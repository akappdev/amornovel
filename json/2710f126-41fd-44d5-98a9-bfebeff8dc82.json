The guy\u2019s hands were tied to the bed frame with a thick, white rope. His arms were stretched above him, and his legs sprawled across the mattress. An open condom wrapper littered the floor to his right, but there was no sign of the condom, or of the person who\u2019d bound the man.</p><p>Poor dead bastard.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone cleaned up.\u201d The rumbling voice came from his partner, Colin Gyth.</p><p>Todd grunted and let his gaze drift over the bed. Yeah, Colin was right. Someone had done a Class A job of screwing their crime scene. Maybe the forensics unit would be able to find more evidence, but he wasn\u2019t going to hold his breath.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he studied the slight impression that marred the sheets on the left side of the body, an impression that could have been the outline of a woman.</p><p>But whoever the mystery lady was, she sure as hell had gotten out of Dodge.</p><p>\u201cHeart attack?\u201d Colin murmured, crouching near the foot of the bed.</p> <p>A possibility. The guy looked fit enough. He was muscled, appeared to be in his late thirties, but, yeah, he could\u2019ve had a heart attack. The sex could have gotten a little too wild, the bondage game too intense.</p><p>It could have happened that way.</p><p>Could have.</p><p>They\u2019d been called to the dingy hotel less than an hour ago. A maid, a currently hysterical teen girl, had discovered the body. There was no ID in the room, no wallet, no personal belongings\u2014even the poor asshole\u2019s clothes were gone.</p><p>The desk clerk had him registered as Jon Smith. Not damn original, and not particularly helpful in this situation.</p><p>At least the clerk had managed to catch a glimpse of the woman with the guy. A blonde. Long, curly hair. Tall.</p> <p>Great breasts.</p><p>It would have been too much to ask, Todd supposed, for the guy to have actually glimpsed her face.</p><p>Where was the woman? Had she been a hooker? Someone the guy had picked up for the night? A street-smart woman who\u2019d taken advantage of a man\u2019s death by stealing him blind? Or maybe she\u2019d been his mistress, meeting in secret while her husband was none the wiser. When her lover had expired, she could have freaked.</p><p>Yeah, those ideas were definite options.</p><p>Or rather, they would have been great options, if this hadn\u2019t been the third dead, naked male that he and his partner had found tied up like this in just over a month.</p><p>Rubbing his eyes, Todd said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a damn thorough autopsy on this one.\u201d Because coincidences like this, they just didn\u2019t happen. Not ever.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t overlook the possibility anymore that there might be a new killer preying on the streets of Atlanta. Or that the killer might be one of the rarest breeds\u2014a female serial.</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck is she doing this?\u201d He asked softly. Had to be drugs. Something the killer slipped into the men\u2019s drinks. A little concoction that made their hearts beat too fast. Or maybe just stop. \u201cI want Smith doing the autopsy and supervising the tox screen.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced up and found Colin watching him with those eerie blue eyes of his. Tension had been heavy between him and Colin for a while now, and Todd knew part of the problem was coming from his end of the partnership\u2014but, damn it, he couldn\u2019t help the stiffness that swept through him every time he had to confront Colin. Things just hadn\u2019t been the same, not since Todd had made the mistake of suspecting Colin\u2019s girlfriend in a murder case.</p><p>Jesus. Couldn\u2019t a guy ever screw up and just be forgiven? Did Colin want him to bleed? \u201cUh, Colin?\u201d</p><p>Of course, there was the other problem\u2014the one that had made him wake up those first few nights after the close of the Night Butcher case, his body soaked in a cold sweat of fear\u2014</p><p>Todd sucked in a deep breath and caught the heavy stench of death. Okay, now wasn\u2019t the time to piss and moan over the damn nightmares or flashbacks or whatever the hell they\u2019d been. He had a case to handle.</p><p>Colin blinked and seemed to shake himself out of his own dark thoughts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Smith was back from sick leave yet.\u201d</p><p>Sick leave. Todd\u2019s lips twisted. He was sure that wasn\u2019t exactly what she would call the extended enforced absence.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s back.\u201d His gut tightened as he said the words. Smith, the best medical examiner in the state, had been taken hostage on their last big murder case. She\u2019d been held prisoner by a fucking psychopath, and when they\u2019d finally managed to rescue her, the woman had looked like a broken doll.</p><p>But the lady had a core of pure steel, and Todd was sure glad she was back at the Crypt\u2014because they damn well could use her help.</p><p>Her replacement just wasn\u2019t as good with the stiffs.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Colin shook his head, a muscle tightening around his jaw. \u201cThis is the last thing the city needs now.\u201d</p><p>Todd exhaled, knowing he was right, but there was no denying the evidence. A killer was out there, preying on men.</p><p>Giving them pleasure and hot sex, then stealing their lives away.</p><p>Damn. What kind of woman could do that? Sex and death...not a combination many could handle.</p><p>But apparently, it was perfect for someone.</p><p>And it was going to be his job to find her, and to stop her.</p><p>By any means necessary.</p><p>\u201cDetectives!\u201d A uniformed cop stood in the doorway, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for\u2014\u201d His gaze darted to the dead man, and all the bright red color drained from his cheeks in an instant.</p><p>Had to be the kid\u2019s first body.</p><p>At least the scene wasn\u2019t too bloody.</p><p>Todd sighed and stepped forward, deliberately placing his body in front of the corpse. \u201cWhaddya got?\u201d</p><p>The cop swallowed and his Adam\u2019s apple trembled. \u201cF-found ID in a Dumpster out back. M-man\u2019s wallet. Woman\u2019s p-purse.\u201d</p><p>A hot lick of excitement pumped through Todd and had every muscle in his body tightening. It couldn\u2019t be this damn easy.</p><p>There\u2019d been no evidence left behind before\u2014and the cops on duty had sure as hell searched every garbage can and Dumpster in the vicinity.</p><p>The kid\u2019s quivering, white-gloved hand raised a driver\u2019s license. A Georgia license. One glance was all it took to identify the small photo.</p><p>Different haircut. Same face.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he studied the ID. Michael House. A quick calculation put the guy\u2019s age at thirty-five.</p><p>Same age as Todd.</p><p>House\u2019s address was easily recognizable. One of the wealthier streets, one of those lined with the big antebellum homes.</p><p>So why had the guy been slumming on the wrong side of the city?</p><p>His attention shifted to the purse. A small leather bag. Delicate and probably expensive as hell. He reached for it, aware of Colin crowding beside him. His gloved fingers brushed across the soft surface, pushed inside.</p><p>He touched the hard edge of a wallet. Pulled it out. Black. A high-end label branded on the side.</p><p>So the woman had gone slumming as well.</p><p>Carefully, he opened the wallet. Just because the uniform had found the purse near the victim\u2019s belongings didn\u2019t mean the purse belonged to his missing lady. Could have been anyone\u2019s purse, especially in this neighborhood, but\u2014</p><p>A hard burst of air exploded from between his lips.</p><p>But the woman on the ID had long, curly blond hair. Just like the desk clerk had described.</p><p>Coincidence? Damn unlikely.</p><p>The lady was also a world-class looker. The photo was small, grainy, but the woman\u2014he\u2019d never seen anything like her before.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>The word seemed to whisper through his mind.</p><p>Her face was a perfect oval, her cheeks high, her nose a small, straight ridge. Her full lips were parted and seemed strangely red in the picture.</p><p>Oh, hell, yeah, he could all too easily imagine a woman who looked like her being able to seduce men to their deaths. It was all there\u2014in her wide, bedroom eyes, in the sinful lips.</p><p>She was the kind of woman a man would die to taste\u2014and maybe, just maybe, three men had.</p><p>\u201cToo easy,\u201d Colin said and Todd knew exactly what he meant. Finding her ID\u2014shouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><p>Nothing had been left at the other crime scenes. Not a hair. Not a piece of fabric from the killer on the victims\u2019 clothing. No fingerprints.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>So why the hell had the woman left her ID behind this time?</p><p>His gaze met the green stare of the young cop. \u201cTell me, exactly, where you found this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-in the Dumpster. Right behind the storage room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might as well have left it in the hotel room.\u201d Colin shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Well, Todd didn\u2019t particularly like anything about the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a lead.\u201d A strong one. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going after her.\u201d It was his partner\u2019s job to back him up. They were supposed to trust one another implicitly.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t exactly trusted Colin for months now, not completely\u2014with pretty fucking good reason\u2014and he knew the feeling was mutual.</p><p>Colin stared at him for a moment, eyes shuttered. Finally, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll put out an APB. Let the uniforms see if they can find her and bring her in to the station\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not an option. \u201cI\u2019m going after her.\u201d He couldn\u2019t explain the sudden, driving compulsion within him, but he was going to find the woman.</p><p>He needed to find her.</p><p>Sex and death.</p><p>The woman in the photo sure as hell hadn\u2019t looked like a monster, but an angel\u2019s face could hide the soul of a devil. Every cop learned that lesson.</p><p>Cara Maloan. The name on the ID was different, exotic. The woman, well, she was probably homicidal, but he was going after her.</p><p>His job was to catch killers, and that was exactly what he planned to do. Pretty face or not.</p><p>He checked the card again, running over her vitals. Five foot nine, 140 pounds. Age...twenty-eight. Blond hair. Blue eyes.</p><p>Fucking beautiful.</p><p>And deadly?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here,\u201d Colin said, straightening his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m damn tired of finding naked dead men.\u201d</p><p>So was he.</p><p>Time to play their usual game of good cop, bad cop.</p><p>Todd was very, very good at playing the game.</p><p>The mysterious Cara was about to find out that she couldn\u2019t screw with the Atlanta PD.</p><p>She was giving up sex. No, she had given up sex.</p><p>As of tonight, she\u2019d officially reached the one month, sex-free mark.</p><p>Cara Maloan slumped on her couch, her eyes trained on the flickering images of a naked couple as they flashed across her television screen. The man and the woman were gasping, moaning, their hands ripping clothing away in the midst of their frantic sexual heat.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d So not what she should be watching. With a flick of her fingers, she turned off the TV, then tossed the remote across the room.</p><p>Unlike that hormone-driven couple, there would be no more fast, hard matings for her.</p><p>Giving up sex. That was the path for her..</p><p>Of course, the fact that she was a full-blooded succubus and derived her power from the sexual act\u2014much like a vampire from blood drinking\u2014the way Cara figured it, she\u2019d be in for some serious hard times.</p><p>Her head fell back against the couch cushions. She was so damn screwed.</p><p>Or actually, she wasn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t have any future plans to be\u2014that was her trouble.</p><p>Why\u2013 why did she have to be different from the rest of her kind? Why did every sexual encounter leave her flushed with power, but aching and empty deep inside?</p><p>Why was she such a freak?</p><p>The other succubi she knew, they flaunted their sexual power, reveled in it, while she\u2014</p><p>Feared it.</p><p>Hell. Her long nails dug into the couch cushions, gouging at the soft fabric.</p><p>She was an aberration, she knew it. Not a predator like she should be. Too weak. The demon blood in her body should have made her a perfect hunter.</p><p>But she\u2019d never really enjoyed the hunt, and that was her whole problem.</p><p>She sighed. At least she had a backup plan in place. Since she wasn\u2019t going to be having the hot, wild sex that her kind craved, she still had to get a power fix. Thanks to her job, she\u2019d be able to get that surge. The sensual rush wouldn\u2019t be as strong, but it would be enough for her to keep living.</p><p>Damn it, why do I have to be so different?</p><p>The peal of her doorbell, followed by the hard, fierce pounding at her door, jerked Cara from her pity party.</p><p>She frowned, glancing quickly at the glowing clock on her DVD player\u20141:16 A.M.</p><p>Who the hell would be coming to see her now?</p><p>Cara rose, stomped into the foyer and then to the door. Her left eye peered through the peephole as her fingers curled against the wood frame.</p><p>Her glowing porch light illuminated two men. Big men. Strangers.</p><p>She stepped back, her gaze narrowing.</p><p>The door shook as a powerful fist pounded against it once again.</p><p>As a rule, Cara wasn\u2019t afraid of humans. She was stronger than them, a hell of a lot stronger, and had once taken down a six-foot-three, 280-pound asshole with one touch.</p><p>She might not enjoy the game of hunting as much as her brethren, but she did know how to use her powers to defend herself when necessary.</p><p>Keeping the chain in place at the top of her door, she swung the dead bolt and opened the door two inches.</p><p>A badge was immediately shoved into the opening. \u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she said, \u201cYes.\u201d The badge was right before her eyes, all shiny and official looking.</p><p>\u201cCara Maloan?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>The badge disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m Detective Todd Brooks of the Atlanta Police Department.\u201d A pause. \u201cI want you to open the door and let me inside.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see much of his face from the angle she had. Just a hard jaw. Sharp cheekbone. Brown hair that was cut brutally short. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Let me inside. His words rang in her head and she blurted the question that immediately sprang to mind, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His hand rose, pressed against the door. It was a strong hand, long-fingered, bronzed from the sun. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this outside. Your neighbors might overhear.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. Her yard was big. Private. That was why she\u2019d bought the house.</p> <p>Besides, she wasn\u2019t exactly clear on what \u201cthis\u201d was. Her fingers tightened around the doorknob. \u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner.\u201d A touch of impatience coated the man\u2019s drawl. \u201cNow I\u2019m trying to ask nicely here, Ms. Maloan. Let me inside.\u201d</p><p>What would happen if he stopped asking so nicely? A hot spurt of fire stroked through her gut.</p><p>Uh, oh. She did not need to get turned on by a dark, rumbling voice.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t need cops on her doorstep.</p> <p>Cara released the chain and hurriedly jumped back as the door was shoved open. Then the men stormed inside, and her heart pounded too fast as a shiver of fear skated down her spine.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the guns in their hands that made her wary, though they were a definite concern. Bullet wounds hurt like a bitch\u2014she knew, she\u2019d been shot once. Not exactly a stellar memory.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t the weapons that made her tremble. It was the men.</p><p>The first guy, Detective Brooks, he was tall, a couple of inches over six feet, and leanly muscled. There was power there, in the tight lines of his body, a strength that hung in the air around him, and, damn but the guy was handsome. Sharp, clean lines defined his face. A straight nose, a chiseled jaw and chin. His top lip was a little too thin, but strangely sexy. And his eyes, they were dark brown. They looked...warm.</p><p>A deception, she was sure, but there was something about him...something hot. Dark. A curl of heat unfurled within her, and a rampant thought raced through her mind. I want to taste him. All of that wonderful power swirling just beneath his surface. He\u2019d be delicious.</p><p>The demon inside her trembled with hunger even as the woman fought to hold on to her control.</p> <p>With an effort, Cara managed to shift her attention to the other cop. He stood farther back, his bright blue stare trained on her. The guy looked like some kind of football player\u2014big, muscled, but his face resembled that of a predator. Tight, sharp. High cheekbones, broad forehead, and a jaw that was clenched.</p><p>He was a good-looking guy, in a rough, scary way. One of those guys who looked like he could beat the shit out of a man and never even break a sweat.</p><p>Despite his obvious power, he didn\u2019t spark a hunger within her. Not like the other man did.</p><p>Cara swallowed. \u201cI-I don\u2019t think the guns are really necessary.\u201d What in the hell was going on? Her heart was beating in a double-time rhythm now, nearly shaking her chest. Her breath began to pant out as she eyed the weapons. Okay, for the first three seconds, the guns had just been an annoyance, but the longer the two jerks kept holding the weapons, well, the more nervous she was becoming.</p><p>As fear and adrenaline flooded through her, she began to feel the sting of her power racing through her veins.</p><p>The second cop, the partner yet to be named, suddenly emitted a hard growl. Her gaze flew to his face. His nostrils flared, as if he were catching a scent in the air.</p><p>Oh, damn, damn, damn.</p><p>Her pheromones. When she got scared or excited, she lost control of them. Mortal men usually responded instantly to the scent of her kind\u2014sometimes, they could respond too strongly.</p> <p>The scent of a succubus could be a powerful weapon in seduction...or in death.</p><p>The guy\u2019s nostrils widened again. He\u2019d definitely caught the scent. So he should\u2014</p><p>He took two quick steps back, shaking his head.</p><p>Cara realized she was in serious trouble. Only other supernaturals could hold out against her scent. Actually, in her experience, only shifters could resist the smell. Demons, vamps, and charmers\u2014well, they usually flocked to her like she was some kind of tasty dessert treat.</p><p>Shifters. Hell. They were some of the most dangerous and often homicidal supernaturals. This cop, the one who looked like he routinely ate nails, or perhaps even small children, he was one of those two-faced killers. Not a good thing.</p><p>But what about Detective Brooks? She turned her head slowly, wary of finding another killer in her midst.</p><p>His dark stare was locked on her. His eyes were wide. His nostrils flared slightly and she knew that he, too, had caught the new scent. Her scent. Sex and woman.</p><p>Cautiously, she took a step toward him. If he was like the other guy, he\u2019d move back.</p><p>Detective Brooks took a step toward her, licking his lips.</p><p>Oh, that was a good sign, that was\u2014</p><p>His gun lifted, pointed straight at her. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, her heart stilled. Damn it.</p><p>Human, but, unfortunately for her, a sensitive human. One with enough latent psychic talent to be trouble.</p><p>The night had just gone to hell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too close to her.\u201d The order came from the shifter.</p><p>Her chin lifted as she raised her empty hands \u201cI\u2019m not exactly armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d The shifter rumbled and Cara ground her back teeth together.</p><p>He was pissing her off. They both were, and she still didn\u2019t know why they were in her house. \u201cLook,\u201d she gritted, \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on and I want to know now. \u201d</p><p>The human smiled at her, flashing a set of perfectly white, even teeth, and a dimple in his left cheek. \u201cWe have some questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cThen get rid of the guns.\u201d She was practically waving her empty hands in their faces. It should be obvious to the morons that she wasn\u2019t hiding any weapons.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>He inclined his head slightly and then finally lowered his gun. \u201cMs. Maloan, I\u2019m going to need you to come downtown with us.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cWhy.\u201d A stark demand. She was tired of this crap. They\u2019d all but forced their way into her home, aimed guns at her, terrified her. She wanted to know why.</p><p>\u201cDoes the name Michael House mean anything to you?\u201d He asked, holstering his weapon.</p><p>Ice chilled her blood, but she kept her face expressionless. \u201cShould it?\u201d</p><p>His smile dimmed. \u201cWhere were you tonight between eight and ten?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. She knew where these questions were heading and she also knew the situation wasn\u2019t going to end well for her. \u201cHere.\u201d Her hands fell to her sides.</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d The doubting question came from the shifter.</p><p>Cara gave a stiff nod.</p><p>\u201cDid any neighbors see you? Delivery guy? Anyone?\u201d Brooks asked. Brooks\u2014that was his last name. She couldn\u2019t remember his first name, and for some reason, that fact seemed important.</p><p>She should know the name of the man who was about to haul her off to jail. After wetting her lips in a quick, nervous move, she admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can verify my story. I got home a little after five.\u201d No one had been out when she\u2019d pulled up into her drive. Just her luck. Usually, one of her neighbors would have been out doing some kind of yard work, but the one time she could have used their nosiness to her advantage, well, fate screwed her. Her lips twisted as she admitted, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t order any dinner or anything. I just, ah, stayed here.\u201d</p><p>Brooks\u2019s stare raked her body, lingering for a moment too long on her breasts. She was wearing an old black tank top and a pair of sweatpants. Hardly sexy. Not succubus material. But\u2014</p><p>His pupils flared and she knew he liked what he saw.</p><p>Under other circumstances, she might have been inclined to play.</p><p>But she\u2019d just sworn off sex, and while the detective had managed to stir her interest, he\u2019d also pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t confirm that alibi, I\u2019m afraid we might have a little problem on our hands,\u201d Brooks murmured, and took another step toward her.</p><p>She could smell his cologne, a rich, masculine scent. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t cologne. Maybe it was just the man. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Though she had a very, very strong suspicion.</p><p>Not Michael...</p><p>\u201cWe found your purse. Your wallet. ID.\u201d The words came from the shifter cop.</p><p>Shifters. She\u2019d always been wary of them. Most supernaturals were. They were born to lie. To deceive. And some of them were just plain crazy.</p><p>She\u2019d never met a cop shifter before. The shifters she\u2019d encountered had been more of the run-from-cops kind.</p><p>So he\u2019d found her missing purse. Big deal. \u201cWell, good.\u201d Not that she really cared. She\u2019d already replaced the ID and gotten a new bag. She didn\u2019t have credit cards, so she\u2019d lost a bit of cash. \u201cWhere is it and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found it at a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth snapped closed. Michael. \u201cJust...ah...what kind of crime scene?\u201d Her hands were trembling, a weakness she didn\u2019t want the men to discover. She balled her fingers into fists.</p><p>Brooks took two gliding steps toward her, closing the distance between them. Cara tilted her head back, gazing up at him.</p><p>\u201cWe found your bag at a murder scene, lady.\u201d The warm smile was completely gone now. Only the hardened cop remained.</p><p>\u201cWanna explain that to me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t explain it. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014my purse was stolen two weeks ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you reported the theft, right?\u201d The shifter asked, voice doubtful.</p><p>Another negative shake of her head. The purse hadn\u2019t mattered enough to report, and she certainly hadn\u2019t wanted to go out and start attracting attention from cops.</p><p>Though it looked like she\u2019d managed to capture their attention anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d Brooks asked, leaning toward her. He drew a ragged breath, as if inhaling her scent, then muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re so damn beautiful, I bet it\u2019s like fucking child\u2019s play for you to lure those men to you.\u201d</p><p>It always had been easy. She\u2019d been born as a lure. Since his words were a bitter truth, Cara stayed silent. Reeling the men to her, no that had never been a problem.</p><p>None of the men had ever cared enough to stay with her.</p><p>An eternity of pleasure, but a life lived alone. That was her lot in this world. The lot for all the succubi. She was just the only one not loving the deal.</p><p>\u201cDo you get off on it?\u201d Brooks asked, voice silky smooth. \u201cDo you like the power? Like the control in bed?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Sometimes, she wanted to lose control. To be taken.</p><p>His hand lifted, brushed across her cheek in a caress that lanced her flesh with its heat. \u201cAnd at the end,\u201d he said, pressing in even closer, so close that for a moment she thought he was going to kiss her, \u201cwhen the pleasure is pounding through you, how does it feel to kill your lovers?\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cNo, listen, I\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hands, yanked them up, and held her tight. Not hurting her. Trapping her. \u201cHow do you do it? Drugs? An injection?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her hands, trying to break free. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d A lie. Killing a lover was so easy.</p><p>But not her way.</p><p>\u201cRight, princess.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at the mocking tone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea why we\u2019re here. You don\u2019t know Michael House, and you have no idea how your ID came to be at our crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what\u2014\u201d She broke off, struggling to clear her throat. \u201cWhat happened to Michael?\u201d A murder scene, he\u2019d said he found her bag at\u2014</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She wrenched her hands away from him.</p><p>\u201cCome down to the station, and I\u2019ll be glad to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She hurried back a few steps, and stumbled into the shifter. Damn it, how had he moved so fast? When had the jerk circled behind her? \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>One dark brow lifted. \u201cWanna bet on that?\u201d</p><p>Not particularly.</p><p>The shifter\u2019s hands landed heavily on her shoulders. She jumped at the contact. His touch was cold to her skin, where Brooks had felt burning hot.</p><p>Brooks held her gaze. \u201cYou can do this the easy way and come with us willingly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can fight,\u201d the shifter growled in her ear, \u201cand still wind up finding your ass downtown.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t like him. Didn\u2019t like either of them. Her skin began to prickle as rage and power swept through her.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d The whisper was so soft she might have imagined it. The shifter\u2019s voice. Barely breathing in her ear.</p><p>She drew in a ragged gasp of air at the sound, drawing the cold oxygen deep into her lungs. Control. She couldn\u2019t shatter in front of them. They were cops.</p><p>Cops who were suspecting her of\u2014what? Assault? Murder?</p><p>If she put up a fight, and used her power, she\u2019d never be safe in Atlanta again. She\u2019d have to run, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop running for a long, long time.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the type to run. Never had been.</p><p>Her chin lifted as she made her decision. \u201cI\u2019ll do it the easy way.\u201d</p><p>Brooks\u2019s lips began to curl.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>That wiped the smug smile right off his handsome face.</p><p>After she shoved on her shoes, they led her outside, into a starless night.</p><p>What would happen at the station? The thought flew through her mind, followed instantly by another, darker worry, one that had her mouth drying. What\u2019s happened to Michael? She hadn\u2019t seen her ex-lover in months, and now, Cara feared she might not ever see him\u2014alive\u2014again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like a killer. Her blue eyes were too clear. Her skin too soft.</p><p>She smelled of sex and embodied the best wet dream of his life.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t look like a killer.</p><p>Which meant she probably was.</p><p>Brooks watched Cara through the two-way mirror. She sat in the interrogation room, legs crossed, fingers idly tapping on the wooden table. She\u2019d been in there for over thirty minutes now. Alone. Every few moments, a ripple of anger or impatience would appear on her face, then disappear seconds later as her cool mask slipped seamlessly back into place.</p><p>Cara Maloan was even better looking than her picture had suggested. In fact, the woman was truly damn near perfect. Hell, yes, he could all too easily imagine her being able to lure those poor assholes to their deaths.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen a woman more sexual. Even in the loose jogging pants and tank top she wore, there was no disguising her appeal.</p> <p>The minute the door of her house had swung open, he\u2019d realized an important fact. He wanted her.</p><p>Then he\u2019d caught a whiff of her scent. Jesus Christ. He\u2019d never smelled anything so good. Rich, like a woman\u2019s sensual cream, but sweet, like flowers or champagne. A combination that had blasted straight to his cock.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t just wanted her then. He\u2019d hungered for her.</p><p>And the lady was probably a killer.</p><p>Damn if he didn\u2019t just have the shit-poorest luck in the world. Or at least, that was what his father would have told him, rest the old bastard\u2019s soul.</p><p>Todd exhaled and wondered for a minute what his dad would have thought of this case. Of Cara.</p> <p>His dad. Tough and twisted sonofabitch that he\u2019d been.</p><p>Todd had never meant to follow in his footsteps, but fate sometimes had a way of screwing up the best plans that a guy could make.</p><p>The door behind him opened with a squeak. He glanced over his shoulder, found his partner watching him with an inscrutable stare.</p><p>\u201cYou got the photos?\u201d Todd asked.</p><p>Colin lifted the manila file.</p><p>Todd turned back to the glass, gazed once more at Cara. \u201cIt\u2019s a real crying shame that a woman like her is a murderer.\u201d Because he was still hard for her. Could still smell her.</p><p>\u201cWe...should be very careful with her.\u201d</p><p>There was a hesitancy in Colin\u2019s voice that made the hair on Todd\u2019s neck rise. Stepping away from the observation window, he turned to fully face his partner. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Colin had held out on him during their last major case. The knowledge still stuck in Todd\u2019s throat, and he wasn\u2019t going to sit around and let the same shit happen again.</p> <p>Colin\u2019s stare darted to the woman. \u201cI know she\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>A hard laugh broke from his lips. \u201cYeah, well, so do those poor bastards she killed.\u201d And he knew it, too, but that fact didn\u2019t stop the wanting. What the hell was wrong with him? He\u2019d never been attracted to a suspect before.</p><p>Then again, he\u2019d never had a suspect like her before.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s off with her,\u201d Colin said.</p><p>Now he snorted. Yeah, Colin was sure one to talk about something being off. \u201cWell, that\u2019s \u2019cause she could be a female serial, and we both know that breed is rare.\u201d He remembered a report he\u2019d read back in the academy. Female serials accounted for only 8 percent of all the serial murders. The other 92 percent of the kills were by men.</p><p>But women were also said to be a hell of a lot more methodical and precise about their killing. A hell of a lot more careful with their crimes.</p><p>Maybe there were more female serials out there than the guys in the suits thought. Could be those women were just too damn good at covering their tracks.</p><p>Todd rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cI think we might need to bring the doc in on this one.\u201d</p><p>Colin stiffened.</p><p>The \u201cdoc\u201d in question was actually Colin\u2019s current lover, Dr. Emily Drake. She was a well-known psychologist in Atlanta, and the department had recently begun using her as a profiler.</p><p>Yeah, it would be a good idea to bring her in and see what she thought of their killer.</p><p>Colin\u2019s gaze was still on the woman. \u201cYes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cmaybe we should.\u201d</p><p>But first...Todd reached for the file. \u201cI wanna see how she reacts to these pictures, and then we need to get started on a photo lineup.\u201d They\u2019d taken Cara\u2019s photo shortly after she arrived. They\u2019d add it to some more images, show the pics to the desk clerk.</p><p>His partner nodded. \u201cAlready got a call in to the team.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you now, man, I don\u2019t think that guy will be able to ID her. Even if the man hadn\u2019t been spending all his time staring at her chest, he reeked of booze.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed the heavy odor, too. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s not much choice for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Colin sounded as disgusted as he felt, and for a moment, it was almost like the old days, before the brutal case that had blasted them apart and sent Todd\u2019s world spinning.</p><p>Todd\u2019s fingers tightened around the folder. \u201cThe uniforms will still bring him in. Who knows? Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>In the meantime, \u201cLet\u2019s find out just what else our lady has to say about Michael House.\u201d Because she knew the victim. He\u2019d caught her slip, just as Colin had. Todd was going to make absolutely certain he learned all the secrets Cara was hiding.</p><p>A pretty face had never swayed him before. It sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to stop him from doing his job now.</p><p>She was furious...and afraid. And the fear made her even angrier.</p><p>They\u2019d left her in the ten-by-eight-foot room for half an hour. The minutes had crawled by as she\u2019d sat and waited.</p><p>Something bad had happened to Michael. She knew it. Wasn\u2019t going to be dumb enough to deny the obvious. She also knew that the cops thought she was involved.</p><p>Not an ideal situation.</p><p>Her fingers tapped against the wooden tabletop. She\u2019d been isolated from the moment she entered the police station. If only she\u2019d been allowed to see some of the other cops, she would have been able to use a bit of her power. She wasn\u2019t gifted with the power of complete mind control\u2014only level-ten demons could totally control the thoughts of humans\u2014but she was still pretty damn good at planting hypnotic suggestions into the minds of susceptible humans, as were most of her kind. The hypnotic power was one of the succubi\u2019s most coveted powers. Right then, she sure had a few suggestions dancing around in her head that she\u2019d like to\u2014</p><p>The door to the interrogation room was shoved open. It slammed back against the wall with a thud.</p><p>Cara sucked in a sharp breath, but instantly schooled her features. They wanted her afraid, so she\u2019d be damned if she let them see her fear.</p><p>Deliberately, she leaned back in the chair. \u201cWhat took you guys so long?\u201d As if she didn\u2019t know they\u2019d been watching her through that ridiculous two-way mirror. Humans. They always thought they were so smart.</p><p>But she knew they\u2019d been watching her. Well, no, not them exactly.</p><p>Just the first cop. The human. Brooks. He\u2019d been watching her almost constantly. At first, she\u2019d felt his stare. Heavy on her skin like a touch. Then she\u2019d turned to the mirrored wall. She\u2019d seen past the illusion\u2014she was used to peering past the veil\u2014and she\u2019d seen him. Standing in the opposite room. Fists clenched. Eyes on her.</p><p>His attention had fueled her anger. Her fear. And added a spark to the desire she shouldn\u2019t have been feeling.</p><p>The man is trying to lock you up. Focus! Oh, damn, but she\u2019d always had a hard time not thinking about sex.</p><p>And the guy oozed sex. Rough, wild sex. The kind that made a woman scream as she came.</p><p>Cara cleared her throat, and realized that neither of the detectives had answered her question. No big surprise.</p><p>The shifter\u2014she\u2019d learned his name was Colin Gyth; he\u2019d finally gotten around to introducing himself during the ride over\u2014walked slowly across the room. He stopped at the edge of the mirrored wall. The perfect position to observe, while not blocking the view from the hidden room.</p><p>Brooks stalked slowly toward her. He pulled out one of the two remaining chairs at the table. The legs of the chair scraped against the floor, the sound almost like a shriek. He sat down, positioning himself directly across from her, and placed a folder on the table between them.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the folder and her palms began to sweat.</p><p>\u201cSorry we were gone so long,\u201d Brooks said, and his brown eyes seemed sincere.</p><p>Liar. She knew the guy wasn\u2019t the least bit sorry. The waiting\u2014that had been a deliberate police tactic. One she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to gather some information to show you.\u201d He smiled at her then, a warm, friendly smile.</p><p>Goose bumps rose on her arms. \u201cIs this what you do?\u201d She asked, the question slipping out without a second\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tapped against the table top. Her nails were bloodred and sharp, and she had to fight the urge to gouge them into the wood. \u201cI asked if this\u201d\u2014she paused, gestured to him, the table, and the silent shifter\u2014\u201cwas what you usually do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this whole idiotic routine where you act like you\u2019re the good one. Like you give a shit what I think or want.\u201d Cara shook her head and her hair brushed across her shoulders. \u201cGot to tell you, I\u2019m really not buying it.\u201d He was good at pretending, she\u2019d give him that, and the bit probably worked great on humans. But for someone with her enhanced senses, it was an insulting waste of time.</p><p>She could smell the sweat on his skin. See the anger that tightened his eyes and mouth. Past the falsely warm gaze, she could see the core of power and the lurking fury.</p><p>Good cop? More like furious, hard-as-nails asshole.</p><p>Cara leaned forward, slapping her hands down on the table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we cut the games?\u201d She asked. \u201cJust get to the part where you tell me why the hell you drug me out of my house in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her. One moment. Two. Then he pushed the file toward her. \u201cI want you to take a look at the photos for me, okay? See if you recognize anyone.\u201d</p><p>Gyth shifted slightly, a ripple of muscle and menace.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look inside the file, but her fingers reached for it, anyway. Flipped it open and found\u2014</p><p>Michael.</p><p>It was a black-and-white shot of him. Shoulders, neck, and head. His eyes were closed. His face devoid of all expression. For a second, one wild second, she thought he might be sleeping.</p><p>But the hope died immediately as the truth hit her hard, making her stomach knot and her lips tremble. \u201cHe\u2019s...dead.\u201d She bit her bottom lip, trying to stop the tremble. She didn\u2019t want Brooks to see her weakness.</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid he was dead, from the moment they\u2019d mentioned his name\u2014</p><p>Michael. He\u2019d been the first to make her want more than just fleeting pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Cara was proud of the fact that her voice didn\u2019t quaver. The words were stilted, a bit cold. But she was cold. Ice cold, all the way to her soul.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Brooks asked softly.</p><p>A shiver worked over her body. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with this!\u201d She\u2019d never hurt Michael.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d Brooks leaned forward. \u201cEarlier you told me that you didn\u2019t even know the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d never denied knowing Michael. \u201cI just asked you if his name should mean something to me.\u201d Not a lie.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me you knew who the guy was?\u201d</p><p>Good question. Not so easy to answer, but she tried, saying, \u201cI was scared, all right? I didn\u2019t know what was happening, didn\u2019t know what you wanted from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to lie to me.\u201d Turning slightly, his gaze met the shifter\u2019s, for just a moment. \u201cThe innocent always lie, don\u2019t they, Gyth?\u201d</p><p>A growl was the shifter\u2019s only answer as Gyth crossed his arms over his powerful chest.</p><p>Her hands slammed into the top of the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him!\u201d Then she shoved her chair back, needing more space. She didn\u2019t want to look at that picture anymore. Didn\u2019t want to think about Michael. If she did, Cara was very afraid that she\u2019d break apart.</p><p>It was obvious the detective was out for blood, but she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d give him any of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou can have a lawyer, you know.\u201d Gyth spoke softly from his watchful position.</p><p>Yeah, she knew she could. They\u2019d told her in the car. Said she could get an attorney if she wanted.</p><p>But Michael had been the only lawyer she knew. \u201cI don\u2019t need a lawyer. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong!\u201d This was an absolute nightmare. Cara squeezed her eyes shut, hoping she was just dreaming. Her kind dreamed, too\u2014just like humans. Powerful, dizzying dreams.</p><p>But never a dream like this one.</p><p>Her dreams were sexy, often wild\u2014but they were not nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYou got him naked,\u201d Brooks said, his voice driving into her mind and causing her eyelids to snap open. \u201cYou tied him to the bed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was home. By myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you do? Drug him? Inject him with something?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in confusion. \u201cWhat are talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d He rose, stalked around the table and loomed over her. \u201cHow did you kill him, without leaving a mark on his body?\u201d</p><p>No! A sudden, terrifying knowledge swept through her, and for an instant, Cara was actually afraid that she might pass out. Her body began to sway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a flash, Brooks grabbed her arms and pulled her up, holding her tightly against him. \u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unable to speak. No, no, she had to be wrong. They had to be wrong.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, she\u2019s ice cold!\u201d His voice exploded like a shot.</p> <p>His hands ran up and down her arms, soothing her, warming her, and she wanted to lean into him. To follow that warm scent and put her head on his shoulder, or against the crook of his neck. The temptation was strong. So strong.</p><p>But he was just playing a game. She had to remember that. He was trying to confuse her. Pretending to be the good cop one instant, and the bad guy the next. He wanted to trip her up, and she\u2019d already made one mistake with the detective.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be making another.</p><p>Gathering her strength, Cara pulled away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers. Emotion burned in that dark stare. Anger. Worry. Lust.</p> <p>Swallowing, she lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m done here.\u201d And she was. She\u2019d played the good citizen. Let them haul her to this crappy station. Sat and waited on their slow asses. Then she\u2019d let them accuse her.</p><p>No more.</p><p>Brooks stepped away from her.</p><p>\u201cI think the two of you\u201d\u2014her disgusted gaze flew from one man to the other\u2014\u201chave more than ruined my night. For the record, let me tell you a few things\u2014and I\u2019d suggest that you both listen very, very well.\u201d Cause she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to repeat herself.</p><p>\u201cI kn-knew\u2014\u201d She stammered just a bit, managed to collect herself, and continued, \u201cMichael House. But I haven\u2019t seen him in several months. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with his death, and like I\u2019ve told you twice already, I was home, alone, earlier tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2019d your bag wind up at the crime scene?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips twisted. \u201cHell if I know.\u201d But that fact worried her. \u201cSomeone took the bag in the park almost two weeks ago. I\u2019ve already got new ID. No, I didn\u2019t report the theft, there wasn\u2019t anything of enough value to worry about in the purse.\u201d She pointed her finger at the infuriating human\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the cop. Run a check with the DMV\u2014or whoever those people are\u2014you\u2019ll see that I got a new driver\u2019s license last Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, you can count on me running the check.\u201d</p><p>His voice had dropped when he called her \u201cbaby.\u201d Gotten husky, intimate.</p><p>Cara balled her hands into fists. Her heart thundered like crazy, and she knew that her pheromones were about to fill the room. She fought to hold the scent in check\u2014she\u2019d learned how to control the fragrance when she\u2019d been a teen. She\u2019d momentarily lost control back at her home, and if she didn\u2019t hurry up and get the hell out of the station, she\u2019d do it again.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not charging me with something,\u201d she snapped, \u201cthen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>She waited. Held Brooks\u2019s stare, and tried to hold back the growing tide of hunger that rose in her body.</p><p>Damn it\u2014why him? Why did she feel this attraction for a man who obviously thought she was a criminal\u2014a murderer? Why did her body tighten and need quicken her blood?</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not planning on going too far,\u201d he said, the words a threat.</p> <p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll go as fucking far as I want.\u201d No, she didn\u2019t have any plans to leave town, but she wasn\u2019t about to tell the too-handsome and too-damn-annoying detective that fact. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Michael, and the way I figure it, if you actually had any kind of real evidence that linked me to the crime, you would have booked me by now.\u201d Instead of making her play the waiting game.</p><p>His jaw clenched and she knew she\u2019d scored a hit with her last words. Giving a hard nod in the direction of the shifter, Cara headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look at all the pictures...\u201d Brooks said softly.</p><p>His words froze her. \u201cI saw all I needed to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d This came from the shifter. He\u2019d sidled around, came to stand right next to the still-closed door.</p><p>She shot him a fuming glare, then glanced back over her shoulder at Brooks. \u201cLook, Detective, I don\u2019t exactly know what gets you off.\u201d But you\u2019d like to know, wouldn\u2019t you? A sly voice whispered in her mind. Deliberately, she ignored the voice and the hunger that seemed to flare in tandem with her anger. \u201cBut I don\u2019t particularly enjoy staring at pictures of dead friends.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cOh? So the other men were your friends, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other men?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared as he stepped toward her, that damn manila file in his hands. She could see the pulse point on his neck beating furiously. Her pheromones were in the air.</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cThe ones we found in the other hotel rooms, tied to the beds, just like Michael House.\u201d Then he lifted a glossy photo sheet, showing her the picture of another man\u2014shoulders, neck, and head, eyes closed, lips parted.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea who that is.\u201d And she didn\u2019t. The man had been good-looking, was still handsome, even in death. Strong bones.</p><p>Sensuous lips. But she\u2019d never seen him before.</p><p>\u201cAnd him?\u201d Another photo. Another guy with good looks and death\u2019s kiss on his lips.</p><p>\u201cNever. Seen. Him.\u201d She jerked her gaze away as fast as she could.</p><p>\u201cAll three men were killed in the same way. All three were stripped. Bound. Then, their hearts...stopped.\u201d</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make any sense. Her kind had never needed to bind prey. The seduction was bind enough. \u201cWhen?\u201d She didn\u2019t have an alibi for Michael. Damn, but just thinking about him hurt. She blinked quickly, trying to fight the tears. \u201cWhen were these men killed?\u201d Please, please let it be a time she could account for\u2014</p><p>\u201cTravis Walters,\u201d he lifted the second photo he\u2019d shown her. She refused to glance at it again. \u201cKilled last Friday night. Just like Michael, it was between eight and ten, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Relief swept through her, nearly making Cara dizzy. \u201cI was singing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair, frustrated, tired. What time was it anyway? \u201cI\u2019m a singer. Last Friday, I was working at Paradise Found. Go ask the bartenders, the waitresses,\u201d she told him, her voice soft but underlined with steel. \u201cI was on stage all night, so I couldn\u2019t have killed that man. \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where were you on the eighth?\u201d This came from Gyth. \u201cIt was a Thursday night and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging.\u201d The reply was automatic. She usually performed at night, Wednesday through Saturday, at the club. She\u2019d started working there only a little over two months ago, but she loved the release of singing. The pleasure of the stage. It was almost as good as sex. Almost. \u201cGo to the bar, it\u2019s on Tyners Ave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know the place,\u201d Gyth cut in, sounding less than thrilled.</p><p>Well, good. Then they could confirm her alibi and this whole terrible mess would be over. \u201cI hope you find the person who did this,\u201d she told Brooks, and meant the words with every ounce of her being. \u201cBut you need to stop looking at me, because I didn\u2019t kill those men. \u201d There was really nothing left to say. The closed door waited before her. She reached out and yanked the knob to the left.</p><p>A few uniformed cops milled around in the small hallway. They stepped forward when they saw her. She knew the move wasn\u2019t because she was a threat to them. No, all the uniforms were males, and her scent drew them to her like a homing device.</p><p>\u201cExit,\u201d she snapped, and they all pointed to the right. She brushed by them, wanting to get away and get her scent under control as quickly as possible.</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t look back as she fled. She didn\u2019t want to see Detective Brooks again. The way she figured it, he\u2019d already done enough damage to her for one night.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t look back, though a part of her wanted to.</p><p>Beneath the rage he\u2019d stirred, the greedy lust still burned. Sometimes it was like that for a succubus. Sometimes, she would stumble onto the perfect prey. A man who could make her want with just a look and who promised a pleasure so powerful it was a temptation to the very soul.</p><p>But she could control her needs. She\u2019d vowed hours before to give up sex, and though the lust had caught her off guard, she\u2019d regain her balance. As soon as she was away from the arrogant cop, the heat would lessen.</p><p>So she didn\u2019t look back. Not once, not even when she heard him softly call her name.</p><p>He wanted to stop her. To run after her and catch her and stop her from leaving him.</p><p>He wanted to berate the others, who watched her with hungry eyes and lustful faces, even as he knew his eyes matched theirs and his face mirrored the same need.</p><p>Damn it, what was the woman doing to him? His guts were tied in knots, his hands actually shaking, and with every breath he took, he tasted her.</p><p>Shit. He was in trouble.</p><p>He called her name, an instinctual response. She didn\u2019t stop. Never glanced back. Just kept moving that shapely ass of hers and walking as fast as she could.</p><p>As she fled.</p><p>Well, hell, he didn\u2019t really blame the woman. If the lady was innocent, and he had to admit that he was starting to think she was, then he\u2019d just come across as a major asshole.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d This time, his disgust was voiced aloud. He slanted a glance at Colin. \u201cThink the alibi will hold up?\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have said it unless she could prove it. The facts are too easy to check, and she has to know that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was what his instincts were telling him, too. So why had her bag been dumped at the site? What was going on?</p><p>A setup?</p><p>Or was the lady dead guilty and just jerking him around?</p><p>Either way, he had to know.</p><p>Glancing down, he realized it was edging close to 4 A.M. And Cara didn\u2019t have a way home.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t really planned to let her out of his sight. Not yet, anyway. Not until his questions were answered\u2014 fully.</p><p>He stepped forward, intent on catching her.</p><p>And was brought up short by Colin\u2019s steely grip on his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>He fought the fierce need to shove the guy off him. He didn\u2019t have time for this crap. Cara was getting away. \u201cWhy not? She\u2019s a suspect, I\u2019m not just going to let her walk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re hot for the woman. You have been from the moment you saw her.\u201d</p><p>His temper began to spike. \u201cGet your hand off me, partner. \u201d His gaze held Colin\u2019s glittering stare. One moment, two.</p><p>Colin dropped his hold.</p><p>Todd\u2019s jaw clenched and he gritted, \u201cI can want a woman and still do my damn job.\u201d He\u2019d always managed to get the job done, no matter what the hell was happening in his personal life.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t think with your dick around her.\u201d Colin\u2019s face was rock hard. \u201cThat woman\u2019s dangerous. Hell, she could be fucking deadly.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew that. He also knew that her lips had quivered when she first saw Michael House\u2019s photo, that her hands had trembled\u2014and that she\u2019d tried to hide both responses.</p><p>When she\u2019d attempted to leave and he\u2019d stopped her with more photos, there had been tears in her bright eyes. Tears that she refused to shed.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t act like a killer. There had been genuine shock and sorrow on her face when she\u2019d learned of House\u2019s death.</p><p>There were some reactions that couldn\u2019t be faked, no matter how good the actress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Paradise Found and check her alibi,\u201d Todd said, determination filling him. After he got a few hours of sleep, he\u2019d head out and make absolutely certain her alibis held. But, right now, there wasn\u2019t much time to spare. The uniforms had almost been salivating over Cara. If he didn\u2019t hurry, she\u2019d probably crook her finger and have one of them volunteering to give her a ride home.</p><p>And that outcome just wasn\u2019t part of his plans for the few remaining hours before dawn.</p><p>\u201cUh, maybe you should let me check at Paradise,\u201d Colin told him, and the hard edge had lessened in his voice. \u201cYou and Niol don\u2019t exactly have a good track record.\u201d</p><p>Niol was the annoying bastard who owned Paradise Found. The last time Todd had been near him, the guy had attacked him. Sort of. Todd still wasn\u2019t exactly certain how he\u2019d flown ten feet across the bar when he couldn\u2019t actually remember Niol ever touching him.</p><p>No question, the man was weird as hell.</p><p>And he really was a bastard.</p><p>But Todd didn\u2019t have time to waste talking about Niol then. \u201cI\u2019m going after her,\u201d he muttered, and figured that was really all he needed to say to Colin.</p><p>His job was now very simple. Either he proved Cara\u2019s innocence and got to looking for the real killer...or he proved the beautiful lady\u2019s guilt.</p><p>He hurried from the station, her sweet scent still filling his nostrils and a helpless need tightening his gut.</p><p>Colin Gyth watched his partner disappear, shaking his head. This wasn\u2019t going to end well. Not. At. All.</p><p>He thought about calling in the captain. Giving him a heads-up on the situation.</p><p>But then Colin dismissed the idea almost immediately. He didn\u2019t know enough about Ms. Maloan to go to the captain, not yet.</p><p>And if her alibis checked out, well, then he might never have to tell Captain Danny McNeal that their suspect wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he whispered the words too late, because Brooks was already gone. But his partner had no idea what hell a woman like Cara could wreak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luckily for Brooks, he did\u2014and Colin wasn\u2019t about to turn his back and let his partner go down in flames.</p><p>Todd caught Cara\u2019s arm just as she started to climb down the narrow steps leading to the street.</p><p>She turned on him, her face furious, \u201cDamn it, enough, just let\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words seemed torn from him. Yet he was sorry. He\u2019d been doing his job, but sometimes, well, sometimes he didn\u2019t like the man he became when he was with suspects.</p><p>You have to be willing to fight dirty to take down the devil. His father\u2019s words. He\u2019d always hated the truth in those words.</p><p>\u201cMs. Maloan...\u201d No, he didn\u2019t like that. Too formal, and they weren\u2019t going to be formal. No, they were going to be damn intimate. He knew it. \u201cCara, I was doing my job.\u201d</p><p>The street in front of the precinct was deserted and slick from the light rain that had fallen during the night. The street-lights glared down on the area, sending pools of light shining onto the gleaming black surface of the road.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still doing your job,\u201d she charged, pulling her arm free. Her hair was wild around her face and he wanted to touch it so badly that his fingers shook. \u201cYou\u2019re just playing the good cop now, trying to gain my trust.\u201d</p> <p>She was right. He was still working the case, but there was more to it than that. More that he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p><p>Her glare would probably have frozen a lesser man. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather walk.\u201d</p><p>Todd doubted that. \u201cIt\u2019s at least twenty miles, Cara, and it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be going through the safest neighborhoods.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to believe you\u2019re worried about me. I\u2019m a killer, remember? I seduce men, then murder them. A walk on a seedy street should be nothing for me.\u201d</p><p>Clamping down on his rising anger, Todd tightened his grip on her. \u201cI was following the evidence,\u201d he said, \u201cand if I hadn\u2019t brought you in for questioning, I wouldn\u2019t be a good cop, now would I?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw remained stubbornly set.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I understand that you\u2019re angry\u2014\u201d</p><p>One golden brow lifted. \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018angry\u2019 really covers my feelings here, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Furious. Pissed. Whatever. But the fact remains that you need a ride home\u201d\u2014he dug into his pocket with his left hand, pulled out his keys\u2014\u201cand I\u2019ve got a car ready.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his keys. Her lips thinned. \u201cFine, but you\u2019d better not ask me another damn question about the case during the ride, got it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, he \u201cgot it.\u201d Todd smiled. \u201cCome on, my car\u2019s around back.\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer to him</p><p>He released his hold on her arm, and his hand rose, brushed lightly across her cheek. Damn, but the woman\u2019s skin was soft.</p><p>Cara stilled.</p> <p>\u201cAnd my name\u2019s Todd,\u201d he said quietly because she hadn\u2019t said his first name yet, and he wanted her to say it.</p><p>Wanted to hear the name fall from those kiss-me lips.</p><p>Her lips firmed. \u201cGood for you, Todd.\u201d Then she stepped around him and marched toward the parking lot, giving him one stellar view of her firm ass.</p><p>Todd swallowed, then sent up a fast and furious prayer that he wasn\u2019t about to fall for a killer.</p><p>Because he had very definite plans to get close to Cara. He wanted her in his bed. Had from the beginning. But he wasn\u2019t going to be stupid enough to let down his guard with her.</p><p>He\u2019d get her to trust him, to reveal all her secrets.</p><p>And if he had to do so, he\u2019d use those secrets.</p><p>He just hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to hurt her.</p><p>Or that he wouldn\u2019t find out that her perfect bedroom eyes belonged to a soulless killer.</p><p>The cops were letting her go.</p><p>From the shadows, the killer watched Cara climb into the black Vette. Saw the detective stare down at her a minute too long.</p><p>The bastard was already falling into her web. Just like all the other idiots.</p><p>The plan was working perfectly. The body count was growing and the cops were fucking clueless.</p><p>Humans were so blind. Never seeing the reality around them until it was too late.</p><p>Soon, it would be too late for Detective Brooks. The poor human was on the list now.</p><p>But the cop wouldn\u2019t die right away. No point in a kill this soon\u2014and Todd Brooks deserved to get to play this wonderful game a bit longer.</p><p>Brooks would play, and so would that bitch Cara.</p><p>Then death would come, in its blinding glory.</p><p>The killer could almost taste the sweet release.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get out,\u201d Cara said when Todd braked at her house. Her voice sounded higher and sharper than she\u2019d intended. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine now.\u201d She thought about thanking him for the ride, then discarded the idea.</p><p>Yes, she knew the guy had been doing his job when he questioned her, but she wasn\u2019t going to overlook the fact that he\u2019d been one serious jerk.</p><p>Being in the car with him had unnerved her. They\u2019d originally gone to the police station in a patrol car. She\u2019d sat in the back. Like any good criminal.</p><p>The confines of Todd\u2019s Corvette were far too intimate. The leather seat felt soft and sleek beneath her, and with the windows rolled up, the scent of leather and man filled the car\u2019s interior.</p><p>Cara reached for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into a fist at the command, her fingernails biting into her palm. She glanced at him and found his stare trained on her.</p><p>The car was cloaked with shadows, but she could still see his eyes. The strong lines of his face. Cara licked her lips. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel it, don\u2019t you?\u201d A whisper that seemed like a caress against her skin.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She could lie, too.</p><p>His lips quirked, just a bit. With a flick of his fingers, he unhooked his seat belt and leaned toward her. \u201cThere\u2019s something here.\u201d</p><p>The promise of hot, wild sex. Of power and magic rushing into her body and making her scream with pleasure.</p><p>But she\u2019d given that up because after the burn of fiery release, she hated the ashes of cold reality.</p><p>The reality that a man wouldn\u2019t love a demon, no matter how enticing her physical appearance.</p><p>His hand lifted, reached for her.</p><p>Her fingers flew out and locked around his wrist in a fierce grip.</p><p>Silence. Then he said, \u201cI just wanted to touch you.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere, but... \u201cI thought you just wanted to send me to jail.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny her words. Didn\u2019t fight her hold. Good thing, too, because the way she was feeling, Cara would have shown him just how strong a succubus could be.</p><p>Instead, his eyes dropped to her lips. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he spoke with words little more than a growl. \u201cDo you taste as good as you smell?\u201d</p><p>The damn pheromones. \u201cIt\u2019s not me that you want.\u201d The admission was hard.</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, but I\u2019m going to have to disagree.\u201d He was close, so close that she could feel the light brush of his breath against her face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. A soft, fast press of his lips against hers.</p><p>Cara\u2019s fingers tightened around him as desire began to heat her blood.</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d His lips were just above hers. \u201cI need another taste...\u201d</p><p>And she wanted more.</p><p>When his lips met hers again, her mouth was open. Ready. The kiss wasn\u2019t as soft this time, and she was glad. She could taste the hunger on his lips, his tongue. A hunger that matched her own.</p><p>There was no questing search as his tongue slipped past her lips. Just need. Demand.</p><p>A moan trembled in the back of her throat even as her mouth widened for him. Her tongue met his, licking, stroking. Her nipples began to ache and swell as the fire blazing inside of her grew.</p><p>She knew she shouldn\u2019t be doing this, but Cara couldn\u2019t stop. The cop was the wrong man for her. The situation was wrong.</p><p>But the need felt so right.</p><p>Power began to fill the air as his lust grew. Such sweet, tempting power. She could feel it, surrounding her. She could have that power. All of it.</p><p>She just had to take it.</p><p>Take him.</p><p>No. She\u2019d sworn to fight that part of her life.</p><p>Cara pulled away from him, twisting her head to the side. \u201cI\u2014we have to stop.\u201d</p><p>His breath was ragged. So was hers. Cara realized she still held his hand. Instead of a punishing grip, her fingers caressed his flesh.</p><p>She snatched her hand away from him.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He didn\u2019t retreat and he kept his stare on her. \u201cIt was just a kiss.\u201d</p><p>That was how the sweetest temptation always started. With a soft kiss.</p><p>He was aroused. No denying the obvious. It was in his voice, and if she glanced down, she knew she\u2019d see the outline of his swollen cock.</p><p>But she was aroused, too. The feel of his lips and tongue against hers had stroked the dark hungers within her, and the feel of his power in the air...</p><p>Resisting was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done.</p><p>Her chin lifted. She\u2019d started a new life. Or she was trying to, anyway. Lusting after the detective, well, that hadn\u2019t been part of her finely crafted plans. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she told him, but couldn\u2019t help wishing that she could.</p><p>He smiled at her then, and with the streetlight drifting into the car, she could see the wink of his dimple. \u201cSeems to me like you can, baby. You were doing one hell of a fine job just a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>Her chin rose another notch. \u201cWhat I meant was that I won\u2019t do this.\u201d She reached for the door handle. Second time is the charm. She managed to shove open the passenger side door. Her body twisted, her feet touched the pavement and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou want me as much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>He had her there.</p><p>\u201cCircumstances are shit now, no denying that.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not just gonna walk away from you. Hell, even if you weren\u2019t hip deep in this mess, I couldn\u2019t walk away from you.\u201d His eyes blazed with intensity.</p><p>Cara stood, rising quickly from the car. The chilly air bit into her arms as she left the warmth of the Vette. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk away from me,\u201d she said, her voice clear. \u201cI\u2019ll walk away from you.\u201d Then she took one step, another. Her back was ramrod straight, her head up. She left him like that, not looking back, even though her body ached for him.</p><p>\u201cRunning, Cara?\u201d</p><p>His taunt didn\u2019t stop her. Damn it, but she could still taste him. She pushed open her gate\u2014the one she\u2019d never bothered to keep locked\u2014and she took careful steps up the curving path until she finally reached her front door. It was only when she crossed the threshold of her house that Cara drew in a deep, clear breath.</p><p>And admitted to herself that, hell, yeah, she\u2019d been running.</p><p>Because Todd Brooks scared her. Oh, he didn\u2019t scare the demon inside her. The demon could handle just about anything.</p><p>No, the demon wasn\u2019t particularly worried, but the woman was scared spitless.</p><p>Moments later, she heard the growl of his car pulling away. Her shoulders dropped as relief swept through her.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>For now.</p><p>Detective Brooks had finally called it a night, but she knew he\u2019d be back.</p><p>Sooner or later.</p><p>The faint light of dawn snuck through her blinds just as Cara finally crawled into bed.</p><p>Her gritty eyes closed, shutting out the light. The bed was soft beneath her, the sheets faintly cool.</p><p>Sleep pushed down on her as exhaustion swept through her body. One deep breath, two, and the dreams claimed her.</p><p>The dreams...</p><p>She didn\u2019t know the apartment. Didn\u2019t recognize any of the furniture. Cara walked slowly across the floor, her bare feet soundless as they crept over the hardwood.</p><p>Where was she? She thought of calling out, but fear stilled her tongue.</p><p>Dream or reality? The question bored into her mind as she ventured forward. Succubi always had such strong, vivid dreams.</p><p>Sometimes it was nearly impossible to tell the dream world from the real one.</p><p>A door waited in front of her. Wooden, painted white. Partially open.</p><p>Her hand lifted. Pressed lightly against the wood and sent the door swinging inward with a soft creak.</p><p>A man\u2019s room. The furniture was dark, heavy. Clothes\u2014a shirt, pants, socks\u2014were tossed haphazardly onto the floor. A king-size bed with rumpled covers waited in the middle of the room. An occupied bed.</p><p>Cara took a step toward the bed, then another, her movements almost helpless. She knew who would be in that bed, of course.</p><p>There really wasn\u2019t any doubt in her mind.</p><p>She could smell him.</p><p>She\u2019d thought of him before her eyes closed. Still tasted him on her lips.</p><p>His dark hair was a sharp contrast to the white pillowcase. His eyes were closed, his features softened in sleep.</p><p>Todd Brooks.</p><p>Dream or reality?</p><p>The floor creaked beneath her feet.</p><p>His eyes flew open. Locked on her.</p><p>\u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>Too late, she realized what was happening. But it had been such a long time since she\u2019d taken a walk in dreams.</p><p>He grabbed her arm, pulled her toward him and had her tumbling into the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDamn it, I know you can\u2019t be, but I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d Then his mouth was on hers. Hard. Hot. His tongue thrust deep and a growl rumbled in the back of his throat.</p><p>His arms wrapped around her, holding her tight. His chest was bare, the muscles strong and warm against her. She wore a thin nightgown, just like the one she\u2019d jerked on before stumbling into bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her nipples pebbled, aching, and the stiff points pushed against the soft silk of her gown.</p><p>She straddled him. The bedsheets covered his hips, but she could feel his arousal nudging against her core.</p><p>The man was most definitely aroused.</p> <p>No. No. This shouldn\u2019t be happening. She had to stop, she\u2014</p><p>His fingers eased under the spaghetti straps of her gown. His callused hands felt so good as they eased over the length of her arms, pushing down the gown and baring her breasts.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers. Eased back so that he could get a better view of her. \u201cGod, baby, you\u2019re the best dream I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>The man had no idea.</p><p>She could feel the spark of magic in the air as his lust grew. His hunger swirled around her in waves of pulsing need. Her skin began to tingle with the promise of such pleasure.</p> <p>And such dark power. Hers to take.</p><p>The strength it would give her...</p><p>But she shouldn\u2019t. Cara shook her head, fighting for her own control as arousal had her sex moistening and her back arching in silent demand. No, this was wrong, she\u2014</p><p>His lips closed over her breast. Pulled the mound deep into his mouth. Sucked.</p><p>Cara shuddered as her fingers dug into his arms. His teeth pressed against her, lightly scoring her flesh, and then he was licking her, long, hungry swipes of his tongue that had her moaning and twisting against him as she fought for more, more.</p><p>His hands slid down her body. Eased over her stomach, where the gown had pooled in a soft heap. His knuckles brushed across her belly button. Smoothed over her abdomen.</p> <p>\u201cTodd\u2014\u201d His name broke from her lips. She didn\u2019t usually speak while dreamwalking. It was too dangerous. Power was in her voice. A command that had his head snapping up and his eyes flying to hers.</p><p>His cock was rock hard now and she realized that she was moving her hips against his. Rocking back and forth. Faster with each stroke of her body.</p><p>Red stained his cheeks. His pupils dilated as she watched. And his lips gleamed with a faint sheen of moisture.</p><p>Cara fought for sanity once more. \u201cNo, I-I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a instant, he tumbled her back onto the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, baby. We can do anything.\u201d He kissed her again. A kiss so sweet and soft that she swore she felt her eyes fill.</p><p>If only...</p><p>But some dreams could turn into nightmares far too easily, and if they didn\u2019t stop soon, Todd would learn that lesson. Every moment she stayed with him, she was stealing a little of his life force. Taking a bit of his power as she stole into his mind.</p><p>She\u2019d sworn not to take from a lover again.</p> <p>Damn it, she hated to take!</p><p>It reminded her that she was little more than a parasite, living off the power and pleasure of others.</p><p>Her hands lifted, caught his face in her palms. She wanted to keep kissing him, to let the passion rage.</p><p>Not a choice for her.</p><p>His head lifted. His gaze met hers. \u201cYou feel so real.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in a smile she knew was sad. \u201cClose your eyes for me.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed at once, but then, she\u2019d put force into her voice, a compulsion he couldn\u2019t resist. Humans were always at their weakest in the dream state.</p><p>Her index finger smoothed over his lips. Then she tilted her head, just a few inches, and urged his mouth back to hers. His lips were parted as he readied to kiss her\u2014</p><p>She blew a light stream of air into his mouth. A soft, sweet stream that she knew would taste of magic.</p><p>His eyes opened, bleary, confused.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she whispered the command.</p><p>Then she closed her own eyes, and left the dream.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn.\u201d Cara\u2019s eyes jerked open and she glared up at the ceiling.</p><p>What in the world had just happened?</p><p>A walk in dreams. She hadn\u2019t snuck into a man\u2019s dreams in over five years. She\u2019d vowed never to enter without permission again.</p><p>Then she\u2019d gone and plunged straight into Todd\u2019s head.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Jumping from the bed, she ran toward her mirror. Her reflection stared back at her, eyes wide, hair tangled, skin faintly glowing.</p><p>Glowing. Crap. She\u2019d taken from him. Stolen his power as her spirit had seduced his body.</p><p>Her head began to shake. A hard back-and-forth motion. She\u2019d taken, and he\u2019d awaken weak now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it,\u201d she whispered, confessing to an image that just stared helplessly back at her. Dreamwalking took focus, intent\u2014hell, often a meditative state. Stealing into the dreams of others was a skill that succubi didn\u2019t master until well after sexual maturity. It was one of their greatest weapons, and by far one of the most dangerous.</p><p>Cara swallowed and tasted the ash of guilt on her tongue. She\u2019d been dead tired, certainly not possessing the strength needed to slip into a human\u2019s secret dreams. She never should have been able to cross the miles and find Todd\u2019s mind.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have happened, but it had.</p><p>She\u2019d just have to make absolutely certain it didn\u2019t happen again, because, if it did, she wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d be able to hold on to her control.</p><p>The temptation to take the handsome detective was just too strong.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Todd woke up, instantly and completely conscious.</p><p>Damn it, he was alone.</p><p>His hands fisted over the sheets. He could have sworn that Cara was with him. Holding him. Kissing him.</p><p>A dull ache pounded in his temples as he rose from the bed. Not enough sleep, he figured, glancing at the clock to find out that he\u2019d been in bed a total of four hours.</p><p>Not nearly long enough.</p><p>He ran a hand over his face, and, for a second, he could have sworn that he smelled her.</p><p>Cara.</p><p>The woman was seriously fucking him up. The last time he\u2019d had a dream that hot about a woman\u2014well, hell, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever had a dream that intense.</p><p>He could still feel her satiny skin beneath his fingertips, still feel the curves of her breasts.</p><p>His cock was hard and heavy with need. A need that he knew only one woman could slake.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Todd headed for the bathroom. He needed a cold shower. It would wake him up and chase the woman from his mind.</p><p>He yanked on the water, sending the powerful stream jetting full blast, then he stepped back, caught the flash of his reflection in the mirror\u2014</p><p>He frowned. What the hell?</p><p>His gaze swept past the faint scars on his chest and side. Instead, his stare dropped down to his left arm. His eyes narrowed as he studied the five small half-moon marks on his flesh. Wounds that looked just like they\u2019d been made by a woman\u2019s nails.</p><p>\u201cNo damn way.\u201d He lifted his right arm. Studied the biceps. Saw the same small wounds.</p><p>In his dream, Cara\u2019s fingers had bit into the flesh of his arms as she\u2019d held tight to him. Her nails had pierced his skin and he\u2019d been aware of the faint sting, and of the pleasure of feeling her hips press against his.</p><p>But that had just been a dream. A hot fantasy that followed him while he slept.</p><p>He ran his fingers over the marks. Felt the raised skin.</p><p>\u201cNo damn way,\u201d he repeated, even as a wave of unease rippled through him.</p><p>No other woman had caused the wounds. He\u2019d stopped seeing his last lover, another cop at the precinct, just over a month before.</p><p>His stomach knotted. So how the hell had he gotten a woman\u2019s scratch marks on his arms?</p><p>Cara.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The lady\u2019s alibis checked out.</p><p>Part of Todd was thrilled by that news\u2014a very, very large part\u2014because the confirmation meant that the delectable Cara was now fair game for him.</p><p>Another part was seriously pissed, and worried. If Cara wasn\u2019t the killer, then the murderer had set her up. No other explanation jived for him.</p><p>A killer who liked to play games\u2014 damn bad news.</p><p>It was Wednesday night. It had been two days since he\u2019d last seen Cara, since he\u2019d gotten to touch those perfect lips and feel her soft tongue stroke against his.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed away, knowing he had to keep his distance until he verified her alibis for the murders. Sex with a suspect wasn\u2019t something he particularly wanted complicating his life.</p><p>But the lady had been cleared now.</p><p>According to Colin, five waitresses and two bartenders had placed Cara at Paradise Found right at the time of the first two kills.</p><p>And one very nosy, sharp-eyed, elderly neighbor had backed up her story about being home alone during the time of House\u2019s murder.</p><p>Ms. Murphy, former schoolteacher and extreme art enthusiast\u2014judging by the dozens of canvases in her den\u2014had cheerfully told him that \u201cI saw her come racing home right after five. In that bright red car of hers. Went in, stayed in.\u201d A beetled frown had pulled down her white brows. \u201cI thought a man would come and see her, but,\u201d a rather disappointed sigh followed, \u201cno one came that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was home from a little after five until ten p.m.?\u201d He\u2019d asked.</p><p>She\u2019d jerked her thumb to a canvas covered in dark gray paint. \u201cI was on the porch, trying a new technique. I call it night painting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there till midnight.\u201d Her fingers, stained with paint, had floated in the air between them. \u201cCara never left. I\u2019d swear my life on it.\u201d The lady had stuck with that story even after repeated questioning from both him and Colin.</p><p>The desk clerk had also been shown a photo lineup. The guy had stared at the line of six blondes, and shaken his head. \u201cI-I don\u2019t think I s-see her.\u201d His words had been husky, the beer still strong on his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think or you know she\u2019s not there?\u201d Colin had pressed.</p><p>The bleary eyes had cleared for a moment. \u201cShe ain\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>So, now, it appeared that Cara was in the clear.</p><p>Absolutely perfect.</p><p>A car horn sounded nearby\u2014close enough to have Todd jerking in his seat. He was parked outside Paradise Found. He swore softly as he realized he\u2019d been sitting in the car, staring at absolutely nothing, for the last ten minutes.</p><p>But, well, he had a few problems on his hands. He had to convince a woman who thought he was a major asshole that he just might be dateable.</p><p>Might.</p><p>He also had to catch a killer.</p><p>His life was damn busy these days.</p><p>With a harsh exhalation of air, Todd finally left his car. His weapon pressed into his back as he walked, and as he drew closer to the dark doors of the club, he couldn\u2019t help but remember his last trip to the bar.</p><p>He\u2019d had the unfortunate pleasure of meeting Niol for the first time then. Strange bastard. Since Colin had been the one to verify Cara\u2019s alibis at Paradise Found, it had been nearly two months since Todd\u2019s last, very memorable, visit to the club.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly looking forward to seeing Niol again.</p><p>How the hell had he done it? Todd wondered. How had the bastard managed to toss me across the room, without seeming to move so much as a finger? That day, when he and his partner had come to interrogate Niol, things had gotten out of control, fast.</p><p>One minute, Todd had grabbed the guy\u2019s shoulder. The next, he\u2019d found himself across the room, lying on top of a shattered table.</p><p>He\u2019d known there was something odd about Niol from the first moment he met the guy. Every nerve in his body had gone on alert and the hair on his nape had risen.</p><p>That fierce awareness happened to him sometimes. Usually, it happened when the shit was about to hit the fan. When a perp was about to pull a gun or when all hell was seconds away from breaking loose.</p><p>He liked to think of it as his body\u2019s warning system. A strong instinct. Whatever it was, it had never led him wrong before.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t felt that response with Cara\u2014at least, not at first. But when he\u2019d walked into her house and gotten closer to her, all his systems had sent out a flashing alert.</p><p>He\u2019d originally thought his gut was telling him the woman was a killer. Now, well, now he wondered if his body was just trying to tell him that the lady was pure danger to his soul.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want, cop?\u201d The snarl came from one of the bouncers, a guy who\u2019d planted his body squarely in front of Todd\u2019s path.</p><p>Smothering a sigh, Todd glanced up, way up. Shit. He knew the tattooed giant in front of him. The asshole had been guarding the door the last time he\u2019d paid a visit to Paradise Found. \u201cI want in,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>The bouncer laughed at that, a deep rumbling laugh, and he nudged his sidekick, a short, dark, heavily muscled guy whose nostrils were currently flaring as he leaned in close to Todd.</p><p>\u201cNot our kind,\u201d the smaller one mumbled.</p><p>What the hell? Todd pulled a twenty out of his pocket. Shoved it at the giant jerk. \u201cOpen the damn door.\u201d</p><p>A smirk. The cash disappeared in a instant. \u201cYer funeral, cop.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened. The scream of a guitar pierced his ears and the rumble of voices danced into the night.</p><p>He paused on the threshold. \u201cYour boss in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lucky night, man,\u201d from the shorter guy. \u201cNiol\u2019s gone hunting.\u201d</p><p>And just what did that mean?</p><p>Then he forgot about the question as he caught sight of a woman with long, golden hair.</p><p>Cara.</p><p>He stepped into Paradise, and heard the crackle of laughter behind him.</p><p>The bar was packed. Literally teeming with bodies. Men, women. Most of \u2019em looked like they were anywhere from twenty to forty years old. Some were huddling in shadows. Some were all but having sex on the dance floor.</p><p>As he walked toward the bar, his nostrils twitched as he caught a familiar scent. It was...blood. He\u2019d worked enough crime scenes to know that coppery stench. Where was\u2014</p><p>The man to the left of him lifted his head. Blood streamed down his chin. The woman in his arms moaned, turning her head just a fraction. Todd saw the marks on her then. Two deep holes in the side of her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the fuck?</p><p>He reached for his gun. \u201cGet the hell away from her!\u201d</p><p>There was a brief murmur at his yell, and one or two people glanced his way, but for the most part, he was ignored\u2014even by the asshole who had attacked the woman.</p> <p>The woman in question did look at him, though. Her face twisted into a snarl, and her lips lifted to reveal teeth that looked too damn sharp. \u201cFuck off, human!\u201d she snapped, then grabbed the guy and stormed into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He blinked, not sure what had just happened. No, an assault had occurred, he needed to help her and\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Cara\u2019s soft, sensuous voice trailed along his nerve endings and cut right through the roar of the bar.</p><p>His fingers still gripped the gun. He turned slowly toward her, not sure if he was really ready to face her again, even though he\u2019d come to be bar just to see...her.</p><p>Shit. She was even more beautiful than he remembered. Her hair was soft and loose around her shoulders. Her face pale and lovely, like something out of a damn magazine ad. Her lips were a flash of crimson, and he wanted them on his.</p> <p>She wore a short black dress. A tall pair of black boots. Her legs were bare, too tempting and so damn long.</p><p>It was all too easy to imagine grabbing her, lifting her up onto the bar that was less than five feet away, and getting her to wrap those sexy legs around his hips.</p><p>And if they weren\u2019t surrounded by a room full of weirdos who apparently got off on biting one another, well, he might just do that.</p><p>\u201cPut the gun away,\u201d she ordered quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re not in any danger now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cThat guy attacked the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they were just having a little foreplay.\u201d She pointed with her index finger.</p> <p>He glanced across the room. Saw the couple snuggled into a corner, and watched as the woman lifted the man\u2019s wrist to her lips and bit down, hard.</p><p>\u201cJesus. \u201d</p><p>She laughed then. A soft, rippling laugh. \u201cNo, he\u2019s one you definitely won\u2019t find here.\u201d Then her face slowly sobered and a faint line appeared between her brows. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The light seemed to dawn as her eyes narrowed. \u201cChecking me out?\u201d</p><p>Todd put his gun back into his holster and pulled his jacket over the weapon. \u201cAlready did that, baby.\u201d</p><p>He heard the sharp inhalation of her breath. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your alibis held\u2014for all three murders.\u201d A fact that he couldn\u2019t help but be grateful for right then. The lady was in the clear.</p><p>The faint scratches on his arm seemed to burn.</p><p>\u201cOf course, they held,\u201d she said, brows snapping together. \u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He noticed then that her eyes looked a little red. As if she\u2019d been crying. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Her lips pressed together, then she said, \u201cI went to see Michael\u2019s family today. They\u2019re really torn up.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d seen them, too. They were grieving their hearts out, and they wanted answers, answers he couldn\u2019t give them. Not yet.</p><p>They seemed like a good family. The mother, a stylish older woman, had stared blankly at him as tears trickled from her eyes.</p><p>Michael\u2019s father, his own eyes rimmed red, had wrapped his arms tight around the woman\u2019s frail shoulders, his gentle hold belying the rage Todd so easily read on his face.</p><p>A good family. One that had loved their son.</p><p>Todd hadn\u2019t belonged in a family like that since\u2014aw, hell, he\u2019d never been in a family like that. He was pretty much alone in the world now, and really, that was fine.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want the kind of pain he\u2019d seen in the Houses\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Cara shook her head. \u201cBut if you already know I\u2019m clear,\u201d her husky voice wrapped around him and banished the image of the family\u2019s grief, \u201cthen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Looking for her. He shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t a guy go to a bar to unwind after work?\u201d Seemed a simple enough explanation to him.</p><p>\u201cNot to this bar,\u201d she said instantly. \u201cNot if the guy is you.\u201d</p><p>What did she mean by that?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think this is...ah...quite your usual scene,\u201d she continued. \u201cMaybe you should leave.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Was the lady trying to kick him out?</p><p>The band stopped playing then as the music faded into silence.</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m on.\u201d Worry flickered across her face. \u201cAre you going to leave?\u201d</p><p>Not a chance. Especially if Cara was about to perform. \u201cI want to watch you.\u201d The words came out as more of a demand than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not very good. Average, really. You won\u2019t be missing anything if you leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d Yeah, the club wasn\u2019t his usual style, and he could feel most of the patrons glaring daggers at him, but Cara was there, he wanted her, and he wasn\u2019t fucking leaving.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She shoved her index finger into his chest. \u201cJust don\u2019t start anything, okay? Stay at the bar\u2014and...stay out of trouble, you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Then she was gone, pushing through the crowd as she headed for the small stage. He watched her for a moment, admiring the soft sway of her hips as she moved. The lady really had an incredible ass. One that he would love to get his hands on.</p><p>She climbed up onto the stage. A faint light flickered over her head, making her blond hair shine.</p><p>Todd eased back, grabbed a bar stool and prepared to watch. There was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around, \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey.\u201d The bartender\u2014a young guy, probably in his early twenties\u2014pushed his favorite drink across the gleaming bar top.</p><p>Todd\u2019s fingers curled over the glass. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompliments of the house.\u201d</p><p>The warning bells that had rung before in his head were suddenly back\u2014ringing so loud they were nearly deafening. \u201cNiol\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Was the bastard somewhere watching him?</p><p>A slow shake of the bartender\u2019s dark head. \u201cGot standing orders to have drinks available to you and the other cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGyth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A brief smile curled the guy\u2019s lips. It wasn\u2019t a friendly smile. More like a dog showing his fangs to an intruder who\u2019d wandered into his yard. \u201cThough if I had my way, neither of you bastards would be at my bar.\u201d</p><p>Well, he was making friends left and right tonight. Todd lifted the drink in a small salute and wondered vaguely if the guy had poisoned him. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>The bartender\u2019s eyes narrowed to beady green points. \u201cWatch yourself, cop. You\u2019ll find a lot of enemies here.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he already had.</p><p>Todd drained the whiskey in one long gulp and felt the burn of the alcohol slide straight down his throat.</p><p>Then he heard her. The first light whispers of her song spread through the bar.</p><p>The voices and the laughter died almost instantly when she began to sing.</p><p>He spun around, his gaze zeroing in on her. The band played behind her. No more grating guitar cries. Instead, the band members poured out dark, bluesy music on their instruments.</p><p>Her fingers curled around a microphone. Her voice trembled faintly as she sang, and her eyes met his.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have looked away then if the bartender had put a gun to his head.</p><p>Caught.</p><p>Oh, yeah, the lady had most definitely snared him.</p><p>Her voice grew stronger then. She didn\u2019t belt out the lyrics or croon or any damn thing like that. She just...sang, with a deep, husky voice that made his body tighten.</p><p>The song was a bit wild, the lyrics lusty and free as she sang about loving a man not meant to be. Her body moved slowly, the sway of her hips gentle and easy. Her left hand lifted, brushing against the air, and he could swear he felt that touch on his skin.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the best singer he\u2019d ever heard. It took him two and a half minutes to realize that. Her voice wasn\u2019t perfect on the notes. But she had something. A fire. A power that wrapped around the words and made even the freaks back in the corner stop to listen.</p><p>When the song ended, a taunting smile curved her lips. The room seemed to tremble as everyone watched her, and for a second, the light above her flickered and Cara actually seemed to glow.</p><p>He blinked, trying to clear his eyes, and in that moment, the illusion faded.</p><p>Cara stepped into the shadows, went to whisper to one of the band members.</p><p>Again. The order whispered through his mind. He wanted to hear her voice again. Needed to hear her. When she finally stepped back to the center of the stage, his shoulders slumped in relief. Then she began to sing again, spinning her web and rousing the hunger within him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go to her when she finished her set. Todd just waited at the bar, watching her every move.</p><p>His stare had been locked on her since she\u2019d taken the stage, and when she\u2019d sang, Cara realized that she\u2019d been singing for him.</p><p>Power floated all around her in the room. It filled her, teased her flesh. She sang to take that power. To build the tension in the bar and to feed off the waves of energy given by the supernaturals.</p><p>Since she hadn\u2019t been indulging in the pleasures of the flesh lately, singing was her only release. Niol knew that. He\u2019d offered her the chance to sing at Paradise Found so that she could keep up her strength. Feeding from the crowd had actually been his idea.</p><p>An experiment at first. One that had worked surprisingly well\u2014well enough for her to decide to abstain from sex.</p><p>\u201cTake a little from them all,\u201d he\u2019d told her, his eyes as black as night. \u201cThey\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>And even if they did know, what would they do? She didn\u2019t take enough power to hurt any of the patrons. She used her voice, injecting just the right amount of sex appeal and desire into her lyrics, and she let the crowd respond.</p><p>Then she took their excess sexual energy\u2014it came to her as if drawn by a magnet because she was the one controlling the lust. Her lyrics made her a sexual Pied Piper, and she pulled the raw energy of the bar patrons\u2019 lust right to her\u2014and she used it to strengthen her own body. In a place like Paradise Found, where you could often even smell the scent of sex in the air, it was easy for a succubus to feed.</p><p>So far, her arrangement with Niol had been working very well for her.</p><p>Or rather, it had been working well, until the detective had shown up.</p><p>Keeping her focus had been nearly impossible when Todd was so close by. She hadn\u2019t wanted to sing to the crowd. She\u2019d wanted to be alone with him. Wanted to see if the passion between them would burn as brightly as she suspected it would.</p><p>Damn it, the man was a temptation that she couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>She walked to the bar. Stopped just in front of him. Her heart raced and her body trembled with the rush of power she\u2019d gotten from the crowd. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cI think every man in this bar wants you.\u201d A statement given with absolutely no hint of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI was...talking about my singing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I.\u201d He leaned back against the bar. \u201cWhy here, Cara? You could probably be singing in any club in Atlanta that you wanted. Hell, you don\u2019t need to be on Niol\u2019s stage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I belong.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t give him any more of an explanation.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cBut I don\u2019t belong here, right?\u201d</p><p>A little sadly, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting damn tired of feeling like there is some kind of secret shit going on in this town that I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Understandable. For a second, she was tempted to tell him the truth.</p><p>But she really doubted the guy would believe her. Oh, yes, it would go something like, \u201cI\u2019m Cara, an immortal succubus. Just so you know, this whole bar is full of demons and vampires and witches. Oh, and your partner, Gyth? He\u2019s a shifter. Yeah, he can turn into an animal at will.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d definitely buy that.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what is it that you think is going on?\u201d She asked him instead, and motioned with a slight flick of her hand for a drink from the bartender, Cameron.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s eyes faded to black for a moment as she stared at him and his glamour lessened. True demons had completely black eyes. Iris, cornea, even the sclera were all as black as night. But, so as not to scare the tender humans, most demons used a glamour to hide their real eye color.</p><p>Just as she hid hers.</p><p>Cameron pushed a martini glass toward her. Shot a glare toward Todd\u2019s back.</p><p>Cameron had never been a particular fan of humans, but he was generally harmless. She\u2019d known the other demon for years. The guy might look like he\u2019d just cruised past twenty-three, but she knew the truth about him.</p><p>The two of them had so damn much in common. Too much.</p><p>She shook her head, a slight move directed at him, and Cameron stepped back.</p><p>Todd sighed, a rough exhalation of air. \u201cHell if I know what\u2019s happening around here.\u201d He caught her hand, rubbed his fingers over her knuckles. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just paranoid.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>With her left hand, Cara reached for her drink. Took a quick sip to ease the dryness in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou lied.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on the sweet liquid. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved into a half smile and his dimple peeked at her. \u201cYou can sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-um, th-thank you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers smoothed over her hand in a featherlight caress. The band began to play again. The music was sexy, slow. Soon, she knew they\u2019d switch into another driving, hard rhythm. Niol\u2019s orders. He loved to mix things up at his club. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides, Niol subscribed to the theory that music tended to soothe the savage beast, and since so many beasts visited his club, he liked to play music that appealed to them all.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d Todd asked, leaning close to her so that his breath feathered over her cheek.</p><p>Power still pulsed within her. A sensual energy that made her want to slide closer and rub her body against his. If they danced, she\u2019d be able to do just that. She could touch him as much she wanted. She could feel the hard strength of his body along the length of hers.</p> <p>Oh, but that sounded good.</p><p>Too good.</p><p>She took another sip of her drink. Then asked, \u201cI take it I\u2019m not a suspect anymore?\u201d She wanted a straight answer, just for clarity.</p><p>He paused, a barely perceptible hesitation, before he said, \u201cNothing is pointing to you right now.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer she\u2019d been hoping for. She really would have liked more of a \u201cYou\u2019re completely clear, baby, I\u2019ll never suspect you again\u201d response. Her gaze held his as she tried to figure him out. \u201cYou\u2019re not, by any chance, trying to seduce some kind of confession out of me, are you, Detective?\u201d</p> <p>A slow shake of his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just trying to seduce you, period.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>If only things were that simple.</p><p>He took the glass from her hand. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>One dance. Surely she could stay in control for just one dance. Cara turned away from him and led the way onto the already full dance floor.</p> <p>Couples swayed together in time with the beat of the music. They looked like simple men and women, but Cara knew they weren\u2019t. Spells were being cast around them. Whispers of seduction and temptation filled the air. When Todd took her into his arms and pulled her tight against his chest, she wondered if perhaps she\u2019d underestimated his power.</p><p>His pull was strong.</p><p>Though she was tall, Todd still towered over her, but when he held her, he bent his head and drew down close to her face. His body was a solid mass of muscle. As they moved, she felt the hard bulge of his cock rising against her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t pull back. Didn\u2019t fake any kind of false modesty. She pressed against him and enjoyed the sensual touch. She wished then that she\u2019d been born different.</p><p>Human.</p><p>Humans were so lucky. They could love and hate and fear and lust, and not have those emotions destroy them.</p><p>Unless they chose to be destroyed.</p><p>For her, there was no choice. Never had been.</p> <p>His hands smoothed down her body, came to rest at the base of her spine.</p><p>\u201cTodd...\u201d She liked the feel of his name on her tongue, but she had to warn him, before things went too far. \u201cI\u2019m not a safe woman to want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hands were a heavy, warm weight. \u201cBut I\u2019m not exactly a safe man.\u201d His hold tightened, for just an instant, and a lick of pure passionate fire shot through her.</p><p>Her sensually aware skin tingled, her pulse raced, and though Cara knew she was playing a dangerous game, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself.</p><p>He said he wasn\u2019t safe. Was he talking about the fact that he was a cop? Or something more?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a nice guy,\u201d he continued, the words hard, but so soft they carried only to her ears. \u201cI\u2019ve done things\u2014\u201d He shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve done what I had to do in order to bring criminals to justice. I\u2019ve fought. I\u2019ve lied.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s confession didn\u2019t particularly surprise her.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019ve even killed.\u201d His gaze met hers. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle that, you need to tell me now.\u201d</p><p>She could handle it. The problem was that he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle her. A pang of sadness filled her as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou like to fight evil, don\u2019t you? Like to make sure that the good guys win and that the bad guys get just what they deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do my job,\u201d he said simply and his fingers pressed into her hips.</p><p>\u201cIs everything black-and-white to you? Good or evil? Is that the only choice?\u201d His answer was so important to her.</p><p>Because, like him, she\u2019d done desperate things in her life. Fought. Lied. And as for the killing...</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNothing\u2019s simple any damn more and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A soft vibration shook his hip and reverberated through her.</p><p>His cell phone.</p><p>Todd\u2019s jaw clenched and his fingers dug into her hips.</p><p>Her time to play and dream had ended. Cara shook her head and stepped away from him, breaking his hold. \u201cYou\u2019d better check that.\u201d The slow, moody music ended. From the corner of her eye, she saw Brock pick up his guitar. She knew what song would come next even before the screech of the instrument cut through the crowd.</p><p>Todd grabbed his phone, glanced at the glowing message and swore softly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call Colin.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he did. Evil never slept. At least not in this city.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the dance.\u201d Her hand lifted and stroked down his cheek. A soft murmur of pleasure whispered past her lips as she felt the faint sting of stubble along his hard jaw.</p><p>He caught her hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to end with a dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, it does.\u201d His hold was tight, but not unbreakable. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of girl who has flings.\u201d Not anymore. Hell, she didn\u2019t have much of anything anymore.</p><p>But once upon a time...</p><p>\u201cI could change your mind.\u201d</p><p>So confident. Such a silly, human trait. She kept her eyes on his, feeling the rush of psychic power flow through her. Hypnotism had always been one of her gifts. \u201cI could change yours,\u201d she breathed the words as she decided to put an end to the game. No more temptation for her. No more wrong side of the town for him.</p><p>\u201cForget about me, Detective. Go back to your life. Fight your evil, and forget about me.\u201d</p><p>In the past, she whispered her words and made men into puppets, eager to follow her commands. Long ago, she\u2019d been so good at giving her sweet suggestions.</p><p>Until she realized she didn\u2019t want puppets.</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes widened and he shook his head. Once. Twice.</p><p>Sensitive. She\u2019d nearly forgotten about his latent powers, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist her order, no one ever had, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour eyes...\u201d The words seemed torn from him. \u201cThey aren\u2019t blue. I thought they were...but...\u201d</p><p>Shit. He shouldn\u2019t be realizing what was happening. The guy sure as hell shouldn\u2019t have noticed that her eye color flickered with that burst of power.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>Cara yanked her hand away from him.</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>The phone vibrated again with a hard buzz of sound.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d An order from her, one without any hypnotic suggestion because her suggestions weren\u2019t working on him.</p><p>She could dreamwalk into his mind, plant a suggestion when his defenses were down, but she couldn\u2019t control him when he was awake and aware.</p><p>Never. Happened. Before.</p><p>A man she couldn\u2019t control. A human.</p><p>If her hypnotic power didn\u2019t work on him, if he could still choose on his own, then that meant he hadn\u2019t come to her just because of her pheromones and the soft, silent lure that a succubus sent out to prey.</p><p>Part of him, at least, and from the awareness in his eyes, she\u2019d say a very large part, had chosen to want her.</p><p>Very, very scary.</p><p>And very arousing.</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you again.\u201d He sounded absolutely certain.</p><p>When she\u2019d told him to forget.</p><p>Her hands trembled.</p><p>He leaned forward. Kissed her hard, fast, and deep. His tongue claimed hers, seduced.</p><p>She was the one who should have seduced.</p><p>Then he was gone. Pushing through the crowd and leaving her alone.</p><p>As she\u2019d been for so long.</p><p>Todd wasn\u2019t precisely sure what had just happened. One minute, he\u2019d been staring down at Cara, thinking about how soft her lips looked and how badly he wanted to taste her again.</p><p>The next, he\u2019d been looking into her eyes and realizing that the color looked too dark.</p><p>Not blue any longer\u2014black.</p><p>She\u2019d been talking to him, whispering something that had seemed very important at the time.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the exact words, but he\u2019d known something was wrong as he gazed down at her.</p><p>He\u2019d shaken his head, focused all of his energy on her, and reality had snapped back to him.</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he found her still standing on the dance floor. A sad, almost lost expression covered her face. He hesitated.</p><p>Cara caught sight of him then. Her shoulders stiffened and a mask of indifference swept across her features.</p><p>Then she turned and disappeared into the throng of dancers.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He stalked toward the empty booths lining the rear of the bar. Lifted his phone and punched in the number for his partner. Colin answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cTell me this is important,\u201d Todd barked.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another body.\u201d</p><p>What? Jesus, already? He rubbed his eyes, felt a throb in his temples that matched the loud beat of the drums in the background.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDayton Hotel. Off Marcus Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d The killer was moving too fast. He wondered what poor bastard had fallen into the woman\u2019s grasp this time. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d Marcus Street was close by. Hell, he\u2019d probably be there in less than five.</p><p>The back exit was just a few feet away. He hurried forward, shoved open the heavy metal door, and stepped into the back alley.</p><p>The human detective burst out of the back door of the club. The killer froze.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Their shoulders brushed, a quick touch. The killer hid a smile and grabbed for the door.</p><p>The cop hesitated. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d</p><p>Nosy bastard. If he didn\u2019t watch it, his time would run out\u2014and the detective would find himself just as dead as the other fucking idiots. \u201cGettin\u2019 air.\u201d It was dark in the alley, and the cop wouldn\u2019t be able to see much.</p><p>Humans were so wonderfully weak.</p><p>And playing with them was so much damn fun.</p><p>For a moment, the temptation to attack the detective rose, sharp and hot\u2014</p><p>But no, it wasn\u2019t time yet for Brooks to die.</p><p>Not just yet.</p><p>The back door swung open and the killer stepped inside Paradise Found. Waited a beat as the door swung shut. Then smiled.</p><p>Perfect. Just in time to catch the best succubus singer this side of the Mississippi.</p><p>And to dream of killing her.</p><p>Ah, such sweet dreams. Dreams of blood and death and rich, wonderful power.</p><p>Would Cara like those dreams? She\u2019d be seeing them, perhaps dreamwalking into them, soon enough.</p><p>Then she\u2019d be dying, just like all the others.</p><p>Revenge was so wonderfully sweet.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a copycat,\u201d Colin announced the minute Todd walked to his side in front of the Dayton Hotel.</p><p>It was the last thing he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cWhat? How the hell is that even possible?\u201d The guys in the department had been extra-Captain-McNeal-will-chew-your-ass careful. Nothing had been leaked to the press...yet.</p><p>So there should be no damn way to have a copycat killer striking in the night.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Colin spun on his heel and stalked toward the line of hotel rooms on the east side. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>They strode past the uniforms scoping the scene. Colin pulled on his gloves as they slipped into the room.</p><p>Todd\u2019s gaze zeroed in on the body. Male. Muscled. Naked. Looked to be in his mid-thirties. And tied to the bed.</p><p>Same victim. Same MO.</p><p>Well, not exactly. The bedcovers were pulled up high on this guy. Past his pectorals. In the other cases, the bedspreads and sheets had pooled right over the men\u2019s groin areas.</p><p>Todd slanted a quick glance at Colin. Saw his partner\u2019s nostrils widen, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou smell that?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>Todd inhaled heavily, and caught the scent of...blood. He stepped forward, his gaze now sweeping over the victim\u2019s body like a hawk\u2019s.</p><p>A tech lifted the covers then, snapped a picture, and Todd got a good look at the guy\u2019s chest.</p><p>Blood coated his flesh.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Colin stepped closer. \u201cThe uniforms first on the scene didn\u2019t touch anything. They just called in the body, said a naked guy had been found tied to a bed with white hemp rope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one even checked to see that the guy had been butchered.\u201d Fuck. Okay, so the uniforms hadn\u2019t wanted to disturb the crime scene\u2014smart.</p><p>But, damn.</p><p>The lady hadn\u2019t been playing with weapons before.</p><p>So much blood. The poor bastard in the bed had died hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the guy\u2019s been dead less than an hour,\u201d the tech told them.</p><p>Colin grunted. \u201cThe guy at check-in has him signing in at nine.\u201d</p><p>So the time line fit. Okay, but...\u201cWas there anyone with him when he checked in?\u201d Todd asked.</p><p>Colin gave a hard nod. \u201cTalked to the clerk right before you got here.\u201d A dark brow rose. \u201cHe saw a woman with long blond hair.</p><p>A woman who kept her back turned away from him most of the time.\u201d</p><p>What was going on? Serials didn\u2019t change their MOs. Not this fast.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a copy,\u201d he muttered, \u201cno one knows about the scene, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little redhead, what\u2019s her name? Hannah? Holly? You know, the reporter who replaced Darla on News Flash Five?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Todd nodded cautiously. Holly Storm.</p><p>\u201cI saw her nosing around the scene of the second kill. The captain sent out a gag order.\u201d A damn strong one. Colin shrugged. \u201cBut maybe the lady got some info from one of the uniforms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been on the five o\u2019clock news if she had.\u201d He\u2019d seen her at the scene, too, skulking around in typical reporter fashion.</p> <p>But Holly hadn\u2019t broadcast any hard-hitting stories yet\u2014because no one on the force had given her so much as a five-second sound bite\u2014and the public wasn\u2019t even aware that there was a crime wave to copy.</p><p>Something else was going on.</p><p>The scene didn\u2019t feel like a copy.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to know.\u201d Colin pointed to the bed. \u201cSomeone knows and they\u2019re trying damn hard to make the scene look the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, guys?\u201d The tech\u2019s voice, breaking with excitement.</p> <p>Their heads jerked toward him. The guy lifted up a knife, blade still bloody, gingerly holding it by the hilt. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got the weapon.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. Now that was sure as hell not like the other scenes.</p><p>But then, neither was the bloody body.</p><p>Either they were dealing with a whole different killer\u2014one who liked the bondage games just as much as the last woman, only she liked for her prey to bleed\u2014or their case had just gotten a very, very big break.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it to forensics.\u201d They needed to scan that baby for prints, ASAP. The odds that there would be a match in the system were slim, even if the perp hadn\u2019t wiped the hilt clean.</p><p>Still it was a solid lead, something that they could run with on the hunt. The fire of the chase began to heat Todd\u2019s blood.</p> <p>It was dawn before Todd made it back to his place. He stripped, then all but fell into the bed.</p><p>He caught her scent then. A light, lavender fragrance hanging in the air, mixed with the wilder scent of woman.</p><p>Cara.</p><p>Hell, it was like the woman was right there with him.</p><p>As he closed his eyes, he whispered her name, and wondered if he\u2019d dream of her again.</p><p>Or if he\u2019d slip back into the past and dream of sharp teeth and savage claws. A nightmare that he couldn\u2019t escape from as he watched a man transform into a beast in a blinding fury of crunching bones and savage pain.</p><p>He wanted Cara, not that shifting demon from hell. The demon who had his partner\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She opened her eyes and found herself in his bedroom once more.</p> <p>Dream or reality? This time, she knew the answer right away.</p><p>Light filled the room. Chased away the shadows and clearly showed the man on the bed. He was naked. She could see the muscled expanse of his chest. The faint marks near his shoulder, the white line too close to his heart, and the jagged imprint on his side. Old wounds\u2014the price of his job.</p><p>A light covering of dark hair arrowed down to his groin\u2014right down to the heavily aroused flesh of his cock.</p><p>The guy emanated so much sexual tension it was a draw she could all but taste in the room.</p><p>But she still shouldn\u2019t have been in his dream. Cara frowned even as she stepped forward almost helplessly. She hadn\u2019t entered his dream deliberately. Once she\u2019d gotten into bed, she\u2019d closed her eyes and let exhaustion claim her.</p><p>She should have slept in blessed darkness.</p><p>Not been sent to him.</p><p>What was going on? It was like she had no control over herself or her powers when she thought of him.</p><p>\u201cCome closer, Cara,\u201d he whispered, and her eyes lifted in surprise to find his hungry stare on her.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t have happened. Even in the dream state, she should have needed to command his eyes open.</p><p>Cara hesitated, confused. But the time before, he\u2019d been awake and aware\u2014just as he was now. She just hadn\u2019t truly realized the significance of that act\u2014until now.</p><p>The man had too much power for a human, and if she had any sense, she\u2019d be transporting out of the dream state as fast as she could.</p><p>Instead of licking her lips and inching toward the bed.</p><p>His gaze dropped and raked over her. His stare was so hot her flesh seemed to burn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing too many clothes.\u201d</p><p>Just a thin gown, like before. No underwear. She lifted her hands, caught the silk, and pulled it over her head.</p><p>Todd swallowed.</p><p>She tossed the gown onto the floor. \u201cNow I\u2019m not.\u201d The good part of her, the part that had sprung to life just a few years back, screamed at her that this was a mistake. She shouldn\u2019t be in his mind without his permission. Shouldn\u2019t be planning to enjoy a sensual game with him. Shouldn\u2019t be so eager to taste him, his lips, his body, his very soul.</p><p>But the other part of her, the wild, dark demon who lived in her heart, she all but growled with eagerness. So much strength and power.</p><p>Cara wanted him.</p><p>And she would have him.</p><p>If only in her dreams.</p><p>His dreams.</p><p>She eased onto the bed, then crawled up the mattress until she crouched over him. Her index finger lifted and trailed a path down the center of his chest. Her gaze darted over the faint scars and, for a moment, a pang shot through her.</p><p>Humans could be hurt so easily.</p><p>\u201cGod, this feels so real,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI can smell you, all around me.\u201d He reached for her, fisting his hands in her hair and dragging her up for a hard, deep kiss. A kiss that made her forget about the scars and know only raw need. \u201cAnd I can damn well taste you,\u201d he bit the words off against her lips. Then he kissed her again. Harder. The thrust of his tongue claimed her mouth, and she responded greedily, stroking him and widening her lips.</p><p>Her hands caught his shoulders. Broad. Powerful. She pushed up, levering her body so that he lay beneath her while she straddled his hips. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d An order. Magic seemed to shimmer in the air.</p><p>He caught her hips and closed his fingers over her flesh. The heavy weight of his hands forced her moist sex against the rigid length of his cock. \u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, her voice husky. \u201cI need the words.\u201d She craved them. It made the dream more real.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste your breasts. Lick your nipples.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts ached with need. Too sensitive. She arched toward him. \u201cDo it.\u201d A challenge.</p><p>His back rose from the bed. His lips closed hungrily around her left nipple. Sucked hard. Licked.</p><p>Bit. A light, sweet bite.</p><p>Cara shuddered and rubbed her sex over his cock. The slick cream from her core covered his thick length. The wet heat made it so easy for her sex to slide over his erection.</p><p>And it would be so easy to take him inside.</p><p>His mouth was on her other breast now. Wild. Desperate. Licking and sucking and the rough rasp of his tongue felt so good. She pressed her breast closer to him, wanting more.</p><p>Needing everything from him.</p><p>\u201cWh-what else?\u201d The words were gasped. Her sex throbbed with need. Her entire body seemed to vibrate with tension and sensual hunger.</p><p>It had been too long since she\u2019d fed from a man\u2019s release\u2014and known the fierce pleasure of her own. \u201cWhat else...do you want?\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, lips wet with a soft sheen of moisture. The look in his eyes caught her breath. \u201cI want you spread beneath me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted slightly on her knees. His hands still held her hips. The fingers of his right hand were just below the half-moon birthmark on her left side. She rose a few inches higher, breaking the flesh-on-flesh contact of their sexes. Cara gazed down at her body. At the ivory skin. The light hair that shielded her sex. Then her gaze drifted to his body. Golden skin. Rippling muscles. Thick, full cock. She licked her lips. \u201cWhat about above you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped. His eyes narrowed as he stared at her sex and his lips parted. \u201cI want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>She could all too readily imagine the warm swipe of his tongue on her flesh. \u201cThat\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sharp, shrieking cry erupted in the room.</p><p>Cara jumped in surprise.</p><p>Todd swore.</p><p>The damn phone.</p><p>The dream connection began to fade as the phone rang again, and its piercing call pulled Todd closer and closer to reality.</p><p>And farther away from her.</p><p>Saved by the bell, again. Cara\u2019s lips tightened. More like screwed by the damn bell.</p><p>She climbed from the bed. Her body ached with unfulfilled need, even as the demon greedily lapped up the sensual currents still permeating the air.</p><p>Put him back under. He can\u2019t fight you in the dream state. A dark, insidious voice whispered in her mind. Finish. Take your pleasure. Give the man his.</p><p>His hand snaked out, caught her wrist in a steely grip. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant shake of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d</p><p>The phone pealed again, the sound even louder as it broke the veil of fantasy.</p><p>His eyes seemed so aware as he gazed at her. Hunger and need raged in those dark depths. She wasn\u2019t certain just how aware he was of what was happening between them. Did he sense that it was so much more than just an erotic dream?</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful.\u201d It was the woman who spoke, fighting back the demon\u2019s snarling demand and her dark wishes. \u201cI\u2019m not who\u201d\u2014 what\u2014\u201cyou think I am.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around her. \u201cThen tell me who you really are.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled as the phone shrieked again. \u201cLover,\u201d he could have been, \u201cI\u2019m not even human.\u201d</p><p>A final demanding cry from the phone swept away the dream and carried her spirit back to her body.</p><p>I\u2019m not even human.</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes shot open and he reached for the phone, nearly knocking the nightstand onto the floor. \u201cDamn it, what?\u201d A bleary look at his bedside clock showed that he\u2019d managed to sleep for two hours this time. Two whole fucking hours.</p><p>And screw it to hell, but he\u2019d been enjoying that dream. Or at least, he had until Cara had whispered her little secret at the end.</p><p>Just what in the hell had that been about? How fucked up was his subconscious? First the damn wolf nightmares\u2014the fucking claws and teeth\u2014and now this shit.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t a guy just have a good sex dream anymore?</p><p>\u201cAh, Detective?\u201d The rough, slightly arrogant tone had him slapping a hand to his forehead.</p><p>Captain Danny McNeal. Aw, hell.</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time for you, Detective?\u201d Annoyed now\u2014and it really didn\u2019t pay to annoy the captain.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Captain. I was...\u201d fantasizing, having almost unbelievable sex...\u201csleeping.\u201d</p><p>A grunt. \u201cWell, Sleeping Beauty, if you can manage to drag your ass down to the station\u2014\u201d</p><p>His back teeth clenched. Drag his ass. Fucking nice. He\u2019d worked most of the night to protect the people of Atlanta. He deserved to let his ass get some sleep now.</p><p>\u201c\u2014Smith has some info on your case.\u201d</p><p>Now that had him finally snapping to full wakefulness. \u201cBe right there.\u201d But he was talking to the dial tone because McNeal had already hung up on him.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Todd met Colin on the steps of the precinct. His only consolation was that his partner looked like shit. Exactly the way he felt.</p><p>Smith\u2019s timing could have been a hell of a lot better.</p><p>Or, depending on the victim\u2019s perspective, he guessed it could have been worse.</p><p>But he knew the rules. The case came first. Then sleep.</p><p>As long as he could function adequately at his job and not jeopardize any civilians, well, he was good to go.</p><p>He and Colin rode the elevator silently down to the Crypt. The Crypt was Smith\u2019s domain. It housed the medical examiner\u2019s office as well as all the cold slabs, so the place always chilled him to the bone.</p><p>When the elevator doors slid open, he expected to hear the usual soft strains of Smith\u2019s jazz music, but, instead, a heavy, thick silence filled the air.</p><p>Colin hesitated. \u201cMaybe you should talk to her alone.\u201d His face was tense, lips tight. \u201cI don\u2019t...know if she\u2019s ready to see me yet.\u201d</p><p>Now that was damn odd. As far as Todd knew, Colin had rescued Smith from that psycho who\u2019d taken her.</p><p>At his raised brow, Colin said, \u201cBad memories, you know? She just got back, I don\u2019t want to stir anything up for her.\u201d The man looked seriously uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to her since she\u2019s been working in the Crypt again?\u201d Todd had gone down the first day to check in with the good doctor. She\u2019d seemed quiet, her face a bit too tense, but otherwise, she\u2019d appeared just fine.</p><p>Colin gave a curt shake of his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, man, there\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d He sauntered down the small hallway, grabbed the handle of the door, and opened it with a quick pull. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>Colin lifted his chin. Marched forward. \u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t want her to freak out.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, Smith had never really struck him as the \u201cfreak out\u201d type. More the serious, smart, and very-much-together genius type.</p><p>Colin entered the Crypt first, then Todd swept inside behind him, calling out, \u201cSmith! We\u2019re here\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stepped out from behind a row of filing cabinets. Her dark gaze immediately went to his partner, and a tremble seemed to roll over her entire body.</p><p>\u201cSmith! \u201d He lunged forward, certain that the ME was about to faint.</p><p>Colin beat him to her. He grabbed Smith, holding her easily and then pushing her down into a nearby chair. \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep gulp of air. Her skin, light, creamy brown, had completely healed from the attack. The bruises had faded.</p><p>The scratches and cuts had healed. Smith looked like her old self. Gorgeous face. Exotic eyes. Hair dark as night.</p><p>But the fear that he saw lurking in those dark eyes, that was new. Before, Smith hadn\u2019t been afraid of a damn thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d admired that about her.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me,\u201d she told Colin, her voice a growl. \u201cI\u2019m fine. \u201d</p><p>He backed off immediately.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s fingers, delicate, ringless, rose to clutch the arms of the chair. Her body wasn\u2019t shaking anymore, and when Colin eased back across the room, some of the fear faded from her gaze. Well, well. What was this about? Apparently, he wasn\u2019t the only one who got nervous around old Colin these days.</p><p>But then, after seeing the guy transform into a four-legged dog with teeth a shark would envy, Todd figured he had a right to be a bit on the edgy side.</p><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t every day that a guy found out his partner could lick his own ass. Or rip a man\u2019s throat out with his teeth.</p><p>Smith\u2019s body trembled \u201cHow\u2019s your doc doing?\u201d She asked Colin, and there was an edge to the words that Todd couldn\u2019t quite define.</p><p>Colin lifted his brows. \u201cGood. If you went to see her, like you should, you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p> <p>Her full lips curved into what was definitely not a smile. More a snarl. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not quite the type of patient she\u2019s used to.\u201d</p><p>Now what the hell was this? Todd stepped between them, lifting his hands. \u201cUh, yeah, it\u2019s obvious you two have some shit to talk about, and that\u2019s just great.\u201d He turned his attention solely to Smith. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired as hell, and just want to know about the case right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Smith gave a hard nod. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to be her favorite word, but from what he could tell, the lady was definitely not fine. Okay, so he\u2019d been mistaken about her.</p><p>A trip to the psychologist sure might be in order for the ME. Well, actually, she\u2019d already been to one. The department had demanded that she go see a counselor before coming back on duty. He just wasn\u2019t sure the person she\u2019d seen had helped her.</p><p>Maybe Colin\u2019s lady could. Dr. Drake sure seemed to know what she was doing.</p> <p>Smith pushed out of her chair. The wheels squeaked as the chair rolled behind her.</p><p>Todd stepped forward instinctively.</p><p>She lifted a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. I just missed breakfast, okay? My blood sugar is too low.\u201d</p><p>If that was the way she wanted to spin it...</p><p>Smith moved toward her desk. \u201cPrelim is done on Michael House.\u201d She lifted a file, handed it to Todd. \u201cI could\u2019ve just sent this up, but...I needed to talk to you.\u201d She cast a quick look in Colin\u2019s direction and after a brief pause said, \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Colin nod.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the verdict, Smith?\u201d Todd asked. He\u2019d read the file later\u2014every word\u2014but when he worked a murder, he always liked to talk face-to-face with Smith\u2014or Phillips, if that idiot was subbing for her\u2014because he could learn more from the death doctors that way. His gaze darted to the left as he wondered where House\u2019s body was. In the vault behind him? Sewn back together all nice and neat?</p><p>He really didn\u2019t know how Smith did her job. Fighting criminals, finding the bodies, that was hard enough. But working with the dead, every day and night, hell, that was a whole other ball game\u2014a gruesome, give-you-nightmares game.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t got the tox screen back yet. Even with a rush order to the lab, it\u2019s going to take longer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got?\u201d The woman was hedging.</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cNot a hell of a lot.\u201d For an instant, she looked just like her old self. \u201cThe guy was in good shape, a nonsmoker.</p><p>Thirty-five. No diseases or defects\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know this,\u201d Colin broke in, voice tight, arms crossed over his chest. His usual intimidating stance.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you get me,\u201d she snapped right back at him. \u201cThe guy was in good shape. There was no sign of coronary artery disease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2014you\u2019re telling us the guy didn\u2019t die of a heart attack?\u201d Todd asked, his own heart beginning to race faster.</p><p>Smith hesitated. Cast another quick look at Colin. \u201cI\u2019m saying the guy\u2019s heart was in great condition. Hell, the best heart I\u2019ve ever seen in my ten years down here.\u201d She rubbed the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cHow did he die, Smith?\u201d Todd pressed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t determine the cause of death yet. I told you...\u201d Impatient now, her eyes narrowed, \u201cI won\u2019t have the tox screen for several days yet.\u201d</p><p>Colin slowly uncrossed his arms. \u201cSo you brought us here to basically\u2014what? Say the guy was healthy? No offense, Smith, but you could have told us this shit on the phone.\u201d He was obviously angry, and Todd was starting to feel the same way.</p><p>Too little sleep. Too few leads. Too many bodies. And, shit, if he went back up to the captain, told him their latest vic was a prime specimen of health who\u2019d just happened to drop dead in the middle of some sex games, McNeal would kick his ass all the way back down to the Crypt.</p><p>\u201cThere was no sign of trauma. No contusions.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe man\u2019s body was in perfect condition. Inside, and out.\u201d</p><p>Another hesitation. \u201cAt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\u2014 what?\u201d His temples throbbed. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018at first\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Smith reached for her white gloves. \u201cDetectives, there is something you\u2019ve got to see.\u201d She walked across the room, her feet hurriedly tapping on the white tiled floor. She stopped beside a gurney. Her hands reached for the plain white sheet that covered the body. \u201cI took him out of storage a few minutes before you arrived.\u201d</p><p>Todd hurried to her side. Colin flanked him.</p><p>She pulled the sheet down, a faint tremble in her hands. \u201cCheck out his chest.\u201d</p><p>Michael House\u2019s flesh was chalky, the dried-out color of the dead. And on his chest, right over his heart and cutting across Smith\u2019s careful stitch work, a very clear impression had formed.</p><p>The outline of a hand.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way.\u201d Todd leaned down for a closer look. Caught the cloying scent of the body. Fought to control an instinctual gag.</p><p>\u201cThose are what I think are fingers.\u201d Her gloved hand moved to the top of the marks, her index finger tracing the pattern. \u201cThe side of the hand. The palm.\u201d</p><p>He could see it. Perfectly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I began the autopsy, this injury wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Her hand paused over the dead man\u2019s chest. \u201cI sewed him back up, started the arrangements to contact the family, then I checked him again and the mark...just appeared.\u201d Smith\u2019s lips pursed for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt was lighter in the beginning. This is the darkest I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>It was the weirdest damn thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cBruising can be caused postmortem,\u201d Smith spoke softly, thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of a case where a guy\u2019s body was pulled from a river. Later, bruises appeared on the arm that the cop grabbed to haul the guy out of the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that you pushed House\u2019s chest too hard?\u201d Colin raised a brow, waited.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m saying this mark you see right here,\u201d she tapped the spot, \u201cappeared in five minutes. This isn\u2019t just some bruise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Todd was adamant on that.</p><p>The mark wasn\u2019t a bruise. He\u2019d learned long ago that bruises could often show up after death and he\u2019d certainly seen his share of those while haunting the Crypt with Smith. But this\u2014this was different. This was the faint tracing of a hand in black, like someone had put a hand against the victim\u2019s chest and literally drawn a line around the edges. The interior of the mark was empty, and if the mark had been the result of a blow, Todd figured there would have been a middle pressure mark or deeper finger grooves.</p><p>Shit. It was almost like fucking art. The perfect design of a hand. He exhaled. \u201cWere the other bodies like this?\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s hand lifted. Balled into a frustrated fist. \u201cNo idea. That idiot Phillips marked \u2019em as natural causes. Both heart attacks. He had the bodies in and out of the Crypt\u2014too fast.\u201d</p><p>The bodies were already in the ground now. It would take a court order to exhume them and see if the handprint was on their chests.</p><p>His gaze dropped once more to the print. It was like someone had just touched the guy, and killed him. \u201cYou\u2019re sure\u2014absolutely one hundred percent certain\u2014there was no internal trauma to the chest?\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth in a hard smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can do my job, Detective.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew she could, too. Smith was the best and they were damn lucky to have her and her kiss-off attitude on staff.</p><p>He studied the mark, frowning. Fucking odd. He lifted his hand, let his fingers hesitate over the outline.</p><p>Smaller than his by a few inches.</p><p>But then, he\u2019d been a quarterback long ago\u2014back in the day\u2014and he knew he had big hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we dealing with here?\u201d He growled quietly. \u201cHow is this even possible?\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Smith\u2019s stare snap toward Colin.</p><p>Todd stiffened and the hand he\u2019d raised over House\u2019s chest clenched into a fist. Slowly, he lifted his head and turned his attention to his partner. \u201cThere something you need to tell me?\u201d He was damn tired of the games. Maybe they should just put their cards on the table. \u2019Cause going on everyday like this, acting like he didn\u2019t know Colin\u2019s secret\u2014acting like everything was, to use Smith\u2019s word, fine, well, that just wasn\u2019t going to keep playing for him much longer.</p><p>Not with more weird shit happening\u2014like this handprint on a man that for all intents, shouldn\u2019t be dead.</p><p>Colin shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou seen this before, partner?\u201d Todd asked, not ready to let the topic drop yet. No way was he going to let the guy hold out on him during this investigation.</p><p>Colin\u2019s jaw tensed. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this print before.\u201d</p><p>Todd wanted to believe him.</p><p>Partners should trust each other.</p><p>Yeah, and there also shouldn\u2019t be any secrets between partners. For a cop, there was no one on the streets who was closer than a partner. No one else watched your back like a partner. No one protected your ass like a partner.</p><p>And when you found out a partner had been deceiving you, well, nothing hurt as bad.</p><p>Todd\u2019s shoulders stiffened as he dragged his stare away from Colin and glanced back at Smith. \u201cAny other tests you can do on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running more blood work.\u201d She rolled her shoulders. \u201cThis\u2014we need someone with a little more expertise in this area, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted once more to Colin. \u201cI\u2019m out of my element here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Smith, he\u2019s a stiff!\u201d It didn\u2019t get any more in her \u201celement\u201d than that! Todd tried to rein in the anger that wanted to shoot out of him. \u201cThe dead are your life.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that. \u201cNo. They aren\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLook, maybe we should call in a heart specialist, get a second opinion\u2014make certain I didn\u2019t miss anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the missing type, Smith.\u201d Colin\u2019s voice was certain.</p><p>Damn straight she wasn\u2019t. Todd opened his mouth to respond, then caught the faint quiver of Smith\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Shit. This is her first case back\u2014the lady has to be nervous as hell. \u201cTake your time, Smith,\u201d he told her, his voice softening.</p><p>\u201cGo over the body again, see what you can find.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and for a minute, he thought she was going to be the one shooting out anger, but instead, she gave a jerky nod.</p><p>Okay, the lady obviously wasn\u2019t big on getting sympathy.</p><p>Todd glanced at Colin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem, man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...we\u2019re gonna have to see the other bodies.\u201d</p><p>No choice. Exhuming the dead was a bitch\u2014getting the court orders, dealing with the grieving families\u2014but there was no choice.</p><p>\u201cHave you told McNeal about the print yet?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cI was leaving that to you guys.\u201d Smith pulled the sheet back over the body. Her chin lifted and a brief smile curved her lips. Not really a smile so much as a feral baring of her teeth. \u201cThought you\u2019d like to give him the info on that.\u201d</p><p>Great. Well, they\u2019d have to break the news to the captain pretty fast if they wanted to get going with the bodies.</p><p>Colin turned toward the door, paused. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you how important it is to keep these details quiet.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder, his eyes locking on Smith.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Her shoulders straightened and a bit of her old fire flared in her dark eyes. She jerked her thumb toward Todd.</p><p>\u201cBut you do sure as hell need to tell your partner what you\u2019re up against this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith...\u201d A warning.</p><p>Todd tensed. He had that shitty, I\u2019m-in-the-dark feeling again. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cYou already know everything about this case that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t on the last one, did you, Brooks? Gyth shut you out of the loop and went after the killer on his own.\u201d</p><p>Colin growled and the hair on Todd\u2019s nape rose. \u201cListen up, Smith,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cThe way I see it, you really ought to be damn glad I did go after the killer.\u201d He turned toward her, facing her fully with clenched fists. \u201cOtherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be examining dead bodies anymore.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cYou\u2019d be the dead one.\u201d Harsh. Cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smith flinched. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Gyth.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes widened. Okay, yeah, he had his problems with the guy, but fur notwithstanding, Colin was his partner. And Todd took his loyalties seriously. Maybe too seriously. \u201cAh, Smith, the guy did save your life.\u201d</p><p>She never glanced his way. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, Brooks.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe. Maybe not. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you clue me in?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened.</p><p>Fuck. \u201cI thought so. Colin, let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d He tucked the file under his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got issues, Smith. Go see Dr.</p><p>Drake. We need you back to your old self.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ll never be that woman again, Detective. All the therapy in the world won\u2019t bring her back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know? Letting someone else inside your head could be the best thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d He strode to the door.</p><p>Shoved it open, but didn\u2019t exit. Not the sympathy kind, but too damn bad. He liked the woman, respected her, and wasn\u2019t going to watch her spiral. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, Smith.\u201d And he was. She was too intense. Too high strung. And holding rage that was all but seeping from her pores. \u201cGet some help. Go see Dr. Drake.\u201d</p><p>Emily Drake was, after all, the best in town.</p><p>The late-afternoon sunlight trickled through the blinds as Cara lay on the soft leather couch. She stared up at the ceiling and tried to figure out just what she should say.</p><p>Ah, hell, just get it over with. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Emily Drake, known to her clients as the Monster Doctor, and currently the only psychologist in the South to knowingly treat the Other, slowly lifted her head. \u201cTell me about him.\u201d</p> <p>Cara licked her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s a cop.\u201d Damn. Hadn\u2019t she heard somewhere that the Monster Doctor was dating a cop? What if the guys knew each other?</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A delicate pause. \u201cAnd does he know what you are?\u201d The doctor\u2019s pen was poised an inch above her notepad.</p><p>Turning her head slightly, Cara let her gaze fall on the doctor. As usual, Dr. Drake\u2019s black hair was pulled back into a severe bun.</p><p>Her thin, wire-framed glasses were perched on the edge of her nose. And her green gaze was trained on Cara. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>Cara repeated the question softly, then shook her head. \u201cNo, even though I\u2019ve...dreamwalked with him.\u201d</p><p>The pen skittered across the paper as Dr. Drake jotted down a quick note.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Cara said at once, then winced. Even though the doctor\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed, she still felt the need to explain herself. To justify stealing into a man\u2019s thoughts. \u201cI swear, Dr. Drake, I never meant to join him in dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d</p> <p>If she couldn\u2019t be honest here, in the safety of Dr. Drake\u2019s quiet office, she couldn\u2019t be honest anywhere. \u201cI want him.\u201d The want was a gnawing ache inside of her. An ache that grew worse every moment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right to desire a man, Cara. We\u2019ve been over this before.\u201d</p><p>No, this was far different from the men before. \u201cI-I gave up sex.\u201d Said in a rush.</p><p>Dr. Drake\u2019s eyes widened and her pen stilled. \u201cCara, you know you can\u2019t do that. It\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think\u201d\u2014 okay, she hoped\u2014\u201cthat it will. I\u2019ve got an arrangement with a friend. He has this place for the Other. I\u2019ve been singing there for a while. When I\u2019m on stage and have the focus of the crowd, I can the pull their sensual energy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will that be enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it seems to be working so far. I mean, it\u2019s not like there are a lot of succubi around here that I can ask if I\u2019ll be able to survive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Drake\u2019s quiet voice cut straight through her words. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d She put the notepad facedown. Leaned forward. \u201cYour kind exist for sex. It renews you. Powers you. I don\u2019t know if the situation you have will keep working for you, though it\u2019s certainly a novel approach for a succubus,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut is it enough for you? Are you happy stealing wisps of pleasure, or do you want your own release?\u201d</p><p>Her own. Her lips pressed together to keep the words back, but she knew when Dr. Drake lifted one brow that the psychologist understood.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want it with him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. She wanted sex with her cop so badly that she was losing control of the demon inside and slipping into Todd\u2019s mind. \u201cI can\u2019t control him.\u201d Or herself. \u201cI can dreamwalk with him, but I can\u2019t compel him, not when he\u2019s awake. No hypnosis, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl is important to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She eased back in her chair, casually reached for her pad once more.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what happened before? When you weren\u2019t able to stop your sister\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>Ah, damn, but she hadn\u2019t even seen that one coming. Leave it to good old Dr. Drake to knock her right between the eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A jealous lover. A human lover had killed her sister. A man who had managed to learn far too much about her kind, and the weaknesses that demons possessed.</p><p>Nina. It hurt too much to think of her now, even years later. Her twin. The only other being who\u2019d ever truly loved her. Who\u2019d understood her. Inside and out.</p><p>Killed by that bastard.</p><p>She\u2019d made certain he got exactly what he deserved. Sometimes, she could still hear his screams.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. No. She wasn\u2019t going back there, not now.</p><p>All humans weren\u2019t evil. She knew that. Had long ago come to terms with the fact that monsters resided in men, just as good spirits, good souls, could reside in the bodies of monsters.</p><p>Such was the way of her world.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that because you can\u2019t control him that this man might one day betray you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d The guy had suspected her of murder and he\u2019d sure been quick to haul her off to jail.</p><p>\u201cYou came to me in the beginning because you were tired of puppets. Tired of men who turned away from you the moment you stopped using glamour and magic.\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into the cushions of the couch. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now, you have a man you can\u2019t control, one who certainly won\u2019t be a puppet. You want him. Tell me, does he want you?\u201d</p><p>She could still taste his hunger. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have a choice to make, Cara. You can keep living this new life you\u2019ve made for yourself...\u201d</p><p>The life without sex. Stolen pleasures. Empty nights.</p><p>\u201cOr you can take a risk with a man beyond your control.\u201d</p><p>She pictured Todd in her mind. Dark hair. Sculpted jaw. The chest she\u2019d yet to kiss. The cock she wanted to taste.</p><p>Beyond her control.</p><p>She\u2019d be vulnerable with him. And if he learned her secret, he could destroy her.</p><p>But demons didn\u2019t exactly have a reputation for playing it safe. She\u2019d been trying, but it had been hell.</p><p>Though she liked to pretend that the demon and the woman were really two separate parts of her, the truth was, deep down, she was all demon.</p><p>The demon, well, she wasn\u2019t afraid of a risk, and she was very, very hungry for her pleasure.</p><p>A pleasure only to be had with one man.</p><p>A man beyond her control, but easily within her reach.</p><p>If she just dared to reach for him.</p><p>The demon decided she\u2019d dare. Oh, yes. She would.</p><p>\u201cIs the city in the clutches of another killer, one who preys on the sexual fantasies of men? The cops aren\u2019t talking, but rumors of the Bondage Killer are rampant on the streets...\u201d</p><p>The reporter\u2019s words stopped the killer cold. He turned around slowly, his gaze jumping to the television screen. He listened to her, stunned...and enraged.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>Fury nearly choked him when the redheaded bitch said she was broadcasting live from the Dayton Hotel, \u201cthe scene of a brutal murder.\u201d</p><p>But not his kill.</p><p>\u201cA body was discovered here last night. A male body. The man was naked, and he\u2019d been bound to the bed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, no.</p><p>Not his.</p><p>The reporter\u2019s eyes seemed to bore into his as he glared at the screen. She lifted her microphone. \u201cTune in later tonight for more details on this savage crime. Until then, this is Holly Storm for News Flash Five, signing off.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slammed onto the top of the remote and instantly, the TV screen went black.</p><p>Not his.</p><p>He threw the remote against the wall.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t part of the plan. No one should have died at the Dayton Hotel.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>His fingers shook. His ears rang. And his control began to shatter.</p><p>He knew exactly who was trying to take over his game.</p><p>Not gonna happen. No one was gonna to screw with his plans. He\u2019d waited far too long for his vengeance. Planned far too carefully.</p><p>A bitch wasn\u2019t gonna steal his power.</p><p>Time for the game to change. Time for a solo act. Time for more death.</p><p>With the next kill, he would be the one to steal the victim\u2019s life away.</p><p>No matter how much she begged...</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>He was watching her again.</p><p>That night, Cara stood on the stage, feeling the swirls of magic and power around her. Desire beat in time with the music of the band. Driving higher and higher in the crowd, and in her own body.</p><p>Todd was in Paradise. She hadn\u2019t looked at him yet, but she could feel his dark gaze on her body and pleasure filled her.</p><p>He\u2019d come for her.</p><p>Slowly, she began to shift her attention around the room. Singing softly, the blues carried in the air as she voiced the old lyrics.</p><p>There. He was at the bar. Staring up at her. Face hard. One hand wrapped around a shot glass. He was dressed casually, in a pair of jeans and a button-up shirt.</p><p>She wanted him naked.</p><p>She was tired of pretending to be good.</p><p>Tired of fighting the need and hunger.</p><p>No more.</p><p>Giving up sex just really hadn\u2019t worked out so well for her. One temptation, one very strong temptation, and she\u2019d been screwed.</p><p>The song finished on a long, deep note. She drank in the energy, inhaling deeply as she bowed briefly to the crowd.</p><p>Not enough. Tonight she needed so much more.</p><p>And she\u2019d have it.</p><p>She replaced the microphone. Nodded to the band. Moved easily across the stage, her skirt swirling around the top of her thighs as she walked. When she lifted her hand to the stair railing, she saw the faint glow on her skin. She wondered if Todd would notice it. Hoped that he didn\u2019t, because she didn\u2019t want to give explanations this night.</p><p>She just wanted to give pleasure\u2014and take her own.</p><p>She felt other stares on her as she sauntered across the room. One man even reached out and touched her shoulder, but Cara froze him with a look.</p><p>There was only one guy in the bar who interested her, and he was the one she was going to claim.</p><p>Todd\u2019s gaze never left her as she drew closer. He lifted the whiskey. Drained it in one fast gulp right before she reached him. The glass clattered against the bar.</p><p>\u201cHello, Detective.\u201d She thought about asking him how the case was going. She\u2019d heard talk in the bar about a body being found at the Dayton Hotel. She wondered if the murder was connected to the others.</p><p>\u201cCara.\u201d</p><p>It was the way he said her name that got to her. Hunger. Lust. Tenderness.</p><p>She decided not to ask about the case. She didn\u2019t want to hear about another poor soul who had been killed, not then. She wanted the few hours of the remaining night to belong only to the two of them.</p><p>These precious hours just after midnight. Playtime for the Other.</p><p>\u201cYou were good tonight.\u201d</p><p>She motioned for Cameron to bring her usual drink. The sweet, ice-cold brew that she sipped after each performance. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d been singing just for him. Had he noticed?</p><p>Cameron put the drink on the bar. Narrowed his eyes on her. Screw him. She neither wanted nor needed his approval. Hell, she never gave him a hard time when he hooked up with human women.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s lips tightened when he caught her cold stare, but then he backed away. \u201cYour choice.\u201d The words were whisper soft.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cameron.\u201d And, yeah, it was her choice.</p><p>Or rather, Todd was her choice.</p><p>Cara leaned over the good detective, deliberately rubbing her body against his as she reached for her drink. She liked the way he smelled . The fresh scent of soap. A hint of aftershave. Man.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he told her, and his voice was harder than before. His hands lifted, caught her just above her elbows.</p><p>She took one slow sip from her drink. The icy liquid eased down her throat. Cara licked her lips and noticed the slight widening of his nostrils. He was catching her pheromones again. He knew the scent was richer, knew something was happening. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>See the same hard lust she felt.</p><p>\u201cWe are talking,\u201d she told him, wondering what his next move would be. She was putting on a bold front with him now, but the truth was, she was nervous as hell inside. If she had sex with him, if she gave in to her instincts, it wouldn\u2019t just be about fun and games and a rush of sweet, sensual power.</p><p>You have a man you can\u2019t control. Dr. Drake\u2019s words echoed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different tonight.\u201d His hold tightened.</p><p>Yes. \u201cWhy did you come back, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodd.\u201d A pause. \u201cI like it when you say my name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A costly admission. It gave her more power. He should know that. \u201cTodd.\u201d She obliged him softly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I like the band.\u201d His lips hitched into the briefest of smiles and that sexy dimple winked at her. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s the singer.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but the guy was smooth. Humans were often so gifted with their words. Especially the men.</p> <p>She\u2019d known human men who could lie their way into almost anyone\u2019s bed. But\u2014</p><p>But Cara didn\u2019t get the feeling that Todd was lying to her. She took another sip of her drink, conscious of the warm weight of his hands on her arms. She wanted those hands on other parts of her body. She wanted them out of the bar and back at her place.</p><p>She wanted Todd any way she could get him.</p><p>Cara lifted a brow. \u201cSo what is it that you want to talk to me about?\u201d She could hear him easily in the bar, even though voices and music surrounded them.</p><p>He brought his face close to hers. Stared into her eyes and said, \u201cMy dreams, Cara. I want to tell you all about my dreams.\u201d</p> <p>The glass nearly slipped from her fingers. \u201cDreams?\u201d He remembered them?</p><p>Men weren\u2019t supposed to remember dreams of a succubus. Pleasure, passion\u2014those were the only impressions meant to stay in a man\u2019s mind. The succubus herself, well, she should be forgotten.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in my head,\u201d he said. \u201cAwake, asleep, I just can\u2019t escape you.\u201d</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t escape him. \u201cDo you want to escape?\u201d</p><p>He brought his lips down onto hers. Kissed her once. A slow, leisurely taste of her lips, then a deep thrust of his tongue into her mouth. The human sure knew how to work his tongue.</p><p>When his mouth lifted, she wanted to moan at the loss.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t understand. Was he rejecting her? Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get away from you.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you usually get what you want?\u201d She bet that he did.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I do.\u201d For a moment, his lips tightened. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t. Guess that\u2019s the way it is for us all, right?\u201d</p><p>The way for humans.</p><p>\u201cWe can play the game, Cara,\u201d he told her, rubbing his hands up and down her arms in a rough caress. \u201cI can be the gentleman.</p><p>Take you out on a dates. Movies. Theater. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He was what she wanted. The lust between them burned too bright for a slow courtship. She needed release. Pleasure.</p> <p>Him.</p><p>Was it because he was a sensitive? Was he somehow magnifying the feelings of desire? It could be possible. Human psychics were rare. She\u2019d only encountered a handful of others. Dr. Drake was by far the strongest she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Todd was strong, too, but his power was different.</p><p>Maybe because he didn\u2019t even realize he had it. If he channeled his magic\u2014</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t exactly certain what would happen.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the hands that still held her. She lifted a brow.</p><p>With a muttered curse, he released her.</p><p>Able to move more easily now, she pushed her glass back across the bar. Gave an almost imperceptible nod to Cameron. Despite his pissy mood, she\u2019d managed to grill him about the detective earlier in the evening. Grudgingly, Cameron had admitted that the cop was known for being on the level. Not one to take a bribe or to \u201cmisplace\u201d evidence. And, apparently, if the gossip around town was anything to go by, Todd had quite a reputation with the ladies. Not that she\u2019d been particularly surprised by that news.</p><p>Cameron had also said the guy was a straight-up asshole, but Cam usually said that about human males.</p><p>Judging by Cam\u2019s continued glare, she figured he was clinging tightly to his asshole theory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never really had much use for gentlemen,\u201d Cara murmured, and the words were true. Of course, she hadn\u2019t really met that many gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. Put her hand on his chest so that she could feel the fast thump of his heart. \u201cI want to get out of here. Go someplace dark and quiet. And I want you with me.\u201d Under her. In her.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d lowered the walls around herself just a bit, the lust was bursting though her body like water that had been contained behind a weak dam.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d She smiled at him, stepped back. \u201cBut the choice is yours, Detective.\u201d He was the one taking the bigger risk. He just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t hurt him. She never hurt her lovers. Well, unless she meant to do so.</p><p>And she\u2019d only meant to kill once.</p><p>A life for a life. Primitive justice, but it had been what her sister deserved.</p><p>She shook her head slightly, trying to push away the past. Now that she\u2019d started thinking of Nina, that terrible night kept slipping into her mind.</p><p>This really wasn\u2019t the time to think about death and darkness. With Todd, she only wanted to think of pleasure and life.</p><p>She held up her hand. Offering, waiting.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something different about you,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but he had no idea just how very different she could be. Perhaps she\u2019d show him.</p><p>He reached for her hand.</p><p>The choice was made.</p><p>The whore had the cop under her spell. From the shadows, he watched as Cara and her detective left the bar...the human had his fucking hands all over her.</p><p>The fool didn\u2019t know who\u2014 what\u2014he was touching. And he sure as hell didn\u2019t know what price he\u2019d pay for his pleasure.</p><p>The others hadn\u2019t known, either. They\u2019d fallen so easily for Cara and her lying eyes. Fallen...then died.</p><p>A smile curved his lips even as his hands clenched into fists.</p><p>Cara should have learned by now\u2014the humans weren\u2019t for her.</p><p>Just how many would he have to kill before she learned her lesson?</p><p>Dr. Emily Drake stepped out of the elevator and into the dimly lit parking garage. It was late, well past midnight, but her vampire client hadn\u2019t been able to make it into the office any sooner. And Marvin had insisted on seeing her. Seemed he\u2019d almost taken blood from a human the previous night. The near miss had so rattled him that Marvin had been physically sick ever since.</p><p>Poor Marvin.</p><p>A classic bloodphobic vamp.</p><p>But the guy was making some incredible headway. At least he wasn\u2019t afraid of the actual blood anymore.</p><p>No, now he could drink the blood just fine, provided he didn\u2019t have to get it straight from a source.</p><p>As she walked, Emily clutched her keys tightly in her right hand. The garage was all but deserted, the fluorescent lights flickering above her. Her car waited up ahead, maybe fifteen feet away, and\u2014</p><p>Someone else was in the garage.</p><p>The certainty came to her on an icy wave of knowledge as Emily\u2019s psychic gift flared to life.</p><p>Hell. Who was\u2014</p><p>She spotted the Jeep then. Parked behind one of the large columns. Nearly hidden from prying eyes. The perfect place to wait for unsuspecting prey.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped in relief when the driver\u2019s side door opened. Of course. She should have known he would be there. When she worked late, he usually showed up, even if he was working on a case.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d He stepped toward her, and for a moment, the glow of the shifter caught her stare. All shifters carried that glow, and as far as she knew, she was the only person on earth able to actually see it. The glow was a soft shine, kind of like a second skin. It was the beast glowing.</p><p>He opened his arms to her, man and beast, and she went to him without a second\u2019s hesitation. He pulled her tight against the hard length of his body. Held her close against his heart. Just the way she liked for him to hold her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to start walking down with one of the security guards,\u201d he growled, lowering his face to the curve of her neck and biting lightly.</p><p>Same old argument. \u201cI can take care of myself, you know.\u201d She was far from helpless. The guy should\u2019ve realized that by now.</p><p>His head lifted. His blue gaze met hers. \u201cJust do it for me, okay? For my sanity, will you promise to only come in the garage this late if you\u2019ve got a guard?\u201d</p><p>Emily gave a grudging nod. She didn\u2019t like having to wait on security, but she would\u2014 for Colin. Hell, she would\u2019ve waited that night, but she\u2019d been in such a hurry to get home and see...him. \u201cIf I get the guards to escort me, does that mean you\u2019ll stop stalking the garage?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Just kissed her. A hard, deep kiss that had her moaning and wishing they were far away from the cold garage and instead in a warm, comfortable bed.</p><p>Her fingers curled over his shoulders, and when he broke the kiss, she was the one who almost howled in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come with me to the station,\u201d he said, voice soft.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWh-what?\u201d Not the sensual night plans she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>His stare was solemn. \u201cI think we may need you on another case, baby.\u201d</p><p>At his words, and at the darkness she saw lurking in his gaze, her sexy excitement began to fade.</p><p>\u201cThe place is deserted now. McNeal asked me to bring you in, see if you could look at the files.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers clenched around the strong muscles of his arms. \u201cJust what do you think we\u2019re dealing with here?\u201d</p><p>His hands smoothed down her back. There was tension in his touch and in his face. In the faint lines around his eyes and the tightness around his mouth. \u201cA being that can kill a man with a touch.\u201d A hard exhalation of air. \u201cKnow anyone like that, doc?\u201d</p><p>Yes, unfortunately, she did. The cold from the garage crept through her bones, settled in her heart.</p><p>Cara.</p><p>Todd followed Cara back to her place. She waited for him on the steps of her house, anticipation building in her and making her heart drum far too fast.</p><p>When he joined her, lust had hardened his face.</p><p>She kissed him. Because she needed to. Her tongue snaked into his mouth, teased his. Pleasured.</p><p>Oh, but the night ahead was going to be so good. Because she was finally going to be bad.</p><p>She broke the kiss, gazed up at him. \u201cNo regrets, Detective?\u201d There was still time to call it off, if that was what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn one.\u201d He grabbed the keys from her hand, managed to unlock the door, then all but dragged her inside.</p><p>She\u2019d always loved a strong man.</p><p>His mouth was back on hers before the door slammed shut behind them. Tasting. Devouring.</p><p>Cara had known it would be like this between them from that very first moment. She\u2019d sensed it from the first look, and she was tired of fighting a hunger that just grew every minute.</p><p>The Monster Doctor had been right when she told her, weeks ago, that some instincts shouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, be suppressed.</p><p>It was time for more pleasure.</p><p>Her fingers found the front of his shirt. Jerked. Buttons popped off and flew and she growled into his kiss.</p><p>His head rose, a hard smile curving his lips. \u201cSo that\u2019s the way you want to play?\u201d</p><p>Then his hands were on her. Not her shirt. On the fabric of her skirt. He shoved the soft cotton up, and then his hand was on her thigh. Fingers stroking.</p><p>Her chin lifted and her breath panted out a bit faster. Higher. Just a few more inches, and he\u2019d touch her just where she wanted him to\u2014</p><p>His fingers trailed over the crotch of her black lace panties. He licked his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>Because she was so turned on that her body was about to explode. The sexual tension between them was so thick she could see it in the air and the powerful rush from that need was driving her wild.</p><p>So much wonderful energy.</p><p>His fingers curled around her underwear. Gripped. Yanked.</p><p>The fabric gave way with a soft rustle. Then his hand was on her sex. Parting her folds. Fingers sliding into the creamy warmth.</p><p>Her skirt was bunched at her waist. Her high heels pressed hard into the floor. Her breasts, aching, swollen, pushed against the cups of her bra.</p><p>And she was about thirty seconds away from her first release with the good detective.</p><p>The very good detective.</p><p>His thumb caressed the hard button of her need and he drove a finger, broad and long, into her core.</p><p>Her lips parted on a moan, but he caught the sound with his mouth, drinking it in and then thrusting his tongue deeply past her lips...</p><p>just as he thrust his finger into her body.</p><p>One finger.</p><p>Another.</p><p>The man had big hands\u2014long fingers, strong.</p><p>So good.</p><p>A slow thrust. Withdrawal. The swipe of his thumb against her clit. A thrust, harder, knuckles deep\u2014</p><p>The release hit her. A fast, hard pop of pleasure that didn\u2019t satisfy. Oh, no, not even close. It just made her hungrier.</p><p>Her sex clenched around his fingers.</p><p>Oh, but this was going to be fun.</p><p>Cara brought her hands between them. Pushed against his chest.</p><p>His lips tore from hers. He gazed down at her, cheeks stained with color, lust on his face. Then he blinked, shook his head. \u201cCara, you look...different. So fucking beautiful, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The sensual energy was literally absorbing into her skin. The faint shine of the magic would be noticeable to him this close.</p><p>But not as noticeable if the lights were off.</p><p>She broke free of him, hating the loss of those clever fingers. Moving fast, she hit the lights and plunged the room into darkness.</p><p>He swore.</p><p>Stepping forward, she grabbed his hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>A rusty laugh slipped past his lips. \u201cRight now, I think I\u2019d follow you to hell.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled at that. Had to choke back her instinctive protest. Finally managed to whisper, \u201cThe bedroom will be far enough for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was giving her too much, too soon, and she was so greedy that if he didn\u2019t hold back more, she just might try to take everything.</p><p>They were at the foot of the stairs. Her porch light shone through the picture window, casting just enough illumination over the steps for them to see and move easily.</p><p>The rooms at the top of the landing were in darkness. Perfect. They hurried up the stairs.</p> <p>His hand was warm against hers. The door to her bedroom stood partially open. With her left hand, she shoved against the wood, and it opened fully with a soft creak.</p><p>She stepped forward, heading for the brass bed she loved.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cTodd?\u201d</p><p>Her vision was sharper than a human\u2019s. Even in the dark, she could make out his form. See the tension he held in check.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I want you so much?\u201d He asked. \u201cI swear, I can\u2019t even breathe right now without tasting you.\u201d He moved a few inches forward, and the moonlight spilling through her bedroom window fell over his face.</p><p>Her pheromones filled the air. No way to control them now.</p><p>But she could smell his scent, too. The warm, rich scent of man. With every breath that she drew, she inhaled him.</p><p>And she could taste him on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou feel it, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d He asked, and there was a demand in his voice.</p><p>It. The need. The lust that was almost overwhelming. Hell, yes, she felt it, too.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m safe, Cara. I need you to know that. I use protection, always use it.\u201d</p><p>Good to know. She was immune to human diseases, but he wouldn\u2019t understand that if she told him. And it was honorable that he wanted to tell her of his health.</p><p>A gentleman.</p><p>It made her want him even more.</p><p>She tugged against his hold.</p><p>\u201cCara?\u201d He released her.</p><p>Her fingers immediately went to the waist of his jeans. Found the buckle of his belt. She unhooked it, then she began to work on the snap of the jeans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d An order.</p> <p>She tilted her head back. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be pretty hard for this to work with your pants still on there, stud.\u201d</p><p>A surprised bark of laughter rumbled from his throat and Cara\u2019s own lips curved.</p><p>Damn. How long has it been since I even felt like smiling with a man?</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, don\u2019t worry. The jeans will definitely be coming off.\u201d His fingertips trailed over her arms. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather get you naked first.\u201d</p><p>She liked her plan better, but...Cara\u2019s fingers rose, began to lift up the hem of her shirt. She tossed it onto the floor. Unfastened the front clasp of her black bra.</p><p>Humans and their inventions. Sometimes they could be damn clever and sexy.</p><p>Her breasts sprang free. The nipples were tight with arousal. She wanted his hands on them. His mouth. But first\u2014</p><p>With a swift move of her fingers, she shoved her skirt down her legs. It pooled around her ankles and she stepped out of the trapping fabric. She kicked her shoes across the room. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>She took that as a yes.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d Then her hands were on him. Unsnapping those jeans. Sliding down the zipper. Discovering a pair of boxers beneath the rough fabric of the jeans.</p><p>Then finding his cock. Aroused. Long. Wider than her wrist. Warm to the touch and pulsating with desire. She stroked him, a long caress from root to tip, and heard with pleasure the sound of his ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease, Cara.\u201d An order given with glittering eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She stepped back. Moved to the edge of her bed and felt the mattress against the back of her thighs. Her hands were literally itching to touch him. To give pleasure. To take pleasure.</p><p>And power.</p><p>Just a touch. So simple. So gentle.</p><p>A touch could bring paradise or pain. Such was the way of her kind.</p><p>Lucky for Todd, she wasn\u2019t too much into the pain. Never had been.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Detective,\u201d she used the title deliberately, \u201cjust what do you like? A woman in control? Or do you like to keep the power?\u201d</p><p>He swore softly. Shed his remaining clothes with an economy of motion. \u201cI don\u2019t care much for games,\u201d he muttered, and she saw him reach into the back pocket of his jeans. He pulled out his wallet, reached inside for something. Probably protection. After a moment, he stalked toward her and tossed a small packet onto the bed. \u201cI just care about getting you under me in, oh, the next five seconds.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted to reply\u2014</p><p>But he had her pinned to the bed, legs spread, arms anchored to the soft mattress above her head in, oh, three seconds.</p><p>The man might not like games, but he sure liked being in command.</p><p>The ridge of his arousal prodded against her sex. Todd was more than ready. So was she. He could thrust deep and hard into her right then and she wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about you.\u201d</p><p>Dreams he shouldn\u2019t have remembered.</p><p>\u201cI want to know if your breasts feel as good against my tongue, in reality, as they do when I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d Keeping his hold on her wrists, he lowered his head, the faint stubble of his five o\u2019clock shadow scraping across her flesh in an electric caress that made her gasp.</p><p>His lips closed over her left nipple. His mouth was warm, wet, and his tongue, as it curved around her areola, so damn skilled.</p><p>Todd Brooks certainly wasn\u2019t an amateur when it came to pleasures of the flesh.</p><p>Good. Neither was she.</p><p>A moan filled the air. Her moan. She lifted her hips, rubbing against him and loving the friction of his body against hers.</p><p>His mouth opened wider and he began to suckle her. Strong. Hard.</p><p>\u201cTodd!\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cYou taste the same...just like my dreams.\u201d He turned his attention to her other breast.</p><p>Oh, damn. Sensual energy filled her body. She pulled her arms down, easily breaking his hold. \u201cI can show you...ah, that\u2019s good...a reality that\u2019s a hell of a lot better than any dream.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved to her stomach. Began to kiss a heated path over her flesh. \u201cYou seem like a dream. A beautiful, fucking dream that I have no business having.\u201d</p><p>Underlying his words, there was a hint of anger that puzzled her. But then she felt the stir of his breath on the curls that shielded her sex and she forgot about the anger. His hands caught her thighs as he shifted his body. He pushed her legs farther apart, spreading her even more.</p><p>\u201cI never got this far in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>A damn shame to her way of thinking. She would have enjoyed the hell out of this particular act. Damn phone call.</p><p>\u201cBefore I take you tonight, I\u2019ve just got to taste you, right here.\u201d He parted her folds. Pressed his lips against the throbbing center of her need.</p><p>Then she felt the warm, wet lap of his tongue. Swirling around her entrance. Oh, damn, but that was great. Great.</p><p>His tongue drove deep inside her.</p><p>Her hands clamped in his hair, held him close, just where she wanted him.</p><p>His fingers were working her sex now. Plucking. Teasing. Rolling her clit between his thumb and index finger. And Todd kept using that wonderful tongue to lick her\u2014then to drive deep into her sex.</p><p>Not just great. Damn fabulous. She was going to come again. A hard, blast of release that would send power rocking through her. She was going to\u2014</p><p>He pulled away from her. The moonlight spilled onto his face. Cara saw the need. The fierce desire. \u201cWhen you come this time,\u201d he gritted, \u201cI\u2019ll be buried as deep in you as I can get.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like a fine plan to her.</p><p>His right hand reached for the foil packet. He ripped it open with his teeth. Rolled the latex up the length of his cock.</p><p>He pushed his aroused flesh between her legs. The head of his erection prodded her straining entrance, just slipping inside her sex.</p><p>Her lips curved into a full smile as she gazed up at him. This was what she\u2019d thought of giving up? She must have been absolutely crazy. Or really, really desperate.</p><p>Todd worked his cock inside of her\u2014 slowly. One inch at a time. There was sweat on his brow, glistening on his body. He was trying to stay in control. Not wanting to hurt her.</p><p>Sweet, silly human.</p><p>As if he could ever hurt her.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d always liked it a bit rough. Not pain, of course, she didn\u2019t really like that, but rather hard pleasure.</p><p>Cara twisted her body, rolling suddenly and taking them near the edge of the bed. When their bodies halted, she was on top of him, knees on either side of his hips, and his cock was buried fully inside her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she whispered, and she began to move. She lifted her body up, then drove down. His hands clamped on her hips, fighting her for control of the tempo and depth.</p><p>Her sex was tight and swollen from her previous climax, but she was more than ready for him, and he filled her so wonderfully well that every move had her body tightening with delight around him.</p><p>The thrusts became increasingly harder. She moved faster and faster. His fingers bit into her waist. The power in the room beat at her, at them, the waves so strong that a faint hum filled the room.</p><p>The release was close. A spark of electricity shot through her body. Blue sparks flickered in the air around them.</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes had squeezed shut, so he missed the burst of light. He never stopped thrusting. And she never stopped taking him.</p><p>So much energy. Hers for the taking .</p><p>Just as he was.</p><p>His eyes opened as he pushed up, caught her breast in his mouth and lashed the nipple with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cTodd!\u201d Her delicate inner muscles clamped tight around him and the climax that had been just out of her reach flew toward her.</p><p>Her right hand slammed down on his chest, driving him back against the bed. The power would come now, come crashing over them both.</p><p>She probably should have warned the guy before. She should have\u2014</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The scream was hers. Exultant.</p><p>He bucked beneath her, roared his release and the driving power of his lust pounded powerfully in the heart that drummed just below her hand.</p><p>The sensual power broke free. As they climaxed, as the pleasure lashed their bodies, the feelings magnified. They shuddered, gasped.</p><p>Cara threw back her head, wild with the rush, but her hand never left his chest. Her body stayed joined to his, and as the magical waves shook her, her head dropped over his.</p><p>Her lips found his. Carefully, she breathed her magic into him. Shared the power.</p><p>She\u2019d never given any of her sensual power to another before.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to just take from him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t like the others.</p><p>His heartbeat, already too fast, began a mad, driving beat.</p><p>Her tongue stroked past the entrance of his mouth. Found his. She kissed him until the powerful rush of magic and climax began to ease.</p><p>Then she lifted her head and forced herself to meet the gaze that she knew would hold a thousand questions.</p><p>Because Todd had to have just realized that sex with her was far, far from normal.</p><p>His chest ached, and a goddess rose above him.</p><p>Her small hand slowly lifted, and his heart finally began to slow down.</p><p>Jesus. He\u2019d just had the best fucking climax of his life, hands down. For a second there, he\u2019d actually been afraid that he might pass out. A damn embarrassing admission for him.</p><p>But in between the pleasure that had made his back bow off the bed and his toes tingle, something else had happened.</p><p>When she\u2019d placed her hand over his heart, for a moment, it had felt like she was branding him. And he\u2019d felt...her.</p><p>Her hunger. Her need. The feelings had been heady. His body had trembled with an unknown power.</p><p>A power he couldn\u2019t wait to feel again.</p><p>Damn, but he felt fucking good. Like he\u2019d slept for twenty hours good.</p><p>Like he\u2019d had the best orgasm ever good. One that had been far, far from normal...because he\u2019d felt her release, too.</p><p>And that shouldn\u2019t have been possible. How the hell had it been possible?</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want to talk now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice dripped honey and sex. Still within her depths, his cock began to stir again.</p><p>His arms skated down her spine. He needed to touch her.</p><p>Everywhere.</p><p>Was her skin glowing? The pale flesh seemed strangely luminous in the dark, and her skin sure felt warm to the touch. But a human\u2019s skin didn\u2019t glow like it was lit by a fire from within.</p><p>I\u2019m not even human, lover. The words from his dream whispered through his mind.</p><p>No, no, that\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe can talk in the morning. I\u2019ll explain everything to you\u2014tomorrow. If you...want to know about me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, he did. He wanted to know everything.</p><p>But not at that moment. He shoved the doubts and questions aside. For that night, they were just going to be a man and a woman.</p><p>Two people who wanted each other very, very badly.</p><p>Dawn could bring out the truth.</p><p>For now...</p><p>Reluctantly, he lifted her body off his hips\u2014and it was so easy. Like the woman was as light as a feather.</p><p>He was so ready to go another round.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>What? Did he look like a moron? \u201cI\u2019ve gotta clean up.\u201d Find another condom. \u201cThen I\u2019m coming back to bed.\u201d He reached out a hand. Traced the line of her nipple. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not even close to being done with you.\u201d Would the next climax be as strong?</p><p>Would he actually feel the power of her release again?</p><p>It was almost like he\u2019d touched her soul.</p><p>He\u2019d never been so close to another person. He knew that he should be scared, or at least a little alarmed, but\u2014</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. At least, not yet.</p><p>Though for a minute there, when her hand had pressed against his chest, he\u2019d had an uncomfortable flash of poor Michael House. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been too far gone to stop then, but apprehension had risen in the back of his mind, for just a moment.</p><p>Fucking ridiculous.</p><p>Cara wasn\u2019t a killer.

For now, he\u2019d take his goddess and the dreams she offered to him.</p><p>The killer returned to the scene of the Dayton murder.</p> <p>Going there was stupid\u2014no denying it, but there really hadn\u2019t been a choice for him. The compulsion to go to the scene had been too strong to resist.</p><p>A line of yellow police tape marked off the room. The door was closed. Sealed shut. The same garish plastic tape crisscrossed the windows.</p><p>He gave a moment\u2019s thought to breaking into the hotel room, but decided the risk just wasn\u2019t worth it. The body was long gone, so there really wasn\u2019t a point to forcing\u2014</p><p>A police cruiser circled the parking lot. Shit. He made a quick slide back into the shadows.</p><p>Damn it. It shouldn\u2019t have happened this way. The plan had been different.</p><p>That poor bastard hadn\u2019t even been on the list.</p> <p>A door opened to the left. A young girl peeked out, then pushed a cleaning cart forward.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss...\u201d</p><p>The girl let out a quick squeak of surprise.</p><p>He stepped into the light. The cops were gone. It was safe now. For the moment, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you a few questions.\u201d Power pulsed beneath the words.</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes went blank. She wouldn\u2019t remember the questions later\u2014so she\u2019d get to live.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sir...\u201d</p> <p>And he would get his questions answered.</p><p>Because before he dealt out his punishment, he had to be certain of the crime.</p><p>Good partners were so very hard to find.</p><p>Only a few women enjoyed the bittersweet mix of sex and death.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the body you found. Every. Single. Detail.\u201d</p><p>The girl began to talk and his hands balled into fists with every slow word that she uttered.</p><p>He\u2019d known, of course, the instant he\u2019d learned the man\u2019s name.</p><p>But when the sweet young thing before him started talking about the blood and the knife that the cops had found...</p><p>Fuck. The last betrayal he\u2019d expected.</p><p>By the one woman he\u2019d trusted.</p><p>Oh, yes, he was gonna make the bitch pay .</p><p>She\u2019d been his perfect bait.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>Now he\u2019d have to add her name to his list.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart,\u201d he told the girl softly, and bent to give her a light kiss\u2014and to steal a wisp of power.</p><p>The girl swayed before him.</p><p>He stepped back, left her. He couldn\u2019t very well kill her\u2014finding a woman\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t fit the MO he\u2019d created.</p><p>Not that the last murder fit, either\u2014 because of that whore.</p><p>But he\u2019d show her. He\u2019d find her, and make the bitch beg. Let her know that, before the cold hell of death, there could be such sweet, hot pleasure.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d Colin told Emily as he paced the small confines of the precinct office. \u201cJust how many supernaturals out there can kill with a touch.\u201d</p><p>Emily kept her gaze on the crime scene photos. \u201cYou\u2019re certain a more...human method wasn\u2019t used to kill these men?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHell, doc, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He came behind her, settled his warm, strong hands on her shoulders and began to gently knead her flesh. \u201cThe tox report isn\u2019t back yet on the last victim.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, but his hands were skilled. She closed the folder. Tried to stop picturing the dead. \u201cWhat about the first two victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith was out. Phillips ruled \u2019em natural causes. Heart attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael House has a handprint on his chest. Not a bruise, an actual outline of a hand. His heart\u2014his whole body, according to Smith\u2014was in perfect condition. No reason for a guy like him to up and die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he was given drugs or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr one of our local supernatural assholes has decided to start fucking with the humans again.\u201d</p><p>She had to wince at that because, technically, he was a supernatural who happened to be, ah, fucking with a human.</p><p>\u201cTell me what supernaturals out there can kill with a touch,\u201d Gyth repeated, his voice hardening, \u201cand I\u2019ll start tracking those bastards down.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was very good at tracking. Hunting. It was the nature of the beast he carried. Her lover was a wolf shifter, a fierce breed, and once he started hunting his prey, he wouldn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d run the killer to ground. \u201cI\u2019ll need some time to think, to check my books and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have suspicions, doc.\u201d He wheeled her chair around, crouching at the same time so that when the chair\u2019s wheels stopped moving, she found herself staring straight into his bright eyes. \u201cSo spill it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cThere are...several beings who could potentially murder this way.\u201d Potentially was the key word. Just because the Other could kill that way, well, it didn\u2019t mean that any of them had.</p><p>One black brow lifted. \u201cAnd they are?\u201d</p><p>She had to be careful here. She couldn\u2019t break her client confidentiality, but she had to give him as much knowledge as she possibly could. Fighting monsters was never easy. Her shifter knew that. \u201cAn incubus. A succubus. Both could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Wait!\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cThe sex demons?\u201d</p><p>A slow nod. Most Other had heard of the incubi and succubi. Even if they hadn\u2019t had, er, personal contact.</p><p>Because once a being had personal contact with one of that particular breed, well, it was said that the experience was unforgettable.</p><p>And, unfortunately for some, very addictive.</p><p>\u201cI thought those two were supposed to get high off pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Emily frowned at that. \u201cThey don\u2019t \u2018get high,\u2019 as you put it.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cThey literally live on it. Like vamps and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cSo how do they go from pleasuring someone to killing \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>Not an easy move. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t,\u201d she said, placing deliberate emphasis on most. \u201cBut, sometimes, certain succubi\u2014or incubi\u2014\u201d though from what she\u2019d learned the females were reputed to be far more dangerous than the males, \u201cwell, they can get...carried away in the heat of the moment.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cYeah, that can happen.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate sped up. \u201cNo, ah, not like that. The power they get through sex isn\u2019t enough for them. It\u2019s really...more like stealing life. The pleasure they get, it\u2019s life. It\u2019s power. Energy. If the succubus or incubus doesn\u2019t shut off the flow of power, if they keep linking with the prey,\u201d not the best word choice, probably, but it was all she had, \u201cthey can literally drain every last drop of life from the body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave a dead man in the bed.\u201d A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccubi and incubi are generally mid-level demons. Fives or sixes. They can only kill like this when sex is heavily involved.\u201d</p><p>Normally, humans didn\u2019t have too much to fear from the lower-level demons. It was the all-powerful level-tens that made real nightmares into reality for humans.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Colin said. \u201cSex has been heavily involved in these cases.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d kind of figured that from the naked bodies and bondage. But...\u201cA level-nine or-ten demon could also do something like this\u2014with the right set of circumstances, anyway. You know they can control minds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssholes like Niol? Yeah, I know they get off on playing with humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but they can place a suggestion a human\u2019s mind, literally, for death.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a hard breath. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me a level-ten can tell a person he\u2019s going to die, and then the poor bastard would just keel over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically, it should be possible. The body would temporarily mimic whatever suggestion the demon gave\u2014whether it was a heart attack or a stroke. The victim would think he or she was truly having the attack. And if you think it, well, sometimes that can just be enough to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at her in disbelief. Poor guy. For a supernatural, he still didn\u2019t quite understand the way the world worked. She tried to reassure him. \u201cBut I-I\u2019ve never known of an actual case like that.\u201d Though just the thought of that much power scared the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cBut you do know of a case where a sex demon has killed someone.\u201d He pounced on what she had said, and what she had not.</p><p>Emily stared straight at him. Now this was the hard part. Colin was her lover, the shifter she loved, but he was also a cop, and she wasn\u2019t about to break her professional standards. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, baby, you\u2019ve just said enough.\u201d</p><p>Her back teeth ground together. \u201cThere is another who could kill this way. The cazador del alma\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell is that? Spanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it roughly means soul hunter. The cazador has the touch of death. He finds those whose time has run out. He touches them\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he fucking kills them. Just great.\u201d Colin shook his head. \u201cSo I\u2019ve got some hunter out there who can kill humans at will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCazadores don\u2019t usually kill humans,\u201d Emily felt obliged to tell him. \u201cThey usually are the ones who go after Other when they go bad.\u201d Though the cazadores were extremely rare these days.</p><p>\u201cThese vics were human.\u201d Absolutely certain.</p><p>\u201cThen they wouldn\u2019t be a cazador\u2019 s usual prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless the guy is just another crazy bastard\u2014which is a definite possibility. Shit.\u201d Colin glanced back at the table and the closed file. \u201cI need to know which of these assholes is in my town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to advertise their presence.\u201d The deadliest beings often kept the lowest profiles, striking out only when necessary. \u201cLook, there could be others, let me research\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do your research, baby, and let me know everything you find out. In the meantime, I\u2019m gonna start hunting and\u2014\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cSonofabitch. \u201d</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>He growled. The sound more wolf that man. \u201cWe fucking had her in the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He jumped to his feet. \u201cA succubus. I\u2019d bet my life on it. I could smell her\u2014damn, the scent alone was enough to\u2014\u201d He broke off, rather wisely, Emily thought.</p><p>But she still had to ask, \u201cEnough to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to make me back the hell away from her, fast. Because she wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, very good answer. She rose quickly, grabbed his T-shirt, bunched it in her fist, and dragged him close for a hard, deep kiss.</p><p>One good thing about wolf shifters. Their loyalty was sacred to them, just as sacred as a mate.</p><p>The bad thing, well, that would be that some of them were psychotic. Luckily for her, Colin was as sane as they came, just with a decidedly aggressive streak that made him perfect as a cop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to call Brooks, let him know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now here was the problem. \u201cJust what, exactly? That you think you have a suspect and she\u2019s a demon?\u201d Emily hesitated. \u201cHe still doesn\u2019t even know the truth about you yet, does he?\u201d</p><p>A fast shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you think he\u2019ll take the news of a demon stalking the streets?\u201d</p><p>Not very well. They both knew that answer.</p><p>Colin exhaled. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the captain. See if he wants me to work this case on my own.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like that idea one bit. \u201cPartners are supposed to watch each other\u2019s backs. You\u2019re not supposed to be out there chasing down killers on your own.\u201d A cold knot lodged in her stomach. Emily knew that Colin was physically one of the strongest supernaturals around, but he wasn\u2019t invincible. As far as she knew, no one was.</p><p>So she\u2019d feel much better if someone was out there patrolling with him while he hunted.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep him in the dark forever.\u201d They\u2019d had the same argument before. \u201cI know your last partner screwed you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, he tried to kill me when he found out what I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooks isn\u2019t Mike, okay? You don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just my call, Em. Once Brooks finds out the truth, the shit will hit the fan about everyone. \u201d</p><p>Yes, it would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the captain,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand see what he wants me to do. But I\u2019m also going to have another chat with the succubus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not be involved.\u201d Her voice was carefully expressionless now. \u201cYou should wait for the tox screen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll wait for the results, but I got the feeling she knew exactly what I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you backed away, she knew.\u201d She could tell him that much.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Disgusted.</p><p>Emily cleared her throat. \u201cShifters have such an overdeveloped sense of smell that her pheromones came off smelling too sweet to you. When you retreated, she knew what you were.\u201d Humans and demons always went closer, eager for more of the heady scent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But not her shifter...he\u2019d acted just as the others of his kind had done before him.</p><p>\u201cYou sure seem to know a lot about the sex demons.\u201d His head cocked to the right. \u201cHow certain are you that the info you have is accurate?\u201d</p><p>Since her knowledge had come straight from the mouth of a succubus, pretty damn certain. \u201cSomething else you should know,\u201d she told him, knowing she had to tread carefully. \u201cSex demons\u2014they are very, very territorial. I\u2019d be surprised if there are more than a few in the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll damn well be having my little talk with Cara as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Cara.</p><p>The name rang in her ears.</p><p>Oh, damn.</p><p>The rising sun shot streaks of pink and purple across the sky as the lights filtered though the clouds and illuminated the horizon.</p> <p>Cara paused in the swimming pool, her body easily staying afloat. This was really her favorite time of the day, when the shadows had to give way to the light.</p><p>She turned slightly, and dove deep, heading straight to the bottom of the pool. The water was warm\u2014she always kept it heated\u2014</p><p>and it closed around her like the arms of a lover.</p><p>Todd.</p><p>She\u2019d left him sleeping upstairs. A smile had been on his lips. Cara had kissed him, a soft, light kiss before she left.</p><p>A part of her was afraid that would be the last kiss she ever gave to him. It was easy to pretend you didn\u2019t care about reality in the heat of passion. When pleasure was only moments away, it was fine to focus on the moment. Hell, she did that all the time.</p> <p>But Todd was a cop, and he wasn\u2019t just going to ignore the...peculiarities of the night before.</p><p>Of course, she had been holding back on the guy. Things could have gotten so intense that she could have had the man begging.</p><p>Or screaming with his pleasure.</p><p>Though they\u2019d both come pretty close to that.</p><p>When she touched the bottom of the pool, Cara pivoted and shot toward the surface. Her eyes were wide open as she swam, and she saw the outline of a man standing near the edge of the pool.</p><p>Todd. Her heart rate kicked up a notch. Her head broke the surface and she sucked in a deep breath of air. Tendrils of steam rose from the water.</p><p>He\u2019d dressed in the rumpled clothes he\u2019d worn last night. His hair was tousled, and there was a hard set to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo you always leave your lovers at dawn?\u201d He asked her quietly.</p> <p>She swam to the edge of the pool. Slow, unhurried movements. She reached for the wall. Curled her fingers over the edge and stared up at him. \u201cDo you always whisper my name when you sleep?\u201d He had, right after she\u2019d kissed him, and that soft sound had pierced straight to her heart.</p><p>Fool. He\u2019s not going to care when he knows the truth. They never care.</p><p>In fact, humans were usually horrified when they found out what she really was.</p><p>Narrow-minded jerks. Okay, now she was starting to think like Cameron, but it wasn\u2019t as if she could help the way she\u2019d been born. She didn\u2019t blame humans for having skin that could injure too easily or\u2014</p><p>\u201cLately, yeah, I probably do.\u201d He crouched down, his powerful thighs bunching. \u201cI missed you when I woke up this morning.\u201d</p><p>The guy sure knew how to say just the right thing.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI, uh, usually swim at dawn.\u201d Oh, jeez, could she have sounded more like a stuttering fool and less like a calm, cool demon?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that. Maybe I\u2019ll join you one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could...join me now if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>His gaze heated at her words.</p><p>Cara lifted her hand, pointing to the high privacy fence that surrounded her yard. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a suit. No one can see us.\u201d</p><p>Though she wouldn\u2019t have really cared if they could. Modesty had never been a particular concern of hers.</p><p>\u201cDamn, but you tempt me, woman.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was the point.</p><p>His hand reached out, caught her by the back of the neck and his lips took hers, pressing tight in a fierce kiss. His tongue moved swiftly to claim hers, stirring the hunger she\u2019d thought was temporarily sated.</p><p>Her wet hands wrapped around his arms. When his lips lifted from hers, she whispered, \u201cCome into the water with me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was so dark. So intense. Todd pulled away from her. Rose. Stared down at her with a face drawn tight.</p><p>She wanted him so badly that her body trembled.</p><p>And the light of dawn was beginning to glow brighter.</p><p>His hands went to his shirt. Only a few buttons remained, thanks to her frantic efforts last night. Slowly, he unhooked them and dropped the shirt onto the cement.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes, tossed away his socks. Then, gazing down into her eyes, he stripped off his jeans and boxers.</p><p>Oh, yes. The man was absolutely perfect to her. She licked her lips. Her stare raked down his chest. Over the sculpted abs and down to the narrow flare of his hips\u2014and to the broad shaft of arousal that jutted toward her.</p><p>This might just turn out to be the best swim she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cHow deep?\u201d He asked, and for a wild, hungry moment, she thought he was talking about sex.</p><p>Then she was actually able to think past her lust. \u201cUh, twelve feet here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He dove into the pool, arching his body and cutting straight into the water with an economy of splash.</p><p>She spun around, wanting to catch him when he came up and feel all that bare male flesh against her body. She was in a bikini, but it would be easy enough for him to pull away the spaghetti straps and\u2014</p><p>He caught her around the waist. Tugged her beneath the water. Her hands flew out, slid over his shoulders, and she found him staring at her, body perfectly poised, eyes blazing with need.</p><p>Oh, but she liked the way he played.</p><p>His hands went to her top. Untied the straps with a quick flick of his fingers. Her bared breasts were desperate for his touch, the nipples tight and hard in the water. He caught the tips with his fingers. Caressed. Teased.</p><p>Made her want so much more.</p><p>Todd and Cara shot to the surface at the same time. The moment air filled her lungs, Cara was ready for him. She kissed him, sealing her lips tight to his\u2014</p><p>Right before they sank beneath the water.</p><p>His fingers went to the bottom of her suit. Found the same easy ties to untangle. When the fabric floated away, he touched her sex.</p><p>Pushed those strong fingers between her legs and made her hips strain toward him as he strummed the center of her need.</p><p>They kicked to the surface together. His hands were still on her. Her lips still on his. Her mouth lifted slowly.</p><p>Then he pushed her back against the wall of the pool. Spread her legs ever wider and thrust two fingers deep into her core.</p><p>Cara hissed as the pleasure lashed her. But she wanted more than just those fingers inside of her. \u201cTodd...I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, damn, but you are the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d His mouth pressed against her throat. Bit. Sucked the flesh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...ah...play.\u201d But playing felt so good. \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more protection with me.\u201d He sounded horrified.</p><p>Hell. Pregnancy wasn\u2019t a major concern for her, but now really wasn\u2019t the time to get into an explanation of her genetics.</p><p>The lust was riding them both too hard. Now was the time for relief. \u201cGuess we have to improvise,\u201d she whispered. It wouldn\u2019t be as good as having that thick erection of his driving into her, but she was discovering that just about any sensual play with Todd was better than everything she\u2019d experienced with others.</p><p>The man sure as hell knew how to please a succubus. A rare talent.</p><p>But she also knew how to please a man. Her fingers found the small nubs of his nipples. Tugged lightly. A growl rewarded her efforts, and she trailed the tips of her nails down his chest. The pressure of her nails wasn\u2019t enough to hurt him or mark him, but just enough to sensitize his flesh and let him know what was coming.</p><p>Well, he would be coming. And so would she. But first\u2014</p><p>Her fingers eased over the skin of his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d His voice had become guttural now, and the fingers inside her were still working her sex in a fierce, possessive drive.</p><p>Her climax was close.</p><p>Time for his.</p><p>The air crackled around them. The already warm water in the pool heated perceptibly as their passion flared.</p><p>She found the length of his cock. Long. Hard. She wrapped both hands around him, squeezed. Tested the length, moving from root to head. Again. Again.</p><p>The fingers driving inside her began to move faster.</p><p>So did her hands.</p><p>He kissed her. Drove his tongue into her mouth in perfect time with the thrust of his hand.</p><p>Her sex contracted around his fingers. Her skin began to prickle as the sting of energy in the air surrounded her, so rich and sweet she could taste it...just as she tasted him.</p><p>Her hands pumped his flesh. Squeezed tighter. Stroked harder. His body stiffened against her, the muscles bunching as he spiraled ever closer to his release.</p><p>Her fingers closed over the top of his shaft, caressed the sensitive head beneath the warm water.</p><p>Oh, but she was close\u2014</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers, stared down at her, breath ragged and hard.</p><p>His thumb pushed against her clit and his fingers thrust deep again.</p><p>The fire within her erupted into a blaze as Cara choked out his name and greedily took the pleasure he offered...even as she pumped him to his own climax.</p><p>His cock tightened, jerked. The face above hers flushed and she felt the hard jet of his orgasm.</p><p>Cara kissed him again, riding the wave of her orgasm, his, and funneling that energy right back to Todd so that his body shuddered as the fiery pleasure seemed to last and last.</p><p>When the climax ended, dawn had arrived in full force. Light blazed across the pool, sparkling on the waves.</p><p>Damn. It was a miracle they both hadn\u2019t drowned.</p><p>Todd blinked and gazed down at Cara\u2019s glistening face. He was so screwed.</p><p>Her full lips trembled. Curved into a smile that looked gorgeous, and a little lost.</p><p>So screwed.</p><p>But he felt good. Fucking fantastic, in fact.</p><p>He kissed those lips of hers. God, but he loved her mouth. The sweet bow of her top lip. The plumpness of her lower lip. The way her mouth fit against his. The way she tasted.</p><p>Her fingers stroked his cock. A final caress before she eased her hands away.</p><p>Todd exhaled. \u201cCara...\u201d Now that the fog of lust was starting to clear, he knew they needed to talk.</p><p>But, if he didn\u2019t get away from the naked temptation of her body, he\u2019d forget about talking, again, and pounce on the lady one more time.</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d Cara\u2019s words stopped him. \u201cYou\u2019re...different, Todd Brooks.\u201d</p><p>And she was far beyond any experience he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why this is going to be so hard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Now the smile on her lips was just sad. \u201cWe should get dressed.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared under the water, sliding beneath the clear surface and swimming around him, before reappearing in the shallow end of the pool\u2014close to the steps that led up to the cement and the waiting patio. He swam slowly behind her, the tension in his gut thickening.</p><p>Todd knew he wasn\u2019t about to have the best conversation of his life.</p><p>He sure as hell hoped the lady wasn\u2019t kicking him out. Not yet.</p><p>His gaze zeroed in on the graceful line of her back as she rose from the pool. Dipped low to the curve of her ass. He hadn\u2019t showed her ass the attention it deserved yet, but he would. He\u2019d show\u2014</p><p>She turned a bit, reaching down to grab a towel off the chaise, and he caught a glimpse of her birthmark. A perfect half-moon birthmark above her hip. Left side.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Goose bumps grew on his flesh, his warning system going off too late.</p><p>In less than five seconds, he was out of the pool. Splashing water and storming toward her. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>She whirled at his snarl, holding her towel in front of her. \u201cAh, Todd\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the edge of the towel, wrenched it away. Last night, it had been so dark in her bedroom that he hadn\u2019t noticed the mark on her hip. But now, in the bright light of the new day, there was no mistaking it.</p><p>Just like in his dream. A perfect fucking match.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>No, it should have been impossible.</p><p>A woman couldn\u2019t just...walk into his dreams.</p><p>And a man couldn\u2019t transform into a wolf\u2014but Colin had. He\u2019d seen the transformation with his own eyes.</p><p>Just like he now saw the damn birthmark.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of that mark.\u201d He stared at the smooth white skin. Skin that contrasted so richly with the dark half-moon. He lifted his gaze to her face. Found her watching him with worried eyes. \u201cHow\u2019d I do that, Cara?\u201d</p><p>The hair on his nape had risen. Oh, yeah, his alarms were ringing now. Shrieking, actually.</p><p>Her hand lifted. \u201cGive me the towel.\u201d</p><p>Todd realized they were both dripping wet and still naked. And that he was aroused. Confused as hell, but increasingly aroused.</p><p>He tossed the towel back to her.</p><p>She wrapped the terry-cloth around her body. \u201cOn the other side of the pool, there\u2019s a small storage room. You\u2019ll find some towels in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk, okay? Just...you need to get dressed first.\u201d</p><p>Fine. He spun around, military-style. His gaze flickered over the still water of the pool, saw her bikini floating on the surface. His stomach clenched.</p><p>Damn it. Todd headed for the storage room. Found an oversize towel. Swiped away the water and secured the towel at his hips.</p><p>Not dressed, but good enough\u2014for the moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went back to face his temptress, and ignored the growing chill in the air.</p><p>She stood at the edge of the pool. Hair slicked back. Eyes bright.</p><p>He stopped about three feet away from her. Waited. Questions tumbled through his mind. One after the other. How had he known about her birthmark? And when he\u2019d woken that first night, with scratch marks on his arms, just what the hell had been happening?</p> <p>Had their encounters been dreams...or had they been all too real?</p><p>And why the fuck did he still feel so good? Energy and heat pumped through him, making him feel stronger than he had in months.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been completely honest with you, Todd.\u201d</p><p>No shit. Her voice was soft. Tense. Her gaze darted to the left a moment, then returned, almost reluctantly, to his. \u201cI\u2019m not the woman you think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who the hell are you?\u201d Why was she talking in riddles? He wanted to know about her birthmark, not\u2014</p> <p>Her left hand lifted, toyed with the top of the towel. \u201cTell me, Detective\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, now he was back to detective? Like she hadn\u2019t been moaning his name less than five minutes ago.</p><p>\u201c\u2014do you believe in monsters?\u201d</p><p>Her question drove the breath from his lungs. \u201cWhat?\u201d Oh, Christ, he sure hoped she wasn\u2019t gonna tell him that\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in monsters?\u201d She repeated the question and licked her succulent red lips. \u201cYou really should, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d His heart pounded like a drum, the dull beat echoing in his ears.</p> <p>\u201cBecause according to some people, I\u2019m one of the worst monsters you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>He jerked on his clothes, so furious that his hands shook. \u201cLook, baby, if you want to blow me off, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t give me some bullshit about being a monster\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d she said, blond brows rising in what could have been a flare of annoyance.</p><p>\u201c\u2014because I know all about real monsters, okay? I deal with them every fucking day. Rapists. Child killers. Fire freaks who burn down homes with nice old ladies inside\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re about to tell me that you did kill Michael House,\u201d and Jesus but he hoped she wasn\u2019t, \u201cthen don\u2019t screw around with me by throwing out labels that I understand one hell of a lot better than you do.\u201d She\u2019d hit his weak spot, and he was furious.</p><p>Todd knew all about the evil in the world. Had known about it since his fourteenth birthday, when he\u2019d watched that bastard Costa smile and shoot his mother straight in the heart. Monsters. Yeah. He knew all about the bastards, and the evil that lived in what they pretended were souls.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Michael.\u201d She licked her lips again. Stood there with that towel wrapped around her and looked so damn good that he ached. \u201cBut I am a monster, Todd. I-I\u2019m a demon.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just finished dressing when she made her announcement. He shook his head, slowly. \u201cRun that one by me again, baby.\u201d No way the lady had just said\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon, Detective. A real, honest-to-God,\u201d her mouth curved slightly at that in a wan smile, \u201cdemon.\u201d</p><p>Todd stared at her, not quite sure what to say. The automatic words, You\u2019re crazy, trembled on his lips.</p><p>And he would have said those words to her\u2014 two months ago.</p><p>Yeah, back then, he would have laughed at her claim. Asked what her punch line was.</p><p>But that was two months ago.</p><p>Back before the dangerous night when he\u2019d trailed his partner to the warehouse district on the darker side of Atlanta and watched his partner of two years stop being a man\u2014and become a snarling, deadly beast.</p><p>A wolf.</p><p>Todd hadn\u2019t said a word to anyone about what he\u2019d seen. He\u2019d followed Colin because the guy was his partner, and partners backed each other up.</p><p>He\u2019d been shaken as hell. Stunned.</p><p>He\u2019d planned to follow the wolf into the warehouse, help him, but the captain had paged him, said that he had to get back to the station ASAP\u2014and that he knew where Todd was.</p><p>The order had been blunt. Get your ass out of there before you get Colin killed.</p><p>So he\u2019d left. He\u2019d taken a heavy knowledge with him\u2014a knowledge he hadn\u2019t shared with anyone\u2014because, well, who would believe him?</p><p>At first, he\u2019d had so many dreams about that night. Memories of that brutal shift. The snap of bones and the growl of the beast had haunted his nights.</p><p>He\u2019d kept at his job, though, damn it. Bit back the instinctive fear that roused its head. And he\u2019d stuck by his partner\u2019s side, even when he\u2019d been pissed and confused as all hell.</p><p>He\u2019d thought that Colin was an anomaly, but now\u2014</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Cara raised her voice. \u201cI-I just told you that I\u2019m a demon.\u201d</p><p>Todd blinked. First werewolves, now demons. But Cara didn\u2019t look like a demon. No horns. No tail. No forked tongue. Or was all that stuff he\u2019d heard as a kid just bullshit?</p><p>\u201cThis is the point where most guys get really afraid and leave, as fast as they can.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cUh, Todd? Can you say something? Are\u2014are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not all right,\u201d he gritted. \u201cMy lover just told me she\u2019s a damn demon.\u201d Not the best news he could have gotten, but at least she hadn\u2019t confessed to being a murdering demon. \u201cYou...don\u2019t look like a demon.\u201d</p><p>Now her smile really did break his heart. \u201cSure I do,\u201d she said, and closed her eyes. When they opened a second later, they were black. Completely black.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>Another blink, and her blue gaze was back. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little glamour,\u201d she told him, lifting a brow.</p><p>Those eyes. He\u2019d seen them before. The darkness. Black cornea. Retina. He\u2019d seen it with\u2014</p><p>Niol. That asshole at Paradise Found. He\u2019d wondered why someone would wear contacts like that, but if Cara was telling him the truth, that meant Niol was a demon, too.</p><p>And that fact made a hell of a lot of sense when Todd remembered his strange attack in the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re handling this, um, rather well.\u201d Cara gazed at him solemnly.</p><p>When Todd lifted his hand to shove back his wet hair, he noticed a tremble still in his fingers. Not that well, baby. He tried for rational. \u201cDemons aren\u2019t real.\u201d He knew the statement was a lie the minute the words slipped out. His partner was a werewolf. If werewolves could exist, then why not demons, too?</p><p>Shit, but the world was even more messed up than he\u2019d originally thought, and about a hundred times more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019re real. We\u2019ve been living with humans from the very beginning.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cAnd before you start asking, let me just tell you, demons are not the spawn of the devil, okay? Total myth, that part. We\u2019re just a...different race.\u201d</p><p>Different race. Seemed simple enough\u2014but his thundering heart wasn\u2019t quite buying the simple explanation. Christ. \u201cWhat kind of demon are you?\u201d His gaze raked down her body. \u201cAnd just how much, uh\u2014\u201d What had she called it? \u201cGlamour have you been using on me?\u201d A cold wind seemed to blow over him. The woman was too pretty. Too perfect looking by far. Hell, the only flaw on her body was that birthmark on her hip, and it really wasn\u2019t a flaw so much as\u2014well, a mark he wanted to bite.</p><p>Too perfect. He\u2019d thought it from the beginning. Just what, exactly, was she hiding beneath the glamour?</p><p>Did he really want to know?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot!\u201d Cara snapped, and turned on her heel. She stomped toward the chaise and picked up a thin, blue robe. She shouldered into it, letting the towel drop to the ground.</p><p>Todd swallowed and absolutely refused to try and catch a glimpse of her naked sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using glamour to do anything but camouflage my eyes, okay? In case you didn\u2019t notice, they\u2019re a bit of a giveaway, don\u2019t you think? And it\u2019s not like I want to go around advertising my true self to the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your \u2018true self\u2019 is what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Last night, he would have done almost anything to claim her. The lust had been that wild. Now, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder...how much of it had been real?</p><p>A demon. He didn\u2019t know anything about demons or their power. It was so unbelievable. So insane, so\u2014</p><p>True.</p><p>He knew in his gut Cara wasn\u2019t lying, and too many facts and situations from over the years were rolling through his head.</p><p>So much made sense now. The angry stares in Paradise Found. The strange energy he\u2019d felt there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using glamour to shield my body or my face,\u201d she said, hands tightening into fists.</p><p>\u201cSo that crap about demons having horns and pointed tails is\u2014what? Straight lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s true for certain very, very old and very, very powerful demons.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a very strong demon,\u201d Cara admitted and did her cheeks flush? Was the woman, ah, demon, embarrassed by her weakness?</p><p>\u201cAnd just what kind of demon are you?\u201d He asked her again, and wondered why she hadn\u2019t answered him before.</p><p>Her mouth opened as if she were going to reply, then she stopped and pressed her lips together.</p><p>Uh, oh. Not a good sign. But, just how many demons were there, anyway?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not acting particularly shocked,\u201d she said slowly, and, once more\u2014not answering his question. There was suspicion on her face as she asked, \u201cHave you met my kind before?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he just hadn\u2019t realized it until now. No wonder he\u2019d felt like half the world had been keeping secrets from him. They had.</p><p>But not any longer. The rose-colored glasses lay shattered at his feet. \u201cCara...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys really do generally run at this point.\u201d A faint line appeared between her brows. \u201cLike I told you, fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told a lot of guys this spiel, huh?\u201d Was that jealousy flaring in his gut? Sure felt like it.</p><p>\u201cA few. Those who don\u2019t run usually want me to prove that I\u2019m a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do your eye trick.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cI can do more than that.\u201d</p><p>Now he was curious. Kinda like those people who stopped and turned around when they saw car accidents. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn any human male but you, I\u2019d be able to hypnotize with just a word. Get you to do my complete bidding.\u201d</p><p>Now Todd had to swallow to ease the dryness in his throat. And she didn\u2019t think that made her fall into the \u201cstrong\u201d</p><p>category? \u201cSo why am I the lucky human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a latent psychic with more power than you realize.\u201d A shrug. \u201cYou\u2019ve got shields up in your mind that you don\u2019t even know about.\u201d</p><p>Now that was a load of shit. He wasn\u2019t psychic. Never had been. \u201cNice try, baby, but if I were psychic, I would have won the lottery years ago and retired to Mexico.\u201d How was he even having this conversation?</p><p>They\u2019d been climaxing together minutes before. He\u2019d wanted nothing more than to shove deep and hard into her tight sex and now\u2014</p><p>Well, now he\u2019d entered the twilight zone, and he\u2019d very much like to leave, please.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that kind of psychic.\u201d He thought he heard her mutter, idiot, beneath her breath. His eyes narrowed. She continued,</p><p>\u201cYou probably get feelings, don\u2019t you? Little vibes of tension or fear just before you walk into a situation that\u2019s dangerous as all hell. But you know before you walk in, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>How did she know that?</p><p>\u201cSome folks would call that instinct. A psychic edge. Whatever you want to name it, the fact is that your mind is stronger than others. You\u2019ve got a gift, one most humans never get, and those that do have it, well, precious few understand just what in the world is going on when the edge kicks into play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you understand, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of my kind have the edge. We were brought into this world with it, and we\u2019ll leave with it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk about what fictional powers he may or not possess. Right then, he just wanted to focus on her. \u201cSo you usually do a hypnotic show, huh? No other tricks to prove that you\u2019re a demon?\u201d Though proof was really moot at this point, he still felt the driving need to keep pushing at her.</p><p>Because she\u2019s just knocked my world right off its axis.</p><p>No, his jaw tightened. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself right then. Colin had rocked his reality months ago. Cara had just broken the shaky peace he\u2019d been living in since that night.</p><p>\u201cI have a few other skills,\u201d Cara admitted, somewhat grudgingly, he thought. She lifted her hand. A small plume of smoke appeared about two inches above her open palm. As he watched, the smoke thickened, and with a snap, a ball of flames burst in the air.</p><p>Cara pulled back her hand, smiled at him, and tossed the fire straight toward him.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>He ducked. Felt the rush of fire. Looked up, saw the ball, spinning in the air, fire blazing gold and red.</p><p>Then it vanished.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t 100 percent certain he believed that. Especially since the top of his head felt singed.</p><p>\u201cYou pissed me off,\u201d she said, lips twisting. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have tossed that toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, you shouldn\u2019t have tossed the ball of fire at my head.\u201d Unbelievable.</p><p>His lover was a demon.</p><p>Damn. Damn. Damn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A very sexy demon.</p><p>One who apparently had a very bad temper.</p><p>And gorgeous legs.</p> <p>Ah, hell. \u201cSo what am I supposed to do now?\u201d He really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>No, actually, he did know one thing\u2014with absolute certainly. He still wanted her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Was that hope flickering in her eyes?</p><p>He had to ask. \u201cYou feel, don\u2019t you, Cara?\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, like me, like humans, you feel. Lust. Anger.\u201d Oh, yes, he knew she felt anger. He had the burnt hair to prove it. \u201cLove.\u201d</p><p>A slow nod. \u201cI can feel. Being a demon doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a woman, Todd. I need. I hurt. I bleed. Just like anyone else.\u201d</p><p>But with a few dangerous extras thrown in for spice. He rubbed his eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve gotta have some time to think about this.\u201d To figure out just what the hell was going to happen next.</p><p>Her face paled. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>That cold, stilted voice pissed him off. He dropped his hand and stalked toward her. Todd caught her arms and hauled her up against him. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you see a damn thing.\u201d She thought he was running, like those other fools she\u2019d mentioned.</p><p>But he was no fool.</p> <p>He kissed her, driving his tongue into her sweet mouth and growling his hunger.</p><p>Her fingers pressed against his shoulders.</p><p>He drank in her essence. Fought the growing hunger that roared inside him. \u201cI have to get to the station,\u201d he bit the words off against her lips. The tox screen was due in first thing this morning. He had a job to do and\u2014</p><p>And he needed to think.</p><p>But he was not running.</p><p>He stepped away from her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, Cara, tonight. We\u2019ll finish this\u2014\u201d Whatever this was.</p><p>She just stared up at him, silent.</p><p>What was he supposed to say? The woman had just confessed that she was a demon, for Christ\u2019s sake.</p> <p>No wonder the sex had been so damn powerful with her. She wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>Just like she\u2019d told him in his dreams.</p><p>Oh, yeah, his dreams...they\u2019d have to talk about those babies\u2014and she would have to tell him just what the hell had really been happening when he touched her in his sleep.</p><p>Cara nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d She shrugged, tried to look as if she didn\u2019t care. Failed. \u201cDo what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>Damn if the stiffness in her shoulders didn\u2019t make him feel guilty, when he was the wronged party. He hadn\u2019t misled her about being human. \u201cIt\u2019s the case, Cara. I have to check in by seven thirty. I\u2019m supposed to be getting the tox screen in for House.\u201d Okay, he probably shouldn\u2019t have told her that. His big mouth was going to get him into trouble one of these days.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p><p>No screaming. No yelling. No when-will-I-see-you again questions.</p><p>He shoved his hands into the front pocket of his jeans. Marched toward the gate on the side of the house. Hesitated. Shit\u2014he had to go. He had to swing by his place, find a shirt with buttons. Then hurry his ass down to the station.</p><p>Todd pulled in a slow breath. \u201cThis isn\u2019t finished.\u201d He said the words without looking at her, because gazing at the woman was dangerous to his control.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word drifted to him on the breath of the wind that feathered over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be seeing his demon again, there was no question of that in his mind.</p><p>His right hand reached for the gate.</p><p>\u201cIt was real, you know.\u201d Her voice stopped him cold. \u201cEverything that happened between us was real. I wanted you, you wanted me. Just like humans. Only much better...\u201d</p><p>Much better than anything he\u2019d ever experienced before, that was certain.</p><p>\u201cRemember that, when you\u2019re away from me. Remember what we had when we were together, and stop thinking that you screwed a monster.\u201d</p><p>His fury erupted. Todd spun around, hands fisted. \u201cDamn it, I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was gone. Just the faintest trace of her soft lavender scent remained in the air.</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were a monster,\u201d he snarled, knowing that she couldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cThat was your word, not mine.\u201d He\u2019d thought of her only as...</p><p>His.</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes squeezed shut. Hell, he\u2019d known the woman was going to be trouble from that first glance, and he\u2019d been so right about her.</p><p>Now what was he supposed to do?</p><p>Colin was bent over his desk, busily thumbing through files, when Todd walked into the bull pen. As usual, chaos reigned in the detectives\u2019 world. Phones rang with shrill cries. Voices floated around the room as questions were tossed back and forth between the men and women who were guzzling black coffee and pushing the sleep from their eyes.</p><p>His home away from home.</p><p>Todd headed for this small desk, directly opposite his partner\u2019s. He\u2019d barely taken two steps when Colin\u2019s head suddenly snapped up and his gaze zeroed in on him.</p><p>No damn way he heard me. Not with all this racket going on. Todd stared back at his partner, saw the slight flare of Colin\u2019s nostrils, then the abrupt tightening of his jaw.</p><p>He knew what that telltale clenching signified. Colin was furious, and from the look on his face, that anger was directed straight at Todd.</p><p>A sigh broke from his lips. Okay. He was tired of the guy\u2019s attitude. He\u2019d put up with enough shit from Colin. It was time to clear the air once and for all\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, partner?\u201d Colin murmured when Todd reached the desks.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>Colin glared at him. \u201cYou know you could be fucking up the case.\u201d</p><p>He knew. Todd didn\u2019t know how the cagey bastard knew, but Colin realized that Todd had spent the night with Cara. \u201cShe\u2019s not a suspect anymore.\u201d</p><p>Another flare of the guy\u2019s nostrils. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Very deliberately, Todd placed his hands on top of the old, wooden desk and leaned in over Colin. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too long ago when you were screwing a suspect, too, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily was never a suspect! She was working with us and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and for a while she looked guilty as hell.\u201d His hands shoved harder against the desktop.</p><p>\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is Cara!\u201d Not guilty of the murders, anyway, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cGyth! Brooks!\u201d The whiplash of Captain Danny McNeal\u2019s voice cut through the fire of Todd\u2019s anger. He glanced up, realizing too late that he and Colin hadn\u2019t exactly been having a quiet conversation. Most of the eyes in the station were on them, particularly the glaring gray stare of the captain.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cIn my office,\u201d McNeal growled, his completely bald scalp gleaming as he inclined his head toward the open door. \u201cNow. \u201d</p><p>Todd straightened. This wasn\u2019t going to be pretty.</p><p>The wheels of Colin\u2019s chair rattled as he shot to his feet.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak as they crossed the room to the captain\u2019s office. Not really much to say at that point.</p><p>McNeal slammed the door shut behind them. Marched to his desk. He didn\u2019t sit down. Just glared at them, tension evident in the thick muscles of his body.</p><p>Todd knew that Captain Danny McNeal had been with the Atlanta PD for over twenty years. The guy was in his early forties and in better shape than most of the men in the precinct. He ran every day, and could be routinely found in the PD\u2019s gym, tossing cops over his shoulder and onto the cushioned blue mats.</p><p>The guy was a real hardass. Smart as a whip. And known for his fiery temper.</p><p>According to the rumors, he\u2019d also been heavily involved with Smith at one time.</p><p>But, of course, those were just rumors, and Todd had never really been able to imagine the gorgeous doctor pairing up with the asshole cop.</p><p>Just didn\u2019t fit for him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fucking stare at me all day, Brooks, or are you going to tell me why the hell my best two detectives were yelling at each other like two twelve-year-old girls in the middle of my bull pen?\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn. Todd winced. The first time he\u2019d ever been compared to a twelve-year-old girl. \u201cI lost my temper, Captain. Sorry.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to point any fingers at Colin. Not his style.</p><p>McNeal grunted. \u201cWell, learn to keep your damn temper in check! Understand, Brooks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Though McNeal really needed to learn the same coping skill.</p><p>\u201cI got the shit-for-brains mayor and the dumbass DA breathing down my neck right now, yelling about another serial killer being on our streets\u2014I don\u2019t need this crap from you two!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Another growl from deep in McNeal\u2019s chest. \u201cIs this partnership working?\u201d He asked bluntly. \u201cDo I need to reassign\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todd answered immediately, and saw Colin stiffen slightly from the corner of his eye.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d McNeal\u2019s gaze shot to Colin. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with us, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stupidity,\u201d McNeal snapped, then finally dropped into his chair. \u201cAll right, screw it. You\u2019ve been warned. Stop acting like fucking idiots and tell me the status on these damn cases.\u201d</p><p>Todd had to fight the curve of his lips. McNeal was a tough bastard, but he respected the guy, and in other circumstances, he would have even called him a friend.</p><p>Instead, he called him boss.</p><p>And asshole\u2014behind his back, anyway.</p><p>Colin cleared his throat. \u201cSmith put a rush order on House\u2019s toxicology screen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got the results.\u201d A pause. \u201cNegative. The guy\u2019s system was clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal\u2019s bushy brows snapped together. \u201cSo what\u2019s the cause of death, then? How\u2019s Smith calling him?\u201d</p><p>Now Colin looked real uncomfortable. \u201cUh, Smith actually said she\u2019d be down for a briefing on this and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she calling it?\u201d</p><p>A light tap sounded on the captain\u2019s door. \u201cI\u2019m busy!\u201d McNeal yelled instantly. \u201cWhat the hell? Does a closed door look like I want company?\u201d</p><p>The closed door opened. Smith poked her head in, frowning. \u201cI know you did not just yell at me.\u201d</p><p>McNeal jumped to his feet. \u201cSmith, I-I didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d His voice seemed to drop, just an octave, so that it was no longer a bear growl. Something softer. More intimate.</p><p>Well, I\u2019ll be damned. Todd studied the captain with barely contained curiosity. Maybe there was a bit of truth to those rumors about the guy and the ME.</p><p>Smith\u2019s dark stare flashed to Colin. Held for just a few seconds as she said, \u201cI told you I needed to be here for this meeting. I\u2019m not going to be cut out of another case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Todd added at once, memories of the last serial killer swirling through his mind. The captain had put Colin in charge and basically sidelined Todd while his partner worked day and night with Dr. Drake.</p><p>No. Definitely not happening again. This time, the killer was his.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of cutting you out\u2014either of you. It\u2019s a matter of doing what\u2019s best for the department.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>Smith closed the door behind her. The two chairs in front of McNeal\u2019s desk were empty. Todd stood just to the left of the chairs, while Colin was positioned near the back of the captain\u2019s office, right beside an oversized green plant. A plant Todd wasn\u2019t entirely convinced was real.</p><p>Smith crossed the room. Sat in the chair next to Todd. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d</p><p>McNeal stared down at her. \u201cYou all right?\u201d He asked suddenly.</p><p>Todd saw her shoulders tighten. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He almost snorted. He had no idea the lady was such a lousy liar.</p><p>He could tell by the doubt on McNeal\u2019s face that the captain knew she was lying, too.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t push her, just sat back down in his chair, and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t miss much. Just discussing the tox screen.\u201d</p><p>The tension in her shoulders eased a bit as she said, \u201cMichael House wasn\u2019t given any drugs. At least, not as far as I can tell.\u201d She held up one hand, the fingers steady. \u201cNow, I didn\u2019t screen for everything\u2014would have been damn impossible to screen for every drug. But I hit the main boys, every mix that I thought could do something like this.\u201d A shake of her head. \u201cHe was clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the cause of death going to be?\u201d</p><p>Her hand dropped. \u201cAt this point, the COD is going down as undetermined.\u201d</p><p>Todd swore. \u201cSmith, if it goes down like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re off the case,\u201d McNeal finished. \u201cBecause as far as the mayor and DA are concerned, there will be no case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say the victim died of natural causes,\u201d Smith pointed out quickly, her voice rising a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well have.\u201d Damn it, the guy had been murdered. Todd knew it in his gut. \u201cWhat about the hand, Smith? That print on his chest?\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s fist slammed down on the desk, hard. \u201cWhat print?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a print.\u201d Smith turned her head and glowered at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can scan the thing and get fingerprints.\u201d She looked back at McNeal. \u201cIt\u2019s just...an outline. Of a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight in the middle of Michael House\u2019s chest,\u201d Colin said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bruise,\u201d McNeal dismissed, fingers tapping now on the desktop. \u201cHas to be. The assailant applied pressure to his chest and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019d call a normal bruise. Colin...\u201d Smith pointed to McNeal. \u201cShow him the pictures.\u201d</p><p>Colin marched forward. Handed the case file to the captain.</p><p>\u201cA normal bruise can appear after a vic\u2019s death, but...\u201d Smith rubbed her forehead. Todd snaked around the desk to get a better look at the pictures. \u201cBruises are generally of varying discolorations. This one is the exact same throughout. A perfect black outline.</p> <p>There aren\u2019t pressure marks, no damage beneath the surface of the skin.\u201d</p><p>She stood up, walked over, and shoved her hand at Todd\u2019s chest, hard. He grunted under the impact.</p><p>\u201cWhen I hit him, I used the ball of my hand. It gives the most force. Or,\u201d another shove, \u201cI can push him back with the tips of my fingers. Just...not with as much power\u201d A faint smile tilted the corners of her full lips. \u201cSorry, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, Smith. He deserved it.\u201d The rumble came from Colin.</p><p>Smith had once joked easily with Colin. They\u2019d been good friends. Now, she seemed to shut down at the sound of his voice, her smile fading instantly.</p> <p>\u201cNeither of those hits would leave a mark like the one found on House.\u201d Her hand fell away from Todd. \u201cEven if the perp were over the vic, shoving him down into the bed, it would have been a ball-of-hand contact. There is no scenario I can think of that would leave that perfect outline of a person\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit.\u201d McNeal\u2019s fingers rubbed over his eyes. \u201cSmith, I wish you\u2019d give me this information first. I\u2019ve told you time and again there is chain of command here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put the file in your box long before I gave a copy to Gyth.\u201d She raised a brow. \u201cHave you checked your box, Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here since four a.m., stuck in a damn three-and-a-half-hour emergency meeting with the mayor and DA,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cSo, no, Smith, I haven\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, next time, you should. Especially before you go growling at me about how to do my job! I know how to do my job!\u201d</p> <p>She was all but going across the desk at him as she nearly shouted her words, and the lady finally was acting like her old self.</p><p>McNeal leaned forward, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cMcNeal. Smith.\u201d It was Colin\u2019s steely voice that broke the tension in the room.</p><p>Their furious faces immediately turned toward him. Colin cleared his throat, then said, \u201cCaptain, as you pointed out to me and Brooks, we really don\u2019t have time for this shit.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>Smith drew in a deep breath. Took a few steps back, then slowly lowered her body into the chair. \u201cAre you going to be able to exhume the other two bodies?\u201d</p><p>A hard shake of McNeal\u2019s head. \u201cDA will never go for even trying on the order. Especially if House isn\u2019t going down as a homicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked House\u2019s body, thoroughly.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe man shouldn\u2019t have died.\u201d</p> <p>The captain\u2019s gaze darted to Colin.</p><p>Todd tensed when his partner gave an almost imperceptible nod. What the hell?</p><p>McNeal peered down at the files again. \u201cWell, at least we damn well know the last vic\u2014what was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas Monroe,\u201d Todd supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, at least we know Monroe was murdered. Turn your focus onto him.\u201d</p><p>They had been focusing on him, and the other dead men who kept turning up. \u201cThere were no prints on the knife, but we did retrieve a hair from the mattress.\u201d A long strand of blond hair, and that fit because, \u201cThe desk clerk said a blond was there with Monroe.\u201d Just like a blond had been in the other hotels with the other dead men.</p><p>But why the change in MO? It made no sense. If the perp was the same, why change methods now? Why change them at all?</p><p>\u201cThe press has gotten wind of the link in the murders.\u201d Colin\u2019s voice was quiet, tense. \u201cThat new reporter for News Flash Five, Holly Storm\u2014\u201d</p><p>So now he remembered her name.</p><p>\u201c\u2014she was at the House scene, too. Must\u2019ve gotten there after we left. She talked to the desk clerk. Found out about the bondage, and now she knows about Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the damn story at five last night,\u201d McNeal muttered. \u201cShit. \u2018 The cops aren\u2019t talking, but rumors of the Bondage Killer are rampant on the streets...\u2019 Hell. Like I needed that crap from her now.\u201d</p><p>Todd winced. He\u2019d also caught the redhead\u2019s story, just like nearly every other person in the city.</p><p>Holly Storm had finally made her big splash on News Flash Five.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight the cops aren\u2019t talking.\u201d McNeal rapped his fingers on the surface of the desk. \u201cMy team doesn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>Well, there wasn\u2019t exactly much to be talking about.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Here\u2019s how this is going to be handled.\u201d He stabbed a blunt finger in the air toward Todd. \u201cYou start digging into Monroe\u2019s life. See what you can find out about any girlfriends, people with an ax to grind, whatever.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already been doing that. It wasn\u2019t like he was a fresh-faced uniform who didn\u2019t know how to handle a case.</p><p>The finger stabbed in Smith\u2019s direction. \u201cI want the completed autopsy report on Monroe ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any sign of a print on his chest yet?\u201d Todd asked quickly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe killer did a real number on his chest. Seventeen knife wounds.\u201d</p><p>Now that was a lot of rage.</p><p>Usually that much rage was personal.</p><p>\u201cFinish the autopsy. Get me the report.\u201d McNeal\u2019s gaze shot to Colin. \u201cYou talked to Dr. Drake about this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He waved his hand toward the door. \u201cThat\u2019s all\u2014Smith, Brooks, you two can brief me later on your findings. Gyth, stay so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Smith opened her mouth as if to protest. Then she shook her head and mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to hear this, anyway.\u201d Then she marched for the door, head held high.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s gaze followed her, and his lips pulled down into a small frown.</p><p>The door closed behind her with a soft click. No slam. No sign of fury.</p><p>But Todd knew she was angry.</p><p>Smith didn\u2019t like being cut out of a case.</p><p>Neither did he.</p><p>But, unlike Smith, he wasn\u2019t just planning to quietly walk out with his dignity.</p><p>Fuck dignity.</p><p>This was his case. He wasn\u2019t going to be pushed to the wayside again. He was a good cop, damn it. He\u2019d busted his ass for years on the force. Taken two bullets. Back when he\u2019d been on beat, he\u2019d even gotten one of the highest arrest rates on record for the city.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Brooks,\u201d McNeal said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll update you on Dr. Drake\u2019s findings later.\u201d</p><p>Todd didn\u2019t move. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just listen now. Save you from having to rehash it all later.\u201d</p><p>McNeal blinked. \u201cI said that\u2019s all, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>A clear dismissal.</p><p>He was tired of being dismissed, and after the morning he\u2019d already had, he wasn\u2019t about to back down.</p><p>My lover is a demon. I don\u2019t really think these guys can surprise me with anything else after learning that fun fact.</p><p>Todd cast a glance at Colin. Found his partner watching him with a tense, worried expression. \u201cAfter I talk to the captain, I\u2019ll come and brief you,\u201d Colin told him, voice quiet, but his eyes seemed to blaze a warning.</p><p>Colin was trying to save his ass, Todd realized. Going toe-to-toe with the captain probably wasn\u2019t a good idea. Colin obviously thought it wasn\u2019t, and now his partner was trying to smooth things over.</p><p>Pity he wasn\u2019t in the mood for a nice, polite smoothing. He turned his attention back to the captain. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you want me to know about this case?\u201d</p><p>McNeal smiled. A shark\u2019s smile. \u201cOh, come on, now, Brooks, don\u2019t be ridiculous! You\u2019re completely in the loop on this case\u2014\u201d</p><p>And hell wasn\u2019t hot.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I just thought your time would be better spent following other leads\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike with the Night Butcher?\u201d He tossed out.</p><p>The smile dimmed. \u201cI don\u2019t like your tone, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t like being kept in the dark.\u201d He began to pace, unable to contain the swirling energy in his body. \u201cI\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m only catching half of the things happening in this precinct.\u201d In the world. \u201cI\u2019m good at my job. Got enough commendations to plaster the damn wall at my apartment.\u201d He stopped, right next to Colin. \u201cI deserve to know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d Colin\u2019s voice.</p><p>He turn his head fractionally, just enough to meet his hard stare. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I want to know, partner? That this world of ours is fucking full of monsters? And that you\u2019re one of them?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d The question came from McNeal.</p><p>Colin just stared at him. His face was completely blank.</p><p>\u201cSince the night Smith was taken. I followed Colin, long enough to see him change.\u201d</p><p>Colin flinched.</p><p>Todd spared the captain a glance. \u201cThen you called and demanded I come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal rubbed the top of his gleaming head. \u201cI knew you were going after him, but I didn\u2019t realize just how damn close you\u2019d gotten.\u201d McNeal glared at Colin. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t smell him? Hear him? You shifters are supposed to have such keen senses!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d A growl.</p><p>\u201cI watched from a good distance. Used night-vision binoculars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis scent was already on me,\u201d Colin said nearly a second later. \u201cAnd that night, I was more focused on Other things.\u201d</p><p>McNeal watched him with a hooded gaze. \u201cSo how much do you know?\u201d</p><p>Not much. \u201cI know werewolves are real\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves? \u201d McNeal mumbled. \u201cFucking figures.\u201d</p><p>Colin cleared his throat. \u201cAh, we\u2019re generally called shifters\u2014not werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and that demons are, too. I know that place, Paradise Found, is some kind of meeting place for them all.\u201d And that all this shit was still making his head spin. Because now he wondered...how many of the perps he\u2019d busted over the years, how many of the people he\u2019d met\u2014had actually been human? And how many had been something more?</p><p>\u201cSo you know about your little girlfriend, huh?\u201d Colin drawled.</p><p>Todd braced his legs apart as he confronted his partner. \u201cDon\u2019t push me, man. I don\u2019t care how much fur you can grow or how sharp your claws are, I will take you down.\u201d He wasn\u2019t particularly afraid of the big, bad wolf, not anymore. The first, oh, two weeks, yeah, he\u2019d been piss scared. But the fear had soon morphed into anger\u2014anger because his partner should have told him the truth long ago</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna take me down?\u201d Colin shook his head. \u201cAnother partner tried that. He\u2019s dead, and I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cSo how do you feel...knowing all this, Brooks?\u201d McNeal rose and stalked toward them. \u201cDo you think the shifters are evil? The demons are abominations that need to be put down?\u201d</p><p>Cara was no abomination. She was beautiful and sensuous and she made him feel better than he\u2019d felt in years.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>And his partner could be a bastard, but he wasn\u2019t evil...just too furry sometimes. \u201cI feel like a veil has been over my eyes for years, and now I\u2019m finally seeing clearly.\u201d He might not love everything he was seeing, but he wanted to see it all. Good. Bad.</p><p>Human. Shifter. Demon.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more out there than you can imagine. A whole world of supernaturals\u2014 the Other. \u201d McNeal was close now. Barely two feet away. \u201cVampires. Do you know about them? They\u2019re real. They can drain a human dry, kill with a bite. And the demons...you think you know about them? Do you know about the level-ten demons? The ones who can destroy buildings with a blink of their black eyes? Do you know that level-tens are practically immortal? The older they get, the harder it is to kill \u2019em. Hell, some can\u2019t even be killed by mortal weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that makes taking them down a real bitch,\u201d Colin added darkly.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s words were probably meant to scare him. They didn\u2019t. They just made him more curious. He\u2019d been trying to block Cara from his thoughts as best he could while he talked with Smith, McNeal, and Colin about the case, but the gloves were off now. No more pretending.</p><p>They were talking about the creatures that were roaming the city right under the noses of the humans. Cara was one of those creatures. He wanted to know everything he could about this new world and about her. \u201cWhat else is out there?\u201d</p><p>Cara wasn\u2019t a level-ten. She\u2019d said she only had mid-range power. She could make fire. The lady had also said that she could hypnotize humans. Not him, but others.</p><p>\u201cOh, just about any damn thing you can imagine.\u201d McNeal never took his gaze off him. \u201cThe nightmares that wake you up late at night, the ones that make you break out into a cold sweat\u2014the things out there, waiting in the shadows just beyond human sight\u2014</p><p>they\u2019re worse than your bad dreams. A thousand times worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDjinn.\u201d Gyth spoke softly. \u201cWitches. Wizards\u2014\u201d</p><p>Instinct guided him as he faced McNeal. There was something about the guy\u2019s voice, about the way McNeal eyeballed him. \u201cAnd just what are you, Captain?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>McNeal\u2019s expression never wavered. \u201cI\u2019m an overworked cop who hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d have to be dealing with this crap again so soon.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer he wanted. That lick of heat powered his blood, the burst of excitement he got when he came close to breaking a case. Or now, breaking his captain. \u201cYou aren\u2019t human.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t have really questioned the captain\u2019s humanity before. But that had been before...before he\u2019d watched Colin change. Before he\u2019d kissed a demon and touched a paradise he hadn\u2019t known existed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m human. Just with a little something...extra.\u201d A quick glance toward the locked door. \u201cScrew it. If you want to play in the Other world, I\u2019ll put my cards out for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaptain?\u201d The surprise in Colin\u2019s voice was real.</p><p>\u201cHe knows, Gyth. No sense denying anything now. Besides, the way this town is overrun with Other gone bad, you\u2019re goin\u2019 to need his backup on these damn monster cases\u2014even wolves can\u2019t go it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will he back me up?\u201d The question was directed at McNeal, but Colin\u2019s gaze was on Todd.</p><p>So he answered. \u201cI always have, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before.\u201d His eyes were guarded.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, the fact that your ass gets furry doesn\u2019t really change things for me.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019ll still watch your back, just like I expect you to watch mine.\u201d</p><p>A hard nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd no more secrets. I\u2019m sick of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooks...\u201d Now the captain looked worried. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many humans who understand about the paranormals. You can\u2019t just go around talking to anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Did he have \u201cidiot\u201d stamped on his forehead? \u201cI\u2019m learning the rules of this game. It\u2019s gonna take me some time,\u201d</p><p>and a whole lot of adjusting, \u201cbut I\u2019m learning. And I\u2019ve already figured out most folks are like I used to be. They don\u2019t have God\u2019s first clue what\u2019s happening\u2014and I think most of \u2019em would like to keep living in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad you understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d He cocked a brow. \u201cSo what are you, captain? A demon? Do your eyes do that cool black trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVamps can do that, too,\u201d Colin told him. \u201cNot the whole eye, though, not like a demon\u2019s. A vamp\u2019s eyes change when he goes into hunting mode.\u201d</p><p>Good point to know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a charmer,\u201d McNeal said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA charmer.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cIt means I can talk to certain...animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, just what kind of animals?\u201d</p> <p>The captain smiled his shark smile once again. \u201cCome with me for a walk sometime, Detective, and I\u2019ll be happy to show you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d put that on his to-do list. Right after he caught a killer. \u201cRain check, Captain.\u201d He pointed to the file that had been tossed onto the desk. \u201cSo what about our killer? What are we dealing with here?\u201d</p><p>Colin rubbed his fingers over the bridge of his nose. \u201cEmily had a few ideas on that one.\u201d</p><p>Emily? So she was in on this, too?</p><p>McNeal must have guessed his thoughts, because he said, \u201cDr. Drake isn\u2019t exactly who you thought she was, Brooks. She\u2019s human, but gifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychic,\u201d Colin supplied.</p><p>Todd tensed.</p><p>\u201cHer gift only works with paranormals, so Dr. Drake\u2019s patients are generally...\u201d</p><p>Supernaturals. Other. The captain didn\u2019t have to finish his sentence. \u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d McNeal frowned at Colin. \u201cSo just who\u2014what are we facing?\u201d</p><p>A hesitation that lasted nearly a minute, then...\u201cAccording to Em, the most likely suspect is a demon. Based on the body\u2019s appearance and the crime scene, she thinks we might be dealing with a succubus.\u201d</p><p>Succubus. The name was familiar to Todd. He\u2019d heard about a succubus before, and the male version, the incubus. He\u2019d read about them back in college in one of his medieval studies classes that he\u2019d taken, hoping for an easy A, but managing to drag out a low B.</p><p>A succubus was a kind of...sex demon.</p><p>Cara\u2019s image flashed in front of his eyes and an icy spear of awareness pressed right into his heart.</p><p>Oh, shit. No way, she couldn\u2019t be a\u2014</p><p>\u201cSuccubus.\u201d McNeal whistled soundlessly. \u201cMet one of \u2019em once. About ten years ago. Sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He coughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, almost ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Cara was damn well the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen, but that still didn\u2019t mean\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing research on succubi,\u201d Colin said, eyes hard and intent on Todd. \u201cTalked with Em some more, hit the local occult shops right before I came in.\u201d A brief smile. \u201cThose places are always open\u2014works for the clientele, you know.\u201d</p><p>Todd made a mental note to hit the same shops. A bit of research reading was definitely in order.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve learned, the succubi tend to be extremely territorial. It\u2019s rare to find more than a couple in the same city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do we know of a succubus in Atlanta?\u201d McNeal asked.</p><p>Colin looked at Todd. Too much knowledge was in his stare.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI said, do we know of a succubus in Atlanta?\u201d The captain repeated, voice rising.</p><p>The spear drove deeper into his heart and the pain stole his breath for a moment when Colin said, \u201cYeah, we do. Her name\u2019s Cara Maloan, and she was our original suspect in the killings.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s face burned fiery hot, then shot to icy cold as pinpricks flew over his skin. A sex demon.</p><p>\u201cThen get her ass in here, now. \u201d McNeal\u2019s thin lips tightened. \u201cBut be careful. I\u2019ve heard stories. A succubus can steal a man\u2019s mind. Drive him crazy with lust...and kill him as he begs for her touch.\u201d</p><p>The captain\u2019s warning came too late for Todd.</p><p>A steady rage began to burn inside him. \u201cCara\u2019s not the killer,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Grim understanding was in the one word. \u201cBrooks\u2014what the hell have you done to my case?\u201d</p><p>He met that gray stare without so much as a blink. \u201cCara isn\u2019t a killer. Her alibis checked out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if those alibis were given by humans, she could\u2019ve planted the damn suggestions! Shit, Brooks, she\u2019s a demon, you can\u2019t trust her\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wanted to. \u201cI saw her reaction to the news of House\u2019s death. The woman hurt. She\u2019s not a killer.\u201d His gut told him that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your dick talking,\u201d McNeal snapped.</p><p>Todd stepped forward, body tense.</p><p>McNeal glared right back at him. \u201cGyth...\u201d He never took his eyes off Todd. \u201cBring her in.\u201d</p><p>He felt, rather than saw, his partner\u2019s hesitation. \u201cHer story checked out, Captain\u2014and the alibis\u2014they were given by demons and a witch, not humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike demons and witches don\u2019t lie.\u201d McNeal shook his head. \u201cI want Ms. Firon here to-damn-day. \u201d</p><p>Todd realized that his hands were clenched into fists. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGyth\u2014get out of here.\u201d McNeal barked the order, then glared at Todd a full minute before saying, \u201cBrooks, you\u2019d better start talking\u2014fast\u2014and let me know why I should keep you on this case. If Cara\u2019s guilty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not.\u201d Gut, psychic edge, whatever the hell it was\u2014every instinct he possessed screamed her innocence.</p><p>The woman had lied to him, though. A sex demon. Shit. She should have told him\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d damn well better prove she\u2019s not involved in these killings\u2014convince me, or your lover is going to find her ass in jail.\u201d</p><p>She was back in the station again. Back in the same dingy interrogation room. Sitting at the same scarred table and sitting in the same chair that tilted slightly to the right.</p><p>And Cara was pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Detective Todd Brooks in here?\u201d She demanded, glaring at the stony visage of his partner.</p><p>Gyth shrugged. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Screw his questions\u2014and screw him. \u201cDoes he know what you\u2019ve done? That you dragged me out of my house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolitely escorted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandcuffed me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your own protection\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut my hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to that sample\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd put me back in this shitty room\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cInterrogation rooms aren\u2019t supposed to be pretty.\u201d</p><p>Her nails tapped against the table top. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I was under the impression we\u2019d already done this dance before. My alibis checked out, remember? I even got a nice apology from your partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left out a few facts when you were here before.\u201d He pulled out the chair on the opposite side of the table. Flipped it around.</p><p>Straddled it as he sat down.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like the fact that you\u2019re a demon. You didn\u2019t mention that little tidbit the first time around.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told her secret. \u201cTodd...discussed that with you?\u201d It hurt. In the heart that others had said she didn\u2019t have. To think that Todd had run straight from her bed to the station so that he could tell his buddies what a freak of nature she was\u2014</p><p>Cara straightened her shoulders. \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s the best idea,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Like she gave half a rat\u2019s ass what he thought. Her nails scraped over the old wood. \u201cLook, shifter\u2014\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed. \u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see Todd. If I don\u2019t see him, I\u2019m done talking. Done being the good citizen and putting up with all this bullshit.\u201d She\u2019d call Niol, and he\u2019d make the cops sorry they\u2019d even thought to question her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess with me. I\u2019ve got friends\u2014</p><p>you can\u2019t even imagine how strong they are. Not even in your darkest dreams.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cYou threatening me?\u201d</p><p>Cara shrugged. She was done talking. Unless she got to see Todd.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been watching you.\u201d Gyth pointed his index finger toward the mirror. \u201cListening to you.\u201d</p><p>Not a newsflash. She could feel his stare. He\u2019d been in and out of the other room since she\u2019d been dumped in interrogation. But she didn\u2019t want to admit her knowledge to the cop, so she\u2019d asked her questions\u2014</p><p>And gotten more damn enraged by the moment.</p><p>Todd should have his ass in there. What game was he playing now? What\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf he wanted to talk to you, he\u2019d be here\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door shoved open before Gyth could finish his sentence. Banged back against the wall with a thud. Todd stood in the doorway, face flushed, eyes glinting.</p><p>He looked furious. Body tight. Hands clenched.</p><p>Just the way she felt. \u201cBeen telling stories, have you, Todd?\u201d She asked softly, tilting her chin back just the slightest bit. Seeing him again stirred an ache inside her. The hunger hadn\u2019t abated. The need was still there, even though he\u2019d turned on her.</p><p>She could be such an idiot sometimes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to tell him. Gyth already knew.\u201d He slammed the door shut with his heel, then stalked toward her.</p><p>Ah. Her gaze darted back to the other cop. Shifter nose.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019d you know about me?\u201d Gyth asked.</p><p>A shrug. Not like it was confidential information or anything. \u201cWhen you smelled my pheromones, you stepped back. Demons, humans, vamps\u2014they all come closer.\u201d</p><p>A growl sounded. It didn\u2019t come from the shifter, but from Todd. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a lot of...experience luring men, do you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like his tone. Not. One. Bit.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a sex demon, right? So screwing men, draining them, even killing them for sensual power\u2014that\u2019s just right up your alley, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>What the hell was happening? Was this some really nightmarish game of bad cop, bad cop? What had happened to her tender lover?</p><p>He\u2019d left when he found out what I truly am.</p><p>The air in the room thickened around her. \u201cI don\u2019t like the term \u2018sex demon.\u2019\u201d Her head cocked to the right. \u201cI find it offensive.\u201d</p><p>As offensive as she found the rest of his words. She\u2019d made love with him the night before. She hadn\u2019t just been screwing around.</p><p>Her fingers flattened against the table. Deep groves indented the surface, courtesy of her nails. Her gaze held Todd\u2019s. \u201cAnd I am not, not, going to apologize for being what I am.\u201d She\u2019d been born a demon. Unchangeable fact. She was a demon, one that, after she hit adulthood, needed a certain powerful energy to continue living. Not her fault. Just the hand of fate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to apologize for killing?\u201d Gyth asked. \u201cDamn ballsy of you.\u201d</p><p>Now she had to be careful. \u201cAnd just who is it that you think I killed? I\u2019ve already told you that I had nothing to do with Michael\u2019s death, or the others you mentioned and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell us that Simon Battle liked to come to Paradise Found and listen to you sing.\u201d Todd was at the edge of the table.</p><p>Hands fisted. Brows low over his eyes, and jaw clenched tight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?

She inhaled sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he knew you,\u201d Todd told her. \u201cIn fact, according to the guy\u2019s friends, he made it a habit to go and catch your show once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been singing at Paradise Found for a little over two months\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he caught one of your shows every week.\u201d</p><p>Cara studied the photo, tried to block the pain that shook her. The man\u2019s eyes were closed. There was nothing particularly familiar about the guy. He was attractive, with strong features and a faint dimple in his chin. His hair was brushed back from his high forehead.</p><p>Yeah, a good-looking, dead guy. One she didn\u2019t know. Her eyes lifted back to Todd\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at Paradise when I sing.\u201d</p> <p>Gyth swore.</p><p>She ignored him, continuing, \u201cYou know how packed that place can get. With the lights on the stage, it\u2019s not like I can see every man in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they can all see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, began to snap, \u201cThat\u2019s just what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d a human get inside Paradise so often?\u201d Gyth demanded, cutting across Todd\u2019s angry words.</p> <p>Cara blew out the breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cHumans get in all the time. Those who know about us sometimes like to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Niol lets them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as no one gets seriously hurt in his place, Niol tolerates just about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him pretty well.\u201d Todd\u2019s voice was controlled now, too controlled.</p><p>Cara nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Niol wasn\u2019t an incubus. Just a full-blooded, deadly dangerous warrior...who happened to be a level-ten demon.</p><p>He\u2019d also been her sister\u2019s lover. Years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Gyth pushed another photo in front of her.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t enjoy looking at photos of dead men. Cara spared a brief glance for the still features of the handsome man, felt pity stir in her heart. \u201cAm I supposed to know him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis Walters. Until recently, he lived on your block. We found out he moved about five months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I moved in less than four.\u201d She wanted to jump up, to scream and rage at Todd. How could he be doing this? Did he really think she\u2019d murdered these men? How the hell could he go from making love to her to\u2014to treating her like a prime suspect?</p><p>She wanted to punch him. She wanted to scream.</p><p>Damn it, she even felt stupid tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>This shit sucked!</p><p>\u201cTell me, Cara...\u201d Todd\u2019s tone was so sharp it could have cut glass. \u201cCan a succubus really kill her lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still alive, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She flared, driven to the edge. She was about to snap. One more smartass comment from her lover and\u2014</p><p>\u201cCan a succubus kill?\u201d</p><p>Cara shot to her feet. \u201cAnyone can kill under the right circumstances.\u201d He should know that. After all, he\u2019d admitted his own crimes to her.</p><p>\u201cBut what about killing without damaging the body? Without breaking the skin at all?\u201d Gyth asked.</p><p>Her stare never left Todd. \u201cWhat am I? Your prime suspect or some kind of expert on demons?\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s lips tightened and gaze dropped to her lips. She saw hunger flicker in those eyes, need. Anger. \u201cYou\u2019re both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a damn jerk.\u201d Why did she always have to fall for the wrong man? And, shit\u2014these questions, they weren\u2019t just about her being a suspect, Cara realized with a sinking heart. Todd and Gyth thought the killer was a succubus.</p><p>And they knew she was a succubus.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that succubi are territorial? That only one or two hunt in a city at a time?\u201d Gyth just kept pressing with his questions.</p><p>Firing one after the other.</p><p>And then she realized what they were doing. Todd was the distraction. Gyth was the real threat. He was hitting her, trying to uncover any secrets she might have.</p><p>Fine. If they wanted some secrets, she\u2019d tell them. Nothing too dangerous, of course. But...\u201cYeah, we\u2019re a bunch of possessive bitches.\u201d A faint shrug. \u201cUsually one, maybe two in a city\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are in the city now?\u201d Gyth fired.</p><p>She paused. Okay, this was gonna look bad, but she\u2019d give them the truth. \u201cAs far as I know...I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p><p>The two men shared a dark look.</p><p>Hell. Jeez, Cara, why not just ask your lover to lock you up and toss that key away next time?</p><p>\u201cAs far as you know...\u201d Todd repeated carefully. \u201cDoes that mean another succubus could be in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMaybe. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sense each other, don\u2019t you?\u201d Gyth\u2019s question was hard.</p><p>\u201cJust like you\u2019d know another shifter.\u201d She pushed back the hair that wanted to tumble over her eyes. \u201cLook, it\u2019s possible another succubus is in Atlanta\u2014if she\u2019s stayed far enough away from me, I wouldn\u2019t have sensed her, so I can\u2019t say with complete certainty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the men?\u201d Todd asked quietly.</p><p>Cara frowned. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncubi.\u201d</p><p>Oh. A shrug. \u201cYeah, some of \u2019em are in Atlanta.\u201d The incubi outnumbered the succubi nine to one, so they\u2019d had to learn long ago how to share the prime cities. It had been a real bloodbath at first. Too many men. Too much aggressive hunting instinct bred into the blood.</p><p>She smiled at Todd, a deliberate, seductive smile, and let her scent out, full-force.</p><p>The shifter swore. \u201cMan, be careful.\u201d</p><p>Too late. Her fragrance was in the air, seducing, and she saw the telling twitch of Todd\u2019s nostrils.</p><p>Cara put her hand on his chest. Just as she\u2019d done last night, when no clothes separated her from his flesh. His heart thundered beneath her touch. Not just from anger. The desire was there\u2014on his face and in his eyes. \u201cPoor detective. Wanting something that you hate.\u201d</p><p>His hand flew up. His fingers locked around her wrist in a hard, steely grip. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you fear me.\u201d And suspected her of murder, apparently, again. Damn it. Could things not just work out well for her one time?</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I don\u2019t fear you.\u201d He leaned in closer to her. \u201cI\u2019m pissed as hell\u2014 you should have told me the truth\u2014all of the truth, damn it\u2014 about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ah, he meant the little succubus part of her demonhood. \u201cI would have told you\u2014you didn\u2019t give me enough time before you ran out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run! Shit! I had a job waiting on me, fucking cases. I was coming back to you tonight\u2014but then I found out a succubus is killing in the city and oh, guess what, my girlfriend just happens to be a succubus\u2014\u201d</p><p>His girlfriend? Okay, she pushed that part aside, for now. \u201cTodd\u2014what makes you think the killer\u2019s a succubus? We don\u2019t kill.\u201d</p><p>Anymore. \u201cWe get along with humans, we don\u2019t hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody sure as hell is,\u201d Gyth murmured.</p><p>\u201cTell me it isn\u2019t you,\u201d Todd said, the words fierce, cutting her like a too-sharp knife.</p><p>Did he truly think she\u2019d gone on some kind of sex spree and killed those three men?</p><p>His skin was warm against hers. The scent of his body reminded her\u2014too much\u2014of the pleasures they\u2019d shared. But his eyes held secrets...and suspicions?</p><p>Fuck him.</p><p>\u201cSo was it a game?\u201d The words burst from her as the anger raged past the pain. \u201c Coming to Paradise, dancing with me, going home with me\u2014was it all some trick? You still think I\u2019m a killer and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a sex demon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccubus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just confirmed that your kind aren\u2019t exactly tripping over each other in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. Didn\u2019t. Kill. Them!\u201d But if they knew a succubus was involved...\u201cAnd you know what, Detective, it sounds to me like someone has been feeding you information about my kind. What\u2019s the deal? You got your own demon expert somewhere around here?\u201d Her gaze jumped to the mirrored wall. \u201cMaybe right there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The drawl came from Gyth.</p><p>Her gaze jerked back to Todd. He stared down at her, too handsome, too fierce.</p><p>Too human. Humans and their suspicions. Always so quick to judge.</p><p>Her temper snapped. \u201cArrest me or let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d Todd shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, then you\u2019d damn well better\u2014\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked a moment, as if he struggled to find words then, \u201cI-I believe you, Cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gyth demanded. \u201cBrooks, are you crazy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a killer.\u201d He cut across Gyth\u2019s snarl with one of his own. \u201cI fucking told you and McNeal that already\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. What?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in here now because procedure demanded it, but Cara\u2019s alibis checked out, she\u2019s cooperated, and she\u2019s not a damn killer!\u201d</p><p>Okay, the man was making her head swim. \u201cIf you knew I was innocent, why did you put me through this shit?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his thumb toward the mirror. \u201cSo the asshole in there would know you were innocent, too.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>He faced the mirror. \u201cReactions, right, Captain? That\u2019s what you wanted to see. Well, judge her. I say she\u2019s innocent. If you think she\u2019s a murderer, then come in now.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t come in. The words flew through Cara\u2019s head.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then a curse from Gyth. \u201cFucking ballsy.\u201d</p><p>Todd grunted then glanced back at her. \u201cI have to do my job. Always. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to play catch-up, fast. So, Todd had been forced to question her by his captain? He still believed she was innocent?</p><p>But...from the look on his face, he was pissed at her.</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t tell him I was a succubus.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cYou had to be questioned, Cara.\u201d Todd spoke, voice softer now, more controlled. \u201cAnd you had to come in because, hell, Cara, I really do want your help.\u201d He glanced at Gyth. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d</p><p>Her knees were shaking. \u201cJust what do you want me to do?\u201d Her anger had cooled a bit, replaced by confusion, fear, and other emotions that she didn\u2019t want to analyze too much.</p><p>Todd sighed and the look on his face told her she wasn\u2019t going to be loving what came next. \u201cWell, first, baby, we\u2019re gonna need you to look at a body.\u201d</p><p>No, not loving it at all.</p><p>He hated battering her with questions. Hated watching the play of stark emotions run across her face.</p><p>For a few moments, she\u2019d looked almost broken. Then the anger\u2014no, rage\u2014had kicked in.</p><p>And the lady had looked like she wanted to kick his ass.</p><p>Not the normal pattern for a killer\u2014he sure as hell hoped McNeal realized that fact, and got off his back.</p><p>The captain had wanted to yank him from the case the minute he\u2019d learned about Todd\u2019s night with Cara. He\u2019d argued for an hour with McNeal, listing every reason, five times, why Cara couldn\u2019t be the killer.</p><p>Damn, but he hoped he wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>His gut said he should trust her.</p><p>His cock said he should take her.</p><p>And his heart said he was in serious trouble.</p><p>He was out on a limb now with the captain. A very thin limb that could break at any point, but the fact was, if Cara wasn\u2019t the killer, then seeing as how it looked like another succubus was on the loose, she\u2019d be the best person to guide them in their hunt.</p><p>Provided, of course, that she was feeling like helping out the long arm of the law.</p><p>\u201cI need you to see something on the body,\u201d Todd told her softly, trying to pull back the anger that flared within him.</p><p>Anger because she\u2019d lied to him\u2014Christ, a fucking sex demon.</p><p>Every man in the world probably wanted her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the sharing type.</p><p>And just how many other humans had she bewitched with her seduction? Was he just another in a long line for her? While she was\u2014well, much more to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cara\u2019s cry was hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t know about your idea of a good time, Todd, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what my idea of a good time is.\u201d He wanted her then so badly he ached.</p><p>And she still looked angry as all hell.</p><p>Oh, yeah, he\u2019d royally fucked things up.</p><p>No choice.</p><p>Proving her absolute innocence was paramount now.</p><p>Keeping away the other assholes on this earth who wanted her\u2014well, that would be his goal number two.</p><p>Her plump lips parted as she drew in a deep breath, and if Gyth hadn\u2019t been glaring at him, Todd would have leaned forward and kissed her right then.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned forward another inch anyway. Just a breath of space away from her delectable mouth. He\u2019d never seen a mouth that sexy before, and he knew it tasted as good as it looked. Pushed too far, he taunted, \u201cBut isn\u2019t that why you sent your sweet smell out to me? Because you wanted me...to want you.\u201d And he did. Didn\u2019t matter to him that the lady was dangerous. A huge unknown element. He. Wanted. Her. Period. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And when this case was finished, he planned to take a few days off and spend them in sheer wild sexual bliss with her.</p><p>Provided that he hadn\u2019t pissed her off too much in the meantime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 shit. \u201d</p> <p>Her mouth even looked good when she said that.</p><p>Sexy demon.</p><p>Sex demon.</p><p>\u201cI really do need your help, Cara,\u201d he said, trying to take his mind off just what being a sex demon entailed. He didn\u2019t want to think of her with another man. Other men.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a virgin. He\u2019d had more than his share of willing partners, so he sure as hell didn\u2019t expect Cara to be pure as the driven snow.</p> <p>But he did not want to think about her with other men. Not even for one fucking moment.</p><p>\u201cRein in the scent.\u201d He reinforced the order by tightening his fingers around her delicate wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t want the cops in the bull pen going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I could make them do,\u201d she told him, voice rumbling.</p><p>Oh, he was starting to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cThe last victim, Thomas Monroe, was stabbed.\u201d Gyth\u2019s harsh words snapped Todd back to the case.</p><p>Cara blinked. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Not if you truly think the killer\u2019s a succubus, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>They were pretty damn certain that was who they were after.</p><p>\u201cA death like that,\u201d Cara continued, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t yield a succubus any power.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught. \u201cExplain that to me, nice and slow.\u201d \u2019Cause he sure as hell didn\u2019t know what she meant, but he knew he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cLook, killing isn\u2019t really our way.\u201d Her lips twisted. \u201cAnymore, okay? Once upon a time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would have been when?\u201d Gyth asked.</p><p>\u201cMiddle Ages.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She read his expression easily. \u201cWhile I personally wasn\u2019t around then, demons always have been. Get used to that fact, Todd.</p> <p>Your life will be so much easier once you start realizing there is much more to the world than you thought.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Or maybe things would just be five times harder.</p><p>He\u2019d bet his paycheck on option two.</p><p>\u201cA lot of demons killed back them. Succubi got a reputation.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d read a bit about that earlier. Right after the captain had chewed his ass out and he\u2019d made a frantic trip to the occult bookstore two streets over.</p><p>\u201cA lot of innocents were killed back then, blamed for what the demons were doing. The attacks also brought attention to the Other. Not really something that my kind wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the demons decided to take a break from killing?\u201d Not likely.</p><p>\u201cThere were some ancient demons. Those who\u2019ve been on earth from nearly the beginning. They don\u2019t rule over anyone, but back then, they\u2014they kept an order, so to speak.\u201d She nibbled on her lower lip. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about those guys in years, don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re still around.\u201d</p><p>Great. So if the big bosses weren\u2019t controlling folks anymore, then he\u2019d probably keep finding demons with appetites for murder.</p><p>\u201cBut long ago, those guys sent out the cazadores del alma.\u201d</p><p>Gyth stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Todd realized he was still holding Cara\u2019s wrist. Stroking her pulse point with his thumb.</p><p>He dropped her hand. Put some space between them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re soul-hunters. Born of witch and demon, those guys are incredibly powerful. Have few vulnerabilities. And they\u2019re basically the boogeymen who come after Other when things get out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo these boogeymen ever go after humans?\u201d Gyth asked, eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d Her brows lowered. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible, though.\u201d</p><p>Todd was trying to assimilate the information as quickly as he could. \u201cSo let me get this straight. Succubi stopped their sex death party in the Middle Ages because the cazadores del alma were sicced on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re saying none of your kind has killed since then?\u201d Not buying it.</p><p>Cara hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m saying succubi don\u2019t normally kill. Not anymore. There\u2019s no need. The sexual culture today is so much more open. Hell, we can get a little rush of energy just by going into a bar\u2014\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned. \u201cOr by singing to a hungry crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as humans are there, yes,\u201d she said\u2014and did a faint flush color her cheeks? \u201cIf there aren\u2019t humans in the crowd, it won\u2019t work. Demon power doesn\u2019t infuse us.\u201d A slanted look at Gyth. \u201cShifter strength can work, just not as well.\u201d</p><p>His head was aching. Temples pounding. And he\u2019d thought working the cases before was tough. \u201cFuck it. We\u2019re going to see the bodies.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, sending the blond locks flying. \u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara, I need your help. House needs you\u2014just look at \u2019em, okay? I wouldn\u2019t ask if it weren\u2019t damn important.\u201d And just the idea of letting her into the Crypt was unorthodox as hell, but he was desperate. With every word she\u2019d spoken, he\u2019d become more convinced that a succubus was out in Atlanta, killing. And to catch a murderer, or a sex demon, well, he just might have to use...a sex demon.</p><p>The knowledge Cara could provide to him was priceless, and he wasn\u2019t about to let her slip away. Not when he needed her so much.</p><p>For the case.</p><p>And for...well, hell, he just needed her.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cTodd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara, I need you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held his. One breath of time. Two. Then, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Relief had his shoulders dropping.</p><p>Smith had wanted someone with more \u201cexpertise\u201d to look at the print on House\u2019s body.</p><p>Looked like she\u2019d just gotten the perfect expert.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Danny McNeal asked quietly as he and Dr. Emily Drake watched the threesome file out of the interrogation room.</p><p>Emily stared through the thin mirror. \u201cI think I\u2019m not going to be able to help you very much on this case.\u201d Her palms were sweating, but her voice was perfectly controlled.</p><p>\u201cCould that woman, Cara Maloan, be a killer?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question.\u201d Her shoulders were stiff as she turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>A line appeared between his brows. \u201cWhat? Why can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor-client confidentiality.\u201d The words were soft.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s eyes widened, then, \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Nice sum up, but McNeal had always seemed to possess a special talent with words.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go inside,\u201d she said softly. When Todd had called him out, she\u2019d felt the electric arc in the air as McNeal tensed.</p><p>A growl. \u201cCan\u2019t prove she\u2019s involved yet.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd Brooks has never been wrong on a case before.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d never had one like this before, either.</p><p>Emily glanced back over her shoulder just as the door shut behind Colin. Damn, but this case had taken a bad turn. Cara was a sweet woman. Smart. Unquestionably beautiful.</p><p>But sad. So very sad on the inside.</p><p>And, even though she couldn\u2019t tell McNeal, Cara was also a woman with the complete capacity for killing. Emily had learned about Cara\u2019s darker side months ago\u2014when the succubus had finally confessed about her sister\u2019s murder...and the ensuing death of her sister\u2019s lover.</p><p>Emily\u2019s fingers curled into fists. She sure hoped Todd knew what he was doing. Colin wouldn\u2019t slip up\u2014he\u2019d never let his guard down around the other woman.</p><p>But Emily was trained to observe other people. To read their emotions, and when she\u2019d watched Todd, she\u2019d seen the hunger in his eyes. The need for Cara.</p><p>A need that could prove to be very, very dangerous.</p><p>A need that had proved fatal for another.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cAh, not so fast, Gyth.\u201d Todd brought his hand up, and barred the entrance to the elevator.</p><p>Cara frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing now, Brooks?\u201d The shifter glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cGetting time with my lady. We need to talk, alone. \u201d The words held an unmistakable edge.</p><p>Gyth\u2019s face hardened. \u201cIf the captain finds out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can call my ass out again\u2014but I\u2019m talking to Cara now. Take the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Todd stepped back and the doors slid closed, blocking the sight of the shifter\u2019s stony visage. Then he turned around and locked his stare right on her.</p><p>All alone now. She looked at him and said, \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Todd blinked. \u201cCara, I told you, I had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have warned me!\u201d She wanted to hit him, hard. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to let that jerk shifter haul me off to the interrogation room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to fight like hell to stay on the case, Cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said I was clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were! Baby, I wouldn\u2019t have slipped into your bed otherwise.\u201d Blazing eyes. \u201cBut then we found out that we weren\u2019t just looking for your run-of-the-mill killer\u2014we\u2019re looking for a succubus\u2014and you\u2019re the only one in the area who fits that bill.\u201d</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He stepped closer to her. His left hand shot out. Punched a red button on the elevator control panel.</p><p>The big box shuddered to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWh-what did you do?\u201d But she knew.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clearing the air here, Cara.\u201d He exhaled heavily. \u201cThe captain knows about our relationship. Hell, Gyth knew I\u2019d been with you the minute I walked into the station.\u201d</p><p>The quiet words rocked through her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make a habit of talking about my sex life.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cI came in today because I was on duty. Apparently, Gyth has one hell of a nose. He\u201d\u2014Todd\u2019s jaw clenched\u2014\u201csmelled you on me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, those two-faced shifters could do that.</p><p>\u201cKissing and telling\u2014that\u2019s not my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I\u2019m not your usual \u2018style,\u2019 now am I? You think I\u2019m some kind of freak because I happened to be born a demon and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a damn freak!\u201d She winced at his yell. \u201cOr a monster or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, then?\u201d</p><p>His mouth snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I? What am I to you? A suspect? An itch that you want to scratch? A\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine!\u201d Nearly a roar.</p><p>She shook her head and wondered if her ears would stop ringing soon.</p><p>He grabbed her, crushing her against him. \u201cI hate this case. I hate bringing you in. I hate seeing you scared and angry. I hate wanting to rip my partner apart because he questions you\u2014and I hate myself because I have to stand there and watch\u2014because if I go too easy on you, the captain will sure as hell suspect you\u2019re involved\u2014and that you\u2019re using your sex demon powers to slip into my mind and make me weak!\u201d</p><p>Wow. She knew her eyes had to be wide\u2014and that her mouth was hanging open in surprise. \u201cTodd, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the case, baby, then there\u2019s you and me.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was the way it should have been\u2014but...\u201cI keep finding myself in the middle of your case, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it fucking sucks.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea. He wasn\u2019t the one who kept popping up as a suspect.</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d Almost desperate. His hands were too tight on her. \u201cChrist, woman, I\u2014\u201d His mouth crashed onto hers. Rough, Demanding.</p><p>So right.</p><p>A hot flush of excitement spread through her. She was still angry with him, she didn\u2019t like the way he\u2019d confronted her during the interrogation, but\u2014ah, damn it, yes she still wanted the guy.</p><p>The sensual power flowing from Todd in waves wrapped around her.</p><p>The man sure had some kind of potent sexual energy.</p><p>And she was the one who was supposed to be dangerous.</p><p>He ripped his mouth from hers, breath rasping out. He freed her hands, only to raise his arms and slap his palms on the wall behind her head, effectively caging her.</p><p>She tasted him on her tongue\u2014and wanted more. \u201cA-aren\u2019t you nervous?\u201d She asked, wetting her lips and watching his gaze drop with a helpless surge of pleasure. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re all alone here with a demon. There\u2019s really no telling what I could do to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sure gone running fast enough this morning.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re all alone with a man who wants you so badly he can hardly think.\u201d His mouth hovered over her lips. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d The question was whispered right back to her.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>His scent surrounded her, just as she knew the tempting lure of her pheromones surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cIs any of it real?\u201d He asked, and there was a spark of unmistakable anger in his eyes. \u201cThe lust, the need...is it all a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before.\u201d She hadn\u2019t lied then, wouldn\u2019t lie now. Screw her pride. \u201cI want you. Have from the moment I opened my door to you.\u201d Her head shook, a little sadly. \u201cThat\u2019s no trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about how I feel?\u201d His right hand dropped to capture her jaw. His thumb brushed over her lip. Pushed just past the edge of her teeth. \u201cAre you making me want you?\u201d</p><p>Her sex clenched with hunger just from his touch. He stood so close to her that she could feel the hard ridge of his aroused cock pressing against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand moved, drifting down her neck until his fingers rested lightly over the pounding pulse in her throat. She tried to answer him as honestly as she could, saying, \u201cMy pheromones, my scent, they\u2019re designed to lure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the way you smell like sex and paradise? Yeah, baby, that\u2019s a damn big lure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t release the full scent with you. I mean, I have, when we were making love, there was no way to stop it then, but now, and before, I\u2019ve tried to control it.\u201d Okay, she\u2019d let it slip in the interrogation room\u2014but he\u2019d pushed her too far. And he\u2019d certainly caught the scent plenty of other times\u2014but not the full onslaught.</p> <p>\u201cJust the scent of you arouses men.\u201d His voice was thick with tension.</p><p>\u201cIt can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t using your magic on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to hypnotize you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Damn, but she wanted the man to kiss her. That mouth of his was so close\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the dreams, Cara? Those sweet, wild-as-hell dreams I had?\u201d His fingers eased over her collarbone. Slid down the vee at the top of her shirt and paused in the valley between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He brushed open the edges of her shirt. Slid his fingertips under the lace of her black bra. Her flesh was so sensitive that when he found her nipple, she gasped with the pleasure that arched through her.</p><p>Even as she realized that the seductress was being seduced.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to what?\u201d he whispered, then his mouth finally took hers. Lips touched. Pressed. His tongue thrust deep. Tangled with hers.</p><p>Only to withdraw too soon.</p> <p>He gazed down at her, and there was no mistaking his need. Or her own.</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you mean to do?\u201d His voice was gravel rough.</p><p>She could still taste him on her tongue. \u201cCome to you, that way. I-I...in the past, I\u2019ve had to focus my power. Project.\u201d Hunt.</p><p>\u201cWhen I closed my eyes, I just went to you.\u201d And it had been wonderful.</p><p>\u201cIt was all real then?\u201d His fingers strummed her tight nipple.</p><p>\u201cYes, in a-a sense.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cThe pleasure was real, but it was just a dream.\u201d She hadn\u2019t actually been in his room.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t felt the warm, naked contours of his body.</p><p>Well, until last night, anyway.</p> <p>His fingers stilled on her breast. \u201cHow many other men have dreamed of you?\u201d He growled the question at her.</p><p>Anger was in his tone. But so was...hurt? Cara lifted her hands. Curled her fingers over the hard muscles in his arms. \u201cThey don\u2019t matter. The only one that matters now is you.\u201d She meant that.</p><p>Dreams, fantasies, they were like wisps of smoke. Being with Todd, it was real, he was real, and the way he made her feel\u2014</p><p>Like a real woman.</p><p>Not just a demon.</p><p>It was her turn to stroke his jaw. The faint sting of stubble rasped along her palm. \u201cI want to be with you. Not the cop and the demon.\u201d She was tired of the allegations. Suspicions. \u201cJust the man and the woman.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t possible, but, damn it, something was between them.</p><p>And she wanted to find out just what it was.</p><p>Could be hard, hot lust. A lust that would burn out with the pounding mating of their bodies.</p><p>But maybe it would be more than lust. That elusive something more she\u2019d searched for so long.</p><p>Cara rose just a bit on her tiptoes. Wrapped her hand around the back of his neck and urged his face closer to her. Their lips met, mouths open. Need burning. She kissed him with all the raging passion in her, and he met her, kissing back, full force.</p><p>When the elevator lurched, she didn\u2019t pay it any attention. She ignored the soft ding of a bell and enjoyed the slow thrust of his tongue and the skilled play of his fingers on her nipple.</p><p>There was a soft swish, and Todd hurriedly stepped back from her, pulling his hand and mouth away with a muffled curse.</p><p>Cara realized then that they\u2019d made it to the basement. The elevator had started moving on its own. Damn it.</p><p>Todd glanced out of the elevator. His back was ramrod straight. \u201cNo one\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t particularly care.</p><p>But when he stepped from the elevator, her eyes narrowed and she followed him. \u201cTodd\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned down at her. \u201cI\u2019m always a cop.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in his voice made her stomach knot.</p><p>\u201cThe cop and the man, they aren\u2019t separate for me. I do my job, twenty-four-seven. I live this job\u2014and I want to trust you, but\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>But. She felt the word hit her like a slap. \u201cI thought we were past this. You said you didn\u2019t think I was a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to trust you.\u201d The words seemed to be ripped from him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me the truth about yourself until just hours ago\u2014and even then, you didn\u2019t tell me everything. I had to get the details from Gyth.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d been afraid he\u2019d turn away from her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d She had to swallow to ease the dryness in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I don\u2019t\u2014and you haven\u2019t told me.\u201d A door opened near the end of the hallway, and from the corner of her eye, Cara saw Gyth exit what she figured was a stairwell. The words snapped out fast as Todd demanded, \u201cTell me this, baby, are the demon and the woman really separate for you?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Her expression must have answered for her because he nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d Todd wasn\u2019t touching her now. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cWe are who we are, Cara. No changing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted to change.\u201d She\u2019d never longed to be human.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>\u201cTake me as I am, and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>The grated words had her blinking in surprise. Was he saying\u2014</p><p>He kissed her, hard. \u201cAnd stay the hell out of anyone else\u2019s dreams, baby.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, Gyth was there. Glaring at her and Todd, with his nostrils flaring. A moment later, another door opened, one that brought her the scent of death and decay, mixed with bleach and the harsh stench of chemicals.</p><p>A tall, thin woman with coffee cream skin\u2014a woman so beautiful Cara doubted she was human\u2014stepped into the hallway. She frowned when she saw them.</p><p>\u201cSmith, just the woman we wanted to see,\u201d Todd called out.</p><p>The woman wore light green scrubs. Behind her, Cara heard the sound of jazz music drifting from the open door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 a break, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe need to look at the bodies.\u201d</p><p>A stare that was as dark as night locked on Cara. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Todd raised a brow. \u201cShe\u2019s the expert you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, Smith? You said you were out of your \u2018element\u2019\u2014well, trust me, for Cara\u2014this is definitely her area of expertise.\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s gaze darted to Gyth. \u201cOne of yours, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure as hell isn\u2019t!\u201d Todd snapped, just as Cara asked blankly, \u201cOne of his what?\u201d</p><p>Gyth marched to the doctor\u2019s side. Whispered to her. Cara caught the familiar \u201csuccubus\u201d and the equally familiar \u201cdangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for whispers,\u201d Todd said, grabbing her hand and pulling Cara toward the door. \u201cOkay. I know what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ve been a blind idiot, but I get it now. I get it. \u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s stare was solemn. \u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot. You\u2019re just human, and I\u2019m beginning to think that we\u2019re pretty damn rare.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but the doctor was very much mistaken. \u201cActually,\u201d Cara murmured, \u201cat the last count,\u201d unofficial though it had been, \u201chumans outnumber supernaturals two hundred and fifty-four thousand to one.\u201d Give or take a bit.</p><p>Smith didn\u2019t look particularly pleased or impressed by this bit of news. But after a moment, she turned around and marched back into the slightly chilled room.</p><p>Back to where the bodies waited.</p><p>Cara pulled in a deep gulp of air, tasted death, and knew this wasn\u2019t about to be pretty.</p><p>Cara\u2019s skin still seemed too pale when she crossed the threshold of the Crypt.</p><p>The impulse to comfort her, to wrap his hands around her delicate shoulders and pull her close, was strong. As strong as the impulse to kiss her had been in the elevator.</p><p>His shoulder brushed against hers, a subtle gesture to let her know that he was there.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t facing this alone.</p><p>Smith kept glancing at Cara. Then at Colin. Then Cara. The woman looked nervous and...angry.</p><p>Colin had told him the full truth about Smith\u2019s abduction earlier. He knew that one of the Other had kidnapped her and tortured her. Before that horrible experience, Smith had no idea that any creatures like shifters or demons really existed.</p><p>It had been a brutal introduction for her. One that she had apparently not recovered from yet.</p><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t really blame the woman. If he\u2019d been held captive by a sadistic psychopath who also happened to be a damn powerful supernatural being, well, he would have freaked, too.</p><p>Not that Smith had freaked, per se. The lady was far too controlled for that. But she\u2019d changed. No denying it. Shut down.</p><p>Blocked herself off.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to live that way.</p><p>No one could. Not and stay sane. He knew. He\u2019d tried once\u2014after his mother\u2019s shooting. He hadn\u2019t wanted to feel again after that. The pain had been too much for him.</p><p>Over the years, Todd had learned a hard truth, though. If you weren\u2019t feeling, you weren\u2019t living, and life was too damn short to sit on the sidelines.</p><p>Smith used to know that.</p><p>The screech of a wheel caught his attention. His head turned, and Todd watched as Smith pushed a sheet-covered body toward them.</p><p>\u201cJust finished some more work on him. Was about to transfer him out...\u201d</p><p>Then they\u2019d arrived just in time.</p><p>Smith\u2019s gloved fingers pulled back the sheet. Todd heard Cara\u2019s sharply indrawn breath. When he glanced at her face, he saw a faint quiver shake her lower lip.</p><p>Maybe demons weren\u2019t so different from humans, after all.</p><p>She\u2019d deceived him, yeah, no fucking denying that, but his Cara wasn\u2019t a killer.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t need his \u201cpsychic edge\u201d to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cLower the sheet more.\u201d Her voice was soft but steady.</p><p>Smith pulled down the sheet, exposing the surgical marks on Michael House\u2019s chest and the dark handprint.</p><p>Cara\u2019s fingers lifted over him. Hovered above that perfect impression. Her hand was smaller than the print, by at least a few inches.</p><p>Cara\u2019s fine-boned fingers were nowhere near close to being a match. He hadn\u2019t thought they would be, though. He hadn\u2019t brought her down there to match hands\u2014he\u2019d brought her there to show her the print\u2014 and to find out what the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cCover him.\u201d A tight order as her hand fisted. Smith jerked the sheet back up. Cara\u2019s breath came faster now. Her gaze lifted, shot to his. \u201cYou were right, Todd. Damn it, you were right. \u201d</p><p>He noticed that Smith and Colin craned just a bit closer. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen that mark before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a mark like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the impression made?\u201d Smith immediately wanted to know. \u201cThe bruising isn\u2019t like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bruising.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cAnd it was made with a simple touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Smith frowned at her.</p><p>Me, either, Todd thought.</p><p>Gyth said nothing, but his attention was completely focused on Cara.</p><p>\u201cWe like to feel the beat of the heart when we take power from someone.\u201d</p><p>He remembered the soft press of her hand against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIn ancient Egypt,\u201d her voice was strangely calm, almost dispassionate as her gaze stayed on the sheet-covered body, \u201cthey believed that the true essence of a man was kept in his heart. His spirit. His soul. All in the heart. Not the brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they used a stick to yank out the brains,\u201d Smith sniffed. \u201cDidn\u2019t really care about preserving that part.\u201d</p><p>Todd wondered where the history lesson was going.</p><p>\u201cWhen the brain stops functioning, a person\u2019s body is still alive.\u201d Cara\u2019s gaze dropped to House\u2019s covered chest. \u201cAs long as that wonderful heart keeps beating, the person is alive.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips, continued, \u201cTo my kind, the heart is life. We want to feel that precious beat. To share the pleasure, the thrill.</p><p>Sometimes that release of pleasure is so intense,\u201d her voice dropped, \u201cso powerful that the urge to keep taking is too strong.\u201d Cara swallowed. \u201cIf you drain a human while you\u2019re feeling the wild beat of a heart, when the human dies, the stain of the touch will remain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve seen this before?\u201d He repeated. She seemed absolutely certain, but Todd had to know.</p><p>\u201cSomething like this. Yeah, once.\u201d Shadows cloaked her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard stories. Before the killings stopped\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, if she was telling him the truth, the succubus killings hadn\u2019t exactly stopped.</p><p>\u201c\u2014brands like this were found all over France. England. Humans didn\u2019t understand what they were seeing back then.\u201d A quick glance at a silent Smith. \u201cNow the doctors know it\u2019s not just a bruise.\u201d</p><p>It was a brand. A fucking calling card left by a killer who\u2019d wanted to mark his victims. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe hand, it\u2019s average size,\u201d Smith said, \u201ccould be a woman with long fingers or maybe a man with sm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cara\u2019s denial was absolute. Said at once. She shot a frowning stare at the body. \u201cYou all need to understand something\u2014</p><p>Michael\u2014he was straight. There\u2019s no way an incubus could have been with Michael.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d know.</p><p>\u201cAn incubus can only seduce those who would find him attractive. Same thing for a succubus. It\u2019s a basic, primitive response.\u201d A firm shake of her head. \u201cMichael would never have gone with an incubus. The killer, hell, the killer\u2019s a succubus.\u201d</p><p>She swiped a tear from her eye and whispered, \u201cYou deserved better than this.\u201d She spoke to Michael, her voice the intimate one of a friend.</p><p>Or lover.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Michael.\u201d She sounded completely sincere. Her hands balled into fists.</p> <p>Damn, but Todd wanted to comfort her.</p><p>To protect and to fuck. Two drives that should have been at odds, but with her, they seemed perfectly in tune.</p><p>Todd huffed out a hard breath and wondered just what he was going to do about his sex demon.</p><p>Smith cleared her throat, looked a bit less hostile as she asked, \u201cUh, does she need to see the other body?\u201d</p><p>Todd gave a grim nod. \u201cShow her.\u201d No sense putting it off now. Besides, he\u2019d been the one to come up with the idea of bringing Cara to the Crypt.</p><p>He just hadn\u2019t realized that seeing her pain would hurt him so much. \u201cHurry, Smith.\u201d He wanted Cara away from that place.</p> <p>Smith turned toward the vault. Pulled back the gleaming handle and grasped the covered slab. The slab rolled toward them with a rush of icy air.</p><p>Cara inched forward. Gasped when Smith revealed the body and she caught sight of the deep wounds on his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a demon do that?\u201d Gyth asked her, coming to stand on Cara\u2019s right side. \u201cIf you guys can kill with a touch, why mutilate the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make him suffer,\u201d Smith said, watching Cara carefully. Like a rat watching a snake that had slithered too close.</p><p>Or a very nervous human watching a dangerous demon.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that.\u201d Cara turned her stare directly onto the ME. \u201cWe can cause as much pain as we want, without butchering a human.\u201d</p><p>Nice to know.</p><p>She rubbed her arms, as if chilled. \u201cIt...this doesn\u2019t make sense. A succubus wouldn\u2019t do this. I told you, it\u2019s a waste\u2014of energy and power.\u201d Her gaze met his. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014our way. This is rage. Hate. There\u2019s no reason to kill this way\u2014not when a succubus could use a simple touch.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, pretty much his thoughts.</p><p>Two different murders. A nice clean death, versus a slaughter.</p><p>Because there were two killers?</p><p>One a sex demon who could kill with the soft stroke of a hand touch and one\u2014one who enjoyed the red splash of blood and the screams of a victim\u2019s pain?</p><p>Ah, shit.</p><p>Two killers\u2014a possibility he couldn\u2019t ignore.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Smith\u2019s hands were shaking when the detectives finally left with their little guest.</p><p>Guest.</p><p>A demon.</p><p>Oh, God, but they were everywhere\u2014and, from the sound of things, another one was out there, a crazy psycho like the one who had attacked her. Only this time, instead of ripping out throats, the killer was seducing and murdering.</p><p>She braced her elbows on her desk and lowered her head into her palms. The faint strains of jazz swirled around her. The music had once relaxed her.</p><p>But the music had been playing when that asshole took her. He\u2019d come into the Crypt, smiled at her, and then lunged.</p><p>She\u2019d seen teeth. Too sharp. Claws.</p><p>Then she\u2019d seen darkness.</p><p>Only to awake to a nightmare.</p><p>Her shoulders hunched. Every person she met. Every. Single. Person. She wondered about them. Human? Demon? Shifter?</p><p>Vampire? Something far worse?</p><p>The bodies that came in, she studied then with sharper eyes\u2014and remembered the times bodies had been \u201ctransferred\u201d out of her care due to a so-called overload in her department.</p><p>Had those transferred bodies been supernaturals? Were they moved so that she wouldn\u2019t notice differences in genetics?</p><p>She suspected they had been.</p><p>The door to the Crypt squeaked open.</p><p>Smith gasped, spun around, and found Danny McNeal standing in the doorway.</p><p>She shot to her feet and demanded, \u201cWhat do you want, Captain?\u201d Their personal relationship had ended. His choice. He\u2019d ended the best damn thing she\u2019d ever had over six months ago. No explanations. Just a cold, hard cut.</p><p>They probably shouldn\u2019t have ever gotten involved in the first place. They worked together. He was the captain with the bright future that everyone was always talking about.</p><p>She was the ME who carved up the dead.</p><p>But she\u2019d wanted him.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>And late one night, when she\u2019d gone to his office to give him a report, they\u2019d finally given in to that need.</p><p>The passion between them had burned hard for three months.</p><p>Then he\u2019d shut her out.</p><p>The bastard.</p><p>The worse part\u2014he\u2019d ripped out her heart.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever let him know that.</p><p>Her chin lifted when he stepped inside the Crypt. \u201cDo you need a case file?\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept the room. Returned to her. Turbulent gray. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s about one of those bodies,\u201d she pointed in the direction of the vaults, \u201cwe don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d Maybe not the most adult response, but she didn\u2019t really give a shit.</p><p>She\u2019d been through hell the last few months, and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear him ramble about crap. Besides, she had a feeling she knew what he was going to say. After the attack, he\u2019d started looking at her kind of...funny.</p><p>With eyes too intent. Always watching.</p><p>After the way he\u2019d kicked her aside, the jerk was probably feeling guilty. Good. He should. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou need to know something about me.\u201d McNeal stalked toward her, and yeah, stalked was the best description.</p><p>Smith tried to study him dispassionately. Really, her friends had asked her what she\u2019d seen in the guy. He was white, for one thing, and her girls had never been into the white men. And he was older. Nine years.</p><p>And bald.</p><p>But on him, being bald, being older, even being white\u2014it worked.</p><p>There was a hardness to him, a strength, in his face, along that stiff jaw, in those eyes. And then there was the aura of power that had always drawn her to him...</p><p>Jerk bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I need to know?\u201d She snapped. \u201cThat you\u2019re an asshole? I know that already. That you\u2019re sorry I got taken by that freak? Yeah, I know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that...\u201d McNeal looked damn uncomfortable. \u201cYou need to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now her heart was racing too fast. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re seeing someone else? Great.\u201d No, it wasn\u2019t, and the pain clawing through her chest told her that. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019ve got to finish working on the Monroe case and with all these damn monsters around I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of them, Nathalia.\u201d</p><p>Her blood iced. \u201cOne of wh-what?\u201d But she knew. God, but she knew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not completely human.\u201d</p><p>Her knees threatened to buckle. \u201cI really don\u2019t need this now, Dan.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her.</p><p>The back of her legs rammed into the desk when she instinctively moved back.</p><p>\u201cJesus, babe, relax, you know I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>But you did. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d Not a demon, or a shifter, please not\u2014</p><p>A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m known as a charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell is that?\u201d A nightmare. That was it. She was having one really wild-ass nightmare\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy kind\u2014\u201d</p><p>His kind?</p><p>\u201c\u2014we\u2019re highly psychic and have the ability to communicate with certain animals.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYour apartment. That fucking big snake\u2014\u201d</p><p>McNeal coughed. \u201cThat was...ah...actually my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>This just kept getting worse. \u201cYour mom talks to snakes?\u201d</p><p>A quick nod.</p><p>It was unbelievable. No, it should have been unbelievable.</p><p>But she knew it was the truth. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Meow-meow kitties that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTigers.\u201d</p><p>Of course. No soft and friendly little cats for him.</p><p>\u201cI found my connection with Shaman, a white tiger who used to be housed at the zoo, when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>The man talked to tigers. Her head pounded so hard that Smith was a bit afraid of passing out, and she refused to humiliate herself that way in front of him. \u201cGet out, McNeal.\u201d</p><p>Another step toward her. This time, the move put him close enough to touch. \u201cWe\u2019re not all bad, babe.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at the endearment and the touch that had her wanting to lean closer to him. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this\u201d you \u201cright now.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of torment on his face. \u201cI am so fucking sorry about what happened to you. I never, ever wanted anything or anyone to hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just didn\u2019t want me, right?\u201d The words she\u2019d held back for so long burst forth and she was glad. She was tired of pretending everything was fine and that she wasn\u2019t human enough to feel pain.</p><p>Because she was human, even if he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The saddest smile she\u2019d ever seen curled his lips. \u201cNo, baby, that wasn\u2019t it at all.\u201d</p><p>Liar. She knew her eyes said what her mouth didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid if you found out the truth, you wouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d He glanced down at her, eyes narrowed.</p><p>She realized that she was all but flinching away from him. Her body recoiling, knees shaking.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was right.\u201d He dropped his hand. Stepped back. Then turned and walked away.</p><p>Before she found her voice, the door had swung shut behind him and she was left with the sting of memories and the bitter taste of fear on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cBrooks.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s gruff voice stopped him just as Todd reached for his Vette. He tensed at Colin\u2019s approach, really not in the mood for a pissing match.</p><p>But when Colin stood beside him, the guy hesitated. Colin drove his hands into the deep pockets of his jacket. Glanced around the all-but-empty parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Gyth?\u201d Maybe something had come up about the case or about Cara or\u2014</p><p>Colin\u2019s bright stare turned slowly back to him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Stark.</p><p>Todd didn\u2019t speak, just waited.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in Illinois, my partner\u2014he found out what I was.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t take the risk that you\u2019d\u2014I just couldn\u2019t risk another partner turning on me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Todd could see where an attempted murder would make a guy hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m not your old partner. I\u2019m not gonna reach for my gun just because you\u2019re...different.\u201d Too tame of a word for a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Colin\u2019s eyes held his. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something, after you saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>Because at first, he\u2019d been too damn stunned. Then he\u2019d tried to convince himself it hadn\u2019t happened, then he\u2019d gotten so furious and then\u2014\u201cI wanted you to tell me.\u201d But now, knowing what Colin\u2019s last partner had done, Todd understood more about the guy\u2014and he knew that Colin probably would never have told him.</p><p>He tried to kill me.</p><p>Shit. No wonder it had been hard for Colin to trust him.</p><p>Colin exhaled. \u201cSo what happens now? Are we gonna keep working together, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, we\u2019re gonna keep working together.\u201d Like he\u2019d really go to the trouble of breaking in anybody else. Besides, Colin was one damn fine cop.</p><p>With a few peculiarities. What had shocked him weeks ago, now just, okay, still shocked him. But he was dealing with the situation\u2014or at least learning to deal with it.</p><p>Todd narrowed his eyes. \u201cBut no more secrets, man. You trust me, and I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d Simple.</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cAgreed.\u201d Colin held out his hand. The shake was brief, strong.</p><p>\u201cNow get the hell out of here,\u201d Todd said, jerking his thumb toward Colin\u2019s old Jeep. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave that sexy doc of yours waiting too long.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke Colin\u2019s lips. \u201cNo, man, I sure don\u2019t\u2014my doc\u2019s not exactly the waitin\u2019 type.\u201d He turned away, then hesitated. When he glanced back at Todd, his smile was gone. \u201cBe careful with your lady, Todd. A woman like her, she\u2019s got a lot of secrets, too.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew she did. And he also knew those secrets weren\u2019t going to stand in his way. He wanted Cara\u2014and he intended to have her.</p><p>Todd heard the soft knock at his door just as he was about to head into the shower. He paused, sent a quick glance at the clock.</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>His steps were swift as he hurried from the bedroom. He knew the identity of his caller even before he opened the wooden door.</p><p>He\u2019d smelled her.</p><p>Cara stood just past the threshold, dressed all in black with her hair pulled into some sort of sexy twist. Her eyes were lined with dark shadow, her lips tinted red.</p><p>\u201cYou missed my first show tonight,\u201d she said. Then stepped forward.</p><p>He fell back, knowing she\u2019d come fully into his apartment and wanting her there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Needing her there. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. Shouldn\u2019t you be at Paradise?\u201d The woman usually played at least three sets.</p><p>\u201cI told Niol I had business tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d he repeated the word softly. \u201cIs that what I am?\u201d</p> <p>A slow shake of her head. \u201cI looked for you in the crowd, but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>There was something in her voice. \u201cMissed me, did you?\u201d</p><p>A faint frown appeared between her brows. \u201cYes, actually, I think I did.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. He hadn\u2019t been expecting quite that level of honesty from her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Todd and\u2014\u201d Her gaze darted behind him, landed on the pile of books he\u2019d tossed haphazardly onto the sofa. A golden brow arched. \u201cDoing some light reading?\u201d</p> <p>Shit. \u201cJust some books I picked up. Nothing important.\u201d</p><p>But she brushed around him, heading straight for the sofa, those delicate hands reaching down and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDemonology: A Hunter\u2019s Guide.\u201d She grabbed another heavy volume. \u201cUnmasking the Demon. \u201d As Cara reached for the third book, the one he\u2019d made the mistake of leaving open, a gasp tore from her lips. \u201cAnd what the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to see the picture to know what had pissed her off. He could remember the image perfectly. One side of the page featured a sketch of a beautiful, naked woman, hair streaming down her shoulders, lips curled in a smile of anticipation.</p><p>Then, on the other side of the page, the illustrator had drawn the picture of a \u201creal\u201d succubus. It was a demon with a long, pointed tail, a body covered in scales, a face like a dog, and a snarling mouth full of jagged teeth.</p><p>\u201cAh, Cara...\u201d</p> <p>She threw the book at him. It missed his head by about three inches. \u201cIs that what you think I am?\u201d</p><p>He hoped to heaven not. \u201cYou said demons used glamour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use it to hide my eye color, not to disguise the fact that I\u2019m some kind of freakish hag! Ugh!\u201d A flush stained her cheeks. \u201cThat writer is a complete moron, and so are you, if you\u2019re buying into that crap. A succubus looks, well, damn it, look at me! Just like a woman.\u201d</p><p>A beautiful woman. Seductive. Physically perfect.</p><p>He lifted his hand to her. \u201cI think you\u2019re exactly what you appear to be.\u201d</p><p>Now she eyed him suspiciously. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman I want.\u201d His head still swam with the new knowledge that he had, but one thing was absolutely clear to him. He wanted Cara.</p><p>Her face softened.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you come here tonight?\u201d He asked, trying to force his gaze to stay on the lines of her face when the hunger demanded that he stare at her body. Those breasts. Such a wonderful size for his hands\u2014and they tasted so sweet in his mouth.</p><p>And her legs...He wanted them wrapped around his waist. Holding him tight as he thrust deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just take from you, Todd. You aren\u2019t prey to me.\u201d She crossed back to his side. \u201cI want you to understand that.\u201d Her hand rose to his chest, pressed just above his heart.</p><p>At her touch, his cock swelled even more with a flood of arousal. \u201cI thought that was what you had to do. Take energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take, but we can also give to our lovers.\u201d The heat of her hand seemed to sear him through the thin fabric of his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cTell me, how have you been feeling since we made love?\u201d</p><p>Better than he had in weeks. Months. A cautious \u201cGood\u201d was his only answer.</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cWe did that. The energy from our bond spilled into us, renewed us\u2014and made us both more powerful.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a pretty good deal to him. \u201cSo it\u2019s not always like that? What usually happens?\u201d Not that he wanted to think of her with others.</p><p>The smile faded away. \u201cUsually we take what we want. Humans are left with pleasure, but their bodies are much weaker than before. The weakness can last for a few hours or even days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just take from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Stark.</p><p>Again, more honesty than he\u2019d expected. Her lips were just a few inches away from his. Her eyes were so blue. A deception, that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want any more deceptions. \u201cShow me your eyes. Your real eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her lids lowered in a slow blink. When her lashes lifted, her eyes were blacker than the night. He raised his hand. Traced a fingertip under her left eye. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured, and meant it. With Niol, the dark eyes looked scary as hell, but the darkness didn\u2019t detract from Cara\u2019s appeal. It added to it. Made her look mysterious, wild.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d There was no coyness in her. \u201cNaked. Inside me.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly where he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything between us. I can\u2019t catch any diseases that humans have, and I control my own fertility.\u201d</p><p>Handy.</p><p>\u201cI want you, flesh to flesh, with me.\u201d</p><p>The lady had caught him at \u201cnaked.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head. Kissed her. A slow, tasting kiss. When she moaned, the sound rumbling in the back of her throat, every nerve in his body tightened.</p><p>She pulled away from him, licked her red lips. \u201cBut first, I want a taste.\u201d</p><p>Her powerful scent surrounded him. Sex. Woman. Magic. When she dropped to her knees before him, Todd actually felt light-headed for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her hands were working on the buckle of his jeans, easing down the zipper and then shoving the rough denim and his boxers out of the way.</p><p>His cock bobbed toward her. The head was stiff and a drop of moisture already coated the tip of his arousal. Her hands wrapped around his swollen length. Tightened. Stroked.</p><p>Pleasure lashed through him.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d she murmured softly and Todd realized he was growling in anticipation. \u201cI\u2019m only going to give.\u201d</p><p>Then her mouth was on him. Lips parted and soft. Tongue caressing as she closed her mouth over him.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her head, dug into the silken tendrils of her hair.</p><p>A powerful energy snaked through him. Her mouth was heaven. Every sexy move of her lips paradise. But there was more. More than he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>The feelings were magnified, spiraling along his nerves and cells, the pleasure pulsating within him.</p><p>Her mouth caressed his cock, her lips featherlight. Her fingers circled the base of his shaft and she moved her hand in time to the seductive motions of her lips and tongue.</p><p>Driving. Him. Insane.</p><p>His cock swelled even more under her ministrations. His hands fisted in her hair, and each move of her mouth had him nearly begging.</p><p>But then she pulled away. Easily broke his hold and leaned back, bracing her palms against the floor as she gazed up at him.</p><p>No, damn it, not yet, he wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cI like the way you taste, Todd. I like it a lot.\u201d</p><p>He swore he could actual hear the rip of his control shredding. He fell to his knees beside her, hands trembling. A roar filled his ears and a growl churned in his throat. A red haze of need covered his eyes and he reached for her with hands that were too rough, far too strong for her delicate skin.</p><p>She met him eagerly. Fought with him to jerk off her shirt. To bare those breasts that he loved. Then he shoved her bra out of the way. Caught one tight nipple between his teeth while his right hand fondled her other breast. The heady scent that was pure Cara thickened in the air.</p><p>He suckled her, drawing her breast into his mouth, then slipping back to lave her nipple. God, but the woman had great breasts.</p><p>Pink nipples. Sweet, firm flesh. Not too big. Just right for his mouth.</p><p>He dragged his fingers down her body. Managed to push down her pants as she shifted, and Cara kicked off her pumps and the pants in a hard, fast move.</p><p>With a last lick, he lifted his head. She wore only black panties now. A small scrap really. Barely covered her mound. His fingers wrapped around her hips, and his eyes zeroed in on that tempting flesh.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten to command his body. Turnabout was only fair.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d A guttural demand.</p><p>Cara smiled, pure enticement, and spread those long, slender legs.</p><p>He eased down between her thighs, lowering his head right over the dark silk. His nostrils flared as he caught the scent of her cream. The rich promise of hot sex.</p><p>The promise of her.</p><p>His lips pressed against the silk. A stark kiss. She arched beneath him, sliding more fully against his mouth.</p><p>Just where he wanted her.</p><p>He could feel the soft nub of her clitoris pressing through the underwear. He rubbed his tongue over the sensitive spot, loving the way she sighed his name with each soft touch.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The fingers of his right hand caught the silk. Tugged and the fabric tore free. Then her sex was bare. Open. Ready for his kiss.</p><p>He put his lips against her first. Explored her creamy flesh. Moved as slowly as he wanted so that he could learn every inch of her.</p><p>Learn what she liked. What made her moan and twist and shake.</p><p>Then he used his tongue, sliding it into the folds of her tight core, taking the rich cream and giving pleasure. He lapped at her.</p><p>Tasted. Drove his tongue deep. Again and again and\u2014</p><p>Todd felt her climax against him with a shudder.</p><p>He drank up her release, driving his tongue deeper into her body, hearing her cries and loving the feel of her nails as they dug into his shoulders.</p><p>When the shivers faded, his head lifted, just a few inches. Todd licked his lips as his fingers slipped over her mound and stroked the center of her need. Oh, damn, but she was wet and more than ready for him now. The flesh swollen, warm and waiting to be fucked.</p><p>Todd drove two fingers deep into her straining sex.</p><p>He felt the sudden tightness of her body beneath his with a rush of satisfaction. His succubus wanted to come again for him. Her sex clenched around his fingers, a telling sign that he wouldn\u2019t ignore.</p><p>Todd pulled away from her, only to reposition his body, lodging the head of his cock against her moist opening. The feel of her sex against his, the creamy warmth, the silken skin, had him gritting his teeth as he thrust forward.</p><p>Her hand rose. Covered his heart. For an instant, he stilled.</p><p>Then her gaze met his. Black eyes. Dark and deep.</p><p>Her lips curved.</p><p>He caught her hand with his. Pressed it harder against his chest. Felt the air around him seem to shimmer, to pulse.</p><p>He drove into her, burying balls-deep in one hard move.</p><p>Then he was moving. Thrusting. Withdrawing. Thrusting. Cara wrapped her legs around him. Arched into his driving hips.</p><p>Her face took on a faint glow. A light from within. A faint stir of gentle wind blew against his face, then all over him, and her hand stayed steady and warm against his chest.</p><p>His thrusts became harder. Deeper. \u201cI want to feel you come,\u201d he gritted. He wanted to feel her release, to see it on her face.</p><p>\u201cThen you will,\u201d she whispered, and gasped, tipping back her head and squeezing her legs even tighter around him.</p><p>The feelings hit him then. The ripples of pleasure that weren\u2019t his own. The shattering euphoria that danced along his skin.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand how, but he was feeling her release. Riding the wave of her pleasure, just as he plunged into her body.</p><p>\u201cAh...Todd! Kiss me!\u201d</p><p>His lips caught hers. His tongue drove into her mouth.</p><p>And his hips pistoned against her.</p><p>His climax hit him, rolling over him in a furious burst of power.</p><p>When she stiffened and moaned into his mouth, he knew she felt the surge of release, too.</p><p>An exchange. Not just taking. Giving.</p><p>From both.</p><p>He held her tighter. Kept thrusting, trying to wring every drop of sensual satisfaction from their bodies. His skin was slick with sweat, his muscles trembling. But he didn\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>So when the climax ended, he just kept thrusting. His cock swelled within her. Her legs gripped him tight, and she stared straight up at him with her midnight eyes.</p><p>Magic was around him. Pressing in the air. Dancing on his skin. The glow of power lit her body.</p><p>And his.</p><p>It gave him strength, a stamina he\u2019d never had. Not so quickly. Never as fast\u2014</p><p>So the thrusts continued. The strange link that he had with her intensified. He knew what she wanted. Knew exactly where to touch and kiss, without her having to say a word. Their breaths panted out, their hearts thundered in a mad, matching rhythm, and the furious race to climax had them locked tight.</p><p>So tight that he could almost touch her soul.</p><p>When they came again, they came together. Mouths, bodies.</p><p>Spirits.</p><p>A demon and a man.</p><p>No, a woman and a man.</p><p>A perfect match.</p><p>He held her, arms too tight, and knew that he\u2019d go to hell for her in a heartbeat.</p><p>A sobering thought for a man who\u2019d already fought the devil once in his life\u2014and had the scar to prove it.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t kill House.\u201d He spoke in the darkness, when the heat of the passion had cooled, but the magic still fired their blood. \u201cOr any of the others.\u201d</p><p>They were in his bed. Naked. His body curled over hers, his right hand on her breast. His left arm rested beneath her head.</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019d touched her in ways most men wouldn\u2019t understand. Not physical. Her heart. Soul. He\u2019d felt her, down to the core of her spirit. Cara wasn\u2019t evil. \u201cYou\u2019re not a killer.\u201d He\u2019d said the same words at the station, but he needed to say them again, now, with her in his arms and her scent on his skin.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI told you from the beginning that I didn\u2019t kill Michael.\u201d There was an ache in her voice when she said the other man\u2019s name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cara had cared House, maybe even loved him. Todd ached for the pain she felt, even as an insidious curl of jealousy rose within him.</p><p>But House was gone now, poor bastard. A death he hadn\u2019t deserved.</p><p>He\u2019d find the guy\u2019s killer\u2014because it was his job and because he liked to give victims their peace.</p> <p>His fingers eased over Cara\u2019s flesh. \u201cI can be a hard man, Cara. My job\u2019s important to me. Doing what\u2019s right. Protecting those who can\u2019t protect themselves. I take it all seriously.\u201d For years, the badge had been all he had. He wanted her to understand him.</p><p>The darkness inside, a darkness he knew she\u2019d felt.</p><p>Her cheek rested on his arm as she gazed at him. \u201cWhy did you become a cop?\u201d</p><p>The memory of his mother\u2019s scream burned in his mind. \u201cMy dad was a cop. He worked for the Atlanta PD for eighteen years.\u201d</p><p>Most folks took the statement at face value and left it at that. A boy, wanting to grow up and be like his father.</p> <p>Some truth. Some lie.</p><p>\u201cBut why did you join the force?\u201d The dark eyes that stared back at him saw too much.</p><p>Too deeply.</p><p>Todd found himself telling her a story he\u2019d never told another. Not even the grandfather who\u2019d wound up raising him. \u201cMy dad worked undercover. Deep undercover. Months would go by and we wouldn\u2019t see him, then when he would finally come home, he\u2019d be a stranger.\u201d A hard, brooding stranger who smelled of alcohol and smoke. One whose eyes had been flint sharp and whose mouth had never smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe was a good cop, though. Everyone said so.\u201d And there had been so many plaques and medals in his dad\u2019s room. His mom had polished them every single week, smiling that same, sad smile as she cleaned them. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many guys my dad put away over the years. Drug dealers. Robbers. Killers. He made a lot of enemies in his time, the kind of enemies who don\u2019t forget or forgive when they\u2019ve been betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t speak. Just watched him.</p> <p>\u201cA guy got out one day. Tony Costa. My dad had been undercover in the guy\u2019s crew. Busted him for selling coke and for the murders of two prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he got out?\u201d Cara asked, surprise in her voice.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t understand the human justice system. \u201cHe rolled on some higher-ups. Pleaded to manslaughter for the prostitutes and wound up serving a seven-year sentence.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath. This was the part that he hated to remember. \u201cI was fourteen when Tony was paroled. I remember because it was my birthday. Mom had ordered me a cake and we were just leaving the house to go get it.\u201d He\u2019d been going to have a swimming party. The plan had been to get the cake and go back home to set up before his friends came over.</p><p>\u201cCosta was waiting for us in the driveway. He had a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made us go back inside. Told mom to call dad. Said to \u2018get the bastard over there so he could watch.\u2019 But dad was undercover, and mom couldn\u2019t get him. She told Costa she could call his captain, but\u2014\u201d A lump was in his throat now, choking back the words. \u201cBut Costa knew a call to the captain would have cops swarming over him. So he smiled at my mom, and he killed her. The bastard shot her point-blank in the head.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, turning to burrow her head against his neck. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He felt cold. Even with the warmth of her body pressing down against him, he felt so damn cold. \u201cThen he turned the gun on me.\u201d</p> <p>She froze against him. A burst of wind blew into the room, sweeping over his body, ruffling the sheets and covers.</p><p>Her head lifted. \u201cHe shot you.\u201d</p><p>Todd caught her hand. Brought it to rest against the old, jagged scar on his left side. \u201cI tried to run, but the bullet caught me.\u201d He\u2019d thought he was dying when he felt the burning lash of the pain in his side. The fiery agony had stolen his breath, then he\u2019d seen the blood. So much blood. His. His mother\u2019s. Everywhere. \u201cHe left me there. Bleeding out on the floor, with my mother\u2019s body only a few feet away.\u201d He still had nightmares about that day. Still woke up in a cold sweat, wishing he\u2019d done something to save his mother. Wishing he couldn\u2019t still smell her blood on his skin.</p><p>\u201cBut you survived.\u201d Her fingers curled over the white scar. \u201cYou got out of there. You lived. \u201d</p><p>\u201cA neighbor heard the gunshots. Called nine-one-one. I woke up in a hospital, my side stitched up, and found my grandfather sitting beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where was your father?\u201d He caught the snap of anger in her voice\u2014and the soft echo of pain, for him.</p><p>\u201cTracking Costa. He came to see me, once, in the hospital. He hugged me and told me that he regretted a lot of the things he\u2019d done in his life.\u201d His dad had been the same hard, stranger, but he\u2019d also seemed...desperate. He\u2019d put back on his wedding band, a ring Todd had never seen the man wear. \u201cHe told me then that \u2018if you go too deep into the devil\u2019s world, only darkness will fill you.\u2019 It was the last thing he ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he catch the man who\u2019d shot you?\u201d Quiet words in a beautiful face that was suddenly deadly.</p><p>The windows were still closed to the night. The magic wind had disappeared now. The air was strangely tense around him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he caught him. Didn\u2019t even try to bring him in. My dad shot Costa in the head and in the heart. Then he turned the gun on himself.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen years on the force, and his dad had eaten his gun. And left him alone.</p><p>\u201cI hated him for leaving me. For years, I didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d done it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought it was his fault,\u201d she said, her voice soft. \u201cHumans...do crazy things when guilt presses on them.\u201d</p><p>This was the part he didn\u2019t like to think about. \u201cI blamed him, Cara. For my mother\u2019s death. For me getting shot. If he\u2019d just been at home, taking care of his family like he should have been doing, none of this would have ever happened.\u201d The words came from the boy he\u2019d been, though he liked to think the man knew better.</p><p>Yeah, he liked to think that. \u201cWhen I first woke up and realized that my mom was gone, I wished it had been him instead of her.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d kept wishing that, even when his father had finally come to see him in the hospital. He\u2019d wished it until...\u201cHis captain came to see me a few days after I was released. I was staying at my grandfather\u2019s.\u201d His mom\u2019s father had been an affluent, somewhat reserved man who lived in one of the older, richer parts of Atlanta. He\u2019d never approved of his only child marrying a cop, and he\u2019d been fighting hard to get a custody hearing for Todd when the captain had come calling with his dark news.</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel, when you learned what had happened?\u201d Her naked body pressed against his, and the flesh-on-flesh contact was strangely comforting. Her hand stroked his scar, softly, tenderly, and the mysterious eyes that stared into his held no censure.</p><p>Just patience. Warmth.</p><p>Warmth in darkness.</p><p>His skin didn\u2019t seem quite so cold anymore, but inside, he still felt like his heart was encased in ice. \u201cI was so fucking glad that Tony Costa was dead. So fucking glad.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a kiss against his chest. Right over his heart. \u201cBut what about your father?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been furious with him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to die, Cara. There were so many other options for him, he didn\u2019t have to die. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he thought he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was damn well wrong.\u201d He\u2019d taken the coward\u2019s way out. The easy way.</p><p>\u201cHe might have thought that he\u2019d failed you, your mother. A man who\u2019d spent his life protecting others would have a hard time facing the fact that he\u2019d failed to protect the ones who\u2019d mattered the most.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, the shrinks had all said something like that. They\u2019d told him that his father had been disturbed, pushed past his reason by the murder of his wife.</p><p>But the simple truth was that his dad had chosen to put that gun into his mouth.</p><p>And chosen to leave the world and his son behind.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t forgiven him for that, not yet.</p><p>Not deep inside.</p><p>\u201cYou hate him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Again, no censure. No judgment of any kind. Just a quiet question and those eyes, watching him.</p><p>\u201cFor a long time, I did. I\u2019m still mad as hell at him for what he did, but\u2014\u201d The truth? \u201cIt takes too much energy to hate. I wish he\u2019d been different. I wish I\u2019d been different, but hating a dead man isn\u2019t going to make my life any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill blaming him?\u201d</p><p>The direct question made him flinch. Suddenly, part of him wanted to jump from the bed, to put distance between them. And another part wanted to hold her as tight as he could. \u201cIt helps me to sleep at night, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does.\u201d Now she kissed him on the mouth. Not a passionate kiss. Her lips were closed, the touch brief, but soothing. \u201cNothing makes death easier to bear. Nothing.\u201d There was a knowledge in her voice. A pain that hinted at her own loss.</p><p>He brushed back her hair, and wondered what had caused the sadness he felt in her. A sadness that more than matched his own.</p><p>He wanted to ask her. Had begun telling her about his father because he\u2019d wanted her to learn to trust him\u2014as he was learning to trust her.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time to push her, he knew that. And perhaps he\u2019d already revealed too much about himself, too soon.</p><p>\u201cIf you blamed him, then why did you become a cop?\u201d</p><p>He would tell her this. \u201cBecause I needed to prove him wrong.\u201d He\u2019d also wanted to save others, as he hadn\u2019t been able to save his mother. But he didn\u2019t tell her that.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give up your humanity to be a good cop. You can fight killers, mon\u2014\u201d He broke off, uncomfortable with that particular word choice. \u201cEvil without becoming evil yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd trying to make up for your mother\u2019s death? That has nothing to do with it, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>Insightful demon.</p><p>Smart woman. \u201cYeah, it does.\u201d He tightened his arms around her. The past weighed too heavily on him. He\u2019d opened the door, but too much had spilled through. \u201cEnough of this talk, Cara. It\u2019s late, you\u2019re here, I\u2019m here, and the dead, they\u2019re buried now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes they don\u2019t stay buried.\u201d Whispered words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and brushed her lips against his once more. \u201cNothing.\u201d Her arms wrapped around him, held him tight.</p><p>For the first time in years, Todd almost felt at peace.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he inhaled her sweet scent.</p><p>Susan Dobbs paced in front of the phone booth. She was nervous as hell, but the call had to be made.</p><p>She\u2019d driven hard and fast to get out of the city. He had too many friends, spies, in Atlanta, and she\u2019d been afraid one of them would see her making the call. Hell, she\u2019d even thought about buying one of those cheap, disposable cell phones, but she\u2019d stopped at two stores and hadn\u2019t been able to find any in stock.</p><p>Just her fucking bad luck.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter\u2014this way was better, anyway. Dozens of people used this phone every day, so the call would never be traced back to her. Besides, once she made the call, she\u2019d keep driving straight down that long, dark road, and no one in Atlanta would ever see her ass again.</p><p>Her palms were sweating and her heart pounded so hard that her chest hurt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done. The last attack hadn\u2019t been part of their original plan. When he found out, Susan knew the guy was going to be fucking furious.</p><p>But damn it, when was she supposed to ever have any fun?</p><p>Taking a breath, Susan reached for the phone. A lock of blond hair fell over her eye, and she shoved it out of the way with her left hand.</p><p>Then she dialed the cop\u2019s number, a number she\u2019d memorized days before.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The shrill cry of the phone ripped Todd from his sleep. He muttered, cursed, and tried to reach for the nightstand. Cara was on top of him, her body completely limp, so the phone rang four times before he finally managed to snag it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jesus, the light on the bedside clock said 4:15 A.M . If McNeal was calling him again\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey lied to you.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice. High. Thready with what could have been fear.</p><p>A burst of adrenaline brought him to instant wakefulness. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>Cara, who was now partially on her side, tensed.</p><p>\u201cThey lied to you,\u201d the woman repeated. \u201cHe made them lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, lady, I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s too damn late for prank calls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour demon wasn\u2019t at Paradise Found like she told you. The waitresses, they lied. So did the bartender. She slipped away, and they know she did.\u201d The words came out in a tumbling rush.</p><p>Anger began to fuel his heart. \u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he made them lie. Just like he tried to make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d But he already knew.</p><p>\u201cNiol.\u201d A fearful whisper of sound.</p><p>\u201cYou got proof of that?\u201d Cara was completely silent next to him, and he knew that she could hear the whole damn conversation.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a demon, just like she is. Demons lie. They deceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He asked again, but he knew the caller wasn\u2019t about to reveal her identity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman who is tired of living with evil. The killings have to stop.\u201d A pause. \u201cShe has to be stopped. Don\u2019t let her trick you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s rotten inside. Just like they all are.\u201d</p><p>The force of his rage caused his fingers to shake. His hand tightened around the phone. \u201cI want to know just who\u2014\u201d</p><p>The call ended with a soft click. Then the buzz of a dial tone had him swearing.</p> <p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>As quickly as he could, he used his call return. One ring. Two. The beeping filled his ears, and he counted up to fifteen rings.</p><p>The lady wasn\u2019t gonna answer his call.</p><p>Shit. Not a big surprise. He glanced over at the Caller ID light on his phone. Made a mental note of the number. He\u2019d be pulling a few strings come daylight, and he\u2019d track down the mystery lady.</p><p>Light trickled through the window, spilling onto the bed and Cara. She sat up, pulling the covers over her breasts. \u201cTodd?\u201d</p> <p>He ran a hand over his face. This damn case was really pissing him off.</p><p>\u201cShe was lying, Todd. I never left Paradise Found those nights, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t get anyone to lie for me.\u201d</p><p>But had Niol? The bastard was as deceitful as a snake.</p><p>\u201cTell me that you believe me.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that woman was on the phone, but she\u2019s the one lying, not me. \u201d Her voice was vibrating with intensity.</p><p>He caught her hand. Kissed her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d He\u2019d get to the bottom of this shit. If the woman had been lying in an effort to set up Cara, he\u2019d find out why, and he\u2019d find her. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Though he doubted he\u2019d be able to follow suit. Possibilities and worries filled his head.</p><p>If Cara was innocent\u2014and he\u2019d bet his badge that his lady was\u2014then someone was working damn hard to make her look guilty.</p> <p>Something like that\u2014it was personal. Always.</p><p>So who would hate his succubus enough to want her life destroyed? Enough to kill to see her punished?</p><p>He\u2019d find out.</p><p>And he knew just where he was going to start his hunt.</p><p>With Niol.</p><p>Cara lay back against the pillows and closed her eyes. The words Todd had spoken rang in her ears.</p><p>And the words he had not drove into her heart.</p><p>She\u2019d bared her soul to him when they made love, let him touch the deepest part of her spirit, and the man still didn\u2019t trust her.</p> <p>Perhaps it was time for her to back off. To let the cop have his space.</p><p>Or perhaps it was time for her to start showing the world just how powerful a succubus could be.</p><p>Because there was only one conclusion she could draw from that phone call.</p><p>Some bitch was setting her up for murder.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t about to take that shit from anyone.</p><p>Cara could play the nice girl. She\u2019d done it for years. But nice went skin deep, and true power, demon power, it cut to the bone.</p><p>She was going to find the person out there who was screwing with her life, and she\u2019d make the woman pay.</p><p>For poor Michael\u2019s death.</p><p>For the other men.</p><p>For making Todd doubt her.</p><p>And for ruining one of the best nights she\u2019d had in years.</p><p>The bitch was about to find out just what happened to people who angered a succubus.</p><p>The woman had better run, fast. Because once a succubus started seeking prey, she didn\u2019t stop until the hunt was over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really a stupid whore, you know that?\u201d The deep voice came out of the darkness and had Susan spinning around. Her back slammed into the phone.</p><p>Oh, shit. He was there. \u201cWh-what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, and the sight chilled her. She wasn\u2019t afraid of much in this world, but this demon terrified her.</p><p>Because she knew he was evil. All the way to the core.</p><p>But so was she.</p><p>Carefully, slowly, she began to kneel down. Before she\u2019d shot out of town, she\u2019d stopped at the pawnshop and picked up a new knife\u2014one that was strapped on her ankle and sharpened to kill. Susan liked knives\u2014liked having them close. She had since she was seventeen, when she\u2019d used the sweet, sharp blade of her mother\u2019s steak knife to stab her stepfather right in his heart.</p><p>Right after the bastard had made the mistake of touching her again.</p><p>Just a few more inches, and she\u2019d have the knife. She knew the demon\u2019s weak spots, and even if she couldn\u2019t take him down, she could hurt him enough to get away and\u2014</p><p>He lunged for her. Grabbed her right hand. Broke her wrist with a twist of his fingers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cry out. She\u2019d stopped doing that years ago. Susan stared up into his black eyes and choked down the pain.</p><p>He yanked her up against him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been playing without me, sweetheart.\u201d He leaned in close, pressed a kiss to her cheek, and inhaled her scent. \u201cI can still smell the blood on your skin.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d washed for hours. Scrubbed until her flesh was sore. But those damn demons, they could smell a speck of blood from a mile away.</p><p>Or so the stories said.</p><p>Susan thought the stories were half bull, but one thing was undeniable\u2014the demon knew what she\u2019d been up to while he\u2019d been watching other prey. \u201cTommy deserved to die.\u201d He\u2019d turned his back on her. Her. Tried to walk away and leave her behind.</p><p>No one did that. Not anymore.</p><p>And Tommy had sure changed his tune once she\u2019d started using her knife on him. He\u2019d been begging for her forgiveness then.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been in a forgiving mood.</p><p>\u201cThomas Monroe wasn\u2019t on my list, Susan.\u201d His touch was ice cold.</p><p>She\u2019d liked that in the beginning. Liked the chill and the rush that he gave her.</p><p>When they\u2019d started killing, she\u2019d liked him even better. It was only lately that she\u2019d begun to worry about him, and to wonder\u2014</p><p>What did the good-looking demon who carried the scent of sex and death have planned for her?</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he was on my list.\u201d She should probably be playing this differently. Acting cowed. Scared.</p><p>Not her style, even though fear squeezed her heart.</p><p>The demon smiled down at her, and his scent thickened in the air around them. Helplessly, she felt her body begin to respond. Her nipples tightened. Her sex creamed.</p><p>\u201cYou were such a surprise to me, sweetheart.\u201d He leaned his head toward her. Kissed her lips. Pushed her back even harder against the plastic phone. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His words were a lie. She knew it. Yeah, she was pretty. She\u2019d used that physical appeal more times than she could count in the past, but he hadn\u2019t wanted her because she was pretty.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her because she looked like the other woman, Cara.</p><p>She\u2019d fixed that demon whore. Cara would be ending up in jail soon.</p><p>\u201cYou left evidence behind. Very, very sloppy of you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>So she wasn\u2019t as smart as he was. Not as good at cleaning up. \u201cThe cops don\u2019t have anything on me.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cThey think it\u2019s that singer, Cara. I just called the detective, you know, the one who\u2019s been watching her at the club...\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped to her throat. Caressed the skin. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I told him that her alibi was crap. That the people at the club were lying.\u201d Her heartbeat began to steady as hope raised its head.</p><p>Maybe she could smooth the situation over with him. He wanted Cara to take the fall for the killings. She\u2019d just given him the other woman on a silver platter.</p><p>Surely that made up for a little extra murder?</p><p>His fingers began to squeeze her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking stupid.\u201d</p><p>The pain of his steely grasp brought tears to her eyes. She blinked, trying to block the moisture from falling. She could get out of this mess. There was still time.</p><p>But her heart had started to race again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s screwing her now,\u201d he spat the words at her. \u201cWhen you called Detective Brooks, she was in his bed.\u201d A laugh. Cold.</p><p>Deadly. \u201cShe would have heard everything you said. She\u2019ll know what\u2019s happening now, Susan. She\u2019ll start hunting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-won\u2019t...f-find...m-me...\u201d Talking was hard with his fingers digging into her windpipe. She barely managed to gasp out the words.</p><p>Then his hand was gone and she dragged air into her lungs, sucking in the oxygen desperately.</p><p>\u201cOf course, she will. Demons are very, very good at hunting. Almost as good as those fucking animal shifters.\u201d</p><p>But that Cara, she was just a piece of fluff. Susan wasn\u2019t scared of her. She\u2019d cut the demon up, just like she\u2019d cut Tommy\u2014</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re up against, do you?\u201d</p><p>Now she was getting pissed. \u201cI...understand th-that you...need me.\u201d He couldn\u2019t kill without her. She was the bait. The perfect setup. Though the demon might be furious, he wasn\u2019t going to do anything stupid. \u201cLook, I th-think...the rules between us...need to change.\u201d The sex was great. Hell, sex was always great after a kill. And he\u2019d been giving her money. Gotten her a nicer place.</p><p>But now the shift of power was about to turn, in her favor. Susan let a smile curve her lips.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cActually, Susan, I don\u2019t need you anymore at all.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, her fate was sealed.</p><p>She shoved against him, hard, seeing her death in the darkness of his gaze. The bastard laughed again and stepped back, and she managed to twist and yank her knife from its sheath. \u201cYou stay the hell back!\u201d She had to hold the blade with her weaker left hand\u2014no way could she use her right now.</p><p>\u201cAw, Susan, why do you want to fight me?\u201d That charming, deceitful smile was on his face. She\u2019d always thought humans lied well, but they couldn\u2019t even come close to matching demons.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d He was blocking the entrance to the phone booth. But if she could make him move, she could run, maybe make it to her car\u2014</p><p>It hit her then. His scent. Teasing her nostrils. Sex. Power.</p><p>No, damn it, no!</p><p>Helplessly, she felt her body respond even more to him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to use that knife on me.\u201d His voice became even deeper.</p><p>Damn demon power.</p><p>She hated demons.</p><p>The hand gripping the knife began to lower.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>No. She\u2019d stopped being a good girl the night her bastard of a stepfather had climbed into her bed.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, don\u2019t you, Susan?\u201d Still using that hypnotic power of his.</p><p>Her nipples were so hard they ached. Her legs trembled. She managed a nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to hurt me, do you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, but she did.</p><p>He lifted his hand toward her as he closed the space between them. His fingers trailed over her breast. Plucked the nipple. \u201cKiss me, Susan.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth, open, met his. The kiss was far too hard, far too rough, and she felt the copper of blood on her tongue.</p><p>The she felt the press of his hand against her chest.</p><p>Right over her heart.</p><p>No! The scream echoed in her mind even as she continued to helplessly kiss him back.</p><p>His lips lifted. \u201cI\u2019m gonna drain you,\u201d he whispered, and sounded like a lover with a caress in his voice. \u201cEvery drop of power from you\u2014I\u2019m gonna take it. Then I\u2019m gonna leave your corpse to rot.\u201d Another bruising kiss.</p><p>Then she felt it. The slow stir of magic in the air. No, God, no, she wouldn\u2019t go out like this.</p><p>With every ounce of strength she had, Susan focused on her left hand. She just needed to break the demon\u2019s power. If he lost his concentration, the pheromones would weaken, and she\u2019d be able to fight more\u2014</p><p>And not just twist and moan eagerly like a bitch in heat against him.</p><p>\u201cAh, Susan, you\u2019re gonna beg me to fuck you, then to kill you.\u201d</p><p>The fingers of her left hand trembled as they tightened around the knife.</p><p>Distract him. \u201cI-I can still...help you,\u201d she managed. \u201cI-I can get...more men. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. Laughed. \u201cI told you, Susan.\u201d His hands cupped her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d screwed up. Played with the devil when she wasn\u2019t ready for hell. \u201cB-but I-I can give...you the n-next man on...y-your list!</p><p>I-I can give y-you...T-Todd Brooks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d He smirked at her. \u201cThanks for the gift.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d be thanking her. Her breath caught, sweat beaded her brow, and she managed to lift the knife and plunge it into his side.</p><p>Startled, the demon cried out, then stumbled back.</p><p>His scent eased, just for a moment, and her head cleared.</p><p>Snarling, she plunged the knife straight into his chest. His cry of pain was music to her ears. Susan yanked the blade out and drove it deep again.</p><p>Blood sprayed across the phone booth. Dripped down the glass.</p><p>She drove the knife into his chest once more. Furious. Desperate. He should be going down. Weakening.</p><p>Susan lifted the knife, prepared for another hard thrust.</p><p>His fingers flew out and locked around her throat. \u201cBitch.\u201d His breath was ragged. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your fucking humans, Susan.\u201d</p><p>He shook her, slamming her head back against the glass. Stars exploded before her eyes. Bloodred stars. \u201cIt takes a hell of a lot more than a few knife wounds to kill me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d see what it took, Susan thought, her world a blur of pain and blood. She\u2019d keep stabbing him until the bastard went down.</p><p>Straining, she struggled to bring the knife between them.</p><p>He should have been weak. His blood was all around her. On her skin. Soaking her clothes. Covering the glass of the booth.</p><p>His hold tightened around her throat. The knife was slippery in her hand, wet from too much blood. If she could just\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came out here, sweetheart,\u201d he gritted the words and glared down at her with black eyes. \u201cNice deserted spot. No one around for miles. The perfect place to die.\u201d</p><p>Her thundering heart shook her entire body. \u201cDon\u2019t! Just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late. He jerked his hand, twisting her head hard to the right and breaking her neck in one fast move.</p> <p>The knife slipped from her hand and landed on the floor of the phone booth with a clatter.</p><p>He held her a moment, enjoying the feel of her twisted neck beneath his fingers. Then he smiled and let her body fall.</p><p>Todd was called to the crime scene on Thomas Boulevard the next morning at a little after 8 A.M. When he\u2019d awoken, Cara had been gone, and he wondered for the fifth time since leaving his place why the woman had disappeared on him without a word.</p><p>He pulled his car to a stop, jumped out, automatically reached for the latex gloves he\u2019d brought in his jacket, only to be stopped short by Colin.</p><p>There was worry in his eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Cara?\u201d</p> <p>Todd frowned at that. \u201cHell if I know.\u201d But he\u2019d be finding out, soon.</p><p>Colin\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cWhen did you see her last?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cIs this another hit by our killer? Damn it, I wondered why we got the call on this one.\u201d So what was happening?</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a hotel around, but had the Bondage Killer struck again? And was Colin trying to pin this one on Cara? Not gonna happen. \u201cLook, man, Cara has an alibi, she was with me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, at my place, in my bed, until seven this morning.\u201d When he\u2019d heard the soft click of the door closing behind her.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t saying she committed this crime\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what were you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin grunted. \u201cYou sure she was with you until seven?\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders seemed to relax. \u201cThought it was her at first, but the smell was off, the freckles weren\u2019t right and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Blue eyes held his. \u201cGo see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d been trying to do just that when Colin had stopped him. Shouldering past his partner, Todd headed for the phone booth just beyond the crossing lines of yellow tape. Even from the distance, he could see the blood lining the glass. \u201cShit. Someone really did a number on the vic\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot the victim\u2019s blood,\u201d Colin said from behind him. \u201cThe victim died from a broken neck.\u201d</p><p>He was at the phone booth now. Todd glanced down, and felt as if he\u2019d just taken a knife to the chest. \u201cShe...looks like Cara.\u201d</p><p>Not a perfect match. But the hair was the same. The nose. The brow. This woman\u2019s chin was bit more curved and she had a line of freckles on her nose, but\u2014damn, it was a close resemblance.</p><p>\u201cThe uniforms on scene recognized her from the station...or they thought they did. They called the captain\u2014he told me to get down here ASAP.\u201d</p><p>It could have been Cara.</p><p>The woman looked so much like her that she could have been her sister.</p><p>A woman who was a copy of Cara, murdered near a phone booth just hours after his mystery call.</p><p>No damn way that was a coincidence. Clearing his throat, he asked, \u201cHave you run the phone records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sent out the order.\u201d A pause. \u201cWhen I got the call from McNeal, he told me not to notify you yet. I-I didn\u2019t know what was happening, and I thought you should be in the loop\u2014\u201d Colin broke off, shaking his head. \u201cMan, if I\u2019d known that he thought it was your lady, I never would have called you in\u2014\u201d</p><p>Your lady. The remorse in Colin\u2019s voice was undeniable. \u201cIt\u2019s not Cara.\u201d But, what if it had been? What if he\u2019d arrived and found her bloodstained body, lying broken in the phone booth.</p><p>No. His hands fisted. He wasn\u2019t even gonna think about shit like that. His lady, as Colin had so aptly put it, was a strong demon.</p><p>No one would hurt her.</p><p>No one. Todd forced his gaze away from the woman\u2019s face. Sweat beaded his brow.</p><p>Do the job.</p><p>He had to focus. Do what needed to be done.</p><p>Then he could get the hell out of there.</p><p>Not Cara.</p><p>He moved forward, being careful not to disturb the victim. His gaze locked on the small identification square just below the phone.</p><p>The plastic screen that covered the phone number for the booth was spattered with blood, but he could still make out the numbers.</p><p>He exhaled heavily. A damn match. He turned his attention to a still shaken-looking Colin. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find my number was the last one dialed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a call last night, this morning, hell, around four a.m.\u201d The call could\u2019ve come moments before the victim\u2019s time of death. \u201cA woman told me that Cara\u2019s alibis were crap. That the staff at Paradise Found were lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would they be doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Niol told them to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe call came from this number.\u201d He pointed to the small sign. This case just kept throwing him one damn surprise after another.</p><p>He whistled as he glanced around the booth and saw nothing but blood. \u201cThe lady must have done a hell of a number on her attacker.\u201d</p><p>Thank God it hadn\u2019t been Cara.</p><p>\u201cThere was a knife beside her body,\u201d Colin said. \u201cIt\u2019s already been tagged and bagged.\u201d</p><p>The stench of blood had him swallowing and stepping back. Well, a knife would explain the blood, if...\u201cShouldn\u2019t there be another dead body here?\u201d He asked quietly. Someone had sure bled out like a stuck pig, and no human could survive that kind of blood loss.</p><p>No human. He met Colin\u2019s stare, understanding hitting him with the force of a blow right to the face.</p><p>\u201cIt takes a lot to kill certain people,\u201d was all Colin said.</p><p>Not people. Other.</p><p>Sonofabitch. \u201cJust how fast,\u201d he asked quietly, too quietly for the other cops to hear, \u201cdo demons heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom wounds like this?\u201d Colin exhaled, then said, \u201cA couple of days. Unless it\u2019s one of the level-tens\u2014and even for one like that, healing would take some time\u2014at least twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019d better move, fast. \u201cYou got this scene secured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I got the scene. Smith\u2019s on her way. So is the captain.\u201d He whistled. \u201cBastard\u2019s gonna bawl my ass out when he finds out you were here.\u201d A wince. \u201cWhat I deserve, though, man, I\u2019m sorry, if it had been her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d He turned away from the body. The scene would be safe. He could trust Colin to handle this end for him.</p><p>Todd yanked off his gloves and began heading for his car, his long strides almost a run.</p><p>\u201cBrooks! Damn it! Wait!\u201d</p><p>He paused, but only for a moment. \u201cIf the killer can heal as fast as you say, then time\u2019s running out, partner.\u201d Every minute that passed was more time for the killer to heal. \u201cYou lead things here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and met Colin\u2019s stare. His partner wasn\u2019t going to like this. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Colin started cursing. \u201cNo, wait, not without backup\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of the body,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this time, I\u2019ll take care of Niol.\u201d</p><p>The bastard really hadn\u2019t been on his list of suspects, until that call came last night. After mentioning the demon\u2019s name, the lady had met one hell of a violent end.</p><p>Coincidence? He didn\u2019t buy those anymore.</p><p>Oh, yeah, it was past time for him to see the devil.</p><p>And to find out if he bled.</p><p>\u201cI want to see your boss.\u201d The two assholes at the door just smirked at Todd when he gave his order.</p><p>I\u2019m not in the damn mood for this. He brushed back the edge of his jacket, let his holster show. \u201cI said I want to see your fucking boss.\u201d</p><p>They stopped smirking. The big, bald one\u2014 Jesus, did that guy ever sleep? \u2014stepped toward him, arms crossed over his barrel-like chest. \u201cNiol\u2019s busy now.\u201d</p><p>Busy doing what? Trying to staunch the flow of blood from knife wounds? \u201cLet me in.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t have a warrant, probably couldn\u2019t even get one, but he wasn\u2019t leaving until he talked to Niol.</p><p>He no longer even thought for a moment that Cara was a suspect in the Bondage case.</p><p>But she could very well be a victim.</p><p>God but that dead woman had looked so much like her...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got another dead body, one that points to Niol, and unless you want every human cop in Atlanta stationed at this door, twenty-four-seven, you\u2019ll let me inside.\u201d</p><p>The bald bastard stared him down. Todd glared right back at him. Finally, the guy cursed and lifted his radio. Then he muttered,</p><p>\u201cTell Niol company\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, clearing the way.</p><p>Todd grunted as he brushed by him and the other bouncer, a tall, lanky fellow with beady eyes who glared daggers at him.</p><p>Inside, Paradise Found was quiet. Dead quiet. The last time he\u2019d come during the day for a confrontation with Niol, the place had been exactly the same.</p><p>Apparently the local ghouls weren\u2019t much for daytime partying.</p><p>Now if he could just find that ass\u2014</p><p>A door marked \u2018PRIVATE\u2019 opened to the left. Niol stepped forward, carefully shutting the door behind him. He quirked a brow as his gaze met Todd\u2019s. \u201cAh, Detective, I was wondering when I\u2019d be seeing you again. From what my bartender Cameron tells me, you\u2019ve become quite the addict here. But then, your kind tends to get addicted so easily.\u201d</p><p>The bastard didn\u2019t look injured. His dark hair was brushed back from his high forehead. His black eyes glinted as he stared at him.</p><p>\u201cCameron says that, huh?\u201d Cameron talked too damn much. Todd\u2019s gaze slanted toward the bar. No sign of the punk.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t there for Cameron, anyway. Another fight for another day.</p><p>Time to cut through the bullshit. \u201cI\u2019ve got a dead body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d Niol drawled, breaking across his words. \u201cYou boys at the Atlanta PD sure do keep busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe victim looks a hell of a lot like one of your singers, Cara Maloan.\u201d</p><p>Not so much as a flicker of his expression. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, really.\u201d He clenched his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got reason,\u201d damn good reason, \u201cto believe the victim managed to injure her attacker before he killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe? You\u2019re sure the killer is a man?\u201d</p><p>No, he just had the damn strong suspicion that Niol was the killer in question. \u201cThis victim called me last night.\u201d Hadn\u2019t been completely proven yet since the woman who could prove the call was stone dead, but lying to Niol wasn\u2019t a crime. It was perfect bait. \u201cTold me that you\u2019d been getting your workers to lie about Cara\u2019s alibis.\u201d</p><p>Now Niol frowned and took a few steps away from the closed door. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you used some of that demon bullshit power of yours and made \u2019em think they were telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>Niol tapped his chin. \u201cFinally figured things out, have you, Detective? It certainly took you long enough.\u201d</p><p>He hated this asshole.</p><p>\u201cBut your education is still very much lacking.\u201d Niol sauntered toward the bar. \u201cDemon magic doesn\u2019t generally work on other demons. And my staff here, well, aside from the occasional witch\u2014who, by the way, would be immune to my power, too\u2014well, they\u2019re all pureblood demons.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Cameron suddenly appeared behind the bar, looking a bit pale as he pushed a dark red liquid toward Niol and a whiskey toward Todd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to drink,\u201d Todd snapped. Not even 10 A.M. What was with these demons?</p><p>Niol took a slow sip from his glass. \u201cNo, of course not. Thanks, Cameron.\u201d He glanced at Todd. \u201cYou\u2019re here to find out if I\u2019ve got some kind of wounds, right? From the attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cameron headed toward the back of the bar, disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to show you anything. I mean, a demon\u2019s body is his own, now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A taunting smile curved his lips once again. \u201cI think you\u2019re playing out of your league, human. Way out. Perhaps you\u2019d better leave and send the shifter back. At least he\u2019s strong enough to handle all the players in the game.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s control snapped. He could still smell that woman\u2019s blood. See Cara\u2019s face. And he wasn\u2019t in the mood to be jerked around by a demon. He lunged at Niol, grabbed him and slammed the guy back against the bar. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you fucking with one of my singers?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d break him apart. He pulled back his fist, ready to wreck Niol\u2019s face and\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop, Todd!\u201d</p><p>Cara\u2019s voice.</p><p>His head snapped to the left. There she was. Standing just outside the door Niol had exited moments before.</p><p>His arm shook with the effort of holding back his punch. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He didn\u2019t release Niol and didn\u2019t drop his hand, though part of him was surprised the demon wasn\u2019t using his mojo to send him flying across the room.</p><p>Cara glanced down at Niol, then back to him. \u201cI work here, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, you don\u2019t.\u201d Wednesdays through Saturdays. He\u2019d confirmed her schedule long ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm, good memory, cop,\u201d Niol murmured.</p><p>Cara\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cI still have to come in and get my check and\u2014talk with Niol about the band.\u201d</p><p>And spout lame-ass lies to him.</p> <p>\u201cTake off your shirt,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Cara blinked. \u201cUh, Todd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you!\u201d She\u2019d damn well better not think of stripping in front of Niol. His fist dropped and his hands clenched the front of Niol\u2019s black shirt. \u201cHim!\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s eyes\u2014eyes that were just as dark as Cara\u2019s when she dropped the glamour, but lacking the warmth he saw in her stare\u2014</p><p>narrowed. \u201cDespite what you may have heard, Detective, I really do prefer to be wined first. And I prefer my partners to be female.\u201d</p> <p>Fucking asshole. \u201cCut the crap and take off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>The scent of sex and lavender floated around him as Cara scrambled to his side. \u201cNiol didn\u2019t kill that woman. He didn\u2019t even know about her until I told him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon hearing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother part of your lacking education,\u201d Niol said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much stronger than a human\u2019s. Not shifter strong, of course, but...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI heard everything you said to Niol.\u201d</p> <p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cAnd I heard everything that woman told you on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And that part, he did know. Cara had been right beside him when he got the call\u2014even a human would have heard the conversation. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you would have come running to him.\u201d That she had done so made Todd angry.</p><p>Furious. Okay, fucking pissed.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have turned to Niol, she should have turned to him.</p><p>\u201cCara and I go way back.\u201d Niol\u2019s voice held the intimate tone of a lover and it made every muscle in Todd\u2019s body stiffen. \u201cShe trusts me.\u201d</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t have to say the rest. It was implied. And she doesn\u2019t trust you.</p><p>\u201cTake off your damned shirt.\u201d He wasn\u2019t there to find out which of them knew Cara better. He wasn\u2019t there to play the jealous lover, though he sure as hell could have nailed that part.</p> <p>\u201cTake your hands off me,\u201d Niol snapped, and the mask that he\u2019d been wearing began to crack as shards of anger pierced his words.</p><p>Todd stared down at him. Waited one beat, two.</p><p>Then he released him. \u201cYour turn. Get the shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Niol glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do a damned thing for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me.\u201d Cara touched his arm and the move had Todd biting back a snarl. \u201cJust show him, for me.\u201d</p><p>Niol caught her hand. Brought it to his lips and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. \u201cOnly for you.\u201d Then he rose, yanked the black T-shirt over his head, and exposed a chest that was completely unmarred. He lifted a brow at Todd. \u201cThat good enough for you, or do I need to drop my pants, too?\u201d</p><p>The phone booth had been small. The blood splatter marks had been high on the glass\u2014so the perp must have been injured in the upper portion of his body.</p><p>Not below the waist.</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Niol winked at Cara. \u201cAnd what about for you, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Todd answered for her.</p><p>Cara shook her head, mouth tightening. \u201cLook, stop acting like a jerk. Niol did what you wanted, he\u2019s shown you every courtesy\u2014\u201d</p><p>And just how many courtesies had he shown her? \u201cI found a woman\u2019s body less than an hour ago. A woman who looked almost exactly like you.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cHer body was in a phone booth outside of town. She\u2019d been left there, like some kind of broken doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who called you\u2014she\u2019s really dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it was her.\u201d Odds were damn high that it was.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut for a moment, then she opened them and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here, Todd.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ll think it\u2019s crazy, but I-I believe someone\u2019s trying to set me up for murder.\u201d</p><p>Not crazy. \u201cAnd you came to Niol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t told anyone to lie for me! My alibis were good. That woman,\u201d she swallowed, \u201cif-if that\u2019s the one whose body you found, she was lying. And there\u2019s only one reason she\u2019d call like that and lie to a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wanted to take Cara down,\u201d Niol said, making no move to put his shirt back on. Instead, he reached for his drink, and took another slow sip. \u201cThe vics were all linked to Cara, weren\u2019t they, cop?\u201d</p><p>All but the last one. Thomas Monroe\u2014and his murder hadn\u2019t fit the MO.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got these bodies, these men who are all somehow tied to Cara, even if she didn\u2019t know them, and they wind up dead.</p><p>Men in the peak of health. Dead.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the bar. \u201cAnd they bear the mark of a sex demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccubus,\u201d Todd snapped.</p><p>Niol quirked a brow. \u201cInteresting, isn\u2019t it, that all the clerks at the hotels just happened to see a blond woman fitting Cara\u2019s description\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know about that?\u201d Todd demanded.</p><p>Niol blinked. \u201cYou do realize that demons make up a good third of your force, don\u2019t you, Detective?\u201d Another sip of his drink, then, \u201cWhere was I? Oh, yes, the clerks all described a woman like Cara, the victims are all killed by the touch of a sex demon, and at one scene, well, damn, you even find Cara\u2019s ID, all nice and neat and just waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Cara\u2019s eyes were on his.</p><p>\u201cThe killer was shoving her down your throat.\u201d Another sip. \u201cSo to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Todd,\u201d Cara said, her tone fierce. \u201cSomeone is setting me up. I can\u2019t prove it yet, but I will, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm, jerked her toward him. So close. He wanted to kiss her. He wanted to claim her. He wanted to tell Niol to get the hell away from her. Instead, his fingers curled tight around her.</p><p>\u201cTodd? I\u2019m being set up, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I fucking know that by now, baby?\u201d Then, because he couldn\u2019t stand the stark look in her eyes, he kissed her.</p><p>Deep and hard, and tried not to feel the swirling cold in his gut.</p><p>A cold that was instinct, rearing its head.</p><p>His succubus was in danger.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be strong enough to keep her safe.</p><p>But he was damn well going to try.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really getting sick of this damn police station,\u201d Cara growled as Todd pulled her across the bull pen and toward his desk, a desk that was overflowing with paperwork.</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d He raised a hand and waved one of the uniforms over to them. \u201cMark, I need you to watch her.\u201d</p><p>Watch her? What the hell was she now? Some kind of dog? Cara set her back teeth.</p><p>Mark gave a firm nod.</p><p>Todd pushed her toward his chair. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>The man was going to piss her off in about five seconds.</p><p>\u201cDetective?\u201d Mark frowned up at him. Probably because he didn\u2019t know if she was a suspect or some poor victim who needed protection.</p><p>She was neither, damn it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to find the captain.\u201d Todd pointed to Cara. \u201cKeep an eye on her. Do not let her leave.\u201d</p><p>She gritted, \u201cTodd, this is absolutely unnecessary\u2014\u201d The guy had been in some kind of freak mode ever since they\u2019d left Paradise Found.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damn well necessary. Consider yourself in protective custody, baby.\u201d He kissed her. Hard. Fast. \u201cUntil I can determine what the hell is going on, I\u2019m going to make certain you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>And that was why she was currently surrounded by cops. She grabbed his hand. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d He sure didn\u2019t seem to be understanding the whole demon part of the equation.</p><p>She was a powerful supernatural creature. Not a level-ten, but still strong enough to kick most folks\u2019 asses. The guy had to stop judging her by the surface skin.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d His voice was pitched low, too low for the young cop to catch. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re dealing with, and until we know just who we\u2019re up against, you\u2019re going to be under police protection.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to find Colin and the captain, and see if they know more about our Jane Doe.\u201d A hard stare. \u201cStay here and stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shot to the uniformed cop. \u201cDon\u2019t let her out of your sight, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...try not to smell her.\u201d Said with a frown.</p><p>Mark blinked. \u201cUh, sir?\u201d</p><p>Another hard kiss. Then he pulled away from her and marched across the room.</p><p>And left her with the junior policeman for protection.</p><p>Cara sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>Then she started trying to figure out who hated her enough to kill.</p><p>One name came instantly to mind. Lance Danvers.</p><p>But that bastard was dead. Had been for the last seven years.</p><p>She\u2019d seen the body. Touched the cold flesh.</p><p>Yeah, he was dead.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d been the one to arrange his meeting with the devil.</p><p>\u201cWe got an ID on the victim,\u201d Colin said, pushing a file toward Todd. \u201cSusan Dobbs. Her prints were in the system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast. I mean, it\u2019s been what? Five, six hours since the body was found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis case has the highest priority,\u201d McNeal said. \u201cI expect everything to go fast. \u201d</p><p>Duly noted. Todd flipped over the manila folder. Glanced at the black-and-white photo of the woman in her mug shot. \u201cWhat\u2019d she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Dobbs liked to cut men up with knives,\u201d McNeal said, leaning back in his chair with a groan of leather. \u201cStarted when she was a kid. Made a habit of the killings for the next fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>Killing with a knife. Sure as hell fit for the Monroe murder. But for the others...\u201cShe\u2019s human, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily thinks so,\u201d Colin told him.</p><p>Todd\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cRun that by me again.\u201d</p><p>McNeal cleared his throat. \u201cThe doctor, she\u2019s good at sensing these things.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cIf Em says the vic\u2019s not Other, she isn\u2019t.\u201d Colin sounded absolutely definite.</p><p>Okay, well, that meant...\u201cSusan wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill the other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by herself,\u201d his partner said.</p><p>It was the conclusion they all had no choice but to reach. Todd turned his stare onto the captain. \u201cIt\u2019s a setup, sir. I don\u2019t know who is doing it, and I don\u2019t know why, but my gut tells me Cara is deliberately being tied to these crimes.\u201d</p><p>The captain grunted. \u201cYou think the killer was using the blonde to throw suspicion on Cara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a dead ringer for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could just be coincidence,\u201d Colin pointed out.</p><p>Todd snorted. Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cThe woman could\u2019ve been a lure, though,\u201d Colin continued, tapping his chin. \u201cEm said that vamps use them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Colin stopped his tapping. \u201cA lure. Something nice and flashy to catch the attention of the humans so that they never see the monsters coming until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA succubus shouldn\u2019t need a lure.\u201d The wheels in Todd\u2019s head were turning, fast. A succubus was a lure. So why use Susan?</p><p>Why bring her in unless...Todd shook his head. \u201cWhat do we know about Susan Dobb\u2019s personal relationships?\u201d</p><p>Colin reached into his pocket and flipped out his notebook. \u201cHer mom\u2019s in jail, her father was never on the scene, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, her sexual relationships. Has anyone checked\u2014\u201d</p><p>He closed the notebook. \u201cBryant did.\u201d</p><p>Bryant was the newest detective in the department. A quiet guy who\u2019d transferred up from Miami just a few months back.</p><p>\u201cSusan liked men\u2014a lot of them.\u201d His brows lifted. \u201cWhat? Do you want him to get you specifics?\u201d</p><p>Todd slanted him a hard look. \u201cCara said Michael House was straight. That he would have only gone to the hotel with a woman.\u201d</p><p>A woman who looked a lot like his ex? \u201cFuck. A succubus shouldn\u2019t need a lure,\u201d he repeated as excitement pumped through him. He might just be figuring this shit out. \u201cA woman wouldn\u2019t need to use Susan, but a man\u2014he sure as hell would.\u201d</p><p>Colin whistled. \u201cSusan could\u2019ve brought in the men, tied \u2019em up with the promise of some wild sex.\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s fingers flattened on his desk. \u201cAnd instead just made them helpless and got them ready for the kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d One damn good supposition. \u201cMaybe she tied the guys up because if they\u2019d seen who was really waiting for them, they never would have been into the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have waited in the closet...\u201d Colin\u2019s eyes were thoughtful. \u201cOr in one of those small-ass bathrooms.\u201d He spoke the last softly, as if to himself.</p><p>Hell, yeah, that was exactly what Todd was thinking. \u201cIt could have happened,\u201d he said. Maybe it had happened just that way.</p><p>\u201cAn incubus?\u201d McNeal asked.</p><p>\u201cIt would explain the print.\u201d Because that was the mark of a sex demon\u2014succubus or incubus. \u201cIf the guy wanted to drain the humans, he would have needed to get their sexual energy pumped up\u2014he would have used Susan for that.\u201d The woman had been a looker, just like his Cara. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo Susie gets the men tied up, gets them horny,\u201d Colin murmured, \u201cthen our incubus comes in. He gives them a touch and kills the poor bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs he takes their power and lives\u2014 yes!\u201d It made sense. Every bit of it made sense. \u201cThis guy, whoever he is, I think he chose Susan Dobbs because she looked like Cara. He dumped Cara\u2019s purse at the third crime scene so we\u2019d pick her up, and he\u2019s been choosing men that are all linked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Monroe.\u201d Colin straightened. \u201cWe can\u2019t find any link to him and Cara\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The pieces fell into place. \u201cBecause that guy was Susan\u2019s kill, hers alone. Think about it.\u201d He paused a moment, then lifted his fingers as he counted off the reasons, saying, \u201cShe stabbed him. She\u2019s got a long history with knives, we all know that. She left the room a wreck, left evidence behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scene was nothing like the others,\u201d McNeal agreed grimly.</p><p>\u201cBecause the killer was different.\u201d Todd knew it with every cell in his body. \u201cShe killed him. I bet if we dig, we\u2019ll find a connection between her and Monroe, something personal.\u201d The woman had snapped\u2014killed in an undeniable fit of rage. There had been so many knife wounds in the guy\u2019s chest...</p><p>\u201cShit. So what, we had some damn team killing together\u2014\u201d McNeal began.</p><p>\u201cUntil Susan broke the rules.\u201d He thought about the cold, quick death Susan had received. \u201cThen she had to be punished.\u201d But just who had punished her? The lady had tried to lead him to Niol, but the demon appeared to be clean.</p> <p>Though appearances could sure as hell be deceiving. He was learning more about the truth of that old saying every day.</p><p>\u201cIf Monroe wasn\u2019t a planned kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen our guy probably got real pissed at Susan.\u201d Because she\u2019d broken his control. Destroyed the layout of his nice, neat little game. \u201cSo pissed that the lady wound up with a broken neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we\u2019re dealing with an incubus, why didn\u2019t he just drain her?\u201d Colin shook his head. \u201cHe could have gotten her energy and\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fought him.\u201d Todd could still see the blood staining the walls of the phone booth. \u201cMaybe he intended to use the touch on her, but Susan had her knife, and once she started stabbing, he snapped her neck.\u201d</p> <p>McNeal sighed. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m tired of this shit in my city. What ever happened to keeping a low profile? Why does this asshole want to stir things up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he going after Cara?\u201d Todd fired back.</p><p>Colin rolled his shoulders, a ripple of movement. \u201cGotta be personal.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was what he figured, and what scared him.</p><p>\u201cNiol was clean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly at the captain\u2019s question. \u201cDoubt I\u2019d ever say that, but there weren\u2019t any wounds.\u201d</p><p>Colin lifted a brow. \u201cAnd the guy\u2019s not a sex demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncubus,\u201d he corrected, almost automatically. \u201cJust what the hell is that guy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who could fry this town if he wanted,\u201d McNeal said, voice rough. \u201cA level-ten who likes to play on the dark side.\u201d</p><p>Niol was definitely cold enough to kill, but he wasn\u2019t an incubus. And there\u2019d been no knife wounds on his body.</p><p>So, as much as he wanted to put the demon away, he wasn\u2019t looking like the killer.</p><p>Which meant the bastard was still out there, somewhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at this all wrong.\u201d They\u2019d thought the woman was the primary, but Susan Dobbs had just been a pawn.</p><p>The real serial was still out there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping Cara in protective custody until we catch the bastard.\u201d Probably should have asked permission from the captain first, but screw that, his woman was in danger, and he would be keeping her safe.</p><p>Colin cleared his throat. \u201cAh, how does she feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His stare was on the captain. \u201cI think she\u2019s in danger.\u201d Those instincts of his were screaming at him. Cara would have said his sensitivity was charging up \u2014 hell, whatever it was, he knew that the lady was in danger.</p><p>And he was going to keep her safe.</p><p>The captain gave him an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cDo we need to take her to a safe house?\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the captain\u2019s door. Peeked through the blinds. Cara was still sitting in his chair. Mark was stationed at her side.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d He\u2019d like to keep her at his place, but he knew someone could have already staked out his home.</p><p>No, better to take her someplace secret.</p><p>Even if she raged at him, and he was certain she would.</p><p>He reached for the knob. \u201cI\u2019d better go break the news to the lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Brooks!\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Colin\u2019s call, opening the door just a few inches. The rumble of voices from the bull pen drifted in to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I came in here, I called the phone company, pulled a few strings.\u201d One brow lifted. \u201cThe last call Susan Dobbs made wasn\u2019t to your place.\u201d</p><p>Now that got his attention. \u201cWhat? No, she called\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I know\u2014but the call to your place wasn\u2019t the last one she made.\u201d Colin stood, stepped toward him. \u201cI got the number and guess who answered on the second ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Not Niol, it couldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe newswoman. Holly Storm.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cI sent a squad car after her. Ms. Storm should be here any minute for a little interrogation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He was curious as all hell to learn just why Susan had contacted the reporter. Had she been offering Storm a tell-all interview? A scoop on the killer that the cops were trying so hard to keep under wraps?</p><p>Damn. Just how much did the reporter know? And how deep was she involved in this mess?</p><p>\u201cShe could\u2014\u201d</p><p>The silence hit him then. The absolute and complete silence from the bull pen.</p><p>The rumble of voices had quieted now. He saw Colin stiffen, and Todd turned back toward the door, peering through the crack he\u2019d made.</p><p>Then he heard words that chilled his soul. \u201cPut the gun down and we can talk.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? He pulled the door open another two inches. Caught sight of a kid with long, greasy hair. As Todd watched, the kid turned in wide circles, a gun clutched in his trembling hands.</p><p>No, not a kid. The guy looked like he was in his early twenties. Too old to be pulling something stupid like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The captain\u2019s voice. McNeal had sidled across the room. He peered over Todd\u2019s shoulder and hissed out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking nail some bastard to the wall for this!\u201d</p><p>Because someone had left an unsecured weapon out in the open and now they were all in serious shit.</p><p>Then the punk with the gun made the mistake of lunging forward and grabbing Cara.</p><p>Todd\u2019s hand went to his holster as he ran out of the room.</p><p>Well, damn if her day didn\u2019t just suck.</p><p>She\u2019d been watching the rumpled human male with half an eye, her mind on the murders, when the guy suddenly lunged for the desk on the far left.</p><p>He\u2019d come up with a gun and every cop in the area had frozen.</p><p>Now he had a too-tight grip on her arm. The scent of fear and unwashed skin flooded her nostrils.</p><p>The barrel of the gun came dangerously close to her face.</p><p>No, not a damn good day.</p><p>\u201cStay back or I\u2019ll fucking kill her!\u201d</p><p>The arm he\u2019d looped around her neck tightened.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Todd. He was advancing on the man, on them, eyes narrowed, face hard with rage. He had his gun out.</p><p>Cara realized if she didn\u2019t do something, fast, her day was about to go from bad to sheer hell.</p><p>Because she sure wasn\u2019t just going to stand there, be strangled, threatened, and then watch her cop get hurt.</p><p>Not when she could so easily stop the jerk who held her.</p><p>Todd might not like the methods she was about to use, but there wasn\u2019t much of an option.</p><p>Besides, perhaps it was time for him to see that she truly wasn\u2019t the helpless damsel that he thought she was.</p><p>\u201cI goin\u2019 out of here, and I\u2019m takin\u2019 this bitch with me!\u201d The guy snarled, spittle flying from his mouth.</p><p>Her hands lifted, yanked on the arm and freed her throat. \u201cNo,\u201d she told him softly, \u201cyou\u2019re not.\u201d Breathing deeply, she dropped her control and let her pheromones fill the air.</p><p>The guy was so close to her that he got a direct hit. He spun her around to face him, eyes wide, mouth open.</p><p>She smiled at him. Pitched her voice low and poured on the compulsion as she said, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>The gun hit the floor with a clatter as he locked his lips on hers.</p><p>The air pulsed with his sexual energy. It was an energy much darker than Todd\u2019s. And weaker. So much weaker.</p><p>But energy was energy\u2014and the little bastard had threatened her.</p><p>So she\u2019d take a bit of his power for herself.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>Her hand rose. Touched his chest, and, with her kiss and touch, she pulled the man\u2019s lust and power right out of him.</p><p>The sweet rush heated her blood. Oh, but it had been so long since she\u2019d just let herself go. Just let herself take and take and take.</p><p>His body trembled against hers. A strangled moan bubbled in his throat and the heart that thumped beneath her hand began to slow.</p><p>Then to skip beats.</p><p>She pulled her mouth from his. Watched his bleary green eyes drift closed.</p><p>And then man fell backward, landing on the floor with a thud.</p><p>Cara inhaled deeply and caught the power still floating in the air. A faint shine lit her skin.</p><p>Sweet, sweet power.</p><p>Her head turned. She saw the stares then. The slack expressions on many of the male officers\u2019 faces. Her gaze darted past them, caught sight of\u2014</p><p>Smith. The ME stood near the elevator, hands fisted, mouth open, and eyes wide with horror.</p><p>Just great.</p><p>And a few feet away from Smith stood\u2014</p><p>Another woman. A redhead. She waited between two cops, just a little past Smith. She stared right back at Cara. Not with the horror that Smith had, but with a kind of stark curiosity on her face.</p><p>As she focused on the woman\u2019s face, the flare of her hunger and rage began to fade, and reality slowly raised its head.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>But there was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you doing?\u201d The roar came from Todd as he grabbed the gun, then secured the weapon. He caught her arms, pulling her close to him. \u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Forced herself to meet his dark stare. Anger. No, fury. Jealousy.</p><p>Fear?</p><p>She could see it all. Swirling in those eyes.</p><p>She could feel the emotions beating at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is who I am.\u201d Gyth was on the floor next to the still man, checking for a pulse. \u201cI told you, I can take care of myself.\u201d And punish those who threatened her.</p><p>Or those she cared for in this world.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Gyth said, jaw tight.</p><p>\u201cOf course, he is!\u201d She snapped. Did they think she had no control? \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to kill him.\u201d Jeez. If she had wanted the idiot dead, the guy would have been at hell\u2019s gate. \u201cI was just trying to stop him from hurting anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull it back.\u201d Todd\u2019s whisper was laced with steel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scent...\u201d He swallowed. \u201cPull it back before I have to start beating sense into this pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019ll take some time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m getting you the hell out of here, baby.\u201d He grabbed her wrist, yanked her through the crowd, and took her down a long, winding corridor.</p><p>Glancing back over her shoulder, the last person she saw was Gyth. He watched her with the sharp eyes of a shifter.</p><p>One predator, measuring another.</p><p>He pushed Cara into the old interrogation room, the one that hadn\u2019t been used for anything but storage during the last six months.</p><p>The door slammed closed behind them, then he pounced.</p><p>His hands locked around her upper arms as he held her against the mirrored glass on the left wall. \u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d</p><p>God, but the woman was beautiful. Skin seeming to fucking glow. Eyes sparkling. Mouth wet and red\u2014</p><p>From another man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>He growled, and, not giving her time to answer, he crushed his mouth to hers. Took her lips. Drove his tongue deep inside in an act of possession.</p><p>No one else. No one.</p><p>She moaned, the sound making his fully erect cock twitch with hunger.</p><p>His hands tightened on her arms, fingers digging into her flesh.</p><p>The woman was making him crazy.</p><p>His mouth lifted as he dragged in a desperate gulp of air. God, but her scent was everywhere. Driving him wild.</p><p>Pushing him to the absolute edge of his control. Not that he\u2019d ever had much to begin with, not with her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A stark demand ripped from him. She hadn\u2019t been forced to confront the perp. To use her powers. Damn it, why\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak. Not human.\u201d She licked her lips, her tongue snaking out in a quick move. \u201cI am...what you saw. You have to un-understand that.\u201d Her voice was shook just a bit. Husky.</p><p>God but he wanted her naked.</p><p>The pheromones? Her magic?</p><p>Or just the woman?</p><p>\u201cI know what you are.\u201d No question in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked this earth a long time.\u201d Her eyes faded to black. \u201cSeen things, done things, that most wouldn\u2019t accept.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was important, he realized. This moment. \u201cI\u2019m not most people.\u201d</p><p>Her lips began to curl, but then the smile that would have been vanished almost instantly. \u201cYou kissed me. Knowing what I can do, after you saw\u2014you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. Hard. Thrust his tongue past those perfect white teeth and savored the warmth of her mouth.</p> <p>Not enough.</p><p>His hands dropped to her hips. She was wearing a dress. A slinky, sexy-as-hell black dress that fit her body like a second skin and skirted the top of her knees.</p><p>His mouth moved to her neck. He licked. Sucked. Bit. Whispered, \u201cHell, yeah, I still kissed you. You\u2019re mine. \u201d Time for them to both realize that fact.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know the real me, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words had him pulling back, glaring down at her. \u201cI know everything that matters. I know the demon. I know the woman. I fucking want them both.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed the fabric of her dress, hiked it up to her waist. \u201cAnd you want me.\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again, Cara. Don\u2019t take another when I\u2019m near\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her black eyes widened. \u201cI would never take another while I\u2019m with you. Never. Back there, that was a succubus fighting. That is our way. We fight, we kill, with just a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Scary shit.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to see me,\u201d she whispered the words as his hands caressed the warm flesh of her hips. \u201cNot the woman you think I am, but what I\u2019m like inside. What I can do.\u201d She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are exactly who I think you are.\u201d He was still furious as hell, but the rage was channeling fast into a white-hot need, a need that had been stirred in the bull pen, but ignited to a flash point once he\u2019d gotten her alone and tasted her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak. Not some simple prey.\u201d She whispered the words again.</p><p>He stared into her eyes. Ancient eyes. Mysterious. \u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, \u201cyou sure as hell aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be dangerous\u2014I don\u2019t want to hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Was the woman trying to warn him off? Because it was far too late for that. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He eased down in front of her, bending to his knees.</p><p>\u201cTodd? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, but I need you, Cara, I need you. \u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek, her fingers moving in a featherlight caress. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter to you, does it?\u201d</p> <p>He turned his hand. Pressed a hot kiss against her palm. \u201cDemon, woman, both are mine. \u201d He stared up at her. \u201cJust don\u2019t ever even think about making me prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would.\u201d Her lips curved again and her stare softened as she gazed down at him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d They would have a hell of a lot more to hash out later. But that would all come, later.</p><p>Now, he wanted her. They were alone, and his cock felt like it was going to burst.</p><p>He hiked up her skirt a little more, found the small silk of her panties. He pressed a kiss to the crotch of the underwear, putting his lips close to her covered sex and enjoying the soft feel of woman and silk against his mouth.</p><p>But he knew he wanted more.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t have long. Someone would look for them eventually. Track him down. Demand explanations.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>He caught the edge of her panties with his teeth. Tugged until the seam broke. Heard the delicious sound of her laughter.</p><p>Damn, but the woman had made him into a walking hard-on.</p><p>She spread her legs for him, needing no urging. He touched her sex. Found her creamy and ready. Just the way he wanted her.</p><p>Edging closer, he curled his fingers around the firm cheeks of her ass. Her hips rocked forward, and his mouth claimed the hot core of her body.</p><p>His tongue slid over her clit and a shudder rocked her. So good.</p><p>Yet it could be even better.</p><p>One hand slid down the curve of her ass, and his fingers curled between her legs. Found her tight opening. Todd pushed his index finger inside her.</p><p>Licked.</p><p>Another finger. Thrust harder.</p><p>A lick.</p><p>Then a slow suck on her tight point of need.</p><p>Her sex clenched around him.</p><p>Oh, hell, yes.</p><p>\u201cTodd!\u201d</p><p>A demand. Her fingers were buried in his hair. She pulled the strands once. Hard.</p><p>Growling, he lifted his head, tasting her, wanting more, and\u2014</p><p>The lust on her face drove the breath from his lungs. The raw need.</p><p>The same need he felt.</p><p>He was up in a instant, hands flying to the buckle of his belt. Their fingers met, fought, and somehow they managed to get the top of his pants undone and his cock out.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to be balls-deep in her.</p><p>Todd grabbed Cara, spun her around, and lifted her onto the old table in the middle of the room. The table groaned beneath her, the faded wood protesting, but right then, Todd didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>If they\u2019d ended up on the ground, he wouldn\u2019t have cared. As long as he\u2019d was inside her...</p><p>Her legs were open, the pink folds of her sex glistening and tempting him. He caught his cock in one hand. Lodged it against that creamy slit.</p><p>\u201cNow, love,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He thrust as deep as he could go.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>He withdrew.</p><p>Thrust.</p><p>Again. Again. Again.</p><p>He covered her mouth to muffle her moans.</p><p>To muffle his own.</p><p>His thrusts shoved the table across the floor. Cara held on to him, her fingers digging into his arms, her nails scoring his flesh.</p><p>He felt her come, that same, wild, mad fury of passion that was hers, his. That joining that he didn\u2019t understand, but longed for with every breath.</p><p>Then he was coming, his semen pumping deep into her as he stiffened and fought to hold on to his sanity.</p><p>Her hand moved, drifted to his heart.</p><p>The pleasure seemed to double. Burning through him, to her, back to him.</p><p>The room swirled around him in a flash of colors. His body quivered, his breath panted out.</p><p>When the orgasm ended, he lifted his lips, pressed a kiss to her cheek. Tasted tears.</p><p>Cara stared up at him, and her skin was so beautiful it almost hurt to look at her with that magic light spilling from her\u2014 from the inside, out.</p><p>Energy pumped through his veins. The power she\u2019d given to him.</p><p>Given, not taken.</p><p>The salt of her tears seemed to burn his mouth. \u201cCara?\u201d He\u2019d known only pleasure, and he\u2019d thought she had, too.</p><p>Her lips parted. Then the hand still over his heart pushed against him. Pushed him away.</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t want to retreat from her. Not yet.</p><p>But she was pushing him, and time had run out. The passion had barely been sated, but he\u2019d have her again.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>He eased away from her, hating the loss of the tight clasp of her body, but he\u2019d already taken enough risks. Losing his control at the station\u2014there were too many eyes in this place.</p><p>Both human, and as jerk-ass Niol had so recently pointed out, Other.</p><p>\u201cTh-there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d She stood, and the dress fell right back over her flesh.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He righted his clothes with a jerk. \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed for a second, then widened with understanding. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>She stepped away from him. \u201cI-I should have told you this sooner.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoed in the hall.</p><p>Time was definitely almost up.</p><p>He caught sight of her panties on the floor. Scooped them up. Enjoyed the feel of the cool silk against his fingers. \u201cWe need to think of a cover story. All those cops saw what you did and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand dismissively. \u201cMost won\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human men won\u2019t. The demons, well, they won\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the women?\u201d</p><p>Frustration flashed across her face. \u201cTell them I hit the guy when we kissed.\u201d</p><p>The footsteps were louder now. Closer.</p><p>\u201cTell them whatever you want! It doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Her hands fisted. \u201cBut you have to know, there\u2019s something I should have told you before.\u201d</p><p>Now the woman wanted to make some kind of confession? And he\u2019d always heard men were the ones with the piss-poor timing.</p><p>\u201cLook, we need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I did something once. Crossed the line\u2014that weak line between right and wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shifted back to blue as she stared at him. \u201cI\u2014ah, damn, this is hard.\u201d Her shoulders straightened. \u201cBut you deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus, what was the woman about to reveal? And why were his guts twisting into knots?</p><p>Because what she\u2019s about to say is going to be bad, real bad.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take psychic powers to figure that one out.</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d</p><p>A door slammed. Sounded like it was just a few feet away. Someone had to be in the small hallway now, heading straight for them.</p><p>\u201cThis can wait, when we\u2019re someplace secure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You have to hear this.\u201d She grabbed his arm. \u201cTodd, I-I\u2019ve used my powers before, deliberately to hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo try to kill.\u201d</p><p>The door to the interrogation room flew open. Todd turned to see Gyth standing in the doorway, and one look at those glittering eyes was all it took for Todd to know that his partner had just heard his lover\u2019s confession.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cNot another word, baby, not without a lawyer.\u201d Todd\u2019s face was rock hard. His voice grim.</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to hear this.\u201d Screw his partner. Todd deserved to know about her. All about her. When he\u2019d touched her earlier, kissed her, it had been so much more than just sex.</p><p>Perhaps it had been from the beginning.</p><p>No more secrets, no more lies.</p><p>She was telling him everything. Her eyes slit as she frowned up at the shifter. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, if you want to lock me up, that\u2019s fine.\u201d She\u2019d be out in less than ten minutes once she got a guard under her spell, but he could sure try tossing her butt in jail, if that made the big, bad cop feel better.</p><p>Gyth gave a slow nod.</p><p>She caught Todd\u2019s hands. Because she needed to touch him again. Because holding him made talking about the past easier. \u201cI-I had a sister once. A twin.\u201d</p><p>A dark look passed between the cops.</p><p>\u201cWe were close. Always close. But so different.\u201d The memory of Nina made her lips curve. \u201cShe was dark where I was light. Wild when I was careful. And she knew me. The hidden parts of me that even I didn\u2019t fully understand.\u201d</p><p>Not identical, but they\u2019d been a perfect match. Nina with her long, straight dark hair and her golden skin. The smile that had always lit her face and the eyes that had shined, with and without glamour.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to kill my kind.\u201d Her fingers tightened around his. \u201cDamn hard because I\u2019m a demon, and even harder because I\u2019m a succubus.\u201d Not the run-of-the-mill demon blood. So few knew that dark secret.</p><p>But he\u2019d known.</p><p>\u201cNina started seeing a human. She fell for him.\u201d A pause. \u201cI thought he cared for her.\u201d</p><p>Todd swore, obviously knowing where her story was headed. Hell, of course. Not to a sweet, happily-ever-after ending.</p><p>Demons didn\u2019t usually get those.</p><p>The shifter remained silent, watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cI felt it when she died,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was like pain stabbed straight through my soul, and in my mind, I heard her scream.\u201d</p><p>She could still hear it. Because in that last moment, her sister had cried out for her, helplessly, and Cara hadn\u2019t been able to do a damn thing to save her.</p><p>She swallowed back the grief that wanted to choke her. Years had passed, but the wound was still fresh to her. \u201cHer human killed her. The one she trusted, loved.\u201d</p><p>Todd flinched.</p><p>And it was the shifter who asked, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question she would normally answer, but these were far from normal circumstances. One of her kind was out there, killing, and the cops, well, they needed to know how to take the demon down.</p><p>\u201cWe heal fast,\u201d she said, nodding her head toward Gyth. \u201cMuch like you do, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cGunshots, knife wounds\u2014they\u2019ll hurt us, but those weapons alone won\u2019t kill a succubus or an incubus.\u201d There was really only one moment when her kind became vulnerable. Her lips twisted as her gaze darted back to Todd. \u201cI told you before, succubi believe that true power rests in the heart, not the mind.\u201d Her power certainly did.</p><p>He gave a grim nod of his head.</p><p>She lifted her hand, touched his chest and felt the strong beat of his heart beneath her palm. \u201cIn that one moment when we take from others,\u201d or give to them, but she wasn\u2019t going to mention her ability to give power, not in front of that dangerous shifter, \u201cwe are at our most vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I touch your heart,\u201d her voice dropped, \u201cThat is the time, the only time, when I\u2019m vulnerable.\u201d When the power began to stir. That first moment, as the air thickened and magic fired her blood. Her hand never moved from his chest and her eyes held his.</p><p>\u201cIn that instant, a human\u2019s weapons\u2014guns, knives\u2014they can kill my kind. A bullet in the heart. A knife. In that one moment, you can destroy a succubus or an incubus, forever.\u201d</p><p>As her voice trailed away, silence filled the room. Thick, heavy. Far too tense.</p><p>Her hand dropped from his chest and Cara stepped back.</p><p>\u201cIf Susan was working with someone...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cara stilled.</p><p>Todd\u2019s gaze met Gyth\u2019s. \u201cA man\u2014an incubus...if they were fighting and she was using her knife on him\u2014\u201d Todd broke off, shaking his head. \u201cShit. She had to be hitting close to his upper chest. You saw the spray\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gyth whistled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Damn it. She attacked him, got too close, and he couldn\u2019t risk draining her. He had to kill her fast, to save his own life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, th-that seems likely,\u201d Cara agreed quietly, her mind whirling. They thought an incubus had been working with the murdered woman?</p><p>She\u2019d been the lure.</p><p>Her lips parted. Of course! A temptation to pull in the men. It made sense. They hadn\u2019t been bound for kinky fun, they\u2019d been tied so they wouldn\u2019t fight when the incubus appeared.</p><p>No wonder she hadn\u2019t felt the draw of another succubus in the city\u2014there wasn\u2019t another one around!</p><p>The killer was an incubus...</p> <p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Cara took a deep breath. The men were still talking about the woman\u2014Susan\u2014and her death. \u201cIf she was working with an incubus, she might have known how to kill him, or maybe\u2014maybe she just got lucky.\u201d</p><p>Either way, she\u2019d wound up dead and her killer had gotten away.</p><p>Todd and Gyth glanced toward her in surprise. Okay, so \u201clucky\u201d hadn\u2019t been the best word choice. She licked her lips then said,</p><p>\u201cLook, just remember what I\u2019ve said, okay?. My kind\u2014we aren\u2019t vulnerable often, so if you have the chance to strike at the killer, well, you\u2019d better take it.\u201d</p><p>There. She\u2019d done it. Given a human and a shifter the most prized secret of her kind. A secret they\u2019d need in order to survive.</p> <p>Todd\u2019s fingers reached out and snagged her hand. Held tight. \u201cWhat happened to the man who killed your sister, Cara?\u201d</p><p>Ah, now this was the part she\u2019d dreaded from the beginning. Todd had just started to look at her as a woman, and now he\u2019d see the killer lurking inside of her pretty shell.</p><p>But perhaps it was time. She\u2019d carried this secret for too long. Seven years.</p><p>\u201cI went to him in his dreams.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s expression didn\u2019t alter. Those brown eyes of his were steady on her.</p><p>\u201cI made him weak. Made him want.\u201d It had been so easy. And she\u2019d been so furious. He\u2019d never met her, didn\u2019t know that she and Nina had a bond beyond death.</p><p>Her sister had wanted vengeance.</p><p>Cara had given it to her.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know...\u201d It was hard to say the words when he was so close, touching her. \u201cThat some can become addicted to the touch of a succubus?\u201d Like a drug addict, needing a fix. If the magic was strong enough, the human was helpless.</p><p>She\u2019d made Lance helpless. He\u2019d come to her, eyes desperate, hands sweating. He\u2019d tracked her to her home, screaming at her.</p><p>Wanting her.</p><p>And she\u2019d been ready for him. \u201cI lured him to me.\u201d So easy. \u201cWhen he found me, I touched him.\u201d She\u2019d nearly drained the bastard dry. His skin had paled. His body had trembled. Tears rained from his eyes.</p><p>The rush of power from his body had been so strong. And so dark. Tainted. Twisted.</p><p>Lance had been evil. A monster beneath the flesh of a man.</p><p>He\u2019d realized what was happening to him\u2014 too late.</p><p>His heart had lurched beneath her hand. So close to death. To the hell he deserved.</p><p>She\u2019d held him there, suspended between the world of the living and the wisps of the eternal, and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known what she meant. Knowledge had been in his eyes. He\u2019d smiled at her. \u201cB-be...cause the f-fucking...b-bitch wouldn\u2019t...give...m-me...p-power...\u201d Then, he\u2019d managed to gather his strength\u2014she still wasn\u2019t sure how the asshole had done that\u2014and he\u2019d jerked a knife out of his back pocket. One of those stupid, small, Swiss Army knives that men always carried, and he\u2019d plunged the blade right into her chest.</p><p>He\u2019d missed her heart, but the attack had thrown her off guard and the bastard had gotten away.</p><p>For a time.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d It was Gyth who asked the question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d Todd snapped, shaking his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>She tugged her hand from his. \u201cHe got away from me.\u201d True. She\u2019d regretted that, hated her failure for years.</p><p>\u201cSo the bastard\u2019s still out there?\u201d Todd asked, mouth hard. \u201cTell me his damn name and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead now.\u201d And that should really have made things easier for her. \u201cThe next day, his body was found in his apartment.</p><p>Lance killed himself.\u201d That was the story that had been in the papers, anyway.</p><p>More silence. The thick, uncomfortable kind that made her want to squirm.</p><p>\u201cIs that the whole story?\u201d Gyth asked. She slanted him a look, saw the suspicion in his eyes.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t the whole story, but she\u2019d told all of her part. She\u2019d confessed to the Monster Doctor about her attack on Lance before.</p><p>And if Lance hadn\u2019t pulled that knife\u2014</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t have regretted his death. Did that make her evil? She really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I\u2019m a killer. Yeah, that\u2019s what she\u2019d told the Monster Doctor. Because even though she hadn\u2019t been the one to take the last breath from Lance\u2019s miserable body and soul, she\u2019d still been responsible for his death.</p><p>\u201cCheck the Miami papers . They ran the stories on him for a few days.\u201d She\u2019d been living in Miami back then. The Other always liked the big cities. So easy to blend in with the throngs of people. \u201cThe article said that Lance Danvers slit his wrists and bled to death.\u201d Too messy for her taste.</p><p>But not for the demon who\u2019d killed Lance.</p><p>Suicide. Not damn likely. Not for a man like him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me this?\u201d Todd asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted you to know there\u2019s a point for humans and paranormals. We can all be pushed too far, and we can all become monsters.\u201d Because she\u2019d truly been a monster that long-ago night. One without pity. Remorse. She would have killed him, and she would have loved every minute of his death.</p><p>Her chin lifted as she faced them. She\u2019d just admitted to two cops that she\u2019d attempted murder. \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>Cara asked, voice soft.</p><p>Todd brought his mouth down on hers, hungrily taking her lips. Her hands wrapped around his arms, held on with all her strength.</p><p>Behind him, Gyth coughed.</p><p>Todd\u2019s dark head rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to thank God that bastard didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. Caught his taste. \u201cAnd what about what I did?\u201d</p><p>Todd turned slowly to face Gyth. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d A challenge. Cara could feel the tension pumping through his body.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Gyth?\u201d</p><p>The shifter\u2019s gaze met hers. Held. Finally, he said, \u201cNo crime that I see.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd I would have done the same.\u201d</p><p>His head inclined toward her slightly.</p><p>One predator to another.</p><p>The breath she\u2019d been holding expelled in a sharp rush.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me sooner,\u201d Todd muttered, bending so that his words whispered into her ear.</p><p>Yes, she should have, but the guy had already been dealing with the fact that she was a demon. She hadn\u2019t wanted him to completely freak on her.</p><p>But Todd wasn\u2019t showing any signs of freaking. Or running. Or, well, hell, the guy was actually holding pretty tightly to her.</p><p>A stab of hope shot through her heart. Maybe, just maybe, Todd would be different.</p><p>More footsteps sounded in the hallway. Hard. Determined steps. The shifter tilted his head to the right, said, \u201cMcNeal,\u201d about five seconds before the police captain shoved open the door and stalked inside.</p><p>He pointed his finger at Cara. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted. She\u2019d seen the captain a few times, but never actually spoken with the guy.</p><p>\u201cYou just put on one hell of a show in my precinct, demon.\u201d</p><p>Not human. Not completely, anyway. The understanding dawned instantly. As she\u2019d told Todd, the human males would have all forgotten.</p><p>Hmm. So just what was the tough captain? She took a step away from Todd, more than ready to defend herself. \u201cWhat I did,\u201d she said, voice fierce, \u201cwas save lives and fix the screw-up one of your officers caused!\u201d</p><p>A grunt. Then his hands flew up. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d She saw his nostrils twitch. \u201cI\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d The words were a bare thread of sound as they slipped past Gyth\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cSo is she,\u201d Todd said.</p><p>Gunmetal eyes widened. \u201cAh, you poor bastard.\u201d McNeal sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you know demons can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d</p><p>Now the guy was pissing her off. The air began to thicken around her.</p><p>\u201cShe can be.\u201d Her lover\u2019s voice sounded absolutely confident.</p><p>The captain\u2019s eyes weighed him. Her. \u201cYou willing to risk your life on that assumption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThen bring your demon into my office. It\u2019s time to clear the air and catch this damn killer before I have another stiff on my hands.\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s office was too quiet. The old phrase as silent as a tomb whispered through Cara\u2019s mind as she waited in the cramped quarters.</p><p>Cara stood near the captain\u2019s obviously fake plant, arms crossed over her chest. Todd was beside her. Gyth leaned against the edge of McNeal\u2019s desk. And McNeal, well, he was sitting behind his desk, glowering at the ME.</p><p>After what had to be at least five minutes, Smith finally cleared her throat and shifted a bit in the rather uncomfortable-looking leather chair she occupied. \u201cAre you, um, sure I can talk about the case in front of her?\u201d</p><p>Her. The ME hadn\u2019t made eye contact with Cara the entire time they\u2019d been trapped in the silence of the office.</p><p>\u201cThis is off the record, Smith.\u201d</p><p>The ME opened her mouth to protest.</p><p>\u201cOff the record. \u201d McNeal ran a hand over his face. Exhaled hard enough to shake the room, then said, \u201cWe need her help, okay?</p><p>She\u2019s got to know the facts of the case because she\u2019s the only damn one who can really tell us what the killer is like.\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019m just like the killer.</p><p>Smith\u2019s back was ramrod straight. Her shoulders far too stiff.</p><p>McNeal stabbed his finger toward Gyth. \u201cAll right\u2014let\u2019s start with the knife. Forensics said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prints were on the knife,\u201d Gyth finished. \u201cBut the hair we found belonged to Susan Dobbs.\u201d</p><p>Todd glanced at her. \u201cYou sure you didn\u2019t know the woman?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d shown her Susan\u2019s picture, and yeah, the woman looked freakily like her, but\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t know Walters, either,\u201d Gyth pointed out, \u201cand that guy had been going to Paradise for the last month to watch you.\u201d</p><p>She saw Todd stiffen. \u201cI think we need to take a step back here.\u201d He motioned toward the captain. \u201cSusan Dobbs was human.</p><p>How\u2019d she hook up with a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons are everywhere,\u201d McNeal said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have been too hard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been a hell of a lot easier for her if she\u2019d been inside Demon Central.\u201d</p><p>Gyth began to nod, obviously understanding where Todd was going.</p><p>\u201cNiol\u2019s place is a meeting point for the Other, and Cara told me once that some humans like to play in Paradise.\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s head cocked to the right. \u201cAnd you think Susan was the playing kind?\u201d</p><p>The woman had been the killing kind, so, yeah, Cara thought she was definitely the type of human who would have enjoyed playing with the Other.</p><p>\u201cNiol will know.\u201d Todd gave a quick nod. \u201cNo one gets in that place without his knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the guy will be in the mood to cooperate with the cops?\u201d Gyth asked, looking damn doubtful.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll cooperate,\u201d Cara said, voice clear. He would do it, for her.</p><p>\u201cWho is this...Nee-ole?\u201d Smith asked slowly, pronouncing the demon\u2019s name with care.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s fingers splayed over the desk. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d The ME\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cI\u2019m in this game now, and I want to know everything. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNiol is the most powerful demon I know,\u201d Cara said, and Smith\u2019s head jerked toward her. Her eyes were wide, stark.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a serious ass,\u201d Gyth added.</p><p>Smith didn\u2019t glance back at him. Her gaze stayed on Cara. \u201cIs he evil?\u201d</p><p>Hard question. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to hurt an innocent.\u201d The not-so-innocent, well, that was a different story.</p><p>\u201cNiol knows every damn thing that happens in this town,\u201d McNeal rumbled. \u201cWith the humans and with the supernaturals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can tell us if there are any incubi hunting on the streets.\u201d Gyth\u2019s features were tense with predatory anticipation. \u201cHe was the one who originally tipped me off about the Night Butcher.\u201d</p><p>Cara bit her lip. She knew of a few incubi in the area. One of the guys\u2014well, she\u2019d known him for years, and the thought of him killing\u2014of any of them killing\u2014 no, she just couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t lie to Todd about the men. Not with so much at stake. \u201cYou really think the killer is an incubus, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Todd turned to face her. His eyes were cop sharp. \u201cI do. A succubus wouldn\u2019t have needed a lure\u2014not with the scent you can put out\u2014and sure as hell not if all succubi are as sexy as you.\u201d</p><p>No two succubi looked alike\u2014not even twins. Her kind came in all shapes and sizes, but they were all created with one purpose\u2014</p><p>to seduce.</p> <p>A succubus would never need another woman to act as bait to capture the attention of human men.</p><p>If there was a chance that the killer was an incubus\u2014and from where she was sitting, it looked like there was one bigass chance Todd was right about that\u2014then she had to tell him what she knew. Protecting the private lives of demons would have to come second to saving the humans and finding out who was setting her up.</p><p>She held Todd\u2019s stare and quietly told him, \u201cI can give you the names of three incubi right now.\u201d The men might all be proved innocent\u2014they were good men, two in high positions in the city\u2014but she had to tell Todd their names.</p><p>Yet even after she told them, Cara knew that the cops would follow up with Niol and find out if any other incubi were hunting sexual prey.</p><p>Niol always knew exactly who was hunting in the city. That was the reason she\u2019d gone to him after leaving Todd\u2019s bed. She\u2019d asked him if there was another succubus on the streets.</p> <p>He\u2019d told her, simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. Because while he might make a habit of lying to others, he\u2019d never lied to her.</p><p>Cara realized that all eyes were on her now. She licked her lips. \u201cI only know three, but there could be more.\u201d</p><p>Gyth stood up, fast.</p><p>Todd swore. \u201cYou could have mentioned their names sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just learned that you were looking for an incubus and not a succubus less than half an hour ago!\u201d Jeez, she had been the suspect, and she hadn\u2019t thought that a man was involved.</p> <p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cTrey Barker.\u201d She said his name clearly.</p><p>Smith\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cThe newsman from Channel Twelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder my mom likes to watch him so much,\u201d McNeal mumbled.</p><p>\u201cJody Rain.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe assistant district attorney?\u201d</p><p>A nod. There was a reason why the guy was so well liked by the women on his juries.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve met the third demon.\u201d</p> <p>Todd shook his head.</p><p>\u201cCameron Komak, the bartender at Paradise Found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that asshole was too pretty.\u201d</p><p>Too pretty. A fairly normal description for an incubus.</p><p>\u201cGyth, start checking these bastards,\u201d McNeal ordered. \u201cTrack \u2019em down, get \u2019em in here, and find out everything you can about their lives for the last two months.\u201d</p><p>Todd stepped forward. \u201cCaptain, I told you I wasn\u2019t going to be shut out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooks, get your ass over to Paradise Found and make Niol tell you everything he knows about the sex demons in this town.\u201d</p><p>A wide grin split Todd\u2019s mouth. \u201cMy pleasure, sir.\u201d</p><p>But she knew Todd would be in for one hell of a fight, because no one made Niol do anything he didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she offered, because she knew the demon didn\u2019t exactly have a soft spot for her lover.</p><p>But he did for her.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d McNeal looked so satisfied that she realized that had been his plan from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cCaptain...\u201d Todd\u2019s face flushed with anger. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be in protective custody. I can handle Niol on my own\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she can handle him one hell of a lot better.\u201d One finger jabbed at Todd. \u201cYou saw her, Brooks, the woman doesn\u2019t need protecting, but any fool who gets in her path just might.\u201d</p><p>Hmm...maybe the captain wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>His fist pounded against the desk. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get this shit wrapped up before any more dead bodies pile up in our Crypt.\u201d</p><p>Smith was the last to exit his office. She waited for the cops and the succubus to leave, then she hesitated at the door.</p><p>McNeal sat in his chair, and she could feel the heat of his stare on her back. Her fingers tightened around the door knob\u2014and she closed the door.</p><p>\u201cSmith?\u201d A thread of worry was in that rough voice.</p><p>She turned slowly and rested her back against the blinds on the door, not caring that they bent and snapped behind her. \u201cYou should have told me...\u201d</p><p>He rose from his chair.</p><p>\u201cFrom the beginning. Right after the first kiss.\u201d The kiss they\u2019d shared here, in his office.</p><p>God, they\u2019d had sex on his desk.</p><p>The memories were all around her in this room.</p><p>She hated coming to meetings in his office.</p><p>And once she left, well, she couldn\u2019t wait to get back inside the room again.</p><p>She still wanted him.</p><p>Damn it, a part of her still loved the asshole. A part she\u2019d tried so hard to kill.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to leave me.\u201d Stark.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He\u2019d just left her in the end.</p><p>A muscle flexed along the hard line of his jaw. Her fingers balled into fists. She\u2019d touched that jaw so many times. Felt the rasp of stubble on her palm.</p><p>On her entire body.</p><p>\u201cBecause...you mattered too much to me.\u201d</p><p>She held his glittering stare and saw raw honesty reflected in his eyes. \u201cBut you walked away.\u201d</p><p>Now he walked toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how hard it is to keep secrets from the rest of the world. To live every day, hiding who you really are, and praying that no one else finds out your secrets\u2014because if someone does find out, the wrong someone, well, then your life will go straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>She understood that. If the truth got out, God, she couldn\u2019t even imagine what life would be like in the world if all the humans realized what was really happening around them.</p><p>Yeah, she understood, but understanding didn\u2019t mean she forgave. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to walk. You could have told me the truth. \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you look at me the way you do at Gyth? Or Cara? Or, hell, I guess the way you\u2019re staring at me now?\u201d</p><p>That stopped her cold. Gyth was a shifter, she knew that, but the man had saved her ass. He wasn\u2019t evil.</p><p>And as for the succubus, well, Smith didn\u2019t know that woman, but she didn\u2019t seem like she was a monster. She just seemed...</p><p>normal.</p><p>Like any woman. Like... Jesus, she seems just like me.</p><p>Smith had even found herself admiring the woman\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not evil, Nathalia.\u201d He was close to her now. So close she could smell the crisp scent of his aftershave.</p><p>She\u2019d given him that aftershave.</p><p>Her knees began to tremble.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard who took you\u2014yeah, he was fucked up. As dark inside as they come, but you know, you know, we\u2019ve dealt with human killers who were just as twisted.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She\u2019d worked on too many cases to deny the truth of his words. They hadn\u2019t all been Other. She knew that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not all bad, baby, understand that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Her nails dug into her palms. She understood, but it was just so hard. She woke up most nights, a scream choking her.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly died in that damn place and when she\u2019d met the killer\u2019s stare, she\u2019d known what hell looked like.</p><p>She saw Dan\u2019s throat work as he swallowed. His hand lifted then, as if he were going to touch her, but then he hesitated.</p><p>Pain danced over his face.</p><p>And she hurt.</p><p>He stepped back. Dropped his hand. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t anything else, Dr. Smith, I need to get back to work and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d Her voice shook. Just like her knees.</p><p>He lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have walked away from you.\u201d Her chin came up. \u201cI mean, shit, Dan, I didn\u2019t care about the fact that you\u2019re white\u2014did you really think I\u2019d give a damn that you could go all Dr. Doolittle on me?\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open.</p><p>Satisfied with that response and not really trusting herself to say more, Smith managed to turn around and open the door. Then she walked out, head held high, and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Her mama had taught her long ago how a lady made an exit.</p><p>Her mama just hadn\u2019t warned her that she had real wolves to worry about in the world, wolves who often wore the flesh of men.</p><p>The guards weren\u2019t at the door of Paradise Found, and the sight of the empty entranceway had Todd tensing.</p><p>Cara stilled beside him. \u201cTodd? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Everything. Cara shouldn\u2019t have even been with him then. She should have been in a safe house, protected by several guards\u2014and he should have been casing the place alone. \u201cWhen we go inside, stay behind me, okay? Just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her bow lips turned down. \u201cWhy...\u201d she drew the word out with obvious impatience, \u201cdo you have such trouble with the concept of me being a demon?\u201d She pointed to her chest. \u201cLook, nearly immortal me.\u201d She tapped him, a bit harder than he thought was really necessary, right in the middle of his chest. \u201cAnd weak, human you.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his holster. He might be mortal, but he was armed. Todd wasn\u2019t forgetting for a moment that a potentially murderous incubus might be inside.</p><p>And then there was Niol...</p><p>His fingers curled around the gun. \u201cMe\u2014human, but ready to shoot. And don\u2019t forget,\u201d he offered her a brief smile, \u201cI\u2019m the one with the badge.\u201d Okay, yeah, he knew the woman was strong.</p><p>But she was his and he wanted to protect her.</p><p>Todd pressed a hard kiss to her lips.</p><p>Then playtime was over and he stalked toward the door. Cara followed on his heels, her seductive scent wrapping around him.</p><p>He pushed on the door. Open. No way was this Niol\u2019s usual operation.</p><p>The cop in him hesitated, but then Todd realized his internal alarm\u2014that system that had never failed him before\u2014it wasn\u2019t making a single noise.</p><p>What a fucking bad time for his instincts to fail him.</p><p>Shoving open the door, he went in with his gun up and his pulse steady.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cThe gun\u2019s not really necessary, you know,\u201d Niol murmured, not bothering to rise from his table. He sat in the middle of the club, a pair of dark glasses covering his black eyes, and offered them a cold smile. \u201cBack so soon, are we?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, for the moment, Todd swept his gaze across the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Cameron?\u201d Cara asked.</p><p>The smile tightened a bit. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like anyone else was there. \u201cWhere the hell is he?\u201d Gyth had probably already sent a squad to the incubus\u2019 house and taken him into custody, but Todd asked the question anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d A shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t really care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiol. \u201d A warning edge had entered Cara\u2019s voice. Then the woman stepped around him. Damn it, he\u2019d told her to stay behind him for protection.</p><p>She strode toward Niol.</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get too close to him.\u201d She might be all warm and friendly with the demon, but it would be one cold-ass day in hell before he felt the same. His gaze snapped to Niol. \u201cI\u2019m here on business, Niol, and I\u2019m gonna be nice and ask you again. Where\u2019s Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Niol\u2019s head tilted to the left. Mild curiosity flavored his voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve got an incubus loose in this city who\u2019s killed at least three men.\u201d</p><p>Niol raised his hand. Removed his sunglasses and cast his dark stare toward Todd. \u201cAn incubus, is it? I thought you boys in blue were looking for a succubus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed.\u201d That was all the info he\u2019d give Niol. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>The black stare slipped toward Cara. \u201cYou think Cameron\u2019s a killer?\u201d</p><p>He read the hesitation on her face. Before she could reply, Todd said, \u201cEvery option has to be explored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d A rumble. \u201cOf course, it does.\u201d A shrug of the demon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t really know where Cameron is. His shift doesn\u2019t start until eight tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here earlier.\u201d</p><p>Another careless shrug. \u201cHe\u2014and the two other bartenders who work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron came in for his check, okay, Detective? He told me he wasn\u2019t feeling too good, then left.\u201d</p><p>Todd shoved his gun back into the holster. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem particularly concerned about the fact that your bartender might have killed those men.\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s lips quirked at that. \u201cCameron\u2019s not really the killing kind. He doesn\u2019t have that instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that? Maybe when you look at him, you\u2019ve just been seeing what good old Cameron wants you to see.\u201d He slanted his stare at Cara. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what both of you have been seeing.\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s eyes narrowed just a bit. \u201cCameron lives at 55 Corington Place. Go get him and drag him down to your station, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>No emotion on the guy\u2019s face or in his voice. And Cara was quiet now. What was with them? Todd took an aggressive step toward Niol. Maybe he should reveal a little more information and see just what kind of response he could shake out of the demon.</p><p>\u201cThe incubus doing these killings\u2014he\u2019s been setting up Cara.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me? Cara was right\u2014she\u2019s being set up\u2014and this bastard is doing it to her! So you know\u2014and what? You don\u2019t give a damn? I thought you cared about her! Are you just going to sit there while\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTodd. \u201d Cara moved forward in a flash, putting herself between him and the demon. A good thing, because he really wanted to rip that guy\u2019s head off.</p><p>That had to be a surefire way to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI do care for Cara.\u201d Niol stood slowly, his body a ripple of threat. \u201cI\u2019d never let anyone hurt her.\u201d His gaze raked down Todd\u2019s body. \u201cDemon or human.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, was that supposed to be some kind of scary warning? Too bad, Todd wasn\u2019t exactly feeling intimidated. \u201cWho are the other incubi in the city?\u201d</p><p>Now Niol looked amused. \u201cDidn\u2019t Cara already tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you. \u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cThe ADA. The reporter. You obviously know about Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny others?\u201d He bit out, impatient. \u201cCome on, Niol, you\u2019re the one who knows this city. Tell me who I\u2019m up against so that I can damn well make certain Cara is safe.\u201d</p> <p>The black eyes widened in just the briefest show of surprise. True emotion\u2014 finally. \u201cYou care for her.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit, of course, he did. He wasn\u2019t a fucking idiot, but he also wasn\u2019t about to have some kind of soul-baring fest with Niol.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my job. Stopping killers and protecting the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow great for you.\u201d The emotion was gone and\u2014again, it didn\u2019t seem like Niol particularly cared.</p><p>Cara\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cWho else is hunting in the city?\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked her. \u201cI must say I\u2019m a bit disappointed in you, Cara. Taking up with a human like him\u2014he\u2019s so beneath you.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, Todd knew that, had known for a while now that he wasn\u2019t good enough for her, but hearing the demon say those words enraged him. Cara was a damn goddess\u2014and he was a detective who\u2019d struggled too long with hell on the streets.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve her,\u201d Niol snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Todd was on him. He\u2019d dodged around Cara in a flash and then locked his hands on the demon. He slammed the asshole into the bar. Balled the front of the demon\u2019s T-shirt in one fist and raised the other, more than ready to punch the asshole right in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give my fucking last breath to protect her.\u201d Yeah, okay, so he wasn\u2019t a level-ten killing machine, but he wasn\u2019t going to back down from anyone.</p><p>And he sure as hell would never let anyone or anything hurt his woman.</p><p>Not when he\u2019d just found her.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do for her, cop?\u201d Niol\u2019s voice was pitched low, and not a hint of fear or worry so much as flickered in that icy pool of darkness that was his gaze. \u201cWould you lie? Break your precious laws?\u201d His voice deepened. \u201cWould you kill? Die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for her.\u201d The words were ripped from him, almost helplessly, as Todd found himself unable to look away from that darkness. Trapped.</p> <p>Good. Right answer, human. The words were in his mind, but Todd knew Niol hadn\u2019t spoken. Not out loud, anyway.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Cara\u2019s fierce demand.</p><p>But was the demand given to Todd\u2014or to Niol?</p><p>The demon smiled. \u201cYou should let go of me now, cop.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to. He wanted to punch the bastard right in his smiling lips, but\u2014</p><p>Todd found himself stepping back, dropping his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong psychic,\u201d Niol murmured, \u201cbut not strong enough to fight me.\u201d</p><p>The glasses behind Niol began to shake, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d An order from Cara. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for your shit right now, Niol.\u201d</p><p>Neither was he.</p><p>\u201cJust tell us the names of the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncubi. \u201d Todd snarled.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cI suppose there could be a few male strays who\u2019ve snuck into town. I\u2019ll have to check my sources\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know by nightfall.\u201d Absolutely confident. \u201cCome back to me then, Detective, and I\u2019ll tell you the exact location of every incubus in the city.\u201d</p><p>Not much of a choice. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d He glared at him. \u201cAnd you better have the information.\u201d He finally asked the question that had been nagging at the back of his mind. \u201cAnd where the hell is everyone?\u201d</p><p>A shuttered expression. Then, \u201cHunting your sex demons, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d No way, that would be\u2014</p><p>\u201cReally, Detective, I did know you were coming.\u201d A shrug. \u201cMy men will be back, by nightfall as I told you, and we\u2019ll find your murderous demon.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, Todd was pretty sure he was staring at a murderous demon.</p><p>Why did Cara have a soft spot for the guy? Couldn\u2019t she see that he was ice cold all the way to the soul?</p><p>Todd straightened his jacket. Felt the reassuring press of his holster against the small of his back. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said to Cara.</p><p>Her gaze was on the demon.</p><p>A prick of jealousy stirred inside Todd. Those two\u2014they shared a bond, a magic, that he\u2019d never know. Did Niol understand Cara better that he did? Better than he could?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making the same mistake she did.\u201d Niol spoke to Cara, voice ragged, as if the words had been torn from him.</p><p>A slight tremble rolled the floor.</p><p>Cara just stared at him. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans can\u2019t be trusted, Cara. You saw what happened to Nina.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no, the bastard had better not be saying he was like the murdering prick who\u2019d attacked her sister. \u201cWatch it, demon. \u201d No way would he ever hurt Cara.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your warnings,\u201d Cara said at the same moment. \u201cAnd I am not my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, love.\u201d A touch of sadness there. The wisp of a memory in the blackness of his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d Then he blinked, and Todd wondered if the emotion had ever been there. \u201cBut like her, you want something that demons, well, we don\u2019t always get to have.\u201d</p><p>Cara\u2019s gaze flickered to him\u2014and Todd saw the yearning in her stare.</p><p>For him? Didn\u2019t the lady know she already had him? Every damn piece of him, good and bad?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust the humans, not with your life.\u201d Niol sauntered forward, reached for his glasses. \u201cI\u2019ll watch your back, just as I\u2019ve always done.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and he\u2019d be watching her back, too. Front, back, every inch of her. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt her,\u201d Todd said clearly, just in case the old demon wasn\u2019t understanding so well.</p><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t.\u201d A certainty from Niol. \u201cYou protected me, I\u2019ll do the same for you.\u201d The words were directed to Cara.</p><p>Her head moved in a brief nod.</p><p>Niol pushed by him. \u201cYou know your way out, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d And his way right back in.</p><p>Because he\u2019d be back at nightfall\u2014and the demon had better be ready.</p><p>The Channel Twelve newscaster\u2019s face flushed dark red. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing in here?\u201d He demanded.</p><p>Colin leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few questions for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>If possible, Trey Barker\u2019s cheeks became even redder. \u201cI\u2019m the fucking anchor for Channel Twelve! We\u2019ve got the largest market in the city\u2014I am the damn market! You don\u2019t call me in here like I\u2019m some punk off the street, you got that, Detective? You don\u2019t send your boys into my office to pick me up, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin raised a brow as he listened to the guy rant. Yeah, this one looked like an incubus. Too good-looking\u2014well, he would have been good-looking if it weren\u2019t for that crazy skin thing he had going on. Wide blue eyes. Dimples.</p><p>Perfect face, but his scent was off. Too strong. Overpowering.</p><p>Incubus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking star in this town!\u201d Trey shouted, and his gaze darted around the interrogation room. \u201cI\u2019ll have you walking the streets again, giving old ladies parking tickets, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin exhaled. \u201cI know exactly who you are, Trey. Or rather, what you are.\u201d</p><p>That shut up the newsman. Colin saw the guy\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bob as he gulped. Then Trey muttered, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Why was the guy even gonna waste his time with denials? \u201cYou\u2019re an incubus.\u201d</p><p>Trey flinched, then managed a faint, scratchy laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were using your scent on the female officer who brought you in to interrogation.\u201d And that annoyed him. \u201cI gave orders only men were to escort you to the precinct, but I should have made sure the women stayed away once you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing a damn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Colin said calmly. \u201cYou were pumping out that sick scent and trying to trick her into telling you about this case.\u201d He nodded toward the files spread before them.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t read my rights! I wasn\u2019t asked if I wanted an attorney present\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was one sitting in the next interrogation room. But Colin would get to him, next. \u201cDid you really want the cops telling everyone at the station that you were a demon and you were being brought in because you might be connected to a series of sex murders?\u201d</p><p>The guy seemed to shrivel. His shoulders slumped. His chin fell to his chest.</p><p>Yeah, that was the way it always was. The ones who blustered the loudest fell the fastest. \u201cSo...\u201d Colin drawled out the word slowly, aware that his captain and Emily were watching. \u201cYou admit you\u2019re an incubus.\u201d McNeal had called Emily in as soon as the incubi were found. The captain wanted her take on them. McNeal had stationed her in the observation room so that she\u2019d be able to see their reactions to Colin\u2019s questions.</p><p>And Colin was damn interested in his doc\u2019s analysis of the guys. His Emily had a talent for getting good and deep beneath the skin of the Other.</p><p>\u201cDo you admit it?\u201d he asked again, still keeping his voice easy and calm.</p><p>A quick nod from Trey. A frantic glance up at the interrogation mirror.</p><p>He knows they\u2019re watching him. Just like Cara had known. Demons always made his job so much harder.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014how did you find out?\u201d Trey asked.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...going to tell everyone?\u201d Horror, in his voice, on his face.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>Another bob of the guy\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>Colin leaned forward. Opened the file and shoved the pictures at the demon. \u201cOn whether or not you\u2019re a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d Emily said as Trey Barker vomited into the garbage can.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Maybe he\u2019s just faking his reaction. He knows we\u2019re here, he could be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No! I didn\u2019t do this!\u201d Trey\u2019s frantic voice broke across the captain\u2019s words.</p><p>Colin began to rattle off the dates of the killings.</p><p>\u201cNo! Listen, damn it, listen to me!\u201d He shoved the pictures away, looked like he might vomit again. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this! Shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me an alibi. Make me believe you.\u201d Colin started talking about the first victim, the date he\u2019d been found and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was in Boston!\u201d Relief lit Trey\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was interviewing for a job up there\u2014call them! At Station Seven. I flew up and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>McNeal leaned forward and adjusted the volume control for the interrogation room. His gaze met Emily\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d she repeated again, and he gave a slow nod.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s try demon number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the Bondage Killer,\u201d Jody Rain said the minute Colin walked into the second interrogation room.</p><p>Colin blinked. Way to cut to the chase.</p><p>Jody shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Gyth. You know what I am and I\u2014\u201d His lips curved. \u201cI know you\u2019re not human, and that\u2019s about damn all I know.\u201d</p><p>Colin lowered himself into the chair across from the incubus. Jody Rain was tall, muscled, with skin tinted gold by the sun. No lines marred his face, so his age was close to impossible to guess.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s all you know,\u201d Colin murmured, aware that he had to tread very carefully with the ADA. Jody was smart, tough, and not generally one for bullshit. \u201cYou know about the Bondage Killer, after all.\u201d</p><p>One dark brow rose. \u201cI have my sources.\u201d</p><p>Colin wasn\u2019t really one for bullshit, either. \u201cOr else you\u2019ve been draining men dry in the city.\u201d A deliberate pause. \u201cIf you\u2019re the one killing the bastards, then, the way I figure it, you\u2019d know exactly what was happening.\u201d</p><p>A bark of laughter. \u201cI\u2019m no killer.\u201d The smile still curved his lips as Jody said, \u201cI know about the case because my boss knows\u2014</p><p>and my boss has a big mouth.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was true enough. Everyone knew the DA needed to learn how to slap a gag order on himself.</p><p>\u201cLook, let\u2019s just cut the shit, Detective. I know when the men were killed, and I can provide airtight alibis for all occasions.\u201d That brow was still up as he murmured, \u201cYou ready for \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d McNeal\u2019s only response as Jody Rain began to rattle off dates and locations\u2014and, far, far too many names to back him up.</p><p>Emily watched the ADA quietly. She could a feel a hum of energy pulsing off him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This one was dangerous. Much, much more dangerous than the last demon.</p><p>She had to point out, \u201cDemons lie well, you know. And they can get humans to lie for them, too. A simple suggestion, the magic of an incubi\u2019s hypnosis\u2014people would back up his alibi even if they didn\u2019t know who he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking these cases can be a bitch,\u201d McNeal grumbled, rubbing a tired hand over his face. \u201cAnd, yeah, Doc, I know, if they\u2019re strong enough, demons can make the whole world lie for \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>Colin continued to grill the ADA about the alibis, asking question after question, and Jody never even came close to breaking a sweat as he replied.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal ground his back teeth together. \u201cWhere\u2019s the last asshole?\u201d</p><p>Cameron Komak sprawled back in his chair. His face was hard with anger, belying his easy pose, and the eyes that locked on Colin\u2019s were narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your partner?\u201d Cameron demanded.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Colin stalked across the room. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dealing with me today.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron leaned forward, eyes assessing, and after a moment, a wide grin broke across his face. \u201cGood. I\u2019m tired of those fucking humans.\u201d</p><p>Colin never changed expression. \u201cWanna run that by me again?\u201d</p><p>The demon rolled his eyes. \u201cCome on, I know you aren\u2019t like them. I\u2019ve known from the first night when you came in with the sexy little Monster Doctor.\u201d He glanced knowingly toward the mirror. \u201cShe\u2019s watching me, isn\u2019t she? I can feel her.\u201d</p><p>The beast Colin carried roared to life. He clenched his hands\u2014the better to leash the urge to punch the demon.</p><p>A laugh, high and grating, burst from Cameron\u2019s lips. \u201cAh, man, come on, I mean\u2014you know what I am, right? If you didn\u2019t, well, you wouldn\u2019t be in here with me. One of them\u201d\u2014disgust laced the word\u2014\u201cwould be.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So the guy wanted to play it with gloves off. Fine with Colin. \u201cYou don\u2019t like... them...too much do you?\u201d His voice was without any inflection. Not good cop, not bad.</p> <p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re weak.\u201d Cameron\u2019s lips twisted with distaste. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t even know it. They go around, acting like they rule this damn world\u2014and they don\u2019t even have a clue what\u2019s really happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr who is really running the show,\u201d Colin finished softly.</p><p>\u201cRight! Yeah, that\u2019s right. They don\u2019t know.\u201d He nodded quickly, dark hair glinting under the light. \u201cThey think they\u2019re the smartest, the strongest things ever put on the earth.\u201d A hard exhalation of air. \u201cThey\u2019re dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Colin pulled out the photos of Michael House, Travis Walters, and Simon Battle. \u201cAnd sometimes they\u2019re just dead.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shot back in his chair. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d His eyes almost doubled in size as he stared, almost helplessly, at the dead men.</p><p>\u201cYou hate them, don\u2019t you?\u201d Soft voice, no pressure. Colin just watched the demon, and waited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know these guys!\u201d Cameron shoved the photos away. \u201cIs this why I\u2019m here? You think I had something to do with those stiffs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumans,\u201d Colin drawled out the word, deliberately not answering Cameron\u2019s questions. \u201cYou hate all of them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The demon blinked. \u201cDon\u2019t hate \u2019em,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cJust don\u2019t really care about \u2019em at all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t care that these men are dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know them!\u201d His fist slammed onto the table.</p><p>Ah, so Cameron had a temper.</p><p>And an obvious dislike of humans.</p><p>But did he hate them enough to kill?</p><p>Colin shifted gears, fast, needing to keep his suspect off balance. \u201cWhat about Cara Maloan? Just how do you feel about her?\u201d</p><p>His lips parted. \u201cCara? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about her?\u201d Colin pressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known her for years. She\u2019s like\u2014like a sister to me.\u201d Real worry appeared on Cameron\u2019s face. \u201cIs she okay? Has something happened to Cara? Hell, I knew she shouldn\u2019t be dating that cop friend of yours! I knew it would be trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Still soft.</p><p>Cameron swallowed. \u201cBecause humans and demons don\u2019t mix. Humans can\u2019t know anything but fear when they\u2019re with us. They aren\u2019t strong enough for more.\u201d</p><p>Colin thought of his Emily, and one word immediately sprang to mind. Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hurt her.\u201d A fierce shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen before. He\u2019ll take everything she has to give, then he\u2019ll destroy her.\u201d</p><p>As Cara\u2019s sister had been destroyed?</p><p>\u201cHumans are weak, \u201d Cameron repeated. \u201cThey can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they just need to be killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cameron shot to his feet. \u201cDamn it, stop putting words in my mouth! I never said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you think you were brought down here today?\u201d Another rapid-fire question shift.</p><p>A blink from the demon. \u201cI-I...don\u2019t know. Thought that Brooks bastard was trying to start trouble for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause he\u2019s always in Paradise, and the guy knows he\u2019s not wanted there. Not by Niol, not by me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is wanted by Cara.\u201d</p><p>Cameron\u2019s mouth snapped closed. The handsome face turned almost ugly for a moment. \u201cHe\u2019s what she wants... now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you don\u2019t think that...wanting will last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for Cara.\u201d Absolutely certain. Then his gaze sharpened. \u201cWait, you never said\u2014is Cara okay? Is she? Or has that asshole cop done something to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed.</p><p>Colin\u2019s gaze raked over the demon\u2019s body. \u201cI need you to lift up your shirt for me, Cameron.\u201d It was the same request he\u2019d made to the last two demons. Right after they\u2019d finished their explanations and alibis.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to wait for the alibi spin with this guy\u2014he was ready to cut to the chase with old Cameron. No sense listening to false stories from this guy when a simple test would tell the truth about him.</p><p>Susan Dobbs had fought like a wildcat. Her knife had found its mark over and over on her killer. And, yeah, demons healed fast, but an incubus wasn\u2019t a level-ten, and it would take time\u2014a hell of a lot longer than twenty-four hours\u2013for the wounds to heal.</p><p>If Cameron had killed Susan, the marks would still be on his flesh.</p><p>Flesh that was currently hidden by a dark shirt, a shirt buttoned all the way to the demon\u2019s neck, and with long, thick sleeves that covered his arms and fastened at his wrists.</p><p>Cameron smirked. \u201cSorry, man, I don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared back at him until the little bastard lost his grin. Then he said, \u201cTwo ways to do this, demon. You can willingly take off your shirt\u2014or I can take it off for you.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s eyes darted to the mirror. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! That\u2019s not legal!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, the ADA had said pretty much the same thing, but...Colin let a smile shape his lips, one that showed the tips of his lengthening canines. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about legal now. I just wanna stop the killing.\u201d Human laws weren\u2019t going to apply to this...situation.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s gaze darted to Colin\u2019s teeth. \u201cAh, shit, shifter.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened.</p><p>\u201cThought you might be a charmer, hadn\u2019t pegged you for one of those animals.\u201d His hands went to the bottom of the shirt, and he jerked the material up, fast.</p><p>Revealing a completely unmarred stomach and chest.</p><p>Just like the flesh of the other two demons.</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Cameron snapped, and Colin saw the faint tremble in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The wounds could have been to the killer\u2019s arms. Defensive wounds that were deep, and bled like a stuck pig. \u201cShow me your arms.\u201d</p><p>A curse. Muttering. Todd yanked the shirt down, fumbled with the buttons at his wrists and finally managed to push up the sleeves.</p><p>Not even a scratch, on either arm.</p><p>\u201cNow are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head. Of the three demons, he sure as hell would have pegged this guy as the killer.</p><p>But it looked like there was another incubus out there in the city. Hiding in the dark, and killing at will.</p><p>And playing one deadly cat-and-mouse game with his partner\u2019s lover.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be satisfied,\u201d Colin said clearly, \u201cwhen you give me your alibis for the murders.\u201d Then he sat down and pulled out his notebook and a pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Shifter, damn it, I don\u2019t even know when those humans died!\u201d He tugged his sleeves into place.</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d Colin tapped his pen against the table. \u201cNow let\u2019s start with the first victim, Simon Battle.\u201d</p><p>McNeal looked like he was about to start screaming. His face had flushed beet red, and Emily could actually hear the sound of his teeth grinding together.</p><p>\u201cBack to square one,\u201d he gritted. \u201cDamn, but I hope Brooks and his demon have better luck with Niol.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned on his heel and stalked from the room.</p><p>Emily turned her gaze back to her lover, her brows pulling down into a frown.</p><p>Maybe it was just the demon\u2019s distaste for humans that had her stomach clenching. There had been such anger in him when he raged at Colin, and she\u2019d been around Cameron before\u2014actually, she\u2019d known him for years\u2014but she\u2019d never felt that fury from him.</p><p>He\u2019d always been seductive. A flirt. She\u2019d known he was an incubus, of course, it would have been impossible for her not to know, but the rage in him\u2014</p><p>It was new.</p><p>And that scared her.</p><p>Jesus, but when had he started to hate with such a consuming fury?</p><p>That much hatred, if it wasn\u2019t faced and fought, soon, it could destroy a man...or a demon.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Time to face the devil.</p><p>When night fell, as the shadows stretched over the city and seemed to swallow the light in their hungry grasp, Todd returned to Paradise and to face his own personal demon.</p><p>The guards were at the door this time. He tensed when he saw them, more than ready to deal with their shit.</p><p>He\u2019d been briefed by the captain. Their top three suspects appeared to be in the clear. That meant, as McNeal had told him,</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to jackshit with this case.\u201d</p><p>He needed a break, and Niol was going to give it to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me tonight,\u201d he warned, voice cold. Cara wasn\u2019t with him. He\u2019d dropped her off at her place, despite his lady\u2019s vehement and loud protests. But he didn\u2019t want her involved in the danger, superhuman powers or not.</p><p>The woman was his, and the way Todd saw it, as a cop, and as a man, he was supposed to do his damnedest to protect her.</p><p>Tall and Scary opened the door for him. \u201cNot stopping you this time,\u201d he told Todd. \u201cBoss wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Todd grunted and shouldered past him. It was still early enough that the place wasn\u2019t packed. A few folks had wandered in, and Todd thought he caught the glimpse of fang as one guy turned away from him, but the club appeared mostly empty.</p><p>His gaze darted toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here tonight.\u201d Niol\u2019s voice, coming from right behind him.</p><p>Christ. Todd spun around. Met those dark eyes. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask you the same question, Detective.\u201d Niol cocked his head. \u201cDid your partner decide to arrest my bartender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No sense lying\u2014and where was Cameron, anyway? \u201cHe\u2019s clear.\u201d The guy had provided Colin with alibis for the murders.</p><p>The bastard said he\u2019d been tending bar, and at least four people had already confirmed his story. Sure, the witnesses were humans, so they could have been hypnotized by the demon, but Colin had also told him that the bartender didn\u2019t have so much as a scratch on his body\u2014and there was no way the guy could have covered the knife wounds.</p><p>It looked like the asshole bartender was off the hook.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s clear? Hmm. Interesting.\u201d But no interest showed in Niol\u2019s shuttered expression. \u201cCameron didn\u2019t check in for his shift.</p><p>Should have been here at least half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>The hair on Todd\u2019s nape rose. \u201cThe captain told me he left the precinct just before six.\u201d So where was he? His heart rate kicked up, but Todd drew in a deep breath in an attempt to keep his control.</p><p>Cara was okay. While she\u2019d still refused the safe house, she\u2019d finally agreed to accept guards. Grudgingly agreed and just to</p><p>\u201csatisfy you,\u201d as she\u2019d said. A patrol car was stationed right in front of her house.</p><p>Nothing was going to happen to her.</p><p>Besides, Cameron had been cleared. He was an annoyance.</p><p>Not a killer.</p><p>But something was pushing his body into alert mode.</p><p>Was it Niol? Or someone, something else? \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d He demanded, wanting to get his information and get the hell out of there. His skin was prickling, and he wanted to see Cara again.</p><p>God, but the woman was always in his mind. Awake. Asleep. Her smell was on his skin. Her taste in his mouth.</p><p>He swallowed.</p><p>Niol shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re addicted, you know.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer he needed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can happen. The lure of a succubus is strong. She won\u2019t just take your heart. She\u2019ll take your soul, and you\u2019ll want her so much, you\u2019ll stop caring about the pain when she takes and takes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Cara didn\u2019t just take from him.

And to think, he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d try to be the good cop tonight.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she chose you,\u201d Niol said, and his brow furrowed. \u201cShe could have anyone.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like he didn\u2019t know that fact. But his goddess had chosen him, and he\u2019d thank his lucky stars every day for the rest of his life.</p><p>A life he wanted to spend with her.</p><p>The realization was as shocking as it was sudden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got word of a few strays in the area.\u201d Niol shrugged. \u201cNothing too dangerous from the accounts, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Strays? Niol had used that word earlier and\u2014Jesus, what were the demons, some kind of unwanted cats?</p><p>\u201cMy men will be bringing them soon.\u201d Said with supreme confidence. \u201cThen you can play your cop games with them, or you can just stand back, and I\u2019ll get all the information you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll question them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d One shoulder lifted. \u201cWe\u2019ll play it your way.\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s gaze returned to the empty bar. Cameron\u2019s disappearance bothered him. So he had alibis and he didn\u2019t have wounds, that should have put him in the clear but\u2014</p><p>But Todd didn\u2019t like the guy and he\u2019d always felt that cold shiver of awareness when he was near the demon.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you known Cameron?\u201d Todd asked as he paced toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cAlmost as long as I\u2019ve known Cara.\u201d</p><p>And that told him jackshit. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Still no answer. Niol just couldn\u2019t ever make things easy.</p><p>\u201cCara trusts him.\u201d But she also trusted the demon beside him\u2014not exactly a ringing endorsement. \u201cI want to know why.\u201d</p><p>Niol pulled up a bar stool. \u201cCameron\u2019s still pretty young\u2014particularly so for a sex demon.\u201d His eyes swept the bar, lingered a moment on a couple swaying on the dance floor, then he glanced back at Todd. \u201cCameron\u2019s mother left his father for a human, and, well, his father\u2014Dominic\u2014he wasn\u2019t exactly the nurturing type.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. McNeal had told him that during the interrogation, Cameron had been all too vocal about his disgust for humans.</p> <p>Now he knew why.</p><p>\u201cHis mother raised him some, when Cameron wasn\u2019t on the streets, but she had a new family to look out for.\u201d</p><p>A family that didn\u2019t include an angry young incubus.</p><p>\u201cCara found him one night. Brought him to me. We taught him the things he should have learned years before.\u201d</p><p>He could see Cara doing that. Helping the other man. \u201cWas this before or after her sister died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore. Cameron helped Cara after...\u201d Niol clenched his right hand into a fist. \u201cI wasn\u2019t much good to her then. Cameron made sure she was all right.\u201d</p><p>So he should be grateful to the demon, but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Because his alarms were still shrieking in his ears.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, when are your men gonna be here?\u201d He wanted to get back to Cara. Needed to get back to her.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d Niol\u2019s black gaze flickered over him. \u201cRelax, human. We\u2019ll have your killer before the night\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Cara cut through the water, her eyes wide open, her arms moving in fast glides as her feet kicked in quick arches.</p><p>She broke the surface, drawing in a deep breath and gazing straight up at the starry night. She\u2019d needed this, needed to wash away the horrors of the day and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked to swim in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>The voice had her spinning around, one hand lifting to her chest. Awareness came too late as the man stepped from the shadows.</p><p>Cameron stared down at her, the dim lighting from the patio lights flickering over his face. \u201cYou like the dawn, don\u2019t you? You don\u2019t usually swim at night.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped against her chest. Hard. She ignored his question, saying, \u201cCameron? How did you get back here?\u201d The patrol officers were right in front of her house, and no way would they have just let him stroll around and\u2014</p><p>A brief bark of laughter. \u201cCome on, Cara!\u201d He shook his head, a smile flirting around the edges of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m a demon. It\u2019s not that hard for our kind to scale a fence.\u201d His gaze flickered to the nine-foot privacy fence that walled in her property. \u201cEven one like yours.\u201d</p><p>Cara swam toward the ladder.</p><p>\u201cThe police picked me up today,\u201d Cameron growled, smile vanishing as he watched her with eyes that didn\u2019t blink. \u201cHauled me down to the station and that animal shifter questioned me.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers closed over the ladder. The metal felt cool to the touch. She climbed up quickly and reached for her robe, not bothering with a towel as the chill in the night air swept over her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>She belted the robe in a quick move. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Anger swept over his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who told them about me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCameron, I had to! I had to tell Todd about any incubus I knew in the area. Someone\u2019s out there killing humans, leaving them with the death brand on their chests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m that someone?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cCara\u2014I thought you knew me. Inside and out.\u201d</p><p>Hurt was in his voice. \u201cCameron...\u201d She stepped toward him.</p><p>He immediately moved back. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m that someone?\u201d</p><p>His voice blasted her. Well, damn, shouldn\u2019t the cops hear that? Her chin shot up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think, don\u2019t you see that? I knew of three incubi in the city\u2014I had to tell Todd about them all! And if I hadn\u2019t, someone else would have. The killings have to stop! I couldn\u2019t just let\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told about you.\u201d Almost whisper soft.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Her arms wrapped around her stomach as the wind seemed to chill even more. She\u2019d been so warm in the water. But the night had taken a turn on her.</p><p>\u201cNot a soul.\u201d He raised a hand. Pointed his index finger at her. \u201cI knew what you did to him, but I never told.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the wind that was cold. Maybe the icy tendrils were coming from within her. \u201cTold what, Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you killed him.\u201d Said so quietly, so sadly.</p><p>Cara tried taking another step toward him.</p><p>Cameron stiffened.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d she told him, and ignored the pang in her heart. She hadn\u2019t, but it had been a damn near thing. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Lance, he killed himself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him move\u2014the guy was on her in less than a second. His hands wrapped around her arms, fingers digging deep.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! \u201d A snarl of rage. \u201cYou killed him. You seduced him, slipped into his mind, and then you killed him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to you that night. When his body was found, your scent was all over him.\u201d He shook her once, hard. \u201cI know what you did!\u201d A vein bulged near his temple. His eyes blazed black.</p><p>Not so handsome right then.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d Said calmly, but she wasn\u2019t feeling calm. And if he didn\u2019t get his hands off her\u2014right fucking immediately\u2014she was going to forget their friendship and show him just how dirty a succubus could fight.</p><p>His mouth snapped closed and he blinked. \u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet. Go.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped immediately. \u201cI-I\u2019m s-sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>But Cameron just shook his dark head. The black began to fade from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know,\u201d she repeated again, swallowing and clenching her hands into fists, \u201cthat my scent was on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went looking for him, after Nina died.\u201d Grudging. His eyes were now as blank as glass. \u201cI knew what you\u2019d want to do to him\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know that?\u201d She demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you! You\u2019ve been in my head, I\u2019ve been in yours. I. Know. You.\u201d A ragged exhalation of air. \u201cAnd if she\u2019d been my sister, I would have wanted to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>To make the killer pay. To scream. To beg.</p><p>To die.</p><p>\u201cI was the one who found Lance\u2019s body.\u201d He backed away from her, began to pace along the edge of the pool. \u201cI got there and caught the stench of death through the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were there, then you saw that it was suicide and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who kill themselves don\u2019t have terror frozen on their faces, Cara! They don\u2019t die with their eyes wide open and their mouths twisted into a scream!\u201d</p><p>Her nails bit into her palms. She felt the wet trickle of blood easing over her flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap! We both know Lance didn\u2019t kill himself, and damn it, I never told what I knew! I never said a word to anyone about you killing him, and you turned and ratted me out to your lover the first chance you got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Said as softly as his words earlier had been. The wind caught her voice, carried it to him.</p><p>Cameron frowned. \u201cYou\u2014you said you told him, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell Todd.\u201d And she would make that choice again. \u201cBut I swear to you on my sister\u2019s grave that I did not kill Lance.\u201d Truth time. The air she sucked in tasted bitter. \u201cI was going to, but he got away from me. I wanted him dead, so badly\u2014but I did not kill him.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t pulled that knife, she would have.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t have regretted the action for a moment.</p><p>He stopped, stared at her. \u201cNo, no, you killed him because of what he did to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d She held his stare, eyes direct.</p><p>His hand trembled as he rubbed his eyes. \u201cBut if you didn\u2019t, who did?\u201d</p><p>Niol watched the crowd as the humans and demons and God knew what else began to flow faster into Paradise Found.</p><p>There was a tension about him\u2014a tightness around his mouth, a narrowing at his eyes\u2014that worried Todd.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t your men have been here by now?\u201d Over an hour had passed since he\u2019d arrived at the club.</p><p>Niol lifted a brow. \u201cStrays probably didn\u2019t want to come willingly.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he imagined they didn\u2019t. \u201cThat won\u2019t really matter to your men, will it?\u201d Of course, they weren\u2019t really men.</p><p>\u201cIt might slow \u2019em down a bit. Nothing too severe.\u201d Niol\u2019s shoulders stiffened then, and his head turned quickly toward the entrance. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>A redhead stood just inside the door, her purse clutched tightly in her hand, and a very determined expression on her pretty face.</p><p>Wait a minute, that woman was\u2014</p><p>The reporter. Holly Storm.</p><p>\u201cTold \u2019em not to let her kind in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer kind?\u201d Was the lady Other, too?</p><p>\u201cReporters.\u201d Niol spat the word. \u201cAs if they ever know what the hell they\u2019re reporting.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s gaze swept across the room. Locked on the bar. On them. Then she started marching forward.</p><p>The tension rolling off Niol seemed to double.</p><p>No way. The demon couldn\u2019t be scared of Holly Storm.</p><p>She stopped in front of them. Kept her eyes on Niol. \u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her then, more a baring of his teeth. \u201cLooks like that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a bit, and her eyes darted to Todd. \u201cDetective, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He tapped his fingers on the bar. \u201cMy favorite singer performs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull.\u201d Her small nostrils flared. \u201cYou\u2019re just like he is, aren\u2019t you? Well, fair warning, I\u2019m going live with this story. It\u2019s time the world finds out the truth about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Niol laughed. Hard.</p><p>Holly Storm glared even harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got proof, you know. I\u2019ve been following this Bondage case every minute. I know the killer isn\u2019t human. He\u2019s some kind of demon\u2014like you\u2014and he\u2019s sucking the life right out of his victims. He used that woman, Susan Dobbs, that he met here to trap them and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Todd jumped to his feet. \u201cWhat the hell did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s mouth hung wide open. She clamped it closed and tossed him a hard stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d He demanded, patience gone\u2014well, it had never really been there.</p><p>\u201cYou already know this\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sure as hell hadn\u2019t known that Susan and the incubus had met at Paradise. Todd growled.</p><p>Holly started talking again, fast. \u201cI got sources\u2014 Other sources\u2014that place Susan here as a regular about four or five months back. She was coming in here plenty, until he\u201d\u2014she glowered at Niol\u2014\u201cgave a standing order that she wasn\u2019t allowed on the premises.\u201d</p><p>What would it feel like to break a demon\u2019s neck? Todd wondered as he eyed Niol and clenched his teeth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that Susan was a visitor here.\u201d And the detective who\u2019d been assigned the task of tracking Susan\u2019s connections to the case\u2014Flint, a guy who\u2019d been transferred up from Narcotics less than a year ago\u2014was going straight to the top of his shit list. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Niol drawled.</p><p>\u201cFlint sure as hell did!\u201d</p><p>Niol just stared at him then, with those fathomless eyes. Todd remembered, too late, something Niol had told him days before.</p> <p>A third of the officers on your force are demons. I know what\u2019s happening in this town every moment. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The reporter watched them with green eyes that saw too much. Todd tried to rein in his temper\u2014he sure would have liked to have rip into Niol, but now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>\u201cSeems you\u2019ve got some pretty interesting sources, Ms. Storm.\u201d He\u2019d bet his next paycheck that Susan Dobbs had been one of those sources. \u201cDo you realize that you\u2019ve been getting information from a killer?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blink. \u201cEasy to lay blame on the dead, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, real easy\u2014when the dead was a murderer.\u201d He paused. \u201cAre your other sources just as reliable as she was?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes held his. \u201cWell, at least they\u2019re better than the police department\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Hit. He inclined his head. \u201cRest assured, we are doing everything possible to make certain that the Bondage Killer is stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when I go live with my story at ten tonight, and tell everyone in Atlanta the truth about what\u2019s happening, then I think you\u2019ll start truly doing everything that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>The woman couldn\u2019t be serious. \u201cLady, you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He didn\u2019t need crap from a reporter right then. The puzzle pieces were all dancing through his mind.</p><p>Susan had been in Paradise Found before Cara started singing, but she could have still been around when his succubus was performing, if she\u2019d slipped past the guards...</p> <p>Paradise Found.</p><p>Had she met the killer here? Seemed a damned good possibility.</p><p>A perfect place for humans who liked to play with the dark side.</p><p>From the reports he\u2019d read on Susan, the woman had possessed one major dark side of her own.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I know about the demons,\u201d Holly said. \u201cI know they\u2019re around us, cops, doctors, lawyers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have proof, do you? Hard evidence?\u201d He pinned her with his stare while Niol just well, looked bored. Nothing new there. \u201cYou think the station director is gonna just let you blast out your tale? Get real, lady. News Flash Five would be laughed out of the city.\u201d And so would she. People weren\u2019t ready to hear the truth yet.</p><p>He sure hadn\u2019t been. \u201cAnd you mentioned just the demons\u2014what about the others?\u201d</p><p>Her face seemed to pale a bit. \u201cO-others?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you know, the vampires, the witches, the shape-shifters...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit with each name that he rattled off. He did not have time for this. \u201cLady, you don\u2019t even have a fucking clue about everything that\u2019s lurking out there\u2014and do you really think all the supernaturals are gonna be happy that you\u2019re planning to blow the lid off their nice, secret world?\u201d</p><p>He saw her throat work as she swallowed. Then her gaze shot to Niol\u2019s. He smiled at her, a smile that displayed a whole lot of teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do. If exposing the Other is your plan, then do it.\u201d</p><p>Aw, crap. Niol would encourage her.</p><p>\u201cEvery demon in the city will go after her,\u201d Todd snapped. Maybe the woman\u2019s sources were setting her up for just such an event.</p><p>Niol\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And that just left what, a couple of thousand who would? Could he not just deal with one crisis at a time? \u201cGo home,\u201d he told the reporter, injecting as much steel as possible into his voice. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a place for you\u2014go back to your safe world and forget about this story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the killer?\u201d She demanded, voice rising.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle him.\u201d And he\u2019d handle Niol, too. \u201cDon\u2019t report this story,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust go home for the night, and we\u2019ll talk tomorrow\u2014hell, I\u2019ll answer any questions that you have, tomorrow.\u201d In the bright, safe light of day.</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for just a little time, Ms. Storm. Just a little more time.\u201d And if she didn\u2019t agree, well, he\u2019d have to toss her ass in jail\u2014</p><p>because no way was she airing her story tonight. He\u2019d hate to lock the lady up, but he couldn\u2019t risk her blowing his town to hell, and now that he knew she\u2019d been poking around in his case, well, the woman could very well have stirred up a whole mess of danger for herself.</p><p>Her lips pressed together. Her gaze flew between him and the ever-watchful Niol. \u201cYou promise to answer all of my questions, on the record?\u201d</p><p>Ah, now she was pushing too much. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an interview.\u201d That was as much of a promise as she was going to get from him.</p><p>And once he got her in the station, he\u2019d work on convincing her to see things his way.</p><p>Holly exhaled. \u201cAll right. You have until tomorrow afternoon, three p.m. If I don\u2019t hear from you, I\u2019ll go live at five.\u201d</p><p>And the woman would do it. He\u2019d have to contact the captain ASAP and let him know they had another fire blazing.</p><p>She turned around, began to stride away from them.</p><p>\u201cOh, Holly...\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s voice was soft, silken.</p><p>The woman stumbled to a halt. She glanced back over her shoulder, lips parted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come to my Paradise again, unless you\u2019re willing to play with the devil.\u201d</p><p>Todd heard the sharp sound of her indrawn breath. Then she hurried toward the door, almost ran in her haste, and Niol watched her every move like some kind of hungry spider. Creepy as hell.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone,\u201d Todd warned. \u201cHell, I thought you didn\u2019t even want her \u2018kind\u2019 in here!\u201d</p><p>Niol shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s human, sexy, and hungry for a walk in the dark.\u201d A soft laugh. \u201cJust the way I like my women.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Todd\u2019s stare shot across the room. Landed on the door marked PRIVATE. He pointed toward the door. \u201cI wanna know every damn thing you\u2019ve been holding back, and I want to know now.\u201d Before any more unexpected visitors showed up in Paradise.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>The closed door muted the growing hum of conversation and music from the club. Todd didn\u2019t bother to sit down. His hands rested easily at his sides and he pinned Niol with his gaze. \u201cTalk, and, this time, save the bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Niol lowered his body into the chair behind the desk. \u201cJust what do you want to know, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention that Susan Dobbs had been in your place before?\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s lips pursed. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to think I was involved with the killings. And I\u2019m not, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cause the guy just reeked of innocence. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been hindering my case so you wouldn\u2019t look guilty?</p><p>Niol frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping you.\u201d</p><p>By withholding information. Right. \u201cCut the crap, okay? I really don\u2019t have time for this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it that you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you kick her out? Why let Susan come in, then suddenly bar the door to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan wasn\u2019t a woman who took well to rejection.\u201d Level stare. \u201cAnd she was also very much not my type.\u201d</p><p>A woman who liked to kill\u2014and she wasn\u2019t a perfect match for the demon? \u201cSo the lady hit on you, you rejected her, and then told her to keep her ass out of your place?\u201d</p><p>One brow lifted. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Todd felt an ache behind his right eye. \u201cLet me go over this one more time, asshole.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s brow lowered. His lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got four dead bodies now, all pointing to a demon\u2019s hand.\u201d Okay, so Monroe\u2019s pointed more to Susan\u2019s dead hand, but...\u201cI\u2019m staring at a fucking demon who knows what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019m getting sick and tired of hearing his jackshit stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans die every day,\u201d Niol said. \u201cNot really my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your problem. The killer brought Cara into his game, and his damn accomplice was in your bar, right in your face and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to Niol\u2019s office flew open.</p><p>Todd jerked his head toward the entrance, automatically reaching for his gun.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014Cara?\u201d She stood in the doorway, her chest rising and falling quickly, her long hair wet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were on Niol. Only Niol, and she asked starkly, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>The demon stared back at her.</p><p>Todd realized that his lady was trembling. He was by her side in an instant, catching her arms and pulling her against him. Damn but her skin was cold. \u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, and her eyes were pitch black. Her lips tried to curve into a smile, but the sight was so weak that he felt a hard clench in his gut. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She blinked once, twice. \u201cI-I need to talk to Niol. Please, Todd, let me talk to him for just a moment. Alone.\u201d</p><p>The clenching in his gut turned in to a hard kick. \u201cWhere are the patrols I put on you?\u201d Because, yeah, the lady was strong, but she wasn\u2019t invincible.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t want to take any chances with her life.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the club. They brought me here.\u201d Her skin was smooth. No makeup. No jewelry. She wore jeans, a pair of high, strappy sandals, and a light blue shirt. She looked so casual, so very perfect.</p><p>And a bit afraid.</p><p>No, a lot afraid.</p><p>What did you do? Her question rang in his ears. He wanted to stay there with her. His mouth opened as he began to demand that she tell him exactly what in the hell was happening.</p><p>\u201cTodd, please, this isn\u2019t about the Bondage Killer, okay? Just\u2014just trust me a moment and let me talk to Niol.\u201d</p><p>Trust. So simple to ask for, so hard to give.</p><p>He leaned forward. Kissed her chilled lips. He wanted to keep kissing her, until the heat and warmth flowed back into her.</p><p>Something had spooked her, and he wanted to find out exactly what had put the fear into his lover\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He raised his head. Gazed into her turbulent gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the other side of the door.\u201d</p><p>A soft sigh slipped past her lips. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hands to his lips. Kissed the palms. Too cold. His lady wasn\u2019t cold. She was fire. Passion.</p><p>Not ice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re gonna tell me everything.\u201d He didn\u2019t want any secrets between them, not ever again.</p><p>A slow nod.</p><p>\u201cCara...\u201d A hard edge cut through Niol\u2019s voice. \u201cSome things the human doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are some things that he does.\u201d Her voice was fierce. \u201cWait for me, Todd. I-I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss. One from her this time as she stood on her tiptoes and pressed her mouth against his. Her breasts brushed against his chest, the soft weight of her body an intimate caress.</p><p>Desire reared its head\u2014 as it always did when she was near. The urge to pull her against him, tighter, harder, flared through him.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>She pulled away, and though he wanted to hold her fast, he stepped back. Cast one last look at Niol, then stalked out the door.</p><p>Cara\u2019s past wasn\u2019t going to stop him from wanting her.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trusting her.</p><p>Now, if she would just start trusting him a little more.</p><p>The door closed with a quiet squeak. Cara\u2019s heart pounded so hard her body seemed to shake and the fierce drumming echoed in her ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got the fear in you, love?\u201d</p><p>Love. He used that endearment with everyone, but with her sister, well, she\u2019d thought he actually meant it then.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you a question, Niol, and I really, really need you to give me a straight answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your cop\u2014always asking questions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiol, damn it, I\u2019m serious! I need the truth!\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cHave I ever given you anything else?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond to that. Instead, she got to the question that was ripping her apart. \u201cDid you kill Lance?\u201d</p><p>No change of expression. He was far too good at deceit for that. \u201cWhy are you asking me this now, Cara? Haven\u2019t you known the answer to this question for years?\u201d</p><p>Had she? \u201cI thought it was you,\u201d she admitted as her hands balled into fists. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word all this time because I thought it was you.\u201d</p><p>There was a crack in his expression. The barest hint of worry that appeared in his eyes. He rose from his chair. Crossed slowly to her side. \u201cCara? Love, why are you so scared?\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2014he\u2019d always been able to read her so well.</p><p>Because she was scared right then, fucking terrified.</p><p>Todd fought the urge to shove his ear against the wooden door and listen for all he was worth. His partner\u2019s shifter senses sure would have come in handy right then and\u2014</p><p>From the corner of his eyes, he caught sight of a familiar figure.</p><p>Todd spun around. His gaze raked the crowd There. Striding away from the bar. Black hair. Cocky-as-hell walk as he sauntered toward the back exit.</p><p>Cameron.</p><p>Oh, no, the guy wasn\u2019t getting away from him that easily.</p><p>Now that he knew about the guy\u2019s history, he had a few more questions for the incubus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaw locked, Todd headed after him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to know,\u201d Cara said, shaking her head. \u201cTell me, did you kill Lance?\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s hand lifted and pressed against her cheek. \u201cWho\u2019ve you been talking to, love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCameron.\u201d The name seemed torn from her. \u201cHe found the body. Said he caught my scent on him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron? \u201d</p><p>She ignored his surprise, her words coming faster and faster as she told him, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I mean, why would Cameron have gone to Lance\u2019s place? He barely knew the guy.\u201d But Cameron had always been protective of her.</p><p>Too protective at times.</p><p>He\u2019d said that he knew what she had planned\u2014but, damn it, why go to Lance\u2019s apartment? If he knew that she was seeking vengeance, then why hadn\u2019t he just confronted her instead of going after Lance himself? Cara swallowed back the pain and demanded, \u201cDid you kill my sister\u2019s lover, or did Cameron?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you see Cameron?\u201d Fierce, growling.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, answer my question!\u201d A demand as fierce as his.</p><p>Niol flinched. \u201cI went to his place, is that what you want? I knew what had happened between the two of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He always knew. Everything.</p><p>\u201cI went to stop him before the little bastard could hurt anyone else that I\u2014\u201d His jaw clenched, then he growled, \u201cThe fool stood in front of me\u2014looked me in the eyes\u2014and told me that he was going to hunt you down and kill you. Just as he\u2019d killed Nina.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe had to die.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders fell. That was as close to a confession as Niol was ever going to give, and she knew that he spoke the truth.</p> <p>After her confrontation with Lance, she\u2019d known that the man would come after her. As soon as he\u2019d gotten his control back, yeah, she\u2019d figured he would come gunning for her. There\u2019d been so much fury in his eyes.</p><p>As much fury as she\u2019d had.</p><p>In her heart, when she\u2019d heard the news of his death, she\u2019d always suspected Niol. She knew that he cared for Nina\u2014knew that the bond he felt hadn\u2019t disappeared when the two had parted ways.</p><p>And Niol was a man long used to the power of vengeance.</p><p>She\u2019d suspected, but she\u2019d never spoken of the crime to him.</p><p>Now, she knew everything. Well, almost. Niol had killed to make certain she was safe, and Cameron...\u201cI-I thought\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWhen Cameron said that he\u2019d been there and caught my scent, I didn\u2019t understand. Didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d The certainty she\u2019d felt before about Lance\u2019s death had become a confused blur. \u201cI never knew that Cameron was at Lance\u2019s place that night, and if he\u2019d been there\u2014well, I thought maybe he\u2019d been the one to kill Lance.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she uncurled her fists. \u201cI guess\u2014I guess Cam was there\u2014trying to protect me, too, huh? But he just arrived too late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he arrived too late, all right.\u201d Niol\u2019s eyes blazed with a dark fire.</p> <p>Cara felt the power swell in the air around them. Her breath caught. \u201cNiol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he think it was you, Cara? Did Cameron think you killed Lance?\u201d</p><p>She could only nod.</p><p>\u201cFuck. \u201d</p><p>The chill she\u2019d felt back at her home iced her veins again. \u201cNiol\u2014what is it?\u201d What was she missing? What\u2014</p><p>He pushed her to the side, yanked open the door. \u201cBrooks! Brooks!\u201d</p><p>But her cop didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>And that numbing cold spread within her.</p><p>The alley was empty. Impossible. Todd tracked his gaze to the left, then the right.</p><p>The incubus had to be there. Cameron had exited barely ten seconds before him\u2014and no way was he buying that the guy was powerful enough to just vanish.</p><p>A whisper of sound. Fabric. Clothes? From up ahead, near the Dumpster.</p><p>Instinct had him reaching for his gun even as he called out, \u201cCameron Komak, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The gun was heavy in his hands, a weight he\u2019d grown used to years before. The weapon was up, pointed into the darkness. Just in case the guy hiding wasn\u2019t the incubus he was after, he said, \u201cListen up! I\u2019m an officer with the Atlanta PD. I want you to come out now, where I can see you.\u201d Shit, but it was dark. He caught the fast scuttle of bugs as he advanced. \u201cI said, come out. \u201d Where were the two officers who\u2019d been trailing Cara? He sure could have used some back up right then.</p><p>Every nerve in his body revved up, and with his instincts screaming danger, Todd was definitely on full alert.</p><p>So when Cameron stepped from the shadows, a smile on his face and his hands up, the gun never wavered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want now, cop? Your partner\u2019s already cleared me.\u201d</p><p>Not really. Gyth had told him that he was suspicious as hell of the three incubi he\u2019d interviewed, but since the guys didn\u2019t have any wounds to match the injuries Susan had given her attacker...</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a guy just take a piss anymore without the cops getting called in?\u201d Cameron drawled and began to lower his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>The smile widened. \u201cI saw your lady earlier. Cara sure looks good when she\u2019s barely dressed, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>A flash of fire heated his veins. Cara had been frightened. He\u2019d seen the fear in her eyes.</p><p>Had she been afraid of Cameron?</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing.\u201d He rocked back on his heels. Shadows fell over his body, concealing too much. \u201cWhere is Cara? Shouldn\u2019t she be with you, right by her lover\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>Todd\u2019s hold on the gun tightened.</p><p>Cameron laughed. \u201cAh, I see. She didn\u2019t run to you, did she? After our talk, she went to...him. I always wondered about them, you know. Was Niol really in love with Nina? Or was it Cara all the time?\u201d</p><p>The bastard was trying to push his buttons. \u201cI want you to step out of the shadows and come fully into the light.\u201d The guy\u2019s hands were clearly visible, and he wasn\u2019t holding a weapon, but Todd knew a threat when he saw one.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel to know that when the chips are down, Cara turns to him instead of you?\u201d</p><p>The bastard\u2019s shitty mind games weren\u2019t going to work with him. \u201cStep into the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want...\u201d</p><p>Cameron stepped forward.</p><p>The back door of Paradise Found shot open and slammed against the side of the building.</p><p>\u201cTodd!\u201d</p><p>His head jerked at Cara\u2019s cry.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him!\u201d Niol\u2019s order blasted through the night.</p><p>Cameron turned to run.</p><p>What the hell? Todd\u2019s gaze snapped back to him as he sprang forward. \u201cFreeze! Damn it, don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A woman stepped into the mouth of the alley. For a moment, the streetlight fell over the fire of her hair.</p><p>Todd\u2019s lips parted to shout a warning.</p><p>Cameron barreled into her and knocked her onto the ground. Their bodies tangled, twisted.</p><p>Todd rushed toward them, Cara and Niol on his heels and\u2014</p><p>The incubus rose with a sneer on his lips and his arms tight around Holly Storm. One hand locked around her neck, the other rose around her waist, so that his fingers pressed right against the middle of her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t take another step,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>In that moment, Todd knew that things had just taken a serious shit turn. He froze, but didn\u2019t lower his weapon so much as an inch.</p><p>\u201cCameron, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten you so upset, but you just need to calm down. I only want to talk to you. Let go of the woman and let\u2019s go back inside.\u201d He pitched his voice low, tried to sound soothing. A hard task with alarms shrieking in his head.</p><p>The incubus shook his head. Holly twisted against him, struggling, cursing, but he easily held her prisoner.</p><p>Too easily, and with that damn demon strength of his, Todd knew that Cameron could snap her neck long before he\u2019d be able to reach the reporter.</p><p>Hell. Hadn\u2019t he told the woman to go home? Why couldn\u2019t anyone take a simple order anymore?</p><p>The soft tap of a footstep had his eyes widening. He saw Cameron\u2019s gaze fly to the left.</p><p>To Cara.</p><p>Oh, no damn way was he about to risk her. \u201cGo inside, Cara. Go inside, now. \u201d</p><p>\u201cStay, Cara!\u201d Cameron\u2019s scream of fury. \u201cAfter all, this is all about you.\u201d</p><p>Aw, fuck.</p><p>Todd looked into Cameron\u2019s black eyes and saw madness. Fury. Hate.</p><p>Love.</p><p>All directed at Cara.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d seen that same look before\u2014in the eyes of men who\u2019d murdered their girlfriends. Men who\u2019d slaughtered their wives.</p><p>Their whole damn families.</p><p>He was staring at a killer.</p><p>A killer too fixated on Cara.</p><p>The signs had pointed to the obsession from the beginning. He just hadn\u2019t figured out the case fast enough.</p><p>No, the incubus wasn\u2019t clear in the Bondage Killings\u2014he was guilty as hell.</p><p>Todd took a step toward Cara.</p><p>\u201cStay away from her!\u201d A shriek of fury.</p><p>Todd froze. This bastard\u2019s past control. He knew he had to distract him\u2014no way did he want Komak focusing on Cara right then. \u201cHow\u2019d you do it?\u201d he asked, still keeping his voice easy while rage and fear pumped through his blood in a boiling mix.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you fool Gyth? You should have been covered with knife wounds and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed. Laughed. Then bent to press his nose into Holly\u2019s hair.</p><p>Her struggles stilled, as if the woman finally understood just how much danger she was in. About time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them.\u201d He inhaled slowly, as if savoring her scent. \u201cI never knew how much power humans had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, no...\u201d Cara. Horrified. Disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cWhen you take everything from them, the fucking rush is unbelievable.\u201d He turned his head, smiled. Madness. \u201cI\u2019m stronger now.</p><p>So much more damn powerful.\u201d Another laugh, one that floated on the wind and twisted the air. \u201cAnd I can heal ten times faster than before.\u201d</p><p>So fast there hadn\u2019t been a trace of the wounds on him. But Niol had said the guy was sick that morning. He hadn\u2019t fully recovered by then, but\u2014</p><p>But he had by the time Gyth found him and hauled his ass into the station.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cCara isn\u2019t the one you want.\u201d Niol\u2019s voice and damn if the demon didn\u2019t just saunter forward from the darkness. No weapon, well, hell, Todd guessed that wasn\u2019t totally true. If he really was a level-ten, then Todd figured the guy\u2019s powers were all the weapon he needed. Niol stopped just to Todd\u2019s right, standing nearly shoulder to shoulder with him.</p><p>Just what I need, the devil for backup.</p><p>The incubus blinked. Shook his head. \u201cThought it was...her.\u201d His voice was slower now, a bit confused. \u201cFor years...thought she\u2019d done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone what, Cameron?\u201d Maybe if he lunged forward fast enough, he\u2019d be able to break the demon\u2019s hold and free Holly.</p><p>Unlikely, considering how strong the guy was, but if he caught him off guard\u2014</p><p>\u201cI thought...she killed...my brother.\u201d</p><p>Snap. The last puzzle piece fell into place. Much too late.</p><p>Niol had told him, but he hadn\u2019t fully understood...\u201cCameron\u2019s mother left his father for a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...she had a new family to look out for...\u201d</p><p>The words played through his head, too loud.</p><p>Todd would bet that new family included a brand spanking new human brother named\u2014</p><p>\u201cLance.\u201d Cara breathed the name. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re the one who told him how to kill Nina!\u201d The agony in her voice pierced Todd like a knife.</p><p>The incubus was going down.</p><p>But first, he had to keep Cara safe.</p><p>And save the hostage.</p><p>Hell. Talk about not having an easy job.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s hold tightened around Holly\u2019s neck. \u201cThe bitch deserved it! She was always shaking her ass in front of me, acting like she was too good for my touch, but she laid down fast enough for Lance\u2014and then she tried to get him addicted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved him!\u201d A scream of fury. Todd flinched, unable to control his emotional response to the pain coming from Cara.</p><p>\u201cI told him what she was. Told him just how to stick the bitch so she\u2019d go down and not lift that demon head again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sonofabitch.\u201d Niol\u2019s voice was ice cold, where Cara\u2019s words had been fired with the heat of her rage. Niol stood, hands clenched, attention fully focused on Cameron. \u201cYou sold out your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLance was mine\u2014my brother, human, but mine!\u201d The blasting rage matched Cara\u2019s.</p><p>Todd could feel the change in the wind. The slight increase in temperature, the additional pressure of the air on his skin. Power was gathering. But whether it was Cara\u2019s, Cameron\u2019s, or, Christ Forbid, Niol\u2019s level-ten hell, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>And he really, really didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna make you pay, Cara!\u201d The fury was leashed now, but Cameron\u2019s eyes were still pitch black. The demon was out and ready to kill. \u201cI waited\u2014all these years, fucking waited until I was strong and you were weak. I found the perfect way to get back at you.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cI was gonna turn your world upside down and leave you with nothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2014you did that already! You and your brother destroyed my world when you took my sister away from me. She was all that I had!

The only one who understood me, the only one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Todd risked a small step forward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move!\u201d Cameron\u2019s hand jerked around Holly\u2019s neck and her eyes bulged as she fought for breath.</p> <p>\u201cLet her go, Cameron!\u201d Todd fired a glance toward Niol and found the demon standing with his legs braced apart, hands loosely at his sides.</p><p>Holly\u2019s nails scraped over Cameron\u2019s arms. Her legs kicked out, her hips twisted\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me! I don\u2019t need this shit and\u2014\u201d He broke off, lips curving. \u201cHumans are so damn easy,\u201d he said, but his voice wasn\u2019t the enraged killer any longer, it was the soft lover now.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Cara. \u201cHis scent...\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. The guy was about to make Holly a willing hostage. One that might do just about anything for her captor.</p> <p>No, he wasn\u2019t about to do it\u2014 he\u2019d done it. As Todd watched, helpless, her struggles stopped. She blinked and stood docilely in Cameron\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cSo damn easy,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they are,\u201d Niol agreed, voice taunting. \u201cThat\u2019s why your bastard brother was so quick to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one I should have hunted,\u201d Cameron yelled. \u201cYou. I should have known Cara wouldn\u2019t have the guts to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got the guts to kill.\u201d A promise was in Cara\u2019s voice. \u201cNow let the woman go and stand on your own to face us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can take me down?\u201d A sneer twisted his mouth. \u201cA low-level succubus and a human?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell, yeah, we can.\u201d No doubt in Todd\u2019s mind. His gun was still trained on his target. Ready for a head shot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to kill you in the next ten seconds,\u201d Niol said, voice like a breeze. \u201cSo what they can do, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Todd saw a flicker of fear in the incubus\u2019 eyes. \u201cYou move on me, I\u2019ll kill the human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not killing her!\u201d Todd yelled.</p><p>But Niol just said, \u201cEither way, you\u2019re dying tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shit. If Niol started using his powers, he was going to have a dead reporter headlining the stories on the news for the next two weeks, and the Other world really would be out in the open for all to see.</p><p>He turned his head toward Cara. He needed her help, and they\u2019d have to move fast, before Niol attacked.</p><p>A distraction.</p> <p>Her eyes met his. Black as the other demon\u2019s, but shining with trust. Her head moved in the slightest of inclinations.</p><p>She stared at the reporter, then dropped her voice low as she said, \u201cFight him. You don\u2019t want his touch. You don\u2019t like his smell.</p><p>He\u2019s evil, and you want to fight. Fight.\u201d</p><p>Magic flowed in Cara\u2019s voice. Power. Would her suggestion work on Holly? Hell, Todd didn\u2019t know\u2014and from the way Komak was responding, it didn\u2019t really matter. The bastard was breaking, crumbling apart. Rage flashed in his eyes as\u2014</p><p>\u201cShut up, you bitch! Just shut the hell up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Todd growled. Komak\u2019s focus was divided, just like he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>The perfect time to strike.</p><p>\u201cBurn, you bastard!\u201d Cara screamed at Cameron, just as she conjured one of her sweet balls of fire and threw it at the incubus.</p><p>As the fire spun toward him, Cameron cursed and lifted one of his hands as he struggled to send his own power at the swirling light.</p><p>And Holly Storm sprang to life then. She snarled, screamed, and twisted like a hellcat.</p><p>Her body fell to the ground when she broke his hold.</p><p>Todd was ready. As the flame disappeared into a wisp of smoke, he aimed and fired.</p><p>The blast rocked the alley, making nearby car alarms scream in the night.</p><p>The bullet thudded into Cameron\u2019s head and the demon stumbled back. But he didn\u2019t go down. \u201cFucking human, you\u2019ll have to do better than\u2014\u201d</p><p>Todd fired again. And again. Now aiming dead center for the guy\u2019s chest. Would he still live? Didn\u2019t know\u2014Cara had said there was only one way to kill an incubus, and this wasn\u2019t it\u2014but he was just trying to do his level damn best to take the bastard down.</p><p>The clip emptied and the soft snick of the pull on the empty chamber froze Todd\u2019s fingers. He stared at the demon\u2014the still-standing demon\u2014heart pounding, blood churning in his body and\u2014</p><p>Cameron fell to the ground, landing on his back as a pool of blood began to spread under his body. Todd reached for the extra magazine he made a habit of carrying. Reloaded the weapon. Cara started forward. He snagged her wrist. \u201cWait, baby.\u201d Her body trembled and he didn\u2019t know if it was fear or anger or some twisted mix of the two that caused her reaction, but he wanted to get Komak first\u2014just in case the bastard had any more surprises waiting for them.</p><p>The reporter pushed herself up. She stared at the incubus with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Cara said. \u201cDown, but not dead.\u201d</p><p>Good enough for the time being. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He asked her. She was pale, and still so beautiful that she stole his breath.</p><p>Even in hell.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know it was him. I swear, Todd, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Soft. If he didn\u2019t have a homicidal demon about ten feet away, he would have taken her into his arms and just held her until that fear and pain vanished from her face.</p><p>But holding her\u2014that would have to wait for later.</p><p>\u201cNiol\u2019s the one who figured it out, he knew that Cameron had a brother, just didn\u2019t know his name until I told him how\u2014\u201d</p><p>The incubus\u2019 body moved, just a bit. Twitched.</p><p>Damn it, the bastard better not be getting ready to rise like one of those B-movie horror freaks.</p><p>And why the hell hadn\u2019t the backup boys arrived? Two cops were somewhere in Paradise Found\u2014hadn\u2019t they heard the gunshots?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than you\u2019ve got to kill him.\u201d Niol slipped forward, moving like some kind of cat as his feet made no sound on the cement. \u201cAn incubus\u2014\u201d</p><p>So much for the bullets, but then, he\u2019d known that. \u201cCan only die in the middle of one of those weird-ass power drains, yeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Niol paused. \u201cCara just tells you everything, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>No, not yet.</p><p>After all, she hadn\u2019t told Todd how she felt about him yet.</p><p>Another twitch of the demon\u2019s body. Todd stalked forward, stopping only when he stood directly over the body.</p><p>Cara marched at his side.</p><p>Niol took up a position near the demon\u2019s head.</p><p>Holly stood, rather unsteadily, just a few steps away.</p><p>And as they watched, Cameron\u2019s eyes opened. Blood trickled from his mouth as he smiled\u2014then lunged upward.</p><p>Todd fired six more shots. Two into his forehead and four into his heart.</p><p>The demon went down once more.</p><p>Holly choked out a cry of disbelief.</p><p>Todd spared her the briefest glance. \u201cYeah, and this is what you thought the city was ready to see.\u201d He shook his head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cStill think that, Ms. Storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Brooks!\u201d</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he saw the two uniforms storm out of Paradise\u2019s back door.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>\u201cHow long will he stay down?\u201d He demanded, knowing that Cara or Niol would be able to tell him. If there was enough time, they could secure the scene, call McNeal and get some kind of transport and security setup ready.</p><p>Niol whistled. \u201cWell, considering he\u2019s got a hole the size of my fist in his chest and his head\u2019s not looking so pretty anymore, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve probably got a few days before our boy here so much as twitches again.\u201d</p><p>Good. A savage smile of satisfaction curled Todd\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to hear.\u201d He lowered his weapon. \u201cBack up my story,\u201d he ordered softly, realizing there would be a ton of explanations needed.</p><p>Niol shrugged.</p><p>Holly bit her lip, then nodded.</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t take her eyes off the body, but he knew she would agree. He could count on her.</p><p>He put his gun in his holster. \u201cStay there!\u201d He shouted to the uniforms. There was no second weapon on the scene, so they\u2019d wonder why the hell he\u2019d blasted an unarmed suspect with bullets\u2014and they\u2019d also probably want to know how the guy was still breathing.</p><p>\u2019Cause he was. Todd had seen the light rise and fall of the demon\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna keep \u2019em back. Cara, hell, baby, I hate to ask...\u201d</p><p>The faintest of smiles curled her lips. Her eyes were haunted, but a hint of humor slipped over her face. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be asking me to distract police officers, now would you, lover?\u201d</p><p>God, but she was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cJust this once...\u201d</p><p>Her head inclined. After one final glance, she turned away from the demon. Just turned her back on the man who\u2019d tried to set her up for murder and who\u2019d arranged the death of her sister.</p><p>Todd couldn\u2019t help it. The detective knew he should stand back, keep it professional with so many eyes watching them, but\u2014</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. Kissed her and tasted the sweetness of her fire on his tongue.</p><p>Her hands curled over his arms. Chilled, but so right.</p><p>He lifted his head. Forced himself to take a deep breath\u2014but he just smelled her.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d A whisper that slipped from the lips he\u2019d reddened. \u201cDo your job. We\u2019ll talk\u2014later.\u201d There was the faintest glint of moisture in her eyes and he knew she was fighting for her own control.</p><p>Hell, the woman had just faced her sister\u2019s killer with stunning fury. Yeah, he knew she\u2019d be able to keep her control now.</p><p>Giving a grim nod, he let her go. Then they began walking toward the officers and his nose twitched as he caught the deepening scent of her pheromones. Oh, damn, but this had better\u2014</p><p>A sudden blast of flames erupted behind them, and the fury of the fire ripped through the alley with the force of an explosion, sending Todd and Cara flying through the air.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Cara hit the ground hard. She felt blood pour from her knees, felt the trickle of the liquid on her palms. As fast as she could, she shoved to her feet, and her first thought was of\u2014\u201cTodd!\u201d</p><p>Then she saw him, rising a few feet away from her, face cut, hands dripping blood just like her own were.</p><p>Relief had her shaking.</p><p>Her gaze flew toward the back of the alley, but she knew what she\u2019d see. She should have known all along, really.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Todd\u2019s voice was stunned and she knew that he\u2019d just caught a glimpse of Cameron\u2019s charred body.</p><p>He took off running, heading straight for the still-flickering flames.</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t move, but her gaze tracked over to the left. Niol rose, his arms around the pale reporter. Cara\u2019s eyes met his.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told Todd, because it would have been impossible for him to manage the feat, but there was a second way to kill a succubus or an incubus. A way only the most powerful demons could master.</p><p>Complete incineration, an incineration that started from within the body. If the fire began in the heart, then blasted outward, the demon could be destroyed.</p><p>But there were so few who could manage that much power.</p><p>So few.</p><p>Niol held her stare.</p><p>He\u2019d loved her sister, in his way. And he\u2019d wanted vengeance just as she had.</p><p>A vengeance he\u2019d achieved.</p><p>A vengeance he\u2019d given to her.</p><p>Cara\u2019s head moved in the briefest of nods. Her heart ached as she thought of Nina. Of the life that had been cut far too short by the darkness in demons and men.</p><p>Justice had finally been given to her twin. Perhaps now, the nightmares would stop.</p><p>And Nina could rest.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d A stunned male voice.</p><p>Ah, the other officers. She\u2019d nearly forgotten about them.</p><p>Todd jerked off his shirt, and he battled against the flames. Didn\u2019t really matter\u2014she knew the fire would die away in moments.</p><p>But the two uniformed officers, they did matter. She closed her eyes, let her power stir inside her, and Cara pushed her scent hard into the air. Her eyes opened\u2014one last look. Then, for the second time, she turned away from Cameron. The man she\u2019d once called friend. The man who\u2019d tried to destroy her.</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be the last time she would think of him, she knew that. Turning away\u2014it didn\u2019t mean she could shut him out or stop the memories. Her heart ached, her soul raged.</p><p>But it was over.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Nina was at peace.</p><p>Cara took careful steps toward the cops. The heel of her left shoe was broken, and her clothes were torn. She probably didn\u2019t particularly look sexy, but how she looked, well, that really wasn\u2019t the issue. The closer she got to the men, the more dazed their expressions became.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she pitched her voice low, injecting a strong dose of hypnotic power, \u201cremember this. When you arrived at the crime scene, the body was already burning and Detective Todd Brooks was fighting as hard as he possibly could to stop the flames.\u201d</p><p>Truth mixed with deception always worked the best.</p><p>Good-bye, Cameron. Hope you enjoy the hell that\u2019s waiting...wonder if it\u2019s as hot as Niol\u2019s flames...</p><p>Sometimes, fate had a way of giving people exactly what they deserved.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The next evening, McNeal sat at his desk, glaring down at the neatly typed report before him. \u201cThat woman from News Flash Five saw everything?\u201d</p><p>Todd cleared his throat. \u201cUh, yes, sir.\u201d Since she\u2019d been less than five feet away and had wound up with singed hair, it would have been hard for Holly Storm to avoid the whole self-combusting incubus scene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>McNeal\u2019s eyes rose, then pinned Todd in his chair. \u201cAnd she\u2019s gonna keep quiet?\u201d</p><p>He hoped. \u201cI think so.\u201d The woman had been shell-shocked, but before the ambulance attendants loaded her up, she\u2019d grabbed his hand and told him, voice hoarse from the fire and Cameron\u2019s powerful grip, \u201cYou\u2019re right. No one\u2019s ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the two uniforms?\u201d McNeal demanded. \u201cBilly Mane and Tyler Johnson? They\u2019re both backing up the story about the fire?\u201d</p> <p>With a little help from Cara. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>McNeal grunted.</p><p>\u201cTodd secured the scene,\u201d Colin said. \u201cHe did the damn best he could under the circumstances and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, stop defending him, Gyth.\u201d McNeal closed the report with a snap. \u201cI know he secured the scene the only way he could.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Nice of Colin to back him up. Maybe he\u2019d finally forgiven him for the whole your-lover-might-be-a-killer thing.</p> <p>The bastard should have forgiven him\u2014Todd wasn\u2019t holding a grudge against Colin for suspecting Cara. Mostly because he\u2019d thought she was guilty in the beginning, too.</p><p>They were both idiots.</p><p>But it looked like they\u2019d officially gotten past the twisted shit in their lives and gone back to being a team again.</p><p>\u201cI just want to know,\u201d McNeal growled, \u201cif Brooks here thinks that bastard Niol was involved in the torching.\u201d His lips pursed.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause that part wasn\u2019t in this neat little report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d He kept his voice calm. \u201cThis is the report that you want presented to the DA and the mayor, correct?\u201d</p> <p>Another grunt.</p><p>\u201cThe report tells, clearly, that when I entered the alley, I discovered Cameron Komak, burning. I tried to put out the flames.</p><p>Several other witnesses\u201d\u2014that would be Niol, Cara, and Holly Storm\u2014\u201csoon entered the alley. The police were notified.</p><p>Unfortunately, the heat from the flames was so intense that Cameron died on scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I went to Cameron Komak\u2019s house after I was informed of the incident,\u201d Gyth picked up the story with barely a pause,</p><p>\u201cI found undeniable evidence to link him to the killings of Simon Battle, Travis Walters, Michael House, and Susan Dobbs.\u201d Now, that part was actually true. The guy had made a whole fucking wall in his place dedicated to the crimes. He\u2019d had clothing belonging to the victims, photos\u2014a fucking sick shrine.</p><p>Gyth shook his head. \u201cThe man apparently had an obsession with Cara Maloan, and in his twisted mind, he was punishing Cara by attacking the men who showed interest in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd framing her for their deaths, right.\u201d A hard exhalation of air from McNeal \u201cNice little package you\u2019ve got for me.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cNice pretty bow you put on the case.\u201d</p> <p>Todd\u2019s shoulders stiffened. \u201cKomak was the one who tied things up with that damn wall.\u201d He\u2019d gone to the apartment after Gyth had notified him and seen it for himself\u2014 fucking insane.</p><p>\u201cThis report will be fine for the mayor and the DA and any of those other vulture reporters who want info on the case.\u201d McNeal picked up a pen, began to tap it casually against the desktop. \u201cBut you left out a few details...like, oh, say, just how the hell did Cameron Komak catch on fire?\u201d</p><p>He pissed off a demon. Todd didn\u2019t speak those words, because he didn\u2019t have proof. He had a suspicion that went straight to his soul, but there was no way anyone would ever be able to prove Niol\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the fire started. Smith\u2019s looking at the body. She\u2019ll be in soon to brief you on what she\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about his alibis? They checked out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alibis were given by humans,\u201d Colin reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Komak planted the memories in their heads,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThey never actually saw him those nights\u2014he just used his demon power,\u201d which was pretty damn scary, \u201cto make them think they had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Disgust coated McNeal\u2019s voice. \u201cThese cases just get harder and harder.\u201d</p><p>Todd shrugged. \u201c\u2019Cause the criminals are a different breed.\u201d One that he\u2019d be ready to face now, head-on.</p><p>He rose slowly, pushing up from his chair. He was bruised and sore as hell from the fall he\u2019d taken in the alley, and he couldn\u2019t wait to go home and curl up in bed with his succubus.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you goin\u2019?\u201d McNeal demanded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know, Captain?\u201d Colin asked, and a smile lifted his lips. \u201cThe man\u2019s got a date waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d McNeal\u2019s dark brows bunched. \u201cWith the succubus?\u201d No censure. Just curiosity.</p><p>Todd gave a stiff nod.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with that one, Brooks. A woman like her, if she gets away from you, you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life kicking your own ass.\u201d</p><p>Then Todd was the one to smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Captain, I don\u2019t have any intention of letting her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d He tracked his gaze over to Colin. \u201cYou gonna finish filling me in?\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>McNeal jerked his thumb toward the door. \u201cThen get the hell out of here, Detective. I think you\u2019ve more than earned some rest...</p><p>or a night off with your lady.\u201d</p><p>Todd didn\u2019t have to be told twice.</p><p>He found her sitting at the edge of her pool, staring down into the glowing water. She wore a loose, flowing top and a pair of dark shorts. In the faint light, her pale legs gleamed.</p><p>He\u2019d kept his distance from her all day, knowing that the media glare would be on the case, and needing to wait until he\u2019d presented his report to the captain before he got close to her again.</p><p>But, at least for him, the case was over now. The killer had been caught.</p><p>Killed.</p><p>Not by his hand, and not in a way that he understood. Because he could have sworn when he battled those flames\u2014they had been coming from inside Cameron\u2019s body.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Or, at least that\u2019s what he would have thought, once.</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t glance up at his approach, but he saw her shoulders stiffen, and he knew that she was aware of him.</p><p>He walked toward her slowly, stopping only when he was close enough to reach out and touch her\u2014and he did, lifting his hand to smooth over the long silk of her hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you...\u201d her voice, husky, sexy, made him ache, \u201cgoing after him?\u201d</p><p>Todd blinked. Not the question he\u2019d been anticipating.</p><p>Cara turned her head, glancing over her shoulder so that their eyes met. \u201cYou know it was Niol, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d known the minute he saw the flames that Niol was responsible. When Cameron had threatened to kill the reporter, Niol had been too calm, too certain when he\u2019d said, \u201cEither way, you\u2019re dying tonight. \u201d</p><p>And Cameron had died.</p><p>But Cara needed to understand something. He stared into her eyes, and told her the truth. \u201cIf I could have killed Komak, I would have.\u201d Because the bastard had gone after her. Killed her sister, and, in his gut, he knew Cameron wouldn\u2019t have stopped until Cara had suffered the same fate.</p><p>And anyone who threatened his woman\u2019s life\u2014well, Todd intended to take them down, by any means necessary.</p><p>Yeah, he was a cop. But he was also a man.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t prove that Niol was behind Cameron\u2019s death.\u201d And no matter how long Smith looked at the body, he doubted she\u2019d find any evidence to link the demon to the crime.</p><p>Her feet lifted from the water\u2019s edge. After a moment, she rose slowly and turned to stand before him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let him go?\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cFor now.\u201d If the bastard fucked up in the future, he\u2019d go after him. But, for now, with this case\u2014well, there really wasn\u2019t a choice.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about us?\u201d Her eyes matched the darkness of the night. \u201cNow that the case is over, are you just going to let us go, too?\u201d</p><p>What? He grabbed her arms, holding her tight and helplessly noting the softness of her skin. \u201cIs that what you want? To get rid of me now?\u201d God, he hoped not, because if she left him now\u2014</p><p>He\u2019d never be the same.</p><p>\u201cAm I what you want?\u201d She asked, voice just as hard and desperate as his had been. \u201cAm I really what you want, Detective Todd Brooks? A demon to take home to the family? A woman who will always be different, one who will always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe mine.\u201d Not a question, a statement of fact. In his heart, she was his. Would be his. Always. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t really give a shit about what the rest of my family thinks. Not that I\u2019ve got much of one left, anyway.\u201d A few cousins, spread across the United States. \u201cHell, baby, your family is the one I\u2019m more concerned about.\u201d How would they feel about having a human in their fold?</p><p>\u201cAll day,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you. Wanted you. Wanted to touch you and taste you and\u2014\u201d He broke off, because he had to feel her mouth under his. The kiss was too fierce, bruising in its intensity, but she met him, her lips feeding on his with a wild hunger\u2014a hunger he knew well.</p><p>The thought of losing her\u2014it ate away at him. His hands worked on her clothes, all but yanking the fabric away. Todd needed to feel the softness of her flesh against his, needed it more than breath right then.</p><p>He had to show her how good it was between them. How good it would always be.</p><p>But her hands rose and pushed against his chest. His head lifted.</p><p>\u201cTodd...it\u2019s more than sex to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The question pierced his heart. \u201cDo you even need to ask, baby?\u201d This time, when he kissed her, his lips were soft. \u201cYou\u2019re in me, Cara. So deep inside me. Hell, I didn\u2019t think anyone would ever know me like you do.\u201d And he hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d ever need anyone the way he needed her. \u201cI told you once that I would follow you into hell.\u201d His hands lifted and he framed her face. \u201cI meant that. I\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014not just saying\u2014\u201d She stopped, shook her head. Her face was wistful, her eyes watchful.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand, baby? You\u2019re mine\u2014the woman I\u2019ve always wanted, and never thought I\u2019d find.\u201d Todd had to swallow before he said, \u201cI know I should be better. More, for you, but I\u2019m just a man, a man who touched the best thing he could have ever imagined one night.\u201d Time to drop his pride. \u201cI love you, Cara. Love every part of you, and if you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life showing you just how damn good a human and a demon can be together.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved upward slowly, and the darkness in her gaze seemed to lighten. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything in this world or any other.\u201d Stark truth. And, damn, but he was praying she felt even a fraction of the same way about him. She had to feel something, and if she gave him enough time, he\u2019d show her how great they could be together.</p><p>\u201cI know things started the wrong way between us.\u201d Extreme understatement. \u201cI wish I\u2019d met you without the case. Just seen you singing one night.\u201d He would have felt the same way about her, but the suspicions and accusations wouldn\u2019t have been between them.</p><p>Her right hand lifted, and she traced the lines of his face. \u201cDo you know that before I met you, I was ready to give up sex?\u201d</p><p>He slowly shook his head, shocked. Could a succubus even do that?</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cThen I met you, and everything changed for me. Everything. \u201d</p><p>He hoped she meant\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you, Todd Brooks, and I will keep loving you for all the very, very long years of my life.\u201d</p><p>She loved him. Fucking miracle. He crushed her against him, drove his tongue deep into her mouth, and tasted the paradise he\u2019d been craving.</p><p>It should have been a soft, tender mating. Their feelings were spoken now, real, but the emotions were too raw, as was their hunger.</p><p>Their hands fought, ripped at the clothing. Fabric gave way quickly beneath the assault.</p><p>Then his mouth was on her breast. Licking, sucking, kissing, loving the sweet flesh. His hands shoved down her shorts. Tore away her panties to find the creamy flesh that waited for him.</p><p>Her fingers unsnapped his jeans, pulled down the zipper, and his arousal sprang out, hard, ready, so eager for her that moisture coated the broad head of his cock.</p><p>There was no waiting. He stumbled over to the chaise longue. Nearly fell onto the cushions and dragged her down over him.</p><p>Her thighs were parted, so when she fell onto him, she straddled him and her hot, wet sex slid over his cock.</p><p>Another kiss. Lips, tongue. Tasting. Taking.</p><p>His hands touched her\u2014frantic touches, caresses all over her flesh.</p><p>Her fingers wrapped around the length of his erection. Squeezed, stroked, and had his eyes rolling back into his head.</p><p>His lips tore from hers. \u201cCan\u2019t...wait.\u201d</p><p>Her smile would have tempted a saint\u2014and it sure as hell tempted a cop. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Then she was positioning his length, lifting her hips, and pushing the head of his arousal into the tight opening of her sex.</p><p>He thrust up, jerking his hips off the chaise at the exact moment her hips drove down onto him. Their moans filled the air as his cock lodged deep within her.</p><p>When her sex clenched around him like a hot fist, there was no stopping him. Todd\u2019s hands dropped to the cement for balance and his hips began to piston up against her. Harder. Faster. The night sky glinted above\u2014a million shining stars winked over Cara and he thrust, sinking into the hottest paradise he\u2019d ever know and starring at stars\u2014and his succubus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were shining. A glow inside the darkness. Her hand was on his chest, right over his heart.</p><p>The heart that had always been hers. He just hadn\u2019t known\u2014</p><p>Her sex contracted, a ripple of movement that had Todd gritting his teeth and choking out her name.</p> <p>Release was moments away, but damn it\u2014he never wanted the passion to end.</p><p>Never wanted to leave her.</p><p>Her thighs clamped over his legs. The site of her bare breasts tormented him, and his head jerked up. Todd caught one nipple in his mouth, then slammed deep into her again.</p><p>The warmth of her palm seared his skin. Power filled the air. Danced over his body.</p><p>The climax hit him, and the world exploded into a shower of those stars he\u2019d seen. Millions of stars. Pleasure flooded him as he pumped into her, driving as fully into her honeyed clasp as he could go, and filling her with the hot essence of his release.</p> <p>Her magic roared through him and she called his name. Her hips bucked, her sex clenched, and the quiver that shook her body shivered through him.</p><p>He licked her breast as the aftershocks of pleasure hummed through his system.</p><p>His hands rose from the cement and wrapped around her.</p><p>Todd\u2019s head lifted and he stared up at her face.</p><p>His Cara.</p><p>The spark of her energy danced in the air, the spark that even now was heating his flesh and sending energy pumping inside him.</p> <p>When he kissed her again, he tasted the magic and he tasted the power of the woman he\u2019d gladly fight the devil to possess.</p><p>And, well, perhaps he already had.</p><p>The bull pen was all but deserted when Smith knocked lightly on Danny McNeal\u2019s office. It was well after 11 P.M., but she knew he was still working. Though the blinds were drawn in his office, faint light glowed from beneath his door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d His voice was gruff, hard, as it usually was.</p><p>Her shoulders straightened and her left hand rose automatically to smooth over her hair.</p><p>Then she walked inside, keeping her head high and her strides long and easy.</p><p>She saw his eyes widen, just the tiniest fraction, when he caught sight of her.</p><p>\u201cDr. Smith.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, so she was back to doctor, hmm? Smith placed her report onto his desk. \u201cMy notes on Cameron Komak\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his pen. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>Well, there hadn\u2019t exactly been a lot left to work with.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the determination?\u201d</p><p>Now this was the tricky part\u2014but she had a feeling she\u2019d probably be dealing with a lot of tricky cases from now on.</p><p>The thought wasn\u2019t as unsettling as it had once been. In fact, now, well, the cases almost seemed...challenging.</p><p>The visits she\u2019d been secretly having with Emily were starting to pay off.</p><p>All of the Other weren\u2019t evil. She was understanding that. Accepting that.</p><p>Smith met his stare directly. \u201cOff the record, my belief is that Mr. Komak self-combusted.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink. \u201cSelf-combusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. The fire appears to have originated internally\u2014as opposed to an external stimulus like gasoline or\u2014\u201d</p><p>McNeal held up a hand. \u201cGo back to the internal part.\u201d</p><p>Simple enough. \u201cI think the fire started inside Mr. Komak\u2019s body. Specifically, in the region near his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d expected that response. He pointed toward her notes. \u201cThat\u2019s not in the report, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy notes list a fire of undetermined origin.\u201d And that was true. She didn\u2019t know how the fire had started\u2014just where it had flared to life.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doctor. That should be all I need, for now.\u201d</p><p>A dismissal. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDoes that mean the case is closed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy detectives discovered indisputable proof to link Komak to the killings.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cShortly after Komak died from that fire of undetermined origin, Gyth searched the guy\u2019s apartment and found one of those hell walls that the serials like to keep. So, yeah, the case of the Bondage Killer is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there will be more, won\u2019t there? More cases like...this.\u201d</p><p>His chair squeaked as he rose. His shoulders were so wide, so strong, and his face\u2014she\u2019d always thought he had the face of a warrior. \u201cThere have always been cases like this. The only difference is that now we aren\u2019t transferring them away from you anymore, they\u2019re coming to you.\u201d He stalked around the desk. \u201cThat gonna be a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>The Other, they still frightened her. Or, some of them did. Whoever had managed to burn Cameron Komak from the inside out, that guy scared her, but Smith realized she had to start trusting the supernaturals that she knew well. Like Colin.</p><p>And it was definitely past time for her to trust the one she\u2019d let into her heart so long ago. \u201cThey won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Deliberately, she looked him over, running her gaze from his gleaming head down to his too-big feet. \u201cBut you will be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes returned to his face just in time to catch his wince. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. I\u2019m not gonna bother you, personally, anymore, Dr. Smith\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, see, now that\u2019s my problem.\u201d She closed the distance between them. Wrapped her hands over his shoulders. \u201cI want you to keep on bothering me.\u201d She kissed him. Mouth open, tongue ready.</p><p>His arms locked around her, jerking her tight against his chest\u2014his heart.</p><p>Just where she liked to be held.</p><p>The kiss was hungry, wild, and held a desperate need\u2014his need, hers.</p><p>Oh, God, but she\u2019d missed him.</p><p>Her hands pushed between them, began to fumble with the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>McNeal dragged his mouth from hers. \u201cNathalia...Hell, babe, don\u2019t tease, don\u2019t let me think you want me again when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted you.\u201d Her nails stilled against the white front of his shirt. \u201cEven when you were such a damn idiot.\u201d Because a little thing like her man talking to animals, well, that wasn\u2019t going to push her away.</p><p>Time to claim her lover again.</p><p>She glanced over at his desk and didn\u2019t even try to stop the smile that rose on her lips. \u201cFeel like taking a walk down memory lane?\u201d</p><p>His hungry growl was more than answer enough for her.</p><p>Cara watched Todd while he slept. Stared at the shadows beneath his eyes and the faint stubble on his jaw.</p><p>The sun rose slowly, and still she watched him. There was more that she needed to tell Todd, and she knew that when his eyes opened and he stared at her in the morning light, it would be time to share another secret with him.</p><p>She\u2019d never told another human what she would tell him, but Todd deserved to know.</p><p>So when his eyelids finally opened and he gazed at her with sleepy brown eyes, she felt a moment of fear.</p><p>Then he lifted his hand and smoothed his fingers over her cheek.</p><p>He won\u2019t leave. The knowledge was certain in her heart.</p><p>\u201cTodd.\u201d His name whispered from her lips. \u201cI need\u2014there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rolled onto his side. They\u2019d made love again during the night. Sweet love, slow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you haven\u2019t noticed it yet, but you will, soon.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cBeing with me, if we stay together, long term, um, you\u2019re gonna start seeing some side effects.\u201d</p><p>The sleep disappeared from his gaze as his body began to stiffen. \u201cSide effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the easiest conversation to have with a lover. She\u2019d known that, and put it off as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cJust what kind of side effects are we talking here?\u201d</p><p>Okay, he didn\u2019t sound overly worried. Good. \u201cYou\u2019ve never asked me how old I am, Todd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-eight. I saw the age on the license we found and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou look twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and she\u2019d keep on looking that way\u2014for a long time to come. \u201cThe power that succubi get from sexual energy\u2014well, you see, part of that power\u2014it renews us.\u201d</p><p>A line appeared between his brows. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m following you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, follow this.\u201d A quick breath. \u201cSex for a succubus, it\u2019s like dipping into a fountain of youth.\u201d And that was one of the reasons her kind were so hard to kill. Frozen forever at a perfect age of health and vitality\u2014yeah, it was hard to take \u2019em down.</p><p>His eyes widened and a soundless whistle passed from his lips. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Another whistle, a quiet one this time. \u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2014you\u2019re some kind of immortal?\u201d</p><p>Something like that. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you and we share the power, you get dipped into that fountain with me.\u201d A pause. Okay, she was starting to sweat. \u201cIf you keep staying with me, and I don\u2019t take, and we both exchange the power\u2014your body will start renewing like mine.\u201d He\u2019d never be as strong as she was, because he hadn\u2019t been born an incubus, but when she poured the magic and power into his body, he would renew the same way.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t live forever. She wasn\u2019t a true immortal. There were few of those guys left. But she and Todd, well, they\u2019d sure live more than their share of days together.</p><p>\u201cThose side effects I mentioned\u2014well, you won\u2019t have as many gray hairs and wrinkles and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me!\u201d He\u2019d shot upright and astonishment was clear on his face.</p><p>Cara shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a minute to take that in. Cara rose beside him, tugging the sheet up to cover her breasts.</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cHmmm. Are women gonna start following me around now because my scent is supersexy?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d better not, or she\u2019d kick their asses. \u201cNo. The longer life span and physical appearance\u2014those the only changes you\u2019ll have.\u201d The only ones she\u2019d ever known a human mated with one of her kind to have. The renewing power was secret and sacred, and custom dictated that it was to be shared only with the mate of a succubus or an incubus.</p><p>Todd was her mate, forever.</p><p>\u201cSo now you know another of my secrets,\u201d she told him, and raised her chin. \u201cAnd the choice to stay or go,\u201d because it wouldn\u2019t be easy, having a longer life when so many that surrounded him\u2014so many that he cared for\u2014weren\u2019t able to walk the earth with him for those days. \u201cThat choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d He repeated, then he caught her arms, rolled fast, and pinned her beneath him on the bed. \u201cTrust me, baby, there\u2019s no going for me.\u201d His kiss was warm and hungry. \u201cI\u2019m right where I want to be, with the woman I want, for the rest of my damn life.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed against her chest at his words. \u201cAre you sure? Think about it, Todd. I can\u2019t just take from you\u2014it\u2019s not an option.\u201d Long-term mating with a succubus without the exchange of power would result in death for a human. \u201cYou\u2019ll be different.</p><p>From your family, your friends.\u201d He needed to understand the road he would take with her.</p><p>\u201cWe can end things now,\u201d she told him. \u201cBefore you change, before anything else happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d Said simply. \u201cI\u2019ve already changed.\u201d</p><p>What? No, he hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen I met you, I changed.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to go back to being the guy I was before. I want to spend the rest of my days\u2014however many I get\u2014with you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but that sounded good to her. She tried to smile, because it was either smile or start crying like a baby. \u201cThen I guess you\u2019re okay with my latest secret, huh?\u201d</p><p>His lips hitched into a half-smile, a smile that showed off the dimple she loved so much. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m fine with all your secrets\u2014and I know you\u2019ve got more.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, I\u2019ll discover them all.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her lips. \u201cEvery.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cLast.\u201d A swipe of his tongue. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...ah...know my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them.\u201d Whispered against her mouth. \u201cBut one day, one day I just might...\u201d</p><p>Then he lowered his head and pressed his lips against the sensitive skin of her neck, and the passion Cara felt for Todd rose once again in her body.</p><p>As she arched against him, Cara realized Todd was right. She did have a few more secrets. Nothing too dangerous.</p><p>And maybe\u2014maybe he would discover them all.</p><p>But first, well, first she\u2019d make certain she discovered his.</p><p>She could hardly wait for the games to begin.</p><p>Good thing they had plenty of time ahead of them.</p><p>Long days, longer nights, great sex, and a few secrets.</p><p>Things might get a bit wild for her and her detective, but that would be just fine for Cara.</p><p>In fact, that was the way life for a succubus should be.</p><p>Wild, sexy...and so damn satisfying.</p><p>Try MAXIMUM EXPOSURE,</p><p>Alison Kent\u2019s latest,</p><p>in stores now from Brava...</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re hoping to find, and I\u2019ll tell you everything that I know.\u201d</p><p>Finn McLain lowered his digital Rebel with telephoto lens and glanced at the woman who\u2019d joined him at the bistro\u2019s very small table for two\u2014the table where he\u2019d been working his coffee more than his camera since setting up shop at nine.</p><p>She was hot, Miami hot, Latina hot, hot like chilies beneath the Florida sun.

She sizzled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was sizzling. Water droplets on an iron skillet. Empanadas scorching his tongue.</p><p>He set the camera on the scrollwork tabletop, stretched out his legs, and wishing for a glass of water, laced his hands low on his belly. Outwardly, he was cool, a pro. He knew his business.</p><p>It was his insides that were scrambling to figure out how badly he\u2019d fucked up. If she\u2019d pegged him as more than a tourist, how great was the chance that he\u2019d also been made by his mark?</p> <p>His dark lenses hiding anything she might see in his eyes, he finally came back with, \u201cGuess you won\u2019t buy it if I say I\u2019m just taking in the sights?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her hair a colored mix of brown sugar and honey. \u201cYou want to sell me on anything, sweetheart, you\u2019ll have to do a better job than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d he asked, still not admitting to any particulars.</p><p>She settled into the chair, which looked like it was fashioned from licorice strings, crossing her legs and revealing a whole lot of thigh where her skirt fell open at the side. And not just thigh, he quickly came to realize, just as quickly tugging his gaze from all that bare skin back to hers.</p><p>\u201cThis is the second time this week I\u2019ve seen you and your phallic equipment in front of my store,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head, indicating the designer boutique across the way. \u201cEither you\u2019re a competitor looking to see what\u2019s selling, or you\u2019re keeping tabs on someone who frequents the area.\u201d The area being a ritzy and exclusive shopping spot near Miami Beach.</p><p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>He reached up, pushed his sunglasses a half inch down his nose, glanced over, and winked. \u201cI just like taking pretty pictures.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, her long dark lashes as thick as the bristles on an artist\u2019s brush. \u201cMore like you don\u2019t surveil and tell.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged lazily. He wasn\u2019t one to commit. \u201cYou mentioned telling me everything you know. Whenever you\u2019re ready...I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p> <p>She looked across the street, where cars no longer drove, where trees now grew in beds lush with shrubs and tropical flowers, her mouth twisted up as if she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to say anything at all.</p><p>He studied her while her attention was elsewhere, certain she knew exactly what he was doing, while not the least bit bothered by the invasion of her privacy.</p><p>It was ten a.m. It was early October. Meaning it wasn\u2019t hot enough or far enough into the day for her to look as disheveled as she did.</p><p>She\u2019d said the store across the street, Splash &amp; Flamb\u00e9, was hers, and that led him to believe that she had an intentional reason for looking like she\u2019d just tumbled out of bed, her caramel hair swirling this way and that where it fell free from the clip holding it.</p><p>She leaned forward, then propped an elbow on the table\u2019s edge and rested her chin in her hand as she met his gaze, daring his to keep from drifting into her cleavage.</p><p>But he was a guy, and it was there in the deep V of her neckline, where the lapels of her jacket gaped over her blouse, and he wasn\u2019t going to pretend otherwise.</p><p>He managed not to swallow his tongue and didn\u2019t even bite it when she used the tip of one slender finger to stroke his big lens.</p><p>\u201cWhat would it cost to hire you?\u201d she asked, and he started to tell her she could have him for the price of a post-coital cigarette.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t smoke, and because he still wasn\u2019t sure if she knew he was a PI and wasn\u2019t spying for a competitor, he asked, \u201cHire me for what?\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head, her long gold earrings dangling against her neck. \u201cYou do this professionally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still avoiding commitment.</p><p>\u201cI need to have some portraits done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWww.yellowpages.com.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d she said, with a smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t want a random photographer. I want you.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was a photographer...or was this some sneaky female test to trap him into admitting otherwise? \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. You haven\u2019t seen my work. You\u2019re picking me up on the street. How is that not random?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you. You\u2019ve seen me.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah. Understatement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that qualifies as the start of a beautiful friendship.\u201d</p><p>He sat straighter, cupped his hands around the metal seat, and lifted the chair, turning it so he could better face her. The legs scraped against the concrete of the sidewalk as he sat, scraped again as he scooted closer, conducting a sneaky-man test of his own.</p><p>\u201cIs that what we\u2019re doing here? Becoming friends? You, me, and my camera?\u201d Something was going on here. He needed to know what the mystery was.</p><p>She uncrossed her legs, then crossed them the other direction, her foot swinging in the space between his calves, her skirt leaving nothing to the imagination where the side slit opened. Her thigh was bare long past the spot where it became her hip, and her skin was bronzed and sleek.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend,\u201d she began, back to toying with his lens, her nails long and painted with a coat of clear shine. \u201cHe owns an art gallery. He\u2019s been after me for a while to hire a photographer before he hires one for me.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d thought. A mystery. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you let him? Save yourself the cost and the hassle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said, her head still inclined, her fingers now fondling the charms on her earring. \u201cIt\u2019s just the nature of the pictures he wants. The nature of his gallery. I don\u2019t do what I do for just anyone, and so only the right photographer will work.\u201d</p><p>His antennae twitched. He wasn\u2019t sure this was anything he wanted to know. But he had to ask. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p><p>She cut her eyes to his. \u201cI let people look.\u201d</p><p>Uh, whoa. Just whoa. Finn found his head nodding, like he couldn\u2019t keep it still with that picture bouncing around inside.</p><p>She let people look.</p><p>The next question should probably have been, \u201cAt what?\u201d But the way she\u2019d said it, he didn\u2019t need to ask.</p><p>He knew. </p> </body></html>"]
