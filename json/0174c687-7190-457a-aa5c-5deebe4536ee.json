If she\u2019d been any other woman, he might have openly admired her slender body, might have wondered if the black hair gracefully coiled around her head felt as silky as it looked, might have dared to run a hand over the brown skin that wasn\u2019t covered by her long red dress. He might have enjoyed the way the dress swished in counter rhythm to her swaying hips. He might have wondered if the way she caressed her chin with that large white feather was a subtle invitation for other kinds of caresses.</p><p>But Dorothea SaDiablo was a Black Widow, a member of the Hourglass, the most dangerous and feared covens in the Realm of Terreille. Black Widows specialized in poisons and journeys of the mind, in shadows and illusions, in dreamscapes that could ensnare a man and leave him locked in an endless nightmare.</p><p>She was also the Red-Jeweled High Priestess of Hayll. Since there were noQueensin theHayllianTerritorywho could match the psychic strength that Jewel signified, and since no weaker Queen who wanted to stay whole and healthy challenged her authority, Dorothea ruled as she pleased\u2014which was something no male in Hayll dared to forget.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen your predecessor lately?\u201d Dorothea purred as she swished past him. Her coquettish smile didn\u2019t match the vicious pleasure in her gold eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Priestess,\u201d Krelis replied, trying to keep his voice neutral. When he and a troop of men had gone into the slums of Draega, Hayll\u2019s capital, to round up some of the dregs for expendable labor, he had seen his former commander stumbling out of a filthy alleyway.</p><p>The former Master of the Guard was now a maimed, tortured mockery of the man he\u2019d been. Worse, his inner web, that intimate core of Self that made the Blood who and what they were, had been shattered so that he could no longer wear the Jewels, could do no more than basic Craft, if even that. The keen tactical mind that had protected Dorothea for so many decades had been split open like a melon and scraped clean. But not completely. If the haunted eyes in the scarred face were any indication, enough thought had been left for him to remember what he had been. And who had done this to him.</p><p>Dorothea swished past Krelis again. Sweat beaded his forehead as he blanked his mind and prayed to the Darkness that she wouldn\u2019t sense anything that would make her want to open his inner barriers and sample his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI gave your predecessor an important task, and he failed me.\u201d Stopping in front of him, Dorothea smiled as she brushed the feather against his cheek. \u201cNow he belongs to the Brotherhood of the Quill.\u201d</p> <p>Krelis shuddered. Mother Night! To be shaved of all the organs that made a man a man. To need one of those large quills to ...</p><p>\u201cAreyou going to fail me?\u201d Dorothea purred, leaning close to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Priestess,\u201d Krelis stammered. \u201cTell me what you wish of me, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise man.\u201d She tickled his lips with the feather before turning away. \u201cYou know of the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>Had he failed already? Oh, he\u2019d heard vague whispers a few months ago, but he\u2019d still been aThird Circleguard at the time\u2014and commanders weren\u2019t in the habit of telling their men more than was necessary. Feeling sick, he swallowed hard, and managed to whisper, \u201cNo, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea flashed a malicious, amused look at him before resuming her leisurely pacing. \u201cShe\u2019s a dangerous enemy, a Gray-Jeweled Queen who rules the Territory called Dena Nehele on the other side of theTamanaraMountains. She\u2019s been a thorn in my side since she set up her court forty years ago, and she continues to fight my attempts to bring the Realm of Terreille under the beneficent guidance of Hayll.\u201d</p> <p>Krelis said hesitantly, \u201cSince she\u2019s not from one of the long-lived races, surely she must be old by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still strong,\u201d Dorothea snapped. \u201cAs long as she continues to live, Dena Nehele will be able to resist being drawn into Hayll\u2019s shadow, and the Territories bordering it will be strengthened by that resistance. Even if she died tomorrow, it would still take at least one of their generations to eliminate her influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intend to declare war on this Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>Dorothea\u2019s gold eyes turned hard yellow. \u201cHayll does not lower itself to such barbarities as war. What would be the point of acquiring a Territory that had been savaged by the kind of war the Blood fight?\u201d She tapped the feather against her chin. \u201cThere are subtler ways of making a Territory ripe for the plucking. But that doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>Krelis stared at the floor. \u201cNo, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour task is to eliminate the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think before he blurted out, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She looked disgusted. Was she regretting savaging the old Master and losing that tactical mind? Then her expression changed.</p> <p>\u201cPoor boy,\u201d she murmured, gently stroking his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been cruel to you, haven\u2019t I? No, darling\u201d\u2014she pressed her fingers against his lips\u2014\u201cyou needn\u2019t deny it. There\u2019s no reason why you would know that bitch\u2019s habits.\u201d She stepped back and sighed. \u201cGrizelle is too well protected in her own Territory for you to reach her there. However, over the past few years, she\u2019s come out of her lair twice each year for the slave auctions at Raej.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave auctions.\u201d Krelis\u2019s gold eyes lit up.</p><p>Dorothea shook her head. \u201cRaej is considered neutral ground. If a Queen were killed there for any reason, others might hesitate to visit, and then how would everyone sell the toys they\u2019re ready to discard and buy new ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA slave could be replaced with a loyal servant and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t buy anyone from Hayll, and there are no loyal servants outside of our own people. Sometimes not even within our own people.\u201d</p><p>Krelis leashed his frustration. This was the first important task she\u2019d given him since he became Master of the Guard a few months ago. He wouldn\u2019t fail. He wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThen what should I do, Priestess?\u201d</p><p>Dorothea stopped pacing. \u201cLord Krelis, you\u2019re the Master of the Guard. How you accomplish this is entirely up to you.\u201d Her expression softened. \u201cHowever, if you wish me to, I\u2019ll use my particular Craft to assist you in whatever way I can.\u201d</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea studied him for just a little too long. Then she smiled. \u201cI knew I\u2019d made the right choice in my new Master of the Guard. I made the same offer to your predecessor, but he didn\u2019t want my help. Since the bitch escaped his trap rather easily, that was reason enough to doubt his loyalty, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Remembering what the former Master\u2019s face looked like now, Krelis shivered. \u201cYes, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have to worry aboutyour loyalty, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea walked up to him and wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cYou know, darling, I\u2019m very generous with a male who pleases me.\u201d She rubbed her breasts against his chest, kissed him thoroughly, then purred, \u201cThat\u2019s to remind you of the rewards that come from serving me well. And this\u201d\u2014she tucked the large white feather into his belt\u2014\u201cwill remind you of the penalties of failure.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Nothing that had been done to him over the past nine years had hurt as much as the harsh truth that he had brought this on himself. With one error in judgment, the eighteen-year-old boy he had been, that young strutting buck who had been so sure of himself, had sent him down this pain-filled road. A road that would soon end in the brutality that waited for men in the salt mines of Pruul.</p><p>Over the past few days, while he had waited to be brought to the slave auction, he had tried very hard to forgive that boy for ignoring the uneasiness his friends had felt and the warnings the older Warlords had given him when that witch had walked into the inn. He had tried to forgive him for not looking beneath the surface, for not sensing the rot that existed beneath the beautiful face and lush body, for grabbing that musky bait with such enthusiasm. He had tried to forgive him for believing the whispered words that had promised a forever filled with nighttime romps, for being so caught up in the pleasure between his legs that he\u2019d let her put that gold ring around his cock because she\u2019d poutingly told him about all the naughty things she wanted to do with him and for him\u2014but not until he wore a Ring of Obedience because she needed alittlecontrol over his passion .</p><p>She\u2019d played with him for a day before he learned just how cruel the Ring of Obedience could be when it was used by someone who enjoyed inflicting pain.</p><p>Having been a pleasure slave for the past nine years, he couldn\u2019t remember why he\u2019d ever wanted to get into bed with a woman.</p><p>And he blamed that boy, bitterly. With the salt mines of Pruul waiting for him, oh, yes, he blamed that boy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Red-Jeweled Warlord doing inthis pen?\u201d one of the slaves whispered. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually put the likes ofhim downhere .\u201d</p><p>Another slave spat. \u201cDon\u2019t matter what Jewels a slave wears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough, but ... I remember seeing him before. I thought he was a pleasure slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d a third man answered, \u201cuntil he became a Queen killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen killer!\u201d</p><p>Queen killer. Queen killer.</p><p>Jared remained in the corner of the slave pen he had claimed for himself, ignoring the whispers that swirled around him, pretending he didn\u2019t see the way the other men avoided him. Even here, in the vilest slave pen, Blood males who were now considered unmanageable for anything but the meanest labor didn\u2019t want to be contaminated by a man who had a Queen\u2019s blood on his hands.</p><p>He understood that. When the blinding rage had faded enough for him to see the bodies of the Queen and her Prince brother, he had been horrified by what he\u2019d done.</p><p>His breath hitched as emotional pain ripped through him again, threatening to tear him apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One part of himself had been horrified, that was true enough\u2014the part that had learned the Warlord\u2019s code of honor from his father, the part that had been raised to serve the distaff gender. But another part, a savage part that he hadn\u2019t known existed, had howled in triumph.</p><p>The pain eased, again, while that wild stranger inside him prowled the edges of his mind and heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust that stranger, even feared its presence.It wasn\u2019thim . But he would use its savagery one more time for just one reason: He wanted,needed , to get home just long enough to see his mother and take back the words he\u2019d had years to regret saying. After that . . .</p> <p>There was no point thinking there would be anything after that. But it would be enough.Had to be enough.</p><p>Which meant he had to escape tonight. Tomorrow, Raej\u2019s autumn slave auction would begin. The witches who came to this island to buy and sell would be on the auction grounds accompanied by hired guards, and the guards watching the pens would be too edgy, too quick to react toanything a slave did.</p><p>So tonight he would find a way to get close enough to the official landing place outside the fairgrounds and catch one of the Winds, those webs of psychic roadways that allowed the Blood to travel through the Darkness. He would catch one and ride it all the way back to Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>The decision made, Jared watched the sun set and the quarter moon rise while he thought about his mother, his father and brothers, his home . . . and the boy he used to be.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Krelis closed the small wooden box Dorothea had given him, then used Craft to vanish it.</p><p>All the plans were made. There was nothing he could do but wait.</p><p>Staying in the Master\u2019s office made him feel too confined, so he left the building that housed theFirst Circleguards and began walking aimlessly across the practice fields.</p><p>Thank the Darkness Dorothea hadn\u2019t demanded his presence at dinner tonight. While his bloodlines could be traced to two of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families, his family on both sides was from minor branches. He\u2019d grown up in a small village, and he still wasn\u2019t comfortable in the jaded, glittering aristo society that made up the social power of Hayll. A man on guard duty during one of these functions could watch the seductions and the games, could listen to the double-edged conversations, could observe the dance of wealth and power without having to participate. But the Master of the Guard was one of the three most important males in a court, and, when required, he was expected to socialize with the people who gathered around his Lady. He was expected to talk with the other men and dance with the women, was expected to flirt just enough not to give offense, without flirting so much that servicing the woman would be required.</p><p>He\u2019d already sweated through a couple of smaller functions. He didn\u2019t need to dance on the knife edge tonight.</p><p>Leaving the practice fields, Krelis followed a bridle path until he reached a small reflecting pool. Sitting on a stone bench near the pool, he watched the still water.</p> <p>Either the former Master of the Guard had become arrogantly foolish or he\u2019d turned traitor. That was the only way Krelis could explain the failed attack on the Gray Lady when she was returning to Dena Nehele after the spring auction at Raej.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t strange that the Master hadn\u2019t led the attack. Along with the Steward and the Consort, the Master seldom left the court unless he was accompanying his Lady. His duties were no longer in the field. But one of those duties was to choose the right men for an assignment.</p><p>The old Master had sent a handful of lighter-Jeweled,Fifth Circleguards and a small band of marauders to destroy a Gray-Jeweled Queen and the escort waiting for her at the Coach station. There had been no time to overwhelm the escort before the Gray bitch\u2019s arrival. There had been no backup force to attack her if she tried to escape on the Winds. There had been nothing.</p><p>Only one of those lighter-Jeweled Hayllian guards had returned to report the failure.</p><p>One was all Dorothea had needed.</p><p>Well, he hadn\u2019t made that mistake. He had tame marauder bands waiting at the Coach stations the Gray Lady would most likely use on her return from the auction. They would eliminate any escorts waiting for her and send a messenger to Lord Maryk, his second-in-command. Maryk, along with carefully selected, experienced First andSecond Circleguards, would arrive at the station just ahead of the Gray Lady to finish the kill. If that ambush wasn\u2019t completely successful, and Maryk and the men were killed, he still had a way to keep track of the bitch and leave a trail the marauder bands could follow. The hunt would continue until the Gray Lady was destroyed.</p><p>Krelis fingered the Master\u2019s badge on his left shoulder.</p><p>With the spells Dorothea had woven for him, his strategy would bring down her most dangerous rival. That would prove to the aristo bastards in the First and Second Circles that he wasn\u2019t some upstartThird Circleguard who had gained a coveted position in the court by using his cock.</p> <p>Of course, he didn\u2019t know any male who wouldn\u2019t use sex in order to achieve his own goals.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t always been like that.</p><p>He remembered that night so many, many years ago. He\u2019d been permitted to stay up when some of his father\u2019s friends had come to the house for their weekly chess games and male conversation. The evening had grown late and he\u2019d been dozing on the couch when his father, who had a strong interest in Hayll\u2019s history, especially where it pertained to the Blood, had gently voiced his concern about some of the changes that had taken place in their society over the past few centuries. Olvan had made no accusations, had named no names, had merely pointed out some differences in the way males who didn\u2019t serve in a court were treated.</p><p>The next day, when he and Olvan were taking a rambling walk along one of the country lanes near their village, the Queen of the Province and twelve of her guards came riding up. The Queen had snapped a few questions at Olvan, becoming more and more enraged with his respectful replies.</p><p>A few minutes later, Olvan dangled from a tree branch. The spelled ropes around his wrists had prevented him from using Craft to undo the knots or sever the ropes. Even if he\u2019d managed to free himself, his Jewels weren\u2019t dark enough to challenge the combined power of the Queen and her guards.</p><p>They let him hang there while he pleaded with the Queen to tell him how he had displeased her. When the pleading finally stopped, six of the guards uncurled their whips.</p><p>The force of the blows swung Olvan back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>There had been no sympathy in the guards\u2019 faces, no mercy in the strong arms that wielded the whips. If anything, there had been a hint of fear in their eyes, as if coming in contact with a male who didn\u2019t understand obedience would taint them somehow and make them less desirable to the Queen they served.</p><p>Through it all, another guard had held Krelis and made him watch.</p><p>When they rode away, they left his father hanging there, half-dead.</p><p>Krelis still remembered running desperately to the nearest house for help, still remembered sitting next to his father\u2019s bleeding body during the ride back home, still remembered the Healer\u2019s reluctance to do anything.</p><p>And he still remembered the moment, years later, when he realized that the whipping had nothing to do with the courteous answers his father had made to the Queen and everything to do with Olvan\u2019s oldest and most trusted friends never once coming back to the house or inviting his father to any of theirs.</p><p>That was the moment he decided to train to be a guard.</p><p>That was the moment he understood that how males were treated in the past didn\u2019t matter. The only thing that mattered to a young Hayllian male was surviving the way things werenow . And the only way to do that was to serve in a strong court.</p><p>Krelis stood up and stretched.</p><p>So here he was just beginning his sixteenth century\u2014a young man by the standards of the long-lived Hayllian race\u2014and he was already the Master of the Guard of the strongest court in Hayll. An important goal in itself, but now just a stepping-stone toward the other things he wanted.</p><p>He had worked too long and too hard to let some Gray-Jeweled bitch who would die in a few decades anyway spoil his plans.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>He had almost made it, had almost gotten close enough to catch one of the Winds. If he\u2019d had a few more seconds before the auction steward had used the Ring of Obedience to pull him down and make him easy prey for the guards and their whips, he would have been home by now.</p><p>He would have had those seconds if he had killed the guard keeping watch on the slave pen. But at the last moment, when that wild stranger inside him had surged forward intent on the kill, he had seen the same fear and knowledge in the guard\u2019s eyes that had been in the eyes of the Queen just before her blood had covered his hands . . . and he had yanked that savagery back. His attack had stunned the guard long enough for him to escape from the pen, but the man had recovered too quickly, had been able to sound the alarm too soon.</p><p>There would be no other chance. Not after last night.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Mother. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so pretty now, do ya, twat-licker?\u201d Pain and the guard\u2019s sneering words brought Jared back to the present. He looked at the man\u2014a vicious brute whose Yellow Jewel was as grimy as the rest of him\u2014and said nothing.</p><p>The guard hawked and spat. \u201cAll you pretty boys, prancing around in your fancy clothes, acting like you was better than other men,real men, who know what to do with their spears. Well, no one\u2019s going to want to play with you now, are they, pretty boy? \u2018Cept theQueensin Pruul, and everyone knows what kind of gamesthey like to play.\u201d The guard grinned, showing a black hole where a couple of teeth were missing.</p><p>Jared watched the guard warily. He\u2019d been brought back to this slave pen at dawn, forced to his knees, and then tied so securely to the four waist-high iron posts he couldn\u2019t move at all, not even his head. He\u2019d had no food or water since yesterday afternoon\u2019s ration. The auction steward in charge of the controlling ring connected to his Ring of Obedience had been sending low-level pain through the Ring since his capture last night. His genitals were so tender that even a fly walking across his balls made him grit his teeth to keep from screaming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flies were an additional torment, buzzing around the lash wounds on his back and belly that had reopened when the guards had pulled his hands behind his back and yanked his arms up to tie the straps to the back posts.</p><p>One fly landed on Jared\u2019s cheek. He closed his eye before the fly could reach it.</p><p>The guard stared at him for a moment, then cursed savagely. \u201cYou son of a whoring bitch, are you winking at me?\u201d Grabbing Jared by the hair, he used Craft to call in a knife, then slowly turned the blade until all Jared could see was the sharp edge. \u201cWell, slut, you don\u2019t need two eyes to dig salt.\u201d</p> <p>Jared panted as the blade came closer, closer. Explaining wouldn\u2019t help him. Neither would pleading. If he used Craft to protect himself, all the guards would be down on him and, by the time it was over, he\u2019d end up losing more than an eye.</p><p>Just before the blade came close enough to cut, the guard jerked, stumbled back a step. He shook his head as if to clear it, then rubbed the small of his back with a fist. When he turned around, he froze and let out a soft whimper.</p><p>Jared blinked rapidly, not sure if it was tears or sweat blinding him. Didn\u2019t matter. The guard was between him and whatever had caught the man\u2019s attention.</p><p>During those long seconds when the guard stood frozen, Jared became aware of the silence. All the usual, small noises inside a slave pen had stopped, as if slaves and guards alike were afraid to do anything that might call attention to themselves.</p><p>Finally, the guard vanished the knife and moved away slowly, awkwardly, as if his legs had become unsteady.</p> <p>No longer blocked by the guard\u2019s body, Jared looked straight into Daemon Sadi\u2019s cold, golden eyes.</p><p>If pleasure slaves were the aristos in the slave hierarchy, then Daemon Sadi was as far above the rest of them as they were to the slaves used for hard labor. Looking at his broad-shouldered body and beautiful face or listening to his deep, sexy-edged voice was enough to arouse most women\u2014and quite a few men, regardless of their preference. He could seduce anything that breathed.</p><p>They called him the Sadist because he was as cruel as he was beautiful. Owned by Dorothea SaDiablo, he\u2019d been a pleasure slave for centuries and wore the Ring of Obedience. He was also a strong Warlord Prince, and people who annoyed Sadi had an odd way of disappearing.</p><p>Jared sighed in relief when Daemon finally looked away, the bored expression on that beautiful face betraying no thoughts, no feelings. But the voice that reached Jared on a Red psychic spear thread held sympathy and understanding.</p><p>*So. You finally couldn\u2019t stomach it anymore.*</p><p>Jared thought of the last Queen who had owned him, and the kinds of bedroom games she and her Prince brother had wanted to play. He shuddered. *No, I couldn\u2019t stomach it anymore,* he replied. *I couldn\u2019t stomachthem.*</p> <p>If Daemon hadn\u2019t taken an interest in him eight years ago when they\u2019d been in the same court, he wouldn\u2019t have survived this long. Pleasure slaves tended to become emotionally unstable after a few years of serving in the bed. Daemon\u2019s lessons had helped him stay detached from what he was ordered to do, or what was being done to him.</p><p>Even that detachment hadn\u2019t been enough that last time.</p><p>*The bitch deserved to die,* Daemon said, as if killing a Queen was so commonplace it wasn\u2019t worth more than a casual remark. Which, for Sadi, was probably close to the truth. Then his tone changed, and he sounded like a teacher who was mildly annoyed with a favorite student. *But you could have been more subtle.*</p><p>The woman next to Daemon tugged on the sleeve of his black, tailored jacket. She seemed confused to find herself so far away from the amusements and the merchant booths. Compared to Daemon\u2019s looks and Hayllian coloring\u2014 golden-brown skin, glossy black hair, and gold eyes\u2014she looked bleached and plain. She mumbled something and tugged again.</p><p>Daemon ignored her.</p><p>Jared couldn\u2019t hear the words, but he heard the whine in her voice. His muscles tensed. He held his breath.</p><p>She spoke again, but her whining was cut off by Daemon\u2019s low, vicious snarl. She quickly stepped away from him. Once she was safely out of reach, she raised her voice. \u201cI could use the Ring.\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled, a cold, brutal smile.</p> <p>The guards exchanged nervous glances and shifted their feet.</p><p>*It seems my Lady requires some entertainment,* Daemon said. There was something beneath the bland tone that made Jared wonder if the Lady wasn\u2019t going to be very sorry she\u2019d made that threat.</p><p>*May the Darkness embrace you, Lord Jared,* Daemon said as he offered his arm to the Lady and started to walk away.</p><p>*And you, Prince Sadi.* Jared replied.</p><p>They were out of sight when Daemon\u2019s last words reached him. *That guard\u2019s going to come down with a mysterious fever. He\u2019ll recover, but he\u2019ll never regain enough strength in his limbs to resume his duties. What use do you think a man like that will have in a place like Raej?*</p><p>Jared shuddered, grateful Sadi had already broken the link between them. He owed Daemon a great deal, but there were things about the Sadist he preferred not to know.</p><p>Another fly landed on his cheek.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes, and tried not to think. Tried not to remember. And failed.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, the day had waned to dusk. At any moment, the bell that signaled the end of that day\u2019s auctioning would ring. The Blood Lords and Ladies who came to buy preferred to do so in harsh sunlight that didn\u2019t hide flaws that wouldn\u2019t be as apparent when a naked slave was displayed in muted candle-light or, better yet, flickering torchlight.</p><p>He saw the guard standing outside the pen, watching him. Not one of the usual brutes. The badge on the clean uniform jacket indicated that this was one of the guards who hired out as an escort. It was a fixed rule at the auction; Ladies were required to hire two of Raej\u2019s guard escorts to help with any slaves they might purchase. Since the man was alone, his partner was probably guarding the slaves that had already been purchased.</p><p>Which still didn\u2019t explain why the man was wandering around near the pens that held the most-condemned males. It still didn\u2019t explain why the bastard was staring at ...</p><p>Something crept through the air. Something tantalizing. Something intriguing. A psychic scent that made his heart speed up and his muscles quiver. A scent that made the wild stranger inside him strain toward it, wary and eager\u2014 and hungry.</p><p>A Queen\u2019s scent.</p><p>Jared looked at the empty space beside the guard escort. Except it wasn\u2019t empty.</p><p>Despite feeling certain of what he would see, he looked straight at her and still almost didn\u2019t see her. She was gray, and stood so still she blended into the dust and the waning light and the taste of despair.</p><p>No.No ! Notthat one .</p><p>He began hoping, desperately, that the auction bell would ring. Then, maybe, if the Darkness was kind, she wouldn\u2019t return in the morning, wouldn\u2019t come back to stare at him with those hard gray eyes.</p><p>There were a few courts where being a slave was almost tolerable. There were others where every command abraded a man\u2019s soul.</p><p>In the slave quarters, stories and rumors were fearfully whispered in the dark. Warnings and advice were passed along. Because of that, the slaves had a saying: the bite of a lash was better than being owned by Dorothea SaDiablo; being owned by Dorothea was better than dying in the salt mines of Pruul; but dying in the salt mines was better, far better, than being touched by Grizelle, the Gray Lady.</p><p>No slave who went into her Territory ever came out again. No slave survived being owned by the Gray-Jeweled Queen who was standing outside the pen, so silent and so still, looking at him.</p><p>Fear swelled inside him until it overwhelmed all the rest of the day\u2019s torments. Tied to the iron posts, he couldn\u2019t turn away, couldn\u2019t even look down since the wide, tight leather collar kept him from moving his head. Isolated, he couldn\u2019t blend in with the other slaves who clustered on the other side of the pen. He was pinned, alone, physically and emotionally naked beneath that gray stare.</p><p>She terrified him. The only advantage he\u2019d ever had was that theQueenswho had owned him hadn\u2019t worn Jewels that could threaten his inner web. But the Gray Jewels were darker than the Red, and a Queen who could tear apart his inner barriers and shatter his inner web as easily as she could tear apart his body wasn\u2019t a woman he wanted to get close to. In any way.</p><p>But the wild stranger, that beast that had been so angry and so eager to kill, now wanted to crawl to her and expose its belly in an act of complete submission.</p><p>That terrified him even more.</p><p>\u201cLady, there\u2019s nothing here of interest. These males are unmanageable, unfit for anything but hard labor.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the undercurrent of worry in the man\u2019s voice, Jared focused on the guard escort standing next to Grizelle. The man had reason to worry. A hired escort who failed to protect the Lady in his charge would probably find himself on the auction block the next morning.</p><p>Ignoring the escort, Grizelle withdrew one hand from her robe\u2019s wide sleeves and pointed at Jared. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s chest clenched so hard he couldn\u2019t draw a breath. Hell\u2019s fire! Even hervoice was gray!</p><p>And she wanted him.</p><p>No no no no no!</p><p>\u201cThatone?\u201d The escort sounded shocked. \u201cLady, that one killed the last Queen who owned him and attacked a guard last night, trying to escape. He\u2019s going to the salt mines unless someone buys him for a killing sport.\u201d</p><p>Listen to him, Jared thought fiercely, trying to make her feel the words without risking a direct link.I\u2019m tainted, twisted, past any hope. I\u2019ll fight you with everything I am for as long as I can, and I\u2019ll hate you long after that .</p><p>The finger didn\u2019t waver. The gray eyes didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>As he focused on the finger pointing at him, nine years of pain and fear began to crystallize into deadly, chilling hatred. He\u2019d once believed in service and honor. Now all he believed in was cold hatred and rage. He was a Red-Jeweled Warlord from Shalador. He was Blood. He\u2019d fight her, and die in the fighting. That was better than cringing and cowering while she tore him apart piece by piece.</p><p>The wild stranger howled in distress and desire, fighting against the very rage it should have embraced, shattering it almost before it formed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat one,\u201d the Gray Lady said again.</p><p>You will not have me, Jared thought as he watched the reluctant approach of the auction steward who had been summoned.I will not yield to you. Even if I can\u2019t do anything else, I can still do that much. Will do that much .</p><p>When a price was finally agreed upon, the steward bowed to Grizelle, then gestured to two of the guards inside the pen. \u201cWe\u2019ll clean him up for you, Lady,\u201d he said. His pompous smile died beneath that steely stare. \u201cI\u2019ll have him and the papers ready in ... an hour?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>The steward paled. \u201cOf course, Lady. I\u2019ll see to it personally.\u201d</p><p>Offering no response, Grizelle and her unhappy escort walked away.</p><p>They gave him no chance to fight. Not that he could have with the way his cramped legs screamed when the guards hauled him to his feet. They attached two chains to the wide collar and kept his hands tied behind his back. With a prissy smile, the steward increased the level of pain coming through the Ring of Obedience until Jared\u2019s already unsteady legs buckled and breathing took all of his concentration.</p><p>The short walk to the small building where lower-class slaves were delivered to their new owners took forever and ended too soon.</p> <p>The wash-down room contained a pump and half barrel, a wooden table that held a large chest, and two iron posts positioned on either side of a drain.</p><p>Pain shot through the Ring at the same moment the guards untied his hands. By the time Jared could think again, his wrists and ankles were cuffed to the posts. One guard pumped water into the half barrel while the one who\u2019d wanted to cut his eye rummaged through the chest. Jared\u2019s gorge rose when the guard turned around and held up a wide strip of leather that had buckles on the ends and a leather ball sewn to the center.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth, pretty boy,\u201d the guard said with a sneering smile as he came toward Jared. \u201cYou know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth.</p><p>Vicious pleasure filled the guard\u2019s eyes as he held the gag in front of Jared\u2019s mouth. \u201cOpen your mouth, or I\u2019ll break your teeth.\u201d</p><p>The steward appeared in the doorway between the rooms and huffed with annoyance. \u201cWe\u2019ve no time for this. She\u2019ll be here soon. Besides, he\u2019s already bought. If there\u2019s any fresh damage, the bitch will demand compensation.\u201d His voice shook a little, leaving no doubt about the kind of compensation the Gray Lady would demand.</p> <p>Another flash of pain came through the Ring of Obedience. Jared kept his teeth clenched and tried to ride it out, but it didn\u2019t end, didn\u2019t end, didn\u2019t end until he opened his mouth in a breathless scream.</p><p>With a satisfied grunt, the guard shoved the gag into his mouth and buckled the straps behind his head.</p><p>The wide leather collar was too thick and stiff to yield to the pressure of bone, so opening his mouth had forced his head back. His tongue worked relentlessly to keep the leather ball from sliding too far back. His stomach twitched, threatening to respond forcefully if he choked. And his mind . . .</p><p>It was during his third year as a pleasure slave, serving in a Black Widow\u2019s court. She wasn\u2019t Hayllian, but she\u2019d been a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Dorothea SaDiablo and had relished the lessons on how to cripple the male spirit. He remembered what it felt like to lie on his back, tied hand and foot to the bed, wearing a gag like this one. Already dosed withsafframate , a vicious aphrodisiac, he\u2019d had no control over his body\u2019s merciless need. He\u2019d lain there, helpless, while she played with him and rode him until he screamed.</p><p>Something had twisted inside him that night, and he\u2019d felt the first flash of savagery. But it had taken six more soul-killing years before his father\u2019s training and the ingrained honor and respect Blood males felt for the feminine gave way to hatred strong enough to let him fight back. Six years between that night and the night that savagery had broken free and he killed the Queen and her Prince brother. But two years ago, he\u2019d secretly rejoiced when he\u2019d heard that that Black Widow had played one game too many with the Sadist\u2014and had lost.</p><p>A slap on the belly brought him back to the wash-down room and the current source of pain.</p><p>The guard bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cSince you ain\u2019t going to the salt mines now, the least we can do is bring a little of the salt mines to you.\u201d</p><p>The other guard grinned as he opened a large sack and poured coarse-grained salt into the half barrel of water. Using Craft, he raised the half barrel and guided it across the room.</p> <p>Jared closed his eyes as the half barrel floated toward him. He ignored his quivering body.</p><p>He would make a brutal dive down into the abyss until he reached the full strength of his Red Jewels. He would gather every drop of strength he had. And as he dove, he would place a Red circle around the building to form a psychic boundary. Then he would unleash all the power he had gathered. That Red strength would hit that boundary and turn back on itself. Even if someone survived the initial unleashing of that much dark power in a small space, the backlash would finish the destruction. They would all die\u2014 and so would he, because he wasn\u2019t going to hold back any of that Red strength to shield himself.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Mother. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>He dove into the abyss.</p><p>The wild stranger rose to meet him, smashed into him, stopping his descent.</p><p>Damn you, LET ME DIE! Jared screamed as he tried to slip past the part of himself that had become his enemy and reach his Red strength.Let me \u2014</p><p>The half barrel of salty, frigid water flooded over him. Jared\u2019s muscles locked around his lungs. The open lash wounds burned. He couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>With a scream of rage, the wild stranger dove back into the abyss, going so deep he could no longer feel it, could no longer find it.</p><p>Sagging, Jared felt the pull in his shoulders as his arms took his weight. The plan he\u2019d had a moment ago to destroy himself became less than a memory. The past nine years of slavery pressed down on him until he thought his shaking body would snap under the weight.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t broken. His psychic power was still there, but, somehow, the wild stranger had taken away the will to use it.</p><p>I\u2019m a Shalador Warlord. I am Blood.</p><p>The words sounded pathetic and empty now.</p><p>The guard removed the gag, pulling out strands of Jared\u2019s dark hair that had gotten caught in the buckles.</p><p>Jared absorbed the new pain, idly wondering if a soul could bleed to death, if that\u2019s why he felt so weak and hollow.</p><p>He was dimly aware of the guards untying him, half dragging him into the next room, then cuffing him to another set of iron posts. The steward appeared in front of him and said something that sounded sharp, but the words were murky smears, and he couldn\u2019t hold on to them long enough to understand them.</p><p>Someone removed the wide leather collar.</p><p>His chin sank to his chest.</p><p>His mind drifted until fingers gently lifted his chin and he found himself captured by hard gray eyes. They looked into him as if his inner barriers were completely crumbled, and there was nothing he could call his own\u2014no thought, no feeling she couldn\u2019t examine and discard as a worthless trinket. He cringed as memories of his family kept trying to surface. He didn\u2019t want her to have his memories of his younger brothers, his aunts and uncles, his cousins, his father. His mother. No, he didn\u2019t want her to have his memories of Reyna, especially not the last memory of her standing there, bleeding from heart-wounds his brutal words had caused.</p><p>The gray eyes still held his, but the fingers drifted down his shivering body, brushed over the hair at his groin, gently circled him like a different kind of Ring, and finally circled the Ring of Obedience. He felt the tight band of gold expand until he felt nothing at all.</p><p>Turning slightly, she flicked her right hand toward the wooden table in the room. The guards\u2019 startled gasps didn\u2019t completely muffle the other sound\u2014like a heavy coin spinning, like a child\u2019s hoop that finally loses speed and circles round and round, lower and lower until the ground claims it.</p><p>\u201cLady!\u201d</p><p>The shocked exclamation meant something, but Jared felt too empty to react. His body hurt so much it didn\u2019t even register the usual discomfort that came from the Ring of Obedience\u2014the discomfort that effectively kept a man\u2019s attention focused on the threat of pain.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Lady, Ring him!\u201d</p><p>The psychic scents of the males in the room stank of fear.</p><p>Jared frowned and wished his thoughts weren\u2019t so fuzzy. Ring him?</p><p>He slowly realized it wasn\u2019t a heavy coin on the table, but the Ring of Obedience. The one he\u2019d worn for the past nine years.</p><p>Before he could even try to shake off the emotional lethargy and physical weakness, to comprehend what it meant, Grizelle\u2019s fingers closed around him again and squeezed lightly. He gasped as pain shivered along his nerves.</p><p>Light flashed from her fingers, blinding him. A clap of thunder shook the building. The unmistakable feel of power filled the room.</p><p>Grizelle stepped back and calmly stared at the nervous guards, the shocked escort, and the sweating, hand-wringing steward. \u201cYou have nothing to fear,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wears my Ring now.\u201d</p><p>The steward pointed a shaking finger at Jared\u2019s groin. \u201cB-but, Lady, there\u2019s no Ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Grizelle said. There were so many nuances in that small sound, so much ice in the calm smile. \u201cBut there is. He wears the Invisible Ring.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s heart began to pound. The Invisible Ring?</p><p>The ghost of a memory drifted just out of reach.</p><p>The steward chewed his lip. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a Ring.\u201d</p><p>Jared had. But how? Where?</p><p>\u201cThe witches in my family have been using it for generations,\u201d Grizelle said. She gestured toward the Ring of Obedience lying on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s ten times more powerful than that little toy.\u201d Then she paused. \u201cWould you like a further demonstration?\u201d</p><p>The men hastily assured her there was no need.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Ten times more powerful. Ten times more painful. How was he supposed to survive that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>No one survived being owned by Grizelle. And now he knew why.</p><p>He let his mind drift again, no longer interested in what was happening in the room. More senseless smears of words. Female anger boiling up like a violent storm on the horizon. Whimpers. Hands untying him, walking him to the final room. He stood where he was placed, passive.</p> <p>Ten times more powerful, and he couldn\u2019t even feel it. Maybe he was numbed by too much pain. Maybe it was too subtle to feel after so much agony.</p><p>If only he could remember what he\u2019d heard about how it worked, or why it was different from the Ring of Obedience.</p><p>Then again, maybe he should be grateful that he didn\u2019t remember.</p><p>The door opened behind him and the escort, who had stayed in the room to keep an eye on him, snapped to attention. \u201cLady?\u201d</p><p>Damn. Something had happened while his mind had drifted. The escort\u2019s voice held cautious fear, a familiar tone that meant a dark-Jeweled witch\u2019s temper was one careless word away from exploding.</p> <p>\u201cThe clothing you requested will be here any moment,\u201d the escort said. Jared heard the man swallow. \u201cIs there something else, Lady?\u201d</p><p>It took all of Jared\u2019s self-control not to turn around to see what she was doing. It took all of his concentration to identify the quiet sound of a lid being unscrewed from a jar.</p><p>\u201cI want to look at those wounds,\u201d the Gray Lady said. \u201cThey need to be properly cleaned and this healing salve applied. I\u2019ve plans for this one. I don\u2019t want him dying before I get any use out of him.\u201d</p><p>Her voice made Jared\u2019s skin crawl. Her psychic scent unnerved him. Even without the wild stranger\u2019s presence, it produced a kind of lust in him that went beyond the body\u2019s desires, the kind of lust a dark-Jeweled male felt in the presence of a dark-Jeweled witch. It made him crave her touch, made him want her hands on him.</p><p>He hated her for that most of all.</p><p>The escort hesitated, then said, \u201cI can take care of it, Lady.\u201d</p> <p>Relief flooded Jared when Grizelle left the small room. It would be better to feel another man\u2019s rough hands than have those gentle fingers touch him again.</p><p>When the guards delivered the clothes and the healing supplies a few minutes later, Jared\u2019s world narrowed to a fierce craving for water. He thought of asking the escort if he could drink from the basin\u2014he would have drunk anything at that moment, no matter what had been added to the water to clean the wounds\u2014but the man\u2019s angry growl killed the words before they could form. As he suffered the sting of warm water and cleansing herbs while the escort washed his back and belly, he wondered if Grizelle had known what kind of torment this would be or if she simply didn\u2019t care how long he\u2019d been without water.</p><p>Jared endured the cleaning in silence, but he gasped when the escort smeared the healing salve into the lash wounds on his back. It felt icy after the warm water. It also quickly numbed his skin.</p><p>Released from a little more pain, he started remembering the advice Daemon Sadi had given him the year they had spent together.</p><p>Daemon had called it balls and sass. If a male went into a court cringing, for whatever reason, and regained a little strength or showed a little temper, it would be regarded as defiance by the Queen and the witches in herFirst Circle, and as a challenge by all the other males who feared losing their place in the court\u2019s pecking order. However, if a male went in with balls and sass, forcing the Queen and the other witches to remember that the danger of a dark Jewel couldn\u2019t be dismissed just because a man wore a Ring and was called a slave, he was treated more cautiously, faced fewer challengers among the males, and was thought of as a chained predator instead of as prey. In some courts, it meant the difference between surviving or not.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Jared croaked when the escort started smearing salve on the belly wounds. He wasn\u2019t sure about that, wasn\u2019t even sure he could stand up much longer since he was quickly reaching his threshold of physical endurance. Balls and sass were a fragile shield, but, right now, they were all he had. \u201cI can do that,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d the escort snarled as he hurriedly applied the salve.</p><p>Jared studied the grim face, the shadows in the eyes that avoided his. The escort was a Warlord who wore the Purple Dusk Jewel. How did he survive looking at the bruised, naked bodies of his Brothers? How did he survive looking at the ones who had been maimed or broken or shaved? Did he go home to a lover or a wife he felt some affection for? Did he have children he cuddled and played with and loved? Or had he picked up a witch at the auction one year, one already broken and barren, whom he mounted without considering her feelings or well-being? What did he think of the males bought and sold here? Had he ever looked up one day and seen a man he\u2019d called a friend standing on the auction block?</p> <p>Ah, the shadows in the eyes. The worry behind having to escort someone like the Gray Lady around the slave fair.Look well , Jared thought as the man finished applying the salve and stepped away.Look at the price you may have to pay for one error in judgment .</p><p>As if the thoughts had been sent on a psychic spear thread, the escort looked Jared in the eyes. Seconds passed in strained silence. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a pretty mouth, a dangle for the Ladies to play with,\u201d the escort snarled.</p><p>Jared smiled savagely. \u201cI\u2019m a Red-Jeweled Shalador Warlord. I\u2019m stronger than you\u2019ll ever be, can unleash power you can only dream of. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>The escort\u2019s jaw tightened. His breathing became harsh. \u201cGet dressed. Your dangle\u2019s for private viewing now.\u201d</p><p>The clothes had been dropped on a rough bench next to the small table that held the basin. Jared forced himself to look away from the basin full of dirty water, but not soon enough.</p><p>With a fiercely pleased look in his eyes, the escort used Craft to vanish the basin. \u201cYou may wear the Red, but you\u2019re still a slave, you\u2019re still Ringed. I might not know the power you wielded when it was yours to command, but I\u2019ll walk out of here a free man, have a cold dipper of water whenever I want it, have a tankard of ale once I\u2019ve seen the Gray Lady safely onto a Coach, and tonight I\u2019ll mount a woman like a man\u2019s entitled to. And you? You would have gotten down on your belly and licked the bottom of my boots for a sip of fouled water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Jared said. \u201cBut you, free? For now, maybe. The only difference between service and slavery is a circle of gold. If the Red can be chained, how long will the Purple Dusk stay free? If the right amount of gold marks changed hands tomorrow, how long do you think it would take to turn the handsome escort into a handsome slave?\u201d</p><p>The escort\u2019s face flushed a dull, angry red. He raised a fist.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t move. He just glanced at the door leading into the hallway and smiled knowingly. He watched the escort fight to hide the clashing emotions, saw the moment the man realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to justify the \u201cdiscipline.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his fist, the escort spat out words like they were gristle. \u201cIn five minutes, I\u2019m chaining you and taking you out of here.\u201d He flung open the hallway door but stopped in the doorway and stared at Jared with burning eyes. \u201cI hope she cuts you apart a piece at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine she will,\u201d Jared said, after the escort slammed out of the room. By force of will, he managed the couple of steps needed to reach the rough bench. Spreading the shirt, he sat on it carefully, grateful his shaking legs didn\u2019t have to support him for a minute.</p><p>Jared, if you\u2019re going skin-swimming at the pond, remember to spread the towel on the log before you sit on it or you\u2019ll have splinters where you least want them.</p><p>Where\u2019s that, Mother?</p><p>Ask your father.</p><p>So he had. Belarr had studied his son for a minute, muttering something about why couldn\u2019t they have had one girl so he could return the favor. Then Belarr had sighed and explained what he thought Reyna meant. That\u2019s the way Belarr always phrased it:I think what your mother means is . . . As if, despite being a strong Warlord, he felt the need to hedge when it came to explaining a woman\u2019s words, especially the words of the woman he\u2019d married.</p><p>Sighing wearily, aching in ways that hurt deeper than physical wounds ever could, Jared pulled on the coarsely woven trousers and slipped his feet into the poorly made leather sandals. He picked up the scratchy shirt but couldn\u2019t bring himself to pull it over his head. Taking a careful breath, he turned toward the full-length mirror attached to the room\u2019s back wall. In the building where pleasure slaves changed hands, the entire back wall was a mirror. He understood the reason for that. He didn\u2019t want to think about why they\u2019d put a mirror here, where it didn\u2019t matter if a slave looked well-groomed when he emerged.</p><p>His fingers shook as he lightly brushed the buttons on the trousers\u2019 fly. Psychic sense, physical sense ... he just couldn\u2019t feel the Invisible Ring. There was no way to tell how fine-tuned it might be, no way to know where the shifting boundary was between what was permissible basic Craft and what would bring agonizing punishment.</p><p>\u201cBalls and sass,\u201d Jared muttered. Hard to judge the risks when there were no reference points. But he just couldn\u2019t pull that shirt over his head without doing something to protect the wounds. He\u2019d listened to men scream when a shirt that had stuck to lash wounds was pulled off their backs, tearing off the fresh scabs with it. He\u2019d seen what those men had looked like when the wounds finally healed.</p><p>Basic healing Craft. A thimbleful of power. That\u2019s all he needed to create a tight protective shield around his back and belly that would keep the shirt away from his skin.</p><p>Taking another careful breath, Jared created the shield and waited.</p><p>Nothing. No surge from the Ring, no angry footsteps in the hall.</p><p>Swallowing hard to push his heart back down his throat, Jared pulled on the shirt and studied the man in the mirror.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dressed for an aristo outing, but even so he was a good-looking man, tall and well built, with that golden Shalador skin\u2014not brown like the long-lived Hayllians or fair like other races, but sun-kissed, gold-dusted. A pleasing shade when combined with the dark-brown hair and brown eyes of the Shalador people. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except his eyes were the rare Shalador green\u2014eyes that could be traced back through the bloodlines to Shal, the great Queen who had united the tribes into one people.</p><p>Reyna\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He was the only one of the three boys who had her eyes.</p> <p>He had been willing to destroy himself, but now that he was still alive, he wanted to survive. Sweet Darkness, hehad to find some way to survive long enough to get home, long enough to talk to Reyna and take those words back.</p><p>Balls and sass. It was the only weapon he could safely use. He was wringing himself dry, squeezing what was left of his physical endurance, but he had to last until they reached the slave compartment in the Coach, had to make Grizelle believe he was still a male to be reckoned with. For a little while longer, he had to hide the fact that he was nothing more than a hollow man.</p><p>Raising his trembling hands, Jared ran his fingers through his hair. It was a bit shaggy now, but with a little Craft, shaggy could be altered to bedroom disheveled. The Gray Lady was an old woman, but he was a bed-trained slave who had a few sweets he could offer that might entice her, might distract her, might help tip the scales to his advantage while he tried to figure out how much control this damned Invisible Ring had over him.</p><p>His stomach churned at the idea of encouraging the Gray Lady to enjoy him. But if it made her lower her guard, it might be possible to slip away and ride the Winds to Shalador.</p><p>Without warning, the escort opened the door and stopped short, unable to hide his surprise at the transformation of the naked slave he\u2019d left into the Warlord who turned away from the mirror and smiled at him.</p> <p>Pleased that he\u2019d managed to unsettle the man, Jared walked toward him and held out his hands as if bestowing a favor. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to chain me, get on with it. The Gray Lady\u2019s waiting to dance.\u201d He hoped the escort would mistake the exhaustion in his voice for boredom.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t specify chains,\u201d the man said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think she would. She strikes me as a discreet Lady, and chains tend to call attention to themselves, especially when the sound they\u2019re making becomes rhythmic. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>The escort\u2019s lip curled in a sneer. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn chains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t implying thatyou had worn them.\u201d Jared waited for the insult to sink in and then shrugged. \u201cOr that you needed them. I just thought that since you earned a living restraining people, you might know a few interesting positions that aren\u2019t considered common in the courts. But perhaps not. Things like that are a bit like mounting a woman dog-style. It isn\u2019t to every man\u2019s taste.\u201d</p><p>Fury blazed in the escort\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know what I can do to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Jared bared his teeth and added softly, \u201cCome on. Try it. Let\u2019s see if this Ring really can hold the Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Grizelle\u2019s voice settled over both men like a cold rain.</p><p>The escort reluctantly stepped into the hallway. \u201cNo, Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the delay?\u201d</p><p>Jared gave the escort a smug smile, knowing it would infuriate the man because there wasn\u2019t any way he could respond to it.</p><p>Time to play the last act.</p><p>Mother Night, don\u2019t let my body fail yet.</p><p>Jared stepped forward, forcing the escort out of the way. He bowed to Grizelle, making sure the bow was exactly what Protocol dictated as proper for a Red-Jeweled Warlord to make to a Gray-Jeweled Queen.</p> <p>If the Warlord wasn\u2019t a slave, that is.</p><p>The escort growled in anger.</p><p>Grizelle stared at him, but Jared thought he caught a flicker of amusement in the hard gray eyes.</p><p>So she liked balls and sass. Thank the Darkness.</p><p>Draining the little psychic strength he could summon in order to project the feel of a sensual man eager to please, Jared offered his right hand, palm down.</p><p>Grizelle hesitated a moment before lightly placing her left hand over his and allowing him to escort her out of the building.</p><p>Jared bit back a grin. The escort was now trailing behind them like a resentful, forgotten puppy.</p><p>It was full dark by the time they hired a pony cart and headed out of the auction grounds. Instead of going directly to the official landing place, they took a side road that circled around the low, flat-topped hill until they reached the ticket station, and the Coaches and drivers that could ride the Winds.</p><p>\u201cWait with the others,\u201d Grizelle said, as Jared helped her from the cart. She didn\u2019t bother to look at either of them as she walked toward the ticket station.</p><p>Jared held on to the cart, hoping the escort didn\u2019t notice how much he needed to lean on that support to stay on his feet. He wasn\u2019t sure his legs would get him to the Coach before they buckled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the others are,\u201d he finally pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d the escort growled.</p><p>As they walked toward the man\u2019s partner, who had been guarding the other slaves, Jared glanced over his shoulder and saw a messenger boy hand a slip of paper to Grizelle just before she reached the ticket station. The boy ran off immediately, not even waiting for the usual coin.</p><p>Feeling a warning prickle between his shoulder blades, Jared stopped and watched her read the message.</p><p>So still. So silent. So gray. Nothing about her seemed different, so he didn\u2019t understand why he instinctively opened his first inner barrier and sent out a delicate Red psychic tendril. Even if her inner barriers hadn\u2019t been stronger than his, the tendril was too delicate to probe even surface thoughts, which meant there was less chance of it being noticed. But it would be able take a sip of her emotions and give him some warning about her temper.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for the blast of fear that raced back through the tendril and crashed into him.</p><p>Something had happened. Something had changed.</p><p>The fear hadn\u2019t been there during the ride here. He was sure of that. Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d touched her, sat beside her. Even she couldn\u2019t have hidden feelings that strong while there had been physical contact between them.</p><p>The message, then. The mes . . .</p><p>As he watched Grizelle tuck her hands into the sleeves of her robe and walk into the ticket station, his waning endurance finally gave out. The world became fuzzy and slow.</p><p>So hard to walk, despite the hand on his arm leading him. Words began smearing again, mashing together and stretching out until they became a language of nightmarish shapes. Bodies appeared in front of him, out of nowhere. Someone tugged on his arm. He stopped walking. The smells of blood-bright fear and sickly brown sweat oozed around the word shapes.</p><p>Water.</p><p>Why did that have to be the one word that still made sense?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be taking . . . west-going Coaches?\u201d</p><p>He thought that was one of the guards speaking, but couldn\u2019t be sure since the voice kept fading in and out.</p><p>\u201cBound to ... Territory\u2019s west . . .TamanaraMountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what . . . figured . . . brought the rest . . . here.\u201d</p><p>Except they were walking again, endlessly walking, while the escorts swore under their breath and their blade-sharp anger cut into him.</p><p>Where were his inner barriers? Where . . .</p><p>Someone pulled at his arms.</p><p>\u201cSsiiitt.\u201d</p><p>His legs folded under him.</p><p>A gray voice. The word \u201cwater.\u201d</p><p>A cup at his mouth. Water trickling past his lips. He held it for a moment, savoring the wetness, before he swallowed. Then he tried to grab the cup and gulp, but hands pulled it away from him.</p><p>\u201cSslloowlly.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed. It was so important to obey, so important that this female voice that wasn\u2019t gray didn\u2019t take away the water.</p><p>Finally enough.</p><p>Ballsansass. That was important, too, although he couldn\u2019t remember why.</p><p>He slid sideways. The water had melted his bones. He hadn\u2019t known water could do that. Whiskey could, if you drank enough of it, but water? Who would have guessed?</p><p>Then he was melting and sliding, melting and sliding, sliding, sliding away into the safety of the night, into the sweet Darkness.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cShe took the bait,\u201d theFifth Circleguard reported with barely restrained eagerness.</p><p>Krelis leaned back in his chair, dropping his hands below the desk to hide the trembling he couldn\u2019t control. Dorothea\u2019s compulsion spell must have worked, which made him feel easier about the other spells she\u2019d woven for him\u2014not that he doubted the High Priestess\u2019s ability.</p><p>\u201cWhile she was in Raej, did the bitch buy anyone who might be of value to us?\u201d Krelis asked, watching the young man who reminded him of himself not that many centuries ago.</p><p>The blank look on the guard\u2019s face only lasted a moment. Then he stiffened and focused his eyes on the back wall of the Master\u2019s office. \u201cMy apologies, Lord Krelis. I didn\u2019t think to obtain a list of the slaves she bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor did Lord Maryk think to include it in your instructions,\u201d\u2018 Krelis said smoothly.</p><p>The guard squirmed a little, recognizing the trap within the words.</p><p>Krelis understood being torn between loyalty and survival. As a boy, he had loved Olvan, who had been a gentle but firm parent as well as a respected teacher and scholar. As a youth, he\u2019d felt desperate to get away from the taint surrounding the frightened, withered man his father had become after that day at the tree. No one had needed to tell him that the longer a connection remained between father and son, the more distrustful the influentialQueenswould be when the time came to serve in their courts.</p><p>Forced to choose between loyalty and survival, he had chosen survival. Loyalty, he discovered, could be bought easily enough.</p><p>So he waited to see which the guard would choose\u2014 loyalty to Maryk, who was not only an aristo but an experienced second-in-command, or survival by giving full allegiance to the new Master of the Guard.</p><p>Finally, the guard said in a low voice, \u201cNo, sir, Lord Maryk did not include obtaining the list in his instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter,\u201d Krelis said with a dismissive gesture. \u201cLord Maryk had more pressing duties to consider.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, sir.

We\u2019ll keep any that may be of interest to the High Priestess and send the others back to Raej to sell on the last auction day.\u201d</p><p>The guard saluted smartly and left.</p> <p>Krelis rubbed his hands over his face. Maryk should be back by nightfall, the task completed. Then, perhaps, he could get some sleep.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>His stomach growled and threatened to chew his backbone.</p><p>Jared ignored it.</p><p>His muscles ached and begged to be stretched.</p> <p>He ignored them, too.</p><p>The fierce need to piss had him swinging his legs over the side of the narrow bed. He pushed himself into a sitting position and fuzzily tried to remember what came next.</p><p>Rubbing sleep-crusted eyes, Jared looked blearily at the dark-eyed, dark-haired boy sitting cross-legged beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cDavin?\u201d Jared said hoarsely, knowing itcouldn\u2019t be even before the boy\u2019s expression turned wary. His youngest brother would be nineteen now, not the ten-year-old he\u2019d cheerfully said good-bye to before he\u2019d torn his life apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tomas,\u201d the boy said. \u201cThere\u2019s no Davin here.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness for that.</p> <p>There was something peculiar and faint about the boy\u2019s psychic scent, but Jared was too preoccupied to figure it out. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the guest servants\u2019 quarters.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head and tried again. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what Territory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the damn chamber pot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tomas pointed at a door in the wall. \u201cOver there.\u201d</p><p>Despite the urgency, Jared hesitated, finally awake enough to realize he was naked and only had a wadded sheet covering his groin.</p><p>Tomas grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re all outside, and Ladies don\u2019t care if you show your dangle to other males.\u201d He scratched his head. \u201cOther males don\u2019t care either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes they do,\u201d Jared muttered, remembering confrontations between pleasure slaves that had turned bloody because desperation had pushed someone over the edge. \u201cSometimes they care very much.\u201d</p><p>Tomas\u2019s grin faded. His face paled. He scrambled to his feet and bolted for the door. The jerky movement and the fear that now filled his dark eyes told Jared more than the fading bruises on the boy\u2019s bare arms, more than the old scars on the stick-thin legs that poked out of a pair of ragged short pants. And he realized what the boy\u2019s diminished psychic scent meant. Tomas was a half-Blood.</p><p>Having too much psychic strength to be landen but not enough to be Blood, half-Bloods were outcast bastards, wanted by neither society. If the Blood sire thought the unclaimed offspring showed potential, the child might be taken in and raised as a servant, maybe even trained to become an overseer for a landen village. Most of the time, half-Bloods became the slaves that looked after, and were used by, Blood slaves.</p><p>And sometimes there was no one cruder than someone who was, himself, enduring cruelty.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Jared followed Tomas.</p><p>The bathroom had two toilets, three sinks, and two bathtubs. There were no partitions to give anyone the illusion of privacy, but at least the toilets were better than stinking privy holes.</p><p>Sighing with relief, Jared took care of business and tried to ignore the boy standing next to him. Tomas might have learned fear in the slave quarters, but the boy was just too brash to have learned caution.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t wearing a Ring,\u201d Tomas said in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s invisible,\u201d Jared replied curtly, hoping that would end it.</p><p>\u201cYou sight shield a Ring so people don\u2019t know you\u2019re a slave, you\u2019ll get your back whipped off for good.\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth at the honest concern in the boy\u2019s voice and pulled the chain to flush the toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s not sight shielded, it\u2019s invisible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I cansee that.\u201d</p><p>How could he explain something he didn\u2019t understand himself? \u201cIt\u2019s an Invisible Ring. It\u2019s like the Ring of Obedience, but stronger.\u201d</p><p>Tomas\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou have to wear somethingstronger than a Ring of Obedience? You that dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs dangerous as the Sadist?\u201d</p><p>Jared started to say something reassuring, but there was no fear in the boy\u2019s face, just a held-breath excitement. Aristos had good reason to fear Daemon Sadi, but not young half-Blood boys. So he said solemnly, \u201cHe taught me everything I know.\u201d</p><p>Tomas looked at him for a long minute, his mouth silently forming the word, \u201coh,\u201d and Jared realized he couldn\u2019t have presented better credentials to reassure the boy he was a \u201csafe\u201d male.</p><p>That grin that seemed to be Tomas\u2019s natural expression flashed again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be wanting a bath. We\u2019ve got hot water and everything.\u201d</p><p>As Jared watched the boy dart around the room preparing a bath for him, the full import of their surroundings finally hit him. He wandered over to the tub that was already half-full of steaming water. \u201cWhy are we in the guest servants\u2019 quarters?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Cause the Lady took one look at the slave quarters and threw a polite icy fit.\u201d</p><p>Jared scratched the back of his head. Hell\u2019s fire, he was looking forward to getting clean. \u201cHow does one throw a polite icy fit?\u201d</p><p>Tomas tugged on his earlobe and scrunched up his face. \u201cWell, like the Lady did, I guess.\u201d</p><p>That told him a lot.</p><p>Tomas turned off the water. \u201cIn you go,\u201d he said, waving the wash sponge at Jared.</p><p>\u201cYes, Tomas,\u201d Jared said meekly.</p><p>Tomas hesitated, as if wanting to be sure that the adult male he was ordering around really was teasing him. Then he grinned and dropped the wash sponge into the water.</p><p>Jared settled into the tub, closed his eyes, and groaned in pleasure. After soaking for a couple of minutes, he opened one eye and looked at the boy kneeling beside the tub. \u201cSo what did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the innkeeper was pleased enough at first to have a Queen staying at his place, even if itwas the Gray Lady. He told her his servants would get her slaves settled into quarters, but she insisted on seeing them before she\u2019d go to her own room. So he showed her the slave quarters and she said, no, they wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they that bad?\u201d Jared asked. Pleasure slaves were usually quartered together in a comfortable \u201cstable\u201d or in tiny rooms adjoining the main bedchambers so they\u2019d be close by to indulge their Ladies\u2019 whims. Since they were also kept fairly isolated from everyone except the court and each other, he really didn\u2019t know what was considered normal slave quarters.</p><p>Tomas shrugged. \u201cLooked like any other as far as I could tell, although the privy holes did stink something fierce. But the Lady said she wasn\u2019t going to have half of us coming down sick with a chill or worse by trying to sleep with no blankets and nothing but bars and broken shutters over the windows. Now, anybody could have told her you don\u2019t seal up slave quarters tight \u2018cause breathing the stink would make us sicker than fresh cold air, but the innkeeper just eyed Thera and Polli and told the Lady if she just eased the Rings a bit, the males would keep the females warm enough, and with their blood heated like that, they wouldn\u2019t even notice the cold.</p><p>\u201cWell, the Lady just looked at the innkeeper until he started to sweat, and she said, mild as if she was asking for a cup of tea, \u2018Have you ever seen what happens to a man\u2019s balls when you freeze them so deep they\u2019ll shatter if you flick a finger against them?\u2019 You could tell he thought she was bluffing, but he was sweating, too. Then one drop of sweat rolled off his chin. It froze before it hit the ground and bounced up like a little hailstone. And she just kept looking at him. I thought he was going to mess his pants.\u201d</p><p>Having experienced that hard gray stare, Jared understood the man\u2019s discomfort all too well.</p><p>\u201cSo right away he offered these quarters,\u201d Tomas continued, handing Jared the soap. \u201cThera and Polli made up a bed for you, and Randolf and Brock carried you in. The Lady fussed over you for a bit and kept muttering to herself about whether the damage was permanent. After she approved the food the servants brought, she went back to the inn.\u201d</p><p>The Lady fussed over you. Jared soaped the sponge and started washing. In a way, it made sense. Badly scarred pleasure slaves weren\u2019t as valuable\u2014except to witches who were aroused by the evidence of pain inflicted\u2014and a healing man didn\u2019t perform at his best. But something in Tomas\u2019s voice told him that, even without knowing about the Invisible Ring, the others had realized that the Lady considered him different from the rest of them, and they weren\u2019t sure what to think about it ... or about him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to think about it either.</p><p>\u201cCourse, Blaed\u2019s going to be relieved to find out you\u2019re a pleasure slave,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cThe way Thera tore into him, I don\u2019t think he wants to stiffen anytime soon, and he\u2019s been worried that the Lady would want to be pleasured and he hasn\u2019t had much training. Not like you, being trained by the Sadist and all.\u201d</p><p>Jared bit his tongue and concentrated on washing his legs.</p><p>Tomas frowned. \u201cCourse, you don\u2019t need a stiff dangle, do you? They say the Sadist never gets stiff, and he\u2019s the best there is.\u201d</p><p>At a lot of things that were better left unmentioned.</p><p>Jared resoaped the sponge and started scrubbing his arms and chest. He didn\u2019t want to talk about Sadi, and he didn\u2019t want to think about pleasuring the Gray Lady. \u201cWhy did Thera tear into Blaed?\u201d</p><p>Tomas shook his head. His voice filled with cautious admiration. \u201cThat Thera. When she gets pissy, she gets a look in her eyes that can singe your ball hairs.\u201d</p><p>The sponge stuttered to a halt. \u201cThat\u2019s a colorful way of putting it,\u201d Jared finally choked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tomas tugged on the sponge. \u201cI\u2019ll wash your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He didn\u2019t need this boy to act as his slave, and knowing too well how it felt to be at the mercy of someone\u2019s whims, he didn\u2019t want anyone else feeling like that because of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Tomas said quietly.</p><p>Thrown off stride by the boy\u2019s sympathy, Jared released the sponge. He\u2019d forgotten about the lash wounds. Feeling no pain as Tomas washed his back, his hands gently explored his belly where the whips had cut him. It felt tender, but that was all.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what the Lady did, but you\u2019ve healed up just fine,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scar.\u201d</p><p>Tomas\u2019s cheerful efficiency made his heart ache. Too knowing for someone so young, here was this boy reassuring a grown man that he hadn\u2019t scarred when his own small body looked like a battlefield.</p><p>Tomas deserved better than to be condemned to a life like this. Then again, they all deserved better.</p><p>Needing a distraction, Jared said, \u201cTell me about Thera and Blaed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, none of the beds were made up, though there were clean sheets and blankets folded up on the mattresses. Thera started right in \u2018cause Cathryn\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCathryn? I thought the other one\u2019s name is Polli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lady bought three females,\u201d Tomas explained patiently. \u201cThera, Polli, and Cathryn. Thera\u2019s a broken Black Widow. Breaking her might have taken her Jewels, but it sure didn\u2019t dull her temper. Polli\u2019s a broken witch. I think it made her soft-headed and skittish. Cathryn\u2019s just a Blood female, too young for breeding yet.\u201d</p><p>Jared ground his teeth. Just the thought of a Blood female being used as an aristo broodmare as soon as she became old enough to bear healthy offspring made him sick. Oh, they weren\u2019t broken like more and more strong witches were, but that was because they didn\u2019t have the inner power for more than basic Craft to begin with, and only unbroken females could produce more than one offspring. \u201cHow old is Cathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s little. Nine maybe. You want to hear about Blaed or not?\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed between his teeth. \u201cI want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Thera started making up beds. Polli was making up a bed, too, but she was moving slow, like something was paining her. Then Blaed walked over to Polli and said something to her, and the next thing you know, she had her back to the wall and she was screaming that she didn\u2019t have to spread her legs, it was her moontime, and she didn\u2019t have to spread her legs during her moontime.</p> <p>\u201cBefore Blaed could say anything, Thera grabbed an apple from the bowl the servants had brought and threw it at him. Blaed\u2019s got good reflexes. He couldn\u2019t dodge it, but he managed to take it on the hip instead of in the balls.</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s Polli having hysterics, and Cathryn\u2019s crying \u2018cause she\u2019s scared, and Thera\u2019s screaming at Blaed, and Blaed\u2019s rushing toward Thera while she\u2019s reaching back for another apple, and Randolf and Brock are trying to jump in before it gets really nasty. And then the outside door burst open and the Gray Lady was standing there.</p><p>\u201cThe males all stopped cold, and I hushed Cathryn, but Polli was still wailing about her moontime\u2014Hell\u2019s fire, evenI could tell that whatever was paining her, it wasn\u2019t that\u2014 and Thera was still screaming about heartless pricks who couldn\u2019t keep their pants buttoned and holding that apple so hard she was squishing it to pulp.\u201d</p><p>Tomas jumped up. \u201cYou soap up your hair. I\u2019ll get a bucket of clean water to rinse with.\u201d</p><p>Jared soaped his hair, muttering all the while about the dire things that could happen to boys who got too bossy. The only response he got was a bucket of water poured over his head before he was ready.</p><p>Sputtering, he climbed out of the tub and grabbed a towel from Tomas. \u201cIf you don\u2019t finish the story, I\u2019ll throttle you.\u201d</p><p>Now certain that he could ignore remarks like that, Tomas just grinned, grabbed another towel, and gently patted Jared\u2019s back dry. \u201cTurns out Blaed was just trying to be helpful. He noticed how Polli was moving and thought she shouldn\u2019t be lifting the mattress to tuck in the sheet.</p><p>After he explained that to the Lady, looking so scared I thought he was going to faint, she fixed a brew to settle down Polli. Then she looked straight at Thera, and said, \u2018Courtesy should be rewarded, not punished.\u2019 And then she looked at Blaed, and said, \u2018Remember that not all scars are visible.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAfter she left, we all ate and took baths. None of the males wanted to get near Polli, in case she had another fit. Didn\u2019t want to get too close to Thera, either. So all the females and you and me stayed on one side of the room and the rest of the males stayed on the other side.\u201d Tomas looked at Jared and shook his head. \u201cAnd you slept through the whole thing. Matter of fact, you slept through all of yesterday, too. Come on, they left some food for you.\u201d</p><p>Disturbed, Jared silently followed Tomas back into the main room. Had the Gray Lady been talking about the lash wounds when she\u2019d wondered about permanent damage? Or had she sensed the hollowness inside him? Now that he was no longer in pain or exhausted, he keenly felt the loss of whatever it was the wild stranger had taken with it. He knew, with absolute certainty, that he had no chance of getting free of the Invisible Ring without it.</p><p>\u201cYou still feeling bad?\u201d Tomas asked.</p><p>Jared shook his head and sat down at the table that had one covered plate, a plate of toast, a cup, and a small pot of coffee.</p><p>Who had put a warming spell on the covered plate and pot of coffee? Polli, who sounded like she\u2019d had her spirit as well as her inner web broken? The sharp-tempered Thera? Either of them would still have enough strength to do something as basic as this.</p><p>But when he touched the plate, he knew it had been neither one of them. Running his finger around the plate\u2019s rim, he found the spot where her finger had touched it, felt the ghost of the spark of power she\u2019d used for the warming spell.</p><p>That she had done it at all spoke of concern and caring.</p><p>It made no sense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best eat,\u201d Tomas said, pouring the coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving here soon.\u201d</p><p>Jared picked up the fork and began to eat, reminding himself with each bite to eat slowly. He couldn\u2019t afford to have his stomach reject the meal in front of him just because he\u2019d gulped it down, especially when he didn\u2019t know when he might get the next one.</p><p>While he ate, Tomas told him about the other slaves. Besides Thera, Polli, and little Cathryn, there were nine males, including Tomas and himself: Blaed, the pleasure slave; Thayne; Brock and Randolf, two former guards; a mind-broken male named Garth; and Eryk and Corry, two boys about Tomas\u2019s age.</p><p>Half-listening to Tomas\u2019s chatter, Jared reached for another slice of thick, buttered toast. What had the Gray Lady been thinking of to buy these particular slaves? He could understand buying the four healthy adult males, but what use could she have for a mind-broken male? Or broken witches who had probably been put on the block because they\u2019d become emotionally unstable or were now barren and had no ability to produce an offspring? Or four children?</p><p>Or a Warlord who had killed the last Queen who had owned him?</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t listening,\u201d Tomas said accusingly.</p><p>Remembering his younger brothers, Jared knew better than to bluff. So he waved his fork over the plate and changed the subject altogether. He hoped. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Tomas sulked for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cPotatoes and eggs and pieces of beef. The Lady had bought a big skillet with the rest of the supplies, and this morning she taught Thera, Polli, and Cathryn how to make it.\u201d</p><p>The toasted bread caught in Jared\u2019s throat. He swallowed some coffee to force it down. \u201cThe Gray Lady wascooking ?\u201d</p><p>Tomas grinned. \u201cI thought the innkeeper was going to die of shame, with her out there cooking in a skillet over an open fire as if what he served in the inn wasn\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s why we all got coffee and buttered toast this morning. The Lady told him she wanted the females to learn how to make this while she could still have his cook prepareher meal, but it would be best to give us the coffee and bread, too, so we\u2019d have something decent under our belts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is good,\u201d Jared said, scooping up another forkful.</p><p>Tomas\u2019s dark eyes sparkled. \u201cProbably better than the Lady got.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cWhy the supplies? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>Tomas rolled his eyes. \u201cI was just telling you about her buying an old pedlar\u2019s wagon and horses \u2018cause we\u2019re going cross-country to her Territory, and we can\u2019t depend on finding an inn when we need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not go to the nearest village that has a Coach station and buy passage?\u201d Jared said, still frowning. \u201cWhy take the chance of tangling with marauders or a pack of rogues by going cross-country?\u201d</p><p>Tomas jerked as if he\u2019d been hit. He wouldn\u2019t look at Jared.</p><p>Jared choked down the last mouthful. Was that why slaves who went into Grizelle\u2019s Territory never returned? Because they never got to the Territory in the first place? Marauders and rogue packs were always male, but they might have guarded home camps where they could keep women. They\u2019d have no use for male slaves, but what about a broken witch who could cook a decent meal over an open fire? Or a broken witch who could be given an aphrodisiac that would make her so mad with need she could be mounted all night and not care what they did to her until the drug finally wore off? Or a young Blood female that could become a breeder for the dominant male of the group? What about an intelligent young half-Blood who tried so hard to please?</p><p>Did Grizelle come to the auctions to act as a slave trader for the marauders and rogue packs who hid in the Tamanara Mountains and wouldn\u2019t dare approach Raej because they\u2019d probably end up on the auction block themselves?</p><p>Jared\u2019s stomach churned. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and willed himself to stay calm. What could he do? Challenge a Gray-Jeweled Queen? If she unleashed the Gray, she\u2019d destroy him completely. Which might be preferable to finding out what would happen if she used the Invisible Ring. He understood the Jewels, but this thing he couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t touch, couldn\u2019t sense in any way . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The outside door opened, and a female voice said, \u201cGood, you\u2019re awake. At least we won\u2019t have to drag you to the wagon and dump you on top of the supplies.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaped up, knocking over the chair, his heart hammering in his chest.It isn\u2018t her , he thought as he looked at the startled dark-haired, green-eyed woman standing in the doorway.It isn\u2019t her .</p><p>\u201cMaybe we would have been better off if wehad had to dump you on top of the supplies,\u201d she muttered after a moment\u2019s silence. Then she gave him one sharp-eyed, head-to-toe look that plainly said there were already too many troublesome males around for her liking, and he was going to be another one. \u201cBetter prance on out there. She\u2019s ready to leave, and we wouldn\u2019t want the prize dangle to get dragged along like a reluctant puppy on a leash, would we?\u201d</p> <p>Anger flooded him, but it had no heat, no bite. It was like his blood was being clogged with ashes instead of flowing with fire.</p><p>And there was something very wrong with the way hewasn\u2019t responding to the presence of a witch, broken or not.</p><p>A sour taste filled the back of his mouth, and he started to shake.</p><p>The woman stepped forward, reaching out to him. \u201cAre you still sick?\u201d</p><p>Jared recoiled from her touch.</p> <p>\u201cHe was doing fine until you came in,\u201d Tomas snapped.</p><p>Her eyes frosted over until they were green ice. \u201cBe careful, little man,\u201d she said in an awful, quiet voice before she turned around and walked out.</p><p>\u201cAreyou still sick?\u201d Tomas asked, looking anxious. \u201cShould I tell the Lady you need to ride in the wagon?\u201d</p><p>Jared continued to shake. When Tomas darted for the door, he managed to grab the boy\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, forcing the word out. \u201cI\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d rather walk.\u201d He took a deep breath. Took another. \u201cThat was Thera?\u201d</p><p>Tomas sighed. \u201cThat was Thera.\u201d</p> <p>With one hand on Tomas\u2019s shoulder to steady himself, Jared left the guest servants\u2019 quarters and slowly followed the pedlar\u2019s wagon and the wary slaves who trailed behind it.</p><p>Thera had done him a favor without realizing it. At least he understood now.</p><p>He was still male. He still had the strength of the Red Jewels. He still had his skill in using Craft. What he had lost, what the wild stranger had taken away, was the fire and passion that made a Jeweled male a Warlord.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Krelis didn\u2019t stare at Dorothea SaDiablo, nor did he avert his eyes. One action would have been considered a challenge; the other, a lack of appreciation. Either error could cost a man freedom or flesh.</p><p>Instead, he looked at the disheveled young Warlord lying on the chaise lounge with Hayll\u2019s High Priestess.</p><p>Not a pleasure slave, Krelis decided as he studied the young Warlord\u2019s kiss-swollen, sulky mouth. Must be one of the toy-boys, maybe even an aristo youth from one of the Hundred Families who had been given the honor of serving in Dorothea\u2019s court. Didn\u2019t really matter, pleasure slave or toy-boy, except the toy-boys had social status so they couldn\u2019t be physically mistreated that much, and were still considered men. Pleasure slaves were considered geldings who still had their balls.</p><p>At least some of them did.</p> <p>Dorothea gave the young Warlord one more throat-swabbing kiss before leisurely rising from the chaise lounge. \u201cDid she take the bait?\u201d she asked as she buttoned her gown, her hands smoothing the material over her firm, small breasts.</p><p>Krelis took a deep breath to steady himself. \u201cYes, Priestess\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off with a sharp, restrained hand gesture.</p><p>Krelis\u2019s face tightened as the young Warlord smirked at him. He understood the youth\u2019s need to make some attempt at superiority, however temporary it might be, but a Master of the Guard was considered the dominant warrior in a court, and any undermining of his authority might lead to actions that could put his Lady at risk. The youth\u2019s Yellow Jewel was no match for his Sapphire, and the difference-in their Jewel rank was reason enough to give Dorothea\u2019s new toy a disciplinary lesson. As for the difference in their social rank ... If the young Warlordwas an aristo from one of the Hundred Families and not from an offshoot, Krelis could become embroiled in the kind of quarrel that might lead to his dismissal\u2014or worse.</p><p>He should have known Dorothea wouldn\u2019t miss, or ignore, silent challenges between two males who served her.</p><p>Looking over her shoulder, Dorothea gave the youth a malevolent smile, and purred, \u201cI won\u2019t be long, darling. Why don\u2019t you amuse yourself? I want you hot when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Krelis felt no pleasure at seeing the distress in the youth\u2019s eyes. They both knew Dorothea\u2019s saying that in front of another man was punishment, and more humiliating than any physical discipline Krelis might have inflicted. They both knew a warrior was more valuable to the court than a handsome youth who could be replaced so easily. And they both knew what could happen if the toy-boy wasn\u2019t ready to please Dorothea by the time she returned.</p><p>Krelis started to turn away, but Dorothea didn\u2019t move. She continued to stare at the young Warlord until his eyes turned tear-bright and his muscles started to quiver. Swallowing hard, he opened his trousers all the way and slipped his hand inside.</p><p>Satisfied, Dorothea led Krelis out of her sitting room and began to stroll toward another wing of the SaDiablo mansion.</p><p>\u201cSo the bitch took the bait,\u201d Dorothea said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s mouth dried up. Sweat gathered in his armpits. \u201cShe disappeared. She bought passage for the westernmost station that could be reached by taking a Coach out of Raej, but when the Coach finally reached the station, it was several hours overdue and there was no one in it except the drivers. Neither of them could explain the lost hours nor what had happened to the Gray Lady and the slaves she\u2019d purchased at the auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Dorothea said. \u201cHas she crossed theTamanaraMountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure, but he wasn\u2019t about to admitthat . \u201cWe\u2019ll find her, Priestess. I swear it. I should have her location soon.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea said nothing for a moment. Then, with a hint of distaste, \u201cFrom your pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Pet slaves had their uses, especially when it came to spying on other slaves. Using his status as Dorothea\u2019s Master of the Guard, he had gone to Raej early to inspect the available slaves, and found one who had been more than willing to be a pet in order to gain whatever favors Hayll might grant.</p><p>Dorothea hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic about his plan, but she had woven the spells he had requested, including the spells that would ensure that his pet was among those the Gray Lady purchased at Raej.</p><p>There was a lot of land between Hayll and theTamanaraMountains, but those Territories now stood in Hayll\u2019s shadow and would offer no safety. There were also plenty of marauder bands who were more than willing to hunt down a Queen if they were offered enough gold marks and a promise not to be hunted in turn. All he needed was the signal from his pet and he\u2019d have the Gray bitch.</p><p>Dorothea let a heavy silence build while she led him through the hallways. Finally, she said, \u201cDo you still have my present?\u201d</p><p>Remembering the white feather, Krelis shuddered. \u201cYes, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always was a cunning bitch,\u201d Dorothea said softly. \u201cShe might have anticipated an ambush at a station since that\u2019s where the attack happened the last time. Did she have an\u201d escort waiting for her at any of those stations?\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes. They were eliminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That means shehad intended to go to that station and whatever had changed her plans was unexpected\u2014</p><p>which means her court is probably just becoming aware that something went wrong.\u201c</p><p>\u201cShe could have sent the escort to the station as a decoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have sent them there just to die. Grizelle isn\u2019t that practical.\u201d</p><p>Unlike you? Krelis thought\u2014then hastily buried that thought. \u201cIf she buys passage on another Coach . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many passes over theTamanaraMountains. She\u2019ll have to reach a station located near one of them and travel overland for some of the journey, no matter what she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could ride the Winds.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s thwarted herself in that as much as she\u2019s thwarted me. There\u2019s some kind of spell that acts as a barrier across the Winds, preventing anyone from riding them into her Territory. Anyone trying to get into Dena Nehele from this side of the Tamanara Mountainshas to use one of passes.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her coiled black hair. \u201cFind out where the slaves she purchased came from. If any of them were from prominent families, she might try bartering with their kin for assistance.\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s shoulders sagged in relief. At least he\u2019d done this right. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent someone to Raej for the list, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea gave him a smile of approval. \u201cI\u2019m sure, once you have it, you\u2019ll be able to offset your miscalculations.\u201d</p><p>Krelis didn\u2019t acknowledge the threat beneath the words.</p><p>Dorothea\u2019s smile sharpened. He couldn\u2019t tell if it indicated approval or displeasure.</p><p>They finally stopped walking when they reached a Red-locked door.</p><p>\u201cSince you have a little time while we\u2019re waiting for your pet to prove useful,\u201d Dorothea purred, \u201cI\u2019d like you to do a favor for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, Priestess,\u201d Krelis said quickly.</p><p>A pleased, vicious light filled Dorothea\u2019s gold eyes as she opened the door and gestured for him to enter the room ahead of her.</p><p>The darkened room stank of sweat and fear to the point where it almost overwhelmed the presence of a feminine psychic scent. Sufficient light came through the open door for him to recognize a bedchamber, but the bed was still too shadowed for him to see the occupant.</p><p>Dorothea raised her hand. The candle-lights on the bed tables brightened, softly lighting the room. Staying near the door, she gestured for Krelis to stand at the foot of the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A young, naked Hayllian witch was tied spread-eagle in the center of the bed. As Krelis stared at her, she struggled against the leather straps around her ankles, trying to close her legs. Since she was also gagged, she could only make muffled sounds of distress.</p><p>It took Krelis a moment to get past the blatant, if involuntary, invitation to mount, and recognize her. He couldn\u2019t remember her name, just that he\u2019d seen her a couple of times several years ago when a maternal second cousin of his had been courting her. That courtship had ended swiftly, and the only thing the cousin had said afterward publicly was that they weren\u2019t as well suited as he had thought.</p><p>But one night, over a couple of bottles of brandy, his cousin had muttered some other things about her. Since she no longer had anything to do with him or his family, Krelis had paid no attention.</p> <p>Now he wished he had, just as he wished he could remember what it was about her that had made him keep his distance during his cousin\u2019s brief courtship.</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Dorothea asked, a dangerous edge in her voice.</p><p>Sweat trickled down Krelis\u2019s sides. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her before, Priestess, but we were never formally introduced.\u201d That, thank the Darkness, was true.</p><p>Dorothea nodded as if satisfied. \u201cShe\u2019s a minor Queen from one of the Hundred Families. Her tendency to voice questionable opinions has caused great embarrassment and distress for her family. The latest unfortunate incident forced them to conclude that having her Virgin Night is the only thing that will settle her down.\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s hands curled into fists.Now he remembered. A mouthy little bitch who was always criticizing the High Priestess and talking about how a Territory shouldn\u2019t be ruled by a witch who was less than a Queen. Always talking as if she, who only wore a Rose Jewel, could gather enough Jeweled strength among the Hundred Families and the rest of Hayll to oppose Dorothea.</p> <p>Not even the Hundred Families were invulnerable if Hayll\u2019s High Priestess decided to punish disloyalty. And since the Families had gained the most from Dorothea\u2019s rule, why would they oppose her anyway?</p><p>\u201cI want you to take care of her Virgin Night,\u201d Dorothea said.</p><p>Panic knotted Krelis\u2019s guts. \u201cMe?\u201d His voice cracked. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lord Krelis?\u201d Dorothea said with quiet malevolence.</p><p>Krelis licked his dry lips. \u201cPriestess, I\u2019ve never . . .\u201d</p><p>Her amusement deepened his panic. \u201cYou regularly make use of the whores at one of the better Red Moon houses in Draega, so I doubt that you\u2019venever . . .\u201d She let the words hang. He could almost see them becoming a noose around his neck. He should have realized Dorothea would make it her business to know aboutthat , especially where it concerned the males who were the closest to her\u2014 and whose loyalty had to be watched the most carefully.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t a consort be better?\u201d Krelis stammered. \u201cThey\u2019re trained for this kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to do this, Krelis. As a favor to me.\u201d She studied him for a moment. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be concerned about filling her belly. This isn\u2019t her fertile time, so she\u2019ll still have that asset when her family contracts a marriage for her.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything, she turned to leave. \u201cI think an hour should be more than sufficient, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Krelis found his voice just as she was closing the door. \u201cBut . . . Priestess . . . what if I break her?\u201d</p><p>Dorothea gave him a queer look before saying with deadly softness, \u201cLord Krelis, I think the question you should be asking is what will happen if you don\u2019t?\u201d She closed the door.</p><p>Krelis heard the click of the physical lock. Then the Red lock snapped back into place, trapping him in the room. Using Craft, he could have destroyed the physical lock, could have destroyed the whole damn door for that matter. But his Sapphire Jewel, even though it was only one rank below the Red, wouldn\u2019t get him through a Red lock.</p><p>Not in one piece anyway.</p><p>His bowels loosened. Afraid of soiling himself, Krelis looked around frantically and spotted two doors in the wall opposite the bed. The first one was the dressing room. The second was a small bathroom.</p><p>Fumbling with his clothing and not caring if the bitch in the other room heard his own sounds of distress, he managed to sit on the toilet before the foul-smelling waste poured out of him. Each time he thought he was empty, his belly cramped again. When it finally stopped, he flushed the stink away and just sat there, his elbows on his knees, his head braced in his hands.</p> <p>To break a witch. Oh, he knew it was done all the time now. It settled down the troublesome ones all right, and it didn\u2019t even take much effort. Make the sex rough, scare her while you\u2019re handling her, and then one hard thrust to tear through the physical barrier. Ride her hard, each thrust driving her closer and closer to her inner web until she plunged through it, out of control. Descend quickly into the abyss, catch her before she fell so far that her mind shattered, and bring her back up. What was left was a witch closed off from her own strength, from the Jewels she had worn, from everything but basic Craft.</p><p>Simple enough.</p><p>But to break aQueen . Blood males were supposed to protect them.</p><p>Then again, since it was his duty to destroy the Gray Lady, why should he flinch about breakingthis little bitch-Queen?</p><p>With that question whirling through his head, Krelis cleaned himself and returned to the bedchamber.</p><p>From the first day he began his training as a guard, his ambition had been to serve in the High Priestess of Hayll\u2019s First Circle. Serving a strong Lady meant prestige and privileges. Even more important, it meant safety. No one toyed with Dorothea\u2019s males. Except Dorothea.</p><p>He\u2019d planned to marry in a year or two. He was tired of using the whores in the Red Moon house. He wanted a woman of his own, one who wouldn\u2019t be spreading her legs for anyone but him, one he could breed every few years to give him the offspring he wanted. His family bloodlines were good, his Sapphire Jewels were impressive enough, and his promotion to Master of the Guard guaranteed he\u2019d be able to pick almost any witch he pleased.</p><p>Now all his plans, all his dreams might end in this stinking bedchamber because an aristo bitch couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. Anger stirred in him as he stared at her pleading eyes, as he listened to the muffled sounds she kept making.</p><p>Stupid bitch. It was her own fault she was here. It washer faulthe was here. Always mouthing off as if that would change the reality of living in Hayll, as if anyone would thinkshe could rival Dorothea. Even if she actually had the strength to rule, would she really be any different than the others? No matter what she said, she\u2019d soon be snap--ping her fingers and expecting the males to dance to her tune.</p><p>That\u2019s the way it was among the Blood now\u2014a game of predator and prey, played out on a constantly shifting landscape of power: who wore the darkest Jewels, who had the most social prestige, who controlled the strongest males, who was the most skilled in Craft, who was the most dangerous.</p><p>Predator and prey.</p><p>Krelis stripped off his clothes and climbed onto the bed.</p><p>The weaker became prey. It was as simple as that.</p><p>His fear of failure churned inside him until it became a hot, throbbing anger. Since he couldn\u2019t turn that anger on the witch who frightened him, he unleashed it on the one who feared him.</p><p>And discovered why men enjoyed breaking witches so much.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019smy turn to sit in the wagon,\u201d Tomas said angrily, refusing to yield when Eryk stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a half-Blood,\u201d the older boy said, giving Tomas a shove. \u201cYou\u2019re just a stupid slave who has to do what he\u2019s told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you!\u201d Tomas returned the shove with interest.</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d Another shove.</p><p>Swiping his rain-soaked hair out of his eyes, Jared swore under his breath as he turned around and slogged through the mud, hoping he\u2019d reach the boys before they ended up bloodying each other\u2019s noses\u2014or worse, since Eryk was strong enough to wear a Yellow Jewel and Tomas didn\u2019t have any way to protect himself. Hell\u2019s fire, didn\u2019t they have enough problems without having to deal with childish squabbles?</p><p>The savage muttering behind him told him that Brock and Randolf had also turned back. Good. There was nothing like annoyed adult males to shrivel a boy\u2019s temper.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jared noticed Blaed and Thayne scrambling to reach the horses pulling the pedlar\u2019s wagon before the shoving match spooked them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any rank,\u201d Eryk shouted. \u201cYou don\u2019t count for anything! My family\u2019s aristo. My family\u2019s important. You\u2019re just a bastard some landen bitch had because a Warlord\u2019s dangle got stiff. You don\u2019t deserve to sit in the wagon. You don\u2019t deserve to eat up our food. You don\u2019t deserve tolive .\u201d</p><p>Jared felt the emotional blows as if they had been directed at him. He was so intent on reaching the boys and letting that little prick-ass feel the lash of his temper, he didn\u2019t see the Gray Lady until her hand connected with the back of Eryk\u2019s head hard enough to make the boy stagger. The waves of fury coming from her hit the rest of them hard enough to make them freeze.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she screamed at the cringing boy. \u201cHe has every right to his share of the supplies. He has every right to be treated with courtesy. He has every right to live, you selfish little prick!\u201d</p><p>With a shriek of rage that had fear skittering up every male spine, she lunged at Eryk.</p><p>Jared lunged at her.</p><p>Their bodies hit with a thud. While he struggled to keep his footing in the slippery mud, she struggled to break free and reach the focus of her anger. They slid around in an ugly, fear-filled dance. Jared\u2019s hands tightened on her upper arms hard enough to bruise, but that didn\u2019t lessen her struggles or her venom-coated curses.</p><p>As she threw herself to the right, almost breaking his hold, her foot slipped and twisted. He saw pain beneath the fury in her eyes, felt the change in her body as she tried to ignore it.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, what was he thinking of to slide around on a muddy road in the pouring rain, challenging a Gray-Jeweled Queen? The boy had no claims on him. Why should he care if she tore the little prick into pieces? All she had to do was send one bolt of power through the controlling ring and she\u2019d have all of them rolling in the mud begging for mercy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since it hadn\u2019t occurred to her yet, he wasn\u2019t going to give her the chance to think of it.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>No response.</p> <p>Fear shivered through him. Now that he\u2019d committed himself to opposing her, he couldn\u2019t back down and hope to remain intact. All right then. Balls and sass.</p><p>He put all the arrogance and temper he could summon into his voice. \u201cLady! It\u2019s the males\u2019 right to discipline their own.\u201d That was true in a court. It was true in a Blood community. Slaves didn\u2019t have that privilege, but he was hoping she was too angry to remember that.</p><p>Apparently she was because she stopped struggling. As he loosened his grip on her arms, her hands tightened on his coat, and he realized she couldn\u2019t put her weight on her right leg.</p><p>Sliding one arm around her waist, he pulled her tight against him to support and distract her\u2014and found himself distracted by the way his body responded to being so close to hers.</p><p>A hint of wildness floated up from somewhere deep inside him. Following that instinct, Jared wrapped a faint seduction spell around her as he lightly kissed her lips.</p> <p>When he was done, she just stared at him. Well, good. Now he wasn\u2019t the only one feeling confused.</p><p>\u201cLet us take care of the discipline,\u201d he coaxed as he stroked her wrinkled cheek with a finger and wondered why her skin felt so delightfully soft. \u201cBelieve me, having been boys ourselves, we\u2019re better at it.\u201d</p><p>He held his breath, waiting for her answer.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally said. \u201cJust . . . keep him away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be our pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in a reluctant smile. \u201cI think this is what my father calls \u2018things it\u2019s best a Queen pretend not to know.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Calls? Her father was still alive?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s just about right.\u201d Jared put some sass into his answering smile and watched, amazed, as color flooded her cheeks.</p><p>Looking around, she finally noticed Brock and Randolf holding Eryk and Tomas, and Blaed and Thayne watching everything while they soothed the nervous horses. Twisting her upper body in the other direction, she met Thera\u2019s frosted stare. The color in her cheeks deepened.</p><p>Feeling absurdly protective, Jared glared at Thera. She met him, look for look, and finally said in a voice so carefully neutral everyone knew she wanted to tear strips out of somebody, \u201cAre you intending to help her into the wagon anytime soon, or are you waiting for that knee to swell up to the size of a melon?\u201d</p><p>The Gray Lady let put a startled squawk when he swung her up into his arms and carried her into the wagon. Settling her on a bench cushioned by a couple of blankets, he knelt in front of her. Thank the Darkness his mother had taught him a little healing Craft. He couldn\u2019t do anywhere near as much as a Healer could, but at least he could do something to help her.</p><p>Except he didn\u2019t have a chance. He\u2019d just pulled off her boot and was debating how to broach the necessity of removing her trousers when Thera stormed into the wagon, followed by Polli, who stared at him as if removing a boot was a prelude to rape.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look after her,\u201d Thera said coolly. \u201cYou\u2019ve other business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Setting the boot on the floor, Jared rose slowly.</p> <p>Polli pressed herself into a corner and started muttering about it being her moontime, her stock reaction to being within a male\u2019s reach.</p><p>Thera\u2019s answer to the unspoken challenge was to turn aside just enough for him to reach the door and leave.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if it was seeing the Gray Lady in pain or Thera\u2019s dismissal that scraped at his temper, but by the time he reached the other men, he was looking for a fight.</p><p>And the best target was the sulky boy who had started all this.</p><p>Grabbing Eryk\u2019s coat, Jared hauled the boy up until he could look right into Eryk\u2019s startled blue eyes. Then he bared his teeth, and snarled, \u201cGive me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t beat the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Eryk wailed, \u201cI\u2019m an aristo! My family\u2019s important!\u201d</p><p>Pulling the boy so close their noses almost touched, Jared said with murderous calm, \u201cWell, now you\u2019re an aristo slave, and your family\u2019s not here. But I am. You feeling cocky enough to take on a pissed-off Red-Jeweled Warlord? Because I won\u2019t hold back or pull back.\u201d As his anger swelled and became hot enough to burn away his control, Jared gave Eryk a fierce shake. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize what could have happened? You put us all at risk! Didn\u2019t that aristo family of yours teach you anything about courtesy and honor? We could have all been hurt because of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Eryk weakly pounded Jared\u2019s arms and shoulders. \u201cI hate you! I hate you! I hope she does hurt you!\u201d</p><p>Jared shoved him. Hard.</p><p>Eryk\u2019s feet shot out from under him. With his arms frantically windmilling, he landed on his back. Then he just lay there in the mud, looking up at the circle of grim-faced, hard-eyed men.</p><p>Jared wondered if, or when, Eryk would realize Brock had been standing close enough to catch him and didn\u2019t.</p><p>Brock opened his coat and hooked his thumbs into his wide leather belt. He stared at Eryk for a moment before meeting Jared\u2019s eyes. \u201cMuch as it shames me to admit it, he and I come from the same Territory. So if we decide it\u2019s a strapping, the duty falls to me.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at the boy who, finally, began to realize the price of his behavior and then at the tall, solidly built Warlord who had trained as a guard. He didn\u2019t doubt Brock would apply his belt with the kind of force the boy wouldn\u2019t forget for a long time, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the emotional blows that had been delivered in those boyish taunts\u2014and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the Lady\u2019s comment about some scars not being visible.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, knowing as he said it that he was declaring himself the dominant male. Knowing, too, that none of the other men wore Jewels that could challenge the Red, nor would they want to since having a dominant male meant the others didn\u2019t have to deal directly with the Queen. Taking a deep breath, he wondered if any of them could sense how much of a sham his claiming dominance really was. But they just watched him, waiting, so he crossed an invisible line he wouldn\u2019t be able to step back over unless a darker-Jeweled male joined their group. \u201cUntil I say otherwise, the little aristo Warlord is going to be Tomas\u2019s servant. He\u2019ll have to take orders, fetch and carry, do anything Tomas wants. If he causes any trouble, Brock will handle the discipline.\u201d</p><p>Eryk\u2019s face burned with humiliation. No one protested the judgment until Tomas stepped away from Randolf.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him,\u201d Tomas said, pulling his shoulders back and holding his head up. It was hard to tell if there were tears mixed with the rain, but the clenched fists and quivering lips told them how hard he was struggling to keep his voice steady. \u201cI don\u2019t want him. I know I\u2019m just a half-Blood and not w-worth much, but there\u2019s plenty of things I can do. I know how to look after someone important, so I\u2019m going to s-serve the Lady. Not like other slaves who do the mean work, but look after her personally, just like her First Circle does.\u201d</p><p>Holding himself with the same care a man did after a beating, Tomas walked toward the back of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cTomas,\u201d Jared called. \u201cYou\u2019d better wait a bit.\u201d</p><p>The wounded look in the boy\u2019s eyes cut at him.</p><p>\u201cBut, Jared, it\u2019s my turn to sit inside.\u201d</p><p>Jared tried to smile. \u201cMine, too. But I got the impression Thera wasn\u2019t going to welcome any male, even a personal servant, until she got the Lady comfortably settled.\u201d</p><p>Tomas thought about that and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll wait \u2018til she\u2019s not feeling so pissy.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t stop him when Tomas headed for the saddle horses that were tethered to the back of the wagon by long lead ropes. Since the Gray Lady and Thera had been riding the horses and were inside the wagon, the boy would have some privacy for his tears.</p><p>He studied the pedlar\u2019s wagon for a moment, then shook his head. The Gray Lady and Thera. What a strange pairing.</p><p>\u201cShould we get moving, Lord Jared?\u201d Blaed asked. \u201cI\u2019ll lead the team for this turn.\u201d</p><p>Jared continued to look at the wagon. How much healing Craft would a broken Black Widow know, if she knew any at all? The Gray Lady must have some knowledge of it since she\u2019d done a fair healing on him, but what if she was in too much pain to use that skill on herself? \u201cLet\u2019s wait a few minutes. Then I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason why the rest of us can\u2019t start walking,\u201d Brock said, hauling Eryk to his feet. \u201cCome on, prick-ass, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Garth?\u201d Jared asked, scanning the surrounding area. Not that he could see much in this rain.</p><p>\u201cStill lumbering up ahead, I imagine,\u201d Randolf replied, not trying to hide his distaste.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as easy to break a Blood-Jeweled male\u2014not like the witches, who were vulnerable until their Virgin Night and were still vulnerable each month during the first three days of their moontime. But a darker Jewel could rip open the inner barriers and tear a man\u2019s mind apart, or unleash a tidal wave of power to shatter the inner web and cut a man off from his own strength in much the same way as a witch was broken. Since every slave knew it could happen to him for no better reason than the witch who owned him wanted it done, they didn\u2019t turn their backs on a man because of it.</p><p>But there was awrongness about Garth, more than the confused, kicked-puppy look in the pale blue eyes that was so at odds with the tall, muscled, barrel-chested body. There was a sliminess to his psychic scent, as if he\u2019d been touched by something tainted.</p><p>Maybe he had. Maybe that\u2019s what had broken him.</p><p>Pity for what had been done to him didn\u2019t make it any easier being around him, though.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWhat about Corry and Cathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were just ahead of Brock and me,\u201d Randolf said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brock took a firm hold of Eryk\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll check on them.\u201d</p><p>After Brock and Randolf started up the road with the reluctant Eryk between them, Jared turned to Thayne. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn on one of the saddle horses, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Thayne glanced at the wagon and swallowed hard. \u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, I\u2019ll keep Blaed company for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Meaning even the saddle horses were too close to Thera\u2019s temper.</p><p>Nodding his permission, Jared moved far enough away from them to discourage conversation. He took a moment to add a little more power to the Craft shields on his clothing. They did a fairly good job of waterproofing the fabric and keeping the mud and water from seeping into the boots. A little warming spell helped, too. But even with spells and shields, it was impossible not to feel the damp after a while, and if anyone knew a shield-spell that would have kept the rain off their heads, no one had mentioned it.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath, wishing it would settle his churning stomach. Sweet Darkness, don\u2019t let her be hurt badly. Pointless to hope that her arms wouldn\u2019t have bruises the shape of his hands.</p><p>Hurting her made him ache. It shouldn\u2019t have. Hadn\u2019t he crossed that line when he\u2019d killed the last Queen who had owned him?</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have made him ache. But it did.</p> <p>When the rain started yesterday afternoon, the Lady was the one who had told them to use whatever Craft was necessary to stay as dry as possible. She was the one who had put the Craft shields on Tomas\u2019s clothes and had kept an eye on those among them who might not have the power to hold the shields. Even Garth. She was the one who had put some kind of shield-spell on the wagon\u2019s wheels and the horses\u2019 hooves so they wouldn\u2019t sink in the mud.</p><p>And she was the one who had come up with the rotation.</p><p>The rotation was fair. More than fair. Hell\u2019s fire, there were thirteen of them, including the Gray Lady, and four of them were children. She could have let the children ride on the outer seat or inside and let the adults stumble along. She could have let the other females stay in the wagon with her\u2014and slave or not, no Blood male would have argued about it. But she\u2019d worked out this rotation that included everyone so that they all alternated between walking and riding, and everyone had a chance to get out of the rain and eat and rest within the confines of the wagon.</p><p>Telling himself that he just wanted to check on Tomas and see if they could start moving again, Jared walked to the back of the wagon.</p><p>Tomas wasn\u2019t in sight. Jared sighed and raked his wet hair away from his face. He didn\u2019t relish stumbling around in the trees and bushes on either side of the road in order to find the boy. Well, the Lady\u2019s controlling ring would be able to locate Tomas quickly enough.</p><p>After giving the roan mare and bay gelding friendly pats, Jared stood on the bottom step and knocked once on the wagon\u2019s door.</p> <p>Thera opened the door, shifting her body slightly to block his view of the inside. But he heard Tomas sternly tell someone to drink up the brew \u2018cause it wasn\u2019t doing any good while it was still in the cup.</p><p>Thera looked at Jared and shrugged.</p><p>Relieved to see humor instead of temper in her eyes, Jared shrugged in reply, as if to say, \u201cHe\u2019s male. What can you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jared asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe wrenched her knee,\u201d Thera replied just as quietly. Then she added thoughtfully, as if she were trying to work out a puzzle that still had too many pieces missing, \u201cI knew she had healing supplies in that private box of hers\u2014I saw them when she took care of you. But when I suggested that she open it so that I could see if there was anything that might help her, she refused to let Polli or me touch it. Then Tomas stuck his head in to see what was going on and heard us ... discussing things. He just stomped in and started scolding.\u201d Thera smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s a good scolder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jared said dryly. \u201cSo you got the healing supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the supplies,\u201d Thera replied.</p><p>But Jared was no longer listening to her. His thoughts were on the small chest the Gray Lady had brought with her. With the spell-lock on it, he\u2019d assumed, along with everyone else, that it held gold and silver marks and other things she wouldn\u2019t want slaves to have access to.</p> <p>Except he\u2019d realized the first time he\u2019d seen it that the chest had a Green-strength spell-lock. Which wouldn\u2019t have meant anything if there wasn\u2019t one slave who wore a Red Jewel and who could have easily broken that lock, if that same slave hadn\u2019t been singled out from the very beginning as being different from the others.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if there was something Thera suspected about the chest that she wasn\u2019t going to mention.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t the Gray Lady used a Gray lock on that chest?</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Thera said.</p><p>Did she sound a little defensive?</p><p>\u201cCan we get moving?\u201d Jared asked. \u201cWe should use what daylight is left and start looking for a place to camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We\u2019ll keep her comfortable enough.\u201d Thera paused. \u201cAre you coming in now? It\u2019s your rest period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes.\u201d When Thera started to close the door, Jared put his hand against it and asked the question he really wanted to ask. \u201cIs her knee the only place she\u2019s hurt?\u201d</p><p>Thera didn\u2019t pretend not to understand. \u201cThere are a couple of bruises. Nothing that won\u2019t easily heal.\u201d</p><p>No anger. No criticism. Somehow that made it worse.</p><p>Thera opened the door a fraction wider, a silent invitation.</p><p>Jared stepped down and back.</p><p>\u201cShriveled balls won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d Thera said tartly. \u201cI may need you to sit on her if Tomas and I can\u2019t convince Lady Grumpy to stay put and let that knee heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good patient?\u201d Jared asked blandly.</p><p>Thera snorted and shut the door.</p><p>Feeling a little better, Jared walked around the wagon and gave Blaed the nod to move out. It couldn\u2019t be a serious injury if she was already snarling and snipping. Painful, yes, but not something they\u2019d need to find a Healer to deal with.</p><p>Brock was waiting for him. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Jared noted that the Purple Dusk-Jeweled Warlord automatically swung to Jared\u2019s left, an acknowledgment of subordinate rank.</p><p>\u201cAlready bored with the sickbed,\u201d Jared answered. He felt Brock relax. \u201cDo you know any outrageous stories?\u201d</p><p>Brock looked startled, then wary. \u201cDepends on what you mean. Campfire talk? Things like that?\u201d</p><p>Jared felt a shiver of apprehension. He knew the dangers of telling tales. In one of the courts he\u2019d been in, a male guest, wanting to entertain one of the Ladies enough to receive an invitation to her bed, had repeated a funny but extremely unflattering story about an aristo witch. He\u2019d named no names, recounting it as he\u2019d heard it, but the story had been rich in detail\u2014and the Lady, who was also a guest, recognized herself. He might have survived if several other guests hadn\u2019t also recognized her by those details.</p><p>Jared had wondered afterward if the man was the only one who didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d had his tongue cut out before he was gutted.</p><p>\u201cWell, spicy enough to distract an elderly Queen who\u2019s convalescing,\u201d Jared said, pushing aside the darker memories. Brock was about his age, old enough to understand walking the knife edge.</p><p>Brock understood very well, if his muttering was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jared said testily, \u201cThera is as subtle as an avalanche and doesn\u2019t use a grain of caution about what she says or who she says it to. It hasn\u2019t been an hour yet and she\u2019s already calling the Gray Lady \u2018Lady Grumpy.\u2019 If we don\u2019t do something, those two are either going to end up in a spitting fight, which could end up with Thera being very dead, or she\u2019s going to try to brain the rest of us out of frustration.\u201d</p><p>Brock ran a hand over his short, light-brown hair. \u201cFor a broken witch, that one\u2019s scary. Hell\u2019s fire, there\u2019s not much to choose from, is there?\u201d He gave Jared a quick, assessing, hopeful look. \u201cYou\u2019re trained for personal service. Couldn\u2019t you handle it?\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth. He might not be able to stop himself from feeling ashamed because he was a pleasure slave, but he didn\u2019t have to let anyone see it.</p><p>Brock didn\u2019t miss much, though. \u201cI meant no insult, Lord Jared,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAny man with working brains knows a consort\u2014and a pleasure slave is nothing less than an unwilling consort\u2014is trained to do more than warm a bed. He dances on temper\u2019s edge, and a good consort makes it easier for the rest of us. I just thought\u2014well\u2014\u201d Brock sighed, resigned. \u201cWhat kind of stories?\u201d</p><p>A consort danced on temper\u2019s edge, but seldom felt the cut. Not like a pleasure slave did. And that tiny question that kept flickering on the edges of Jared\u2019s mind flashed to the front. Howwould the Gray Lady treat a consort . . . or a pleasure slave?</p><p>That thought stirred a memory.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fourteen,\u201d Jared said, \u201cthe Province Queen came to our village. Can\u2019t remember why now, or why she wasn\u2019t accompanied by the District Queen.\u201d He frowned, trying to remember. \u201cMaybe that was the year the former Queen stepped down and the new one wanted to see everything in her territory. Anyway, all the boys old enough to have begun formal training but still too young to be allowed to stand with the men had decided to wait on the main street, just in case we could be of service.\u201d</p><p>Brock grinned at him in perfect understanding.</p><p>\u201cMy father is the Warlord of Ranon\u2019s Wood, so he was the Lady\u2019s escort while she was there. He had gone to the official landing place outside of Ranon\u2019s Wood to meet her Coach and wasn\u2019t home when I came downstairs, dressed in my best clothes. I casually told my mother I was going to meet a couple of friends\u2014which was true since we were all going to be on the main street. She never said a word about my clothes, never asked where I was going. She just smoothed my collar and said, equally casual, that my younger brothers would be staying home with her that day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRanon\u2019s Wood is a fair-sized village, but there weren\u2019tthat many boys within that age group, so we all had a little piece of the walkway on either side of the street staked out as our territory. At the time, I thought we\u2019d just been clever enough not to draw the notice of the older youths. I learned much later that they\u2019d been asked to stay in the background unless specifically summoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your father wasn\u2019t there, who\u2019d have that much influence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. She\u2019s a Healer.\u201d Warmed by the memory that was now as bittersweet as all of his memories of Reyna, Jared\u2019s voice swelled with unmistakable pride.</p> <p>Brock nodded, silently respectful.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s eyes glazed when the carriage reached the beginning of the main street and he saw all of us spread out like that. But the Queen ordered the carriage to stop and said she wanted to walk a bit. And walk she did. I was the first one on that side of the street, and my father, may the Darkness embrace him, never said a word. I don\u2019t know what the Queen was thinking, but I saw her glance at the street and immediately offered to escort her across so she wouldn\u2019t get run over by another carriage\u2014not that there were any carriages moving on the street. She accepted my hand, and I led her across. Except then her official escort was on one side of the street and she was on the other. Naturally, the nearest boy offered to escort her back across.</p><p>\u201cShe never laughed at us, never gave us the slightest impression that there was something odd about being shepherded back and forth as she slowly made her way up the street. The last boy at the top of the street handed her back to my father, who had been keeping pace, and he took her into the coffeehouse.</p><p>\u201cTo this day, I have no idea where he was supposed to have taken her or if she got any refreshment before he slipped her out the back door to avoid more assistance.\u201d Jared smiled.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell your mother?\u201d Brock asked.</p> <p>The mud and the rain\u2014what did they matter compared to this?</p><p>\u201cMy mother and several other witches dined with the Queen that evening. Since it was Ladies only, my father stayed home with my brothers and me. For several days after that, every so often my mother would glance at him and giggle while his face turned red.\u201d</p><p>They walked for a minute in companionable silence.</p><p>Then Brock said, \u201cCorry and Cathryn are walking up ahead. Randolf s keeping an eye on them, and keeping Eryk away from them.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re holding hands.\u201d</p><p>Jared and Brock grinned at each other.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Brock said, hitching a thumb toward the wagon. \u201cGo warm up for a bit and make yourself useful. You might tell her that story. I think Thera would like it, too.\u201d</p> <p>More than willing to get out of the rain and give his legs a rest, Jared waited until the wagon caught up to him. Then he let it pass. He stared at the back of it, turning the thought over and over in his mind, testing it against instincts sharpened by the cruelty he\u2019d seen, and endured, over the past nine years.</p><p>Then he hurried to catch up, suddenly wanting the warmth, wanting something to eat, wanting to see if he could read anything in those hard gray eyes when he told her the story.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he trusted the Gray Lady. Yet he felt certain that in some other village on some other street, she, too, had allowed herself to be needlessly shepherded so that a few young boys could proudly say they had served.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Krelis stared at the spelled brass button in his hand and then at the uneasy guard. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>The guard\u2019s face tightened. \u201cI made no mistake, Lord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>Krelis waved his hand, an oblique apology for insulting the man\u2019s skill. His voice thickened with frustration. \u201cWhat in the name of Hell is shedoing ?\u201d</p><p>The guard shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s a Coach station less than a mile from that inn\u2014but there\u2019s a better inn right next to the station if she\u2019d intended to buy passage and go on to the Tamanara Mountains.\u201d</p> <p>Which is precisely what the bitchshould have done.</p><p>\u201cThe innkeeper was sure it was the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old Queen dressed in gray with twelve slaves. I found that button in the guest servants\u2019 quarters because the slave quarters weren\u2019t \u2018comfortable\u2019 enough for her new toys. Maybe she\u2019s trying to tame the Queen killer with sugar instead of the lash.\u201d</p><p>Krelis felt his blood chill. \u201cWhat Queen killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador pleasure slave who showed his temper a couple of weeks ago. He would have gone to the salt mines of Pruul, but she fancied him.\u201d</p><p>Krelis let his breath out slowly. Fool! He\u2019d already seen the list of slaves, and the Sadist wasn\u2019t on it. Besides, the High Priestess only sold Daemon Sadi\u2019s services. She\u2019d never sell him outright\u2014and she\u2019d never let a dangerous enemy have any kind of control over a male that deadly.</p><p>The name on the list had meant nothing to him, but he\u2019d heard about that Shalador Warlord\u2019s butchery. Would that work in his favor? A dark-Jeweled male turned vicious wouldn\u2019t be tamed again easily. He might even hate the next witch holding the leash enough to strike a crippling blow with no provocation. Doubtful he\u2019d survive if he tangled with the Gray\u2014no loss if he didn\u2019t\u2014but if he weakened her, it would make it that much easier to finish the kill once they found the Gray Lady.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Coach station in easy reach that would get her out of a Territory that stands in Hayll\u2019s shadow. Instead of going there, she buys an old pedlar\u2019s wagon, a team of horses, two saddle horses, and supplies.\u201d Krelis\u2019s voice rose. \u201cTo do what? What\u2019s the bitch\u2019s game?\u201d</p><p>The guard shrugged again. \u201cShe set out on the road heading northeast, or so the innkeeper said. Lots of small roads branch off it, traveling west and northwest. She could have changed direction. Been lots of rain around there. She can\u2019t be traveling fast, and she\u2019s not traveling light. She packed that wagon with supplies.\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s hand closed around the button. \u201cWhich still doesn\u2019t explain what she\u2019s doing!\u201d</p><p>The guard shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cMaybe that attack in the spring was more successful than anybody thought. She\u2019s an old woman.\u201d</p><p>Krelis let the idea take root. \u201cItwas a vicious attack.\u201d The Gray Lady had escaped last spring, but the violent unleashing of power might have left her mentally unstable. Could she be wandering aimlessly, all the time thinking she was heading for the Tamanara Mountains and safety?</p><p>Krelis slipped the brass button into his pocket. At least he had something to report. \u201cLet the marauder bands know where she was last seen. They\u2019ll know the land around there better than we do.\u201d</p><p>After dismissing the guard, Krelis slumped in his chair. So far his plan was working. If his pet hadn\u2019t left the spelled button, though, he would have had no idea where to start looking for her.</p><p>That Shalador Warlord troubled him a little. There had been no reason for her to go down to those slave pens and even less reason to buy him. She\u2019d already bought a young pleasure slave. She didn\u2019t need another, especially one who had turned savage.</p><p>Or had she bought him with the intention of giving him to a Shalador Queen in exchange for help reaching the Tamanara Mountains?</p><p>Krelis smiled grimly.</p><p>If getting help from Shalador had been her plan, she was already too late.</p><p>Much too late.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>An hour after sunrise, Jared gave a final pat to the bay gelding and roan mare that were already saddled and tethered to the back of the wagon, and approached the door. They\u2019d broken last night\u2019s camp and were ready to move on, but courtesy and a healthy sense of self-preservation told him he should get the Gray Lady\u2019s permission first\u2014especially since he\u2019d never consulted her yesterday afternoon when he had decided they\u2019d all had enough of slogging through rain and mud and had given the order to make camp.</p><p>He raised his hand, but it froze before he could knock on the door. No matter what Jewels he wore, no man would willingly step into that cramped space while two witches were arguing in sharp, low voices that would have been raised to full volume if they hadn\u2019t been trying to keep it private.</p><p>Jared stepped back, unsure what to do\u2014and wished, again, that he hadn\u2019t begun the sham yesterday of being the dominant male. HisJewels might outrank everyone else\u2019s except the Gray Lady\u2019s, but what difference did that make? He was aslave . He was hollow inside. He didn\u2019t want to have authority over the other males. He didn\u2019t want the responsibilities that came with that authority. But he\u2019d let a moment\u2019s temper make that choice for him, and now he was stuck with it.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t back away now and just wait untilshe gave the order to move on.</p><p>Before he could retreat, Tomas opened the door, looking flushed and angry.</p><p>No longer muffled, Thera\u2019s voice had a dangerous edge.</p><p>\u201cYoucan\u2019t walk. That knee healed better than I thought it would overnight, but it\u2019s not going to take that kind of exercise, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I can ride one of the saddle horses, or sit on the driving seat. That will give others the opportunity to be inside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t raining now,\u201d Thera interrupted. \u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned, let\u2019s stay in this camp for a day and give everyone a rest. The animals certainly could use it.\u201d</p><p>Jared winced. Thera sure knew how to twist a verbal knife. By the end of that first morning on the road, they\u2019d all recognized the Gray Lady\u2019s love for animals. If she could have figured out a way to tuck the horses into the wagon to give them a rest, he was sure she would have done it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Was that physical or emotional pain in the Gray Lady\u2019s voice? \u201cWe have to keep going. I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tomas had been looking at Jared. Now he twisted around. \u201cYou can just sit and get better like you\u2019re supposed to,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat if you slip in the mud and hurt yourself bad?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m riding a horse\u2014\u201d The Gray Lady had to be gritting her teeth to make the words sound like that.</p><p>But Tomas wasn\u2019t going to be warned or silenced by mere words. \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking in the rain for two days now, and you\u2019re a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueens don\u2019t melt in the rain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could take sick or something. What if your throat gets sore and you can\u2019t talk? Then what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>An awful silence filled the wagon.</p><p>Jared held his breath, waiting.</p><p>Whatever was said next wasn\u2019t loud enough for Jared to hear, but Tomas grinned and scampered down the steps. His grin widened when the door closed behind him with a less-than-gentle slam.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both feeling pissy this morning,\u201d Tomas said cheerfully.</p> <p>Jared muttered, \u201cLucky us.\u201d He looked at the closed door, thought about the \u201cdiscussion\u201d that had just taken place, then shook his head. His mother had been right: When faced with staying in bed because of illness of injury, even the maturest adult turned into an obstinate child.</p><p>Giving in to the inevitable, Jared trudged to the front of the wagon and gave Thayne the signal to move out.</p><p>Everyone else was ahead of him, Garth so far ahead he\u2019d be out of sight once he topped the small rise. Randolf was leading the rest of them, and Brock had taken a mid position so that he could keep an eye on the wagon and the walkers. Corry was walking between Polli and Cathryn. Blaed was paired with Eryk, who looked grateful to be included again after being shunned by everyone since yesterday\u2019s squabble with Tomas. Tomas walked alone, but there was no indication it wasn\u2019t by choice.</p><p>Jared turned up his coat collar and lengthened his stride enough to catch up to Tomas. The rain had stopped for the moment, but the morning air was cold\u2014and those clouds piling up in the west were a sure sign that there would be another storm by afternoon.</p><p>Tomas gave him a quick glance that told him his presence was an intrusion that would be endured.</p><p>Jared smiled in reply. \u201cIf we walk together, we\u2019ll both have some time and privacy for thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Tomas looked startled for a moment. Then he grinned and returned to his own thoughts.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath. As he released it, he felt some of the tension in his shoulders ease.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about much in the past couple of days, if he didn\u2019t count the fierce daydreams about staying put in some kind of shelter where he\u2019d be warm and dry, and eating something besides that traveler\u2019s fare the Gray Lady had taught Thera and Polli how to make. He\u2019d learned nothing about the Invisible Ring. If it was shielded, he couldn\u2019t detect the use of Craft. There was no weight, no tightness, none of the things that made a man ever aware of a Ring of Obedience. Hell\u2019s fire, it might as well not be there at all!</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t helping him figure out a way to elude it. Except for the explosion Eryk had caused, they\u2019d had no way to measure the Gray Lady\u2019s temper. A deliberately casual comment by Randolf, and Blaed\u2019s fumbling attempt to get information, indicated the Rings of Obedience weren\u2019t tightly held either. A test of obedience? A trap for the first man who tried to slip the leash? Was that why she didn\u2019t insist that they remain close to the wagon? Was she using the Rings to keep track of them? No way to tell. The Gray Lady kept shifting between acting cold and being concerned, which kept them all off-balance and wary of being near her\u2014except Thera and Tomas. He could understand her putting up with Tomas\u2019s lack of subservience. He\u2019d seen a number of Queens amuse themselves by indulging that kind of behavior in an otherwise powerless slave\u2014and he\u2019d seen what had happened to those slaves when the Queen no longer found it amusing. But he couldn\u2019t understand why the Gray Lady tolerated Thera\u2019s tongue and temper. And he still didn\u2019t understand what it was about this Gray-Jeweled Queen that made something inside him restless enough and hungry enough to keep forgetting why he should fear her.</p><p>All he knew for sure was that they were traveling through rough country, always heading west or northwest, and hadn\u2019t seen anyone since they\u2019d left the inn. They were far enough north to feel the bite of autumn, especially at night, but he still didn\u2019t know what Territory they were in, and the Lady wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>Or else the Lady didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Not a pleasant thought. Mother Night,none of his thoughts were pleasant! He understood why she wouldn\u2019t allow slaves to ride the Winds by themselves, but why hadn\u2019t she bought passage at the next Coach station if she was determined to bring them back to Dena Nehele?</p><p>And what was she afraid of? That the males would try to break the Rings of Obedience and then call in the Jewels and attack her? Doubtful. The stories whispered about her were sufficient reason for any sane man to think long and hard before challenging her. And in truth, there were only five out of the twelve of them who were whole enough and trained enough to be even a potential threat to her.</p> <p>So there had to be some other reason for the flashes of anxiety he had picked up from her over the past couple of days, despite her effort to hide them. Did the message she\u2019d received just before they\u2019d left Raej have anything to do with this demand to keep moving?</p><p>Jared scowled. Whatever it was, it was her problem, not his.</p><p>He\u2019d give it another day. Maybe two. He didn\u2019t know exactly where he was, but he did know he was still east of the Tamanara Mountains and south of Shalador. Another day or two, and then the hollow man masquerading as the dominant Warlord would test the leash attached to the Invisible Ring and see if it would reach as far as Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>Just for a little while. Just long enough. After that, he would accept whatever happened to him.</p><p>To keep himself from traveling down that path, Jared broke the comfortable silence. \u201cWhat difference does it make if the Lady\u2019s throat gets sore?\u201d</p><p>Tomas shot him a nasty look.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t implying that it wouldn\u2019t matter if she got sick,\u201d Jared said. Hell\u2019s fire, the boy was pricklier than a Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cWell, if her throat gets sore and she can\u2019t talk, how\u2019s she going to tell us the next part of the story? She\u2019s the only one who knows.\u201d</p><p>Before Jared could say anything, Tomas launched into the story about a group of children who had been captured by a Queen who had become greedy and cruel. By banding together, they managed to escape and decided to travel to a protected Territory where the Blood still believed they were the caretakers of the land and Craft was a power used responsibly. They had a number of adventures, getting help from unlikely, and sometimes humorous, sources as they eluded troops of guards and marauder bands.</p><p>As Tomas retold the story, Jared wondered if any of the children had thought it strange that the children in the story had the same names as they did, or if that just added to the delight as they outwitted the forces the wicked Queen sent after them. He also couldn\u2019t quite dismiss the tiny spark of resentment that Thera and Polli had been transformed into children for the tale but none of the adult males had been included.</p><p>And the tale itself ... A land and a people whose Queen still balanced power with honor standing against a land and a people corrupted by a twisted witch. Did the Gray Lady see herself as the last defense against Dorothea\u2019s influence and corruption of power?</p><p>What if she was?</p><p>The thought rocked him back on his heels, and a whisper of hope began to take root inside him.</p><p>What if she was? What did anyone really know about the Gray Lady? If shewasn\u2019t a deadly, ruthless Queen, why didn\u2019t traders from neighboring Territories correct anyone who spoke harshly about her? Or did no one disagree with the stories that were told because a fierce reputation kept her people and the bordering Territories better protected?</p><p>Tomas reached the point in the story where the children were standing on the edge of a cliff, with a fast-moving river far below them and a marauder band riding up to cut off any chance of escape.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d Jared demanded, a little embarrassed that, despite his wandering thoughts, he\u2019d still been listening to the story.</p><p>Tomas shrugged and wiped his nose on his sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019ll tell us tonight\u2014if her throat doesn\u2019t get sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Was there a discreet way of telling the Lady that the adult males would enjoy the story, too?</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Thera called from behind him.</p><p>Knowing it was childish but somehow blaming her because he\u2019d been excluded from the entertainment, Jared hunched his shoulders and lengthened his stride. Maybe he could pretend he hadn\u2019t heard her.</p><p>Randolf, who was walking ahead of Jared, glanced over his shoulder and quickened his pace. Blaed, however, looked back and hesitated.</p><p>Jared glared at both of them.</p><p>\u201cLord Jared!\u201d</p><p>Jared winced, swore softly, and turned around.</p><p>Thera stomped through the mud, her clenched hands swinging from stiff arms, her color high, and her green eyes blazing with temper.</p><p>Jared glanced at Brock, who rolled his eyes but made no effort to get closer. Blaed, having turned back, swung to Jared\u2019s left, close enough to look supportive but still far enough away not to be included in the discussion. Even Tomas stepped away from him.</p><p>Were they giving him maneuvering room, or just trying to avoid getting hit by mistake if she tried to punch him?</p><p>\u201cLord Jared,\u201d Thera said again as she stomped up to him. \u201cThe Lady needs some entertainment.\u201d</p><p>Blood rushed into Jared\u2019s face and drained out again, leaving him shaken. Thera didn\u2019t have much tact, but even she should know better than to state it so baldly.</p><p>Thera hesitated for a moment, puzzled. Then her eyes blazed even brighter. \u201cNotthat , you fool. Although sitting on her may be the only way you\u2019re going to get her to be sensible and stay off that leg.\u201d She swiped at the hair that had escaped from the loose braid. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, you\u2019d think the woman had never had to spend a day in bed in her entire life! She\u2019s so stubborn, so ... so ...\u201d</p><p>Jared bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cSo like in temperament?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He braced for the punch. He wouldn\u2019t take it, but he\u2019d dearly love an excuse to push her face into the mud.</p><p>She made a noise, like steam escaping a kettle. When she finally spoke, her voice was dangerously controlled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wears the Red, Warlord. So show some balls anddo something.\u201d</p><p>She brushed past him and started walking, her dark braid bouncing against her back.</p> <p>Brock raised his hands and shrugged, fighting hard not to laugh.</p><p>Blaed bit his lip, rolled his shoulders, and finally said hesitantly, \u201cI have a chess set, if that would help.\u201d</p><p>Using Craft, the Blood had the ability to call in and vanish objects, allowing them to carry things without being physically burdened with them. Sadi had described it once as an invisible cupboard, its size dependent on a person\u2019s strength and how much power was siphoned off to maintain it.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t ask what else Blaed\u2014or any of the rest of them\u2014might have that would be of interest to the group. When a man\u2019s body was someone else\u2019s property, material possessions could take on fierce importance and become emotional wounds if sharing them wasn\u2019t done by choice. All too often these small treasures were taken by a stronger slave or by someone in the court who wanted the object. . . or simply wanted the slave to feel the loss of it.</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d Jared said, letting nothing in his voice or expression make any demands. There had already been too many demands made on Blaed, who was barely twenty and the only other male who had been used as a pleasure slave. Jared remembered too well how he had felt at that age, and the harsh lessons he\u2019d learned when sexual pleasure had been turned into a twisted game.</p> <p>Blaed called in the chess set, protected by a cloth bag, and handed it to Jared.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI'll see that it\u2019s returned.\u201d</p><p>Relief visible in his eyes, Blaed smiled his acknowledgment and hurried to rejoin Eryk.</p><p>Jared trotted up to the wagon, which had passed him while he\u2019d been \u201cdiscussing things\u201d with Thera. He wondered briefly why no one was riding the saddle horses, then shrugged off the thought. Either Thera and the Gray Lady were supposed to be riding this turn, or whoever was supposed to be had chosen to walk instead of being that close to two witches who were grating on each other\u2019s tempers.</p><p>He jumped to the bottom step, using a little Craft to keep his balance. Taking the muffled snarl that answered his knock as an invitation, he entered and closed the door quickly so he wouldn\u2019t tumble out. The wide shutters at the front of the wagon were opened enough to provide a little fresh air, but not much light.</p><p>A small ball of witchlight began to glow near the Lady\u2019s head.</p> <p>Dressed in dark-gray trousers and a long, heavy gray sweater, she sat on one of the benches that acted as seats and beds, her back resting against the storage boxes stacked against the top side of the bench. A blanket was wrapped around her shoulders like a shawl. Her long gray hair, usually hidden by the hood of her coat, was pulled back in a loose braid. The dim light smoothed away the age lines in her face and made her look like the lovely young woman she once must have been.</p><p>Desire nipped at him unexpectedly, making his heart beat a little faster, making his blood heat.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be feeling like this, not for an old woman who had bought him in the same way she had bought the wagon and the horses. But . . .</p><p>Was there a man in Dena Nehele who found her touch exciting, who considered it a privilege and an honor to warm her bed? Did she have a consort or a lover, or did she use pleasure slaves? Would she enjoy having him caress her until his hands and mouth gave her release? What would she do if he kissed her until the desire humming through him consumed them both?</p><p>Dangerous thoughts\u2014and foolish ones. He was thinking like a man who would be granted equal pleasure in the bed instead of a slave who might use his experience and training to his own advantage.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>The surly tone, the wary look in her gray eyes, and the way her body stiffened slapped his thoughts back to something close to neutral. Had he slipped so much that his thoughts had shown on his face? Thank the Darkness his coat was long enough to hide his body\u2019s response. Or was it the Ring that had betrayed him?</p><p>Jared raised the cloth bag. \u201cWould you like to play a game of chess to pass the time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChess?\u201d Her eyes immediately brightened with interest. She swung her legs over the side of the bench, wincing when the right knee refused to bend.</p><p>The sharp look she gave him was sufficient warning not to say anything, so Jared settled on the other bench and pulled the box out of the cloth bag. Partly because it was practical and partly to test her, he didn\u2019t ask permission before using Craft to hold the box in the air.</p><p>There was nothing in her expression except eagerness.</p><p>Odd that she didn\u2019t ask where the chess set came from. Slaves were supposed to show any possessions they carried using Craft, including the Jewels which always traveled with them even if they were forbidden to wear them. But every slave he\u2019d known tried to hide a few things\u2014favorite books, a gaming set like this, personal mementos, pictures of loved ones. If Blaed had acknowledged having this, he wouldn\u2019t have been so fearful about admitting it.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t ask, and he found himself warming to her because of it.</p><p>Jared opened the box, which became the game board with its alternating black and light-gray squares.</p><p>\u201cRed or black?\u201d he asked, indicating the playing pieces.</p><p>\u201cBlack,\u201d she replied, pushing up the sweater\u2019s sleeves.</p><p>Even slogging through the mud, she moved with unstudied grace, and he\u2019d been surprised when he\u2019d carried her to the wagon yesterday to discover that the body hidden by trousers, layered tunics and a knee-length coat was shapelier than he\u2019d expected. More solid, too. Now, seeing the strong wrists and forearms showing below the sweater, Jared readjusted his image of her a little more. She might be old in years, but she was still a vigorous woman who probably engaged in all kinds of physical activity. All kinds.</p><p>Keep your mind on the game, Jared warned himself as he began separating the game pieces.Your body is getting far too interested in thatkind of speculation .</p><p>When all the pieces were separated and ready to be placed, he handed her the dice to roll for the Queen\u2019s rank.</p><p>She rolled a six, which gave her Queen the Purple Dusk Jewel and the ability to move six squares in any direction. He rolled a five, the Summer-sky. One rank difference, so she didn\u2019t have an overwhelming advantage.</p><p>After carefully slipping the dice into the cloth bag, Jared began setting up his pieces.</p><p>The board was thirteen squares by thirteen. The first five rows on either side were the player\u2019s territory. The middle three were the battlefield. After placing his two castles and the sanctuary, Jared quickly set up the rest in one of his favorite patterns, with his Queen safely tucked away behind one of the castles and enough of the stronger pieces nearby to provide protection.</p><p>Satisfied with his positioning, he glanced at her side of the board and clenched his teeth to stop the instinctive protest. Why was her Queen standing in the middle of her territory with other pieces in the way of her reaching the castles and sanctuary? What kind of strategy was that when the whole point of the game was to capture the Queen?</p><p>Unless the Blood in Dena Nehele played by a different set of rules.</p><p>Without warning, a shadow of anger slid through his veins, a feral anger that tasted of the wild stranger. He felt tempted by it, wanted to welcome it and fan it until it burned hot and bright.</p><p>Instead, he pushed it away. Anger was dangerous to a slave. And, Hell\u2019s fire, it was only a game. Why should he care how she set up her pieces?</p><p>He used Craft to create a larger, brighter ball of witch-light. With the witchlight floating over the game board, the rest of the cramped space disappeared until all that was left was the game and the old woman watching him, wearing a friendly but challenging smile.</p><p>Since he had the lighter-ranked Queen, the first move was his. Meeting her eyes for a moment, Jared smiled as he moved a Warlord Prince onto the battlefield and accepted the unspoken challenge.</p><p>She moved her Queen.</p><p>The game began.</p><p>His father had told him chess was a game of the heart as well as the mind, that it was a kind of training ground because it showed you your own weaknesses. Which was why you didn\u2019t play it with an enemy.</p><p>When he was young and first learning the game, that hadn\u2019t made much sense. But later, as he watched his father play with friends who dropped by for an evening game, he began to understand. Belarr always tried to protect the Healers on the board as well as the Queen, sacrificing any male piece if it could block the attack.</p><p>Reyna, on the other hand, tended to use the Healers as protection for other pieces, even the Blood males and witches who were the pawns in the game. Her Healers, Priestesses, and Black Widows were usually captured long before any of the stronger male pieces.</p><p>When he\u2019d pointed this out to her one time, she had shrugged and told him to care for his own.</p><p>He\u2019d told his father about this quirk in an otherwise intelligent woman, thinking Belarr would find it as amusing as he had.</p><p>Belarr, too, had shrugged, but it wasn\u2019t as lighthearted a movement as Reyna\u2019s had been. He\u2019d carefully masked whatever he had been thinking and said, \u201cHealers and Queens don\u2019t play the game well.\u201d Then he\u2019d abruptly changed the subject.</p><p>At the time, Jared had thought Belarr\u2019s reaction was due to Reyna\u2019s returning home completely exhausted from a long and difficult healing. Now, watching the Gray Lady\u2019s Queen scamper around the board attacking, protecting, risking capture, the memory became shaded with a different meaning, a deeper understanding.</p><p>He passed up a couple of opportunities to capture, initiating attacks on the other side of the board where she had to use the stronger male pieces. Even then, she sacrificed a Priestess instead of a Prince.</p><p>He swallowed the anger that was building up inside him again. It was only a game, a way to relieve her boredom. But, Hell\u2019s fire, didn\u2019t the woman have any sense? You didn\u2019t sacrifice the distaff gender while there was still a strong male left standing unless there was no other move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she moved her Queen to protect a Blood male that couldn\u2019t escape capture, his temper finally snapped.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d he said through gritted teeth as he took the Blood male, \u201cit\u2019s an insignificant piece. You shouldn\u2019t be risking your Queen for a pawn.\u201d</p><p>The air in the wagon chilled so much he could see his breath.</p> <p>Startled, he looked at her.</p><p>The gray eyes that had been warm and friendly a moment ago were icy, hard, and reflected a fury that came from so deep within her they reflected nothing at all.</p><p>Never breaking eye contact, she reached out and deliberately knocked over her Queen. \u201cThere are no pawns.\u201d</p><p>Looking away, she began gathering up the captured pieces that were lying beside her on the bench, carefully setting each one into the box.</p><p>Watching the jerky movements of muscles clenched in anger was worse than feeling the lash.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for the game,\u201d she said stiffly, feeling around for the last piece. \u201cI\u2019m tired now. I wish to rest.\u201d</p><p>As she picked up the last piece, a Blood male, her fingers closed protectively around it.</p><p>The cold dismissal stung, but he accepted it. After double-checking that all the pieces and the dice were back in the box, he slipped it into the cloth bag and left the wagon. He returned the game to Blaed with faint thanks and hurried away.</p><p>No one approached him. No one asked what had happened. Even Thera took a long look at his face and left him alone.</p><p>Not a game to be played with an enemy, because it exposed the heart\u2019s weaknesses.</p><p>All these long years later, he understood the quarrels between Belarr and Reyna as he never had before. Despite their Craft and their courage\u2014or, perhaps, because of it\u2014 Healers didn\u2019t have a strong sense of self-preservation and would drain themselves to the breaking point before they\u2019d back away from a healing. Which was why, by Blood Law, every Healer had to be served by at least one Jeweled male unless she had a Jeweled consort or husband who would assume the duty of protecting her from herself.</p> <p>Was that why courts had originally formed around Queens? To protect them from giving too much of themselves?</p><p>Since he\u2019d never served in a court before he was Ringed, he\u2019d never been with a Queen he respected let alone wanted to protect, never experienced the fierce loyalty and pride that he\u2019d heard filled men when they served a good Queen.</p><p>For the rest of the morning, his thoughts chased each other, swinging from the Gray Lady to Reyna and back again. Speculation and memories kept poking at him until he felt savage and frightened. He couldn\u2019t shake the idea that Reyna would like Lady Grizelle, and it troubled him. That Belarr would probably consider her a good Queen troubled him even more, because Belarr would question the honor of a Red-Jeweled Warlord who would abandon a Queen during a difficult journey.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, he was aslave . He hadn\u2019t agreed to serve her. Why shouldn\u2019t he escape if he got the chance? He wanted to go home. He wanted to talk to Reyna. Wanted,needed to explain.</p><p>Belarr had never been a slave. There was no way he could fully appreciate the emotional difference. What would the Sadist do if he were here, wearing the Invisible Ring?</p><p>No answers. No answers. Just a churning uneasiness that came from knowing that he would have to make a choice soon.</p><p>Just when he thought the day couldn\u2019t get any worse, it started raining again.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Randolf snarled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Garth now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jared said as the big man ran awkwardly toward them, holding out his arms to help maintain his balance on the muddy road.</p><p>Garth tended to roam ahead of the rest of them and then shuffle back to keep them in sight, much as a pet dog would do. The fact that the Gray Lady didn\u2019t keep him on a tighter leash was another thing about her that baffled the other males. Granted, Garth couldn\u2019t ride the Winds by himself, if he had ever been able to, and it wasn\u2019t likely that he could get far enough away on foot to prevent the Gray Lady from incapacitating him with the agony that could be sent through the Ring of Obedience, but that leniency wasn\u2019t typical in a slave owner.</p><p>Jared shook his head. Right now, he wasn\u2019t interested in puzzling over the peculiarities of female behavior. He was cold, wet, and tired. The afternoon light\u2014what little of it there had been that day\u2014was waning, and the only thing he was interested in was finding a place to make camp and getting something hot to eat. So his voice had an edge to it when he said, \u201cWhat is it, Garth?\u201d</p><p>Garth gave no sign of having heard him. Instead of continuing toward Jared, he suddenly veered toward Corry and Cathryn, waving his arms as if he were trying to herd small farm animals into a pen.</p><p>\u201cShoo! Shoo!\u201d Garth shouted, waving his arms.</p><p>There was something sadly amusing about watching Garth, but there was nothing amusing about the way the children froze, their eyes getting bigger and bigger, or the fear in Corry\u2019s face when he grabbed Cathryn\u2019s hand and ran back to the wagon.</p><p>\u201cGarth,\u201d Jared yelled, starting toward him.</p><p>Garth changed directions and ran toward Eryk. \u2018\u2019Shoo! Shoo!\u201c</p><p>\u201cGarth!\u201d Jared put the crack of a lash into his voice. He held his ground when Garth turned again, and clenched his teeth when the big man grabbed his upper arms and lifted him off his feet.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Rauders!\u201d Garth shouted, shaking him. \u201cFight \u2019rauders!\u201d</p><p>Jared felt Randolfs bristling temper and wondered if this was going to turn into a maiming fight. Then he felt Brock\u2019s battle calm and saw the other man silently come around behind Garth. Randolf might have been a well-trained guard before being made a slave, but in a fight, Jared would rather have Brock\u2019s steadiness at his back any day.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, Garth,\u201d Jared said firmly.</p><p>\u201cFight \u2018rauders!\u201d Garth insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhen you put me down.\u201d</p><p>Garth dropped him.</p><p>Jared slipped on the mud and would have landed on his back if Garth hadn\u2019t grabbed him again, planting his feet so firmly on the road it made his bones rattle.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Garth!\u201d Jared snapped as he stepped out of reach.</p><p>Garth just hopped from one foot to the other in an anxious, shuffling dance. \u201c \u2018Rauders!\u201d he said, growing more insistent and more frantic.</p><p>Jared eyed the big man, then took a deep breath and blew it out. Hell\u2019s fire. There weren\u2019t any marauders. No one but slaves owned by a stubborn idiot of a Queen would be traveling on a day like this. Most likely, Garth had spotted an animal moving through the brush and trees that bordered the road. Although . . . unless they had been startled for some reason, even animals would find a spot to shelter in, wouldn\u2019t they?</p><p>Made uneasy by that thought as well as Garth\u2019s continued distress, Jared sent out a wide psychic probe that spanned the narrow road and extended several yards on either side. A few seconds later, he choked back a shiver of fear.</p><p>Still out of sight but coming steadily toward them were thirteen Blood males\u2014twelve Warlords . . . and a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince whose psychic scent had that distinctive blend of viciousness and passion that separated Warlord Princes from other males. They were a law unto themselves, no matter what Jewels they wore. And they were always dangerous.</p><p>Jared took a step back before he could stop himself. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.\u201d He whipped around to face Randolf and Brock. \u201cGet everyone back to the wagon. Now!\u201d</p><p>Brock narrowed his eyes as if that would let him see farther in the pouring rain. \u201cJared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNOW!\u201d</p><p>Brock and Randolf looked at Garth, who was now standing in the middle of the road with his legs far enough apart for good balance and his huge hands clenched. Nodding grimly, they wrapped their hands around his thick-muscled arms and dragged him toward the wagon, leaving Jared alone on the road.</p><p>Jared raked one hand through his dark hair and swore when the rain squeezed out by the motion trickled down his back.</p><p>Thirteen men, all of them wearing Jewels. He\u2019d pulled back the moment his psychic probe had touched the Sapphire shield and he realized it belonged to a Warlord Prince, so there hadn\u2019t been time to discern how dark the other Jewels were. The Sapphire was probably the strongest among them, but that didn\u2019t help much. If he were free to use the Red Jewels, he could take a Warlord wearing the Sapphire. But the Red were only one Jewel rank darker than the Sapphire. That wasn\u2019t enough of an advantage against a man who was, by his very nature, a killer. A Warlord Prince wasn\u2019t going to stand back and let anyone strike at his lighter-Jeweled followers. And if he was rogue, he had nothing to lose and everything to gain from a fast, vicious strike that would leave most of them helpless.</p><p>Except the Gray. If that Gray strength was unleashed . . .</p><p>Jared shuddered, his mind suddenly filled with the image of a chess piece scampering around the board, attacking, defending.</p><p>You\u2019re a slave. Remember that! You\u2019re aslave.</p><p>It should have mattered. It didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t stand by and watch the Gray Lady risk herself in a battle while there was one man among them who was still standing.</p><p>The Warlord Prince and his men came into sight a couple of minutes later. In the waning light and the rain, they were nothing more than dark, moving shapes, but he felt the power that swirled around them.</p><p>And the anger.</p><p>For a moment he just stood there, torn between his instincts to protect and the reality of his position. As a slave, he was forbidden to wear the Jewels, and without that reservoir of power, all he had was the strength that was always within him. Granted, it was a deeper well than most of the Blood had, but not enough against a Sapphire who could draw on his reserves and sustain the attack.</p><p>Jared turned away and kept a measured stride as he walked back to where the wagon had stopped. He felt a swift, light probe brush against his inner barriers and pushed back instinctively, letting the Warlord Prince know for certain that he would face one man who was a Jewel rank darker.</p><p>As he approached the wagon, he smiled grimly. Interesting how easily all the males had responded to the protective instinct. Brock and Randolf had placed themselves so they effectively blocked the narrow road. Ludicrous since they weren\u2019t wearing Jewels and didn\u2019t have any weapons. Then he caught the look in Brock\u2019s blue eyes and wondered what hidden things the guard might be carrying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Garth hovered near the wagon. The children and Polli were bunched next to the rear wheel. Thayne held the team of horses and anxiously watched Blaed, who was standing in the middle of the road, a peculiar, blank expression in his hazel eyes.</p><p>A jolt of realization swept through Jared, strong enough to take his breath away. Mother Night. Courteous, easygoing Blaed was a Warlord Prince.</p><p>As their eyes met, Jared felt some emotion\u2014pain? regret?\u2014flash through Blaed.</p> <p>Knowing he\u2019d have to talk to the younger man later\u2014if there was a later\u2014Jared nodded as he passed Blaed and continued to the wagon.</p><p>The shutters that gave access to the driving seat were wide-open. Shoulder to shoulder, Thera and the Gray Lady watched the road.</p><p>\u201cRogues or marauders?\u201d Thera asked as Jared reached them.</p><p>Jared looked back. The thirteen men had stopped, barely visible in the rain.</p><p>He almost asked what difference it made, but his attention was caught by the quickly hidden look of relief in the Gray Lady\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cRogues,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Thera narrowed her eyes and studied the Gray Lady. \u201cThey can be more vicious than marauders, and that\u2019s a Warlord Prince leading them.\u201d</p><p>Saying nothing, the Gray Lady backed away from the opening.</p><p>Thera gave Jared a puzzled look and followed.</p><p>A few seconds later, the shutters were slammed shut with enough force to startle the horses and the sharp, muffled voices told Jared a hot-tempered argument had started.</p><p>It ended just as abruptly.</p> <p>Jared\u2019s body tightened as his anger warred with his fear: anger because the two of them were indulging in a temper tantrum while all of them were at risk from an outside danger; and fear because the continued silence might mean one of them, namely Thera, was badly injured\u2014or dead.</p><p>The door opened a few minutes later. The Gray Lady emerged, followed by Thera, who was carrying one of the cloth bags they used to store spare clothes.</p><p>Jared breathed a sigh of relief when Thera appeared, only then aware of how badly his legs were shaking.</p><p>\u201cPolli, come with me,\u201d the Gray Lady said quietly.</p><p>No one moved. No one made a sound.</p><p>\u201cPolli, come with me,\u201d she said again, holding out her hand.</p><p>Polli looked at the Gray Lady, then looked at the rogues whose features were obscured by the rain. She backed away from the Gray Lady, shaking her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s my moon-time. I don\u2019t have to spread my legs when it\u2019s my moon-time.\u201d She continued backing away as the Gray Lady slowly advanced. When she bumped the front wheel, her hands closed fiercely around the spokes. \u201cIt\u2019s my moon-time,\u201d she wailed, slowly folding up until she was sitting on the muddy road, her hands still clutching the spokes.</p><p>Because he wanted to argue and didn\u2019t dare, Jared stepped back until he bumped into Blaed. Betrayal burned his throat and stomach. Despite all of his experience during the past nine years, he\u2019d begun to respect the Gray Lady. Now she was trading Polli\u2014Polli!\u2014to a pack of rogues so the rest of them could leave without a fight.</p> <p>What made it even worse was that he understood her reasoning. Rogues tended to be more vicious because they had a price on their heads. They were either escaped slaves, or they\u2019d broken their service contract with a Queen, or they\u2019d refused to serve when a Queen had chosen them for her court. But they were still men, and any of them who hadn\u2019t been castrated would enjoy having a female to mount.</p><p>And who else could she give them? Sharp-tongued Thera, who was intelligent and useful? Little Cathryn?</p><p>Bracing one hand on the wheel, the Gray Lady leaned over and spoke to Polli, her voice too low for Jared to hear. As she spoke, she brushed a hand over Polli\u2019s head.</p><p>She must have used a calming spell, he concluded bitterly as the fear gradually left Polli\u2019s face.</p><p>The Gray Lady straightened up slowly. Polli scrambled to her feet. Looking thoughtful, Thera hugged Polli and handed her the cloth sack. The Gray Lady linked her arm with Polli\u2019s and, walking with care, led her toward the rogues.</p><p>Bitch, Jared thought as he watched the two women.What lies did you tell her to make her so accepting ?</p><p>There was tightness in Brock\u2019s expression and anger in Randolf s eyes as the women passed them. Jared suspected that, if the trade didn\u2019t work, both men would be able to suppress their instincts sufficiently to let the Gray bitch fight her own battles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Blaed whispered.</p><p>Since the answer seemed obvious, Jared didn\u2019t bother to reply.</p><p>The Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince urged his horse forward, meeting the two women halfway between his men and the wagon. He dismounted slowly, his eyes never leaving the Gray Lady. His lean, hard body moved with a warrior\u2019s grace as he cautiously approached, one hand resting easily on the hilt of the knife attached to his belt.</p><p>Too far away to hear, and not daring to probe in case it produced a violent reaction, Jared watched the negotiations. After one long, searching look, the Warlord Prince ignored Polli and seemed to listen courteously to the Gray Lady\u2019s offer.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, what if the man wanted to inspect Thera and Cathryn before accepting the woman offered?</p><p>A long few minutes later, the Warlord Prince raised his left hand. Two of his men immediately came forward and dismounted. One of them took Polli\u2019s bag and tied it to his saddle. The other led Polli to the Warlord Prince\u2019s horse and helped her mount.</p><p>Jared narrowed his eyes. All the stories he\u2019d heard about rogues said they lived hard, desperate lives, so emotionally scarred by Queens and courts that they wouldn\u2019t yield to the distaff gender for any reason. Any female unfortunate enough to fall into their hands could only expect to be viciously used for the most basic and base needs.</p><p>So why did the Warlord who had helped Polli mount handle her so gently? Why was this Warlord Prince still listening courteously to the Gray Lady?</p><p>They talked for several more minutes. At one point, the Warlord Prince seemed aggravated enough that it took considerable effort to keep his temper leashed. At another point, he shook his head, his regret obvious. That\u2019s when the Gray Lady\u2019s shoulders sagged as if a great weight had settled on them.</p><p>When there didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say, the Warlord Prince took her hand and raised it to his lips.</p><p>As he watched, Jared felt the emotional ground shift beneath him again. That gesture wasn\u2019t a meaningless salute as it would have been in a court. A rogue Warlord Prince who wore Jewels as dark as the Sapphire wouldn\u2019t bother with empty gestures. And it wasn\u2019t mockery.</p><p>Why would a rogue deliberately show his respect for a Queen?</p><p>Jared turned that thought over and over while the Gray Lady slowly limped back to the wagon. Her face looked pinched and pained, and she seemed more frail than she had a few minutes ago.</p><p>Brock and Randolf stepped aside as she reached them. If ordered to, they would have assisted her, but that subtle defiance\u2014forcing a Queen to order every small thing she wanted from a slave\u2014was the only safe way for a man to show disrespect. He couldn\u2019t be faulted because he did exactly what he\u2019d been told to do. He just didn\u2019t do anything beyond that.</p><p>Jared watched her approach, knowing he\u2019d have to make a decision within the next few seconds. He\u2019d declared himself the dominant male. If he acted like a slave and stepped aside as Brock and Randolf had done, the others would accept that decision and act accordingly. If he responded as his instincts demanded and helped her, the others would, grudgingly, accept that, too.</p><p>The mental shove struck him without warning, the anger behind it hitting his inner barriers like heavy surf. He turned his head and met the Warlord\u2019s Prince\u2019s stare.</p><p>*She deserves the best you can give her,* the man said, using a Sapphire spear thread.</p><p>*She deserves whatever she can squeeze out of a slave,* Jared snapped, unwilling to let this stranger sense how much her betrayal of trust hurt him.</p><p>They stared at each other, the other rogues and slaves forgotten.</p><p>*It seems I misjudged you,* the man sneered. *Despite your Jewels, you don\u2019t have balls enough and you aren\u2019t man enough to serve her.*</p><p>The Warlord Prince strode to his horse and mounted behind Polli, his contempt apparent in every line of his body. At his signal, his men turned their horses and rode back down the road.</p><p>Polli leaned to one side and looked back once.</p><p>The Warlord Prince didn\u2019t look back at all.</p><p>Jared shook with anger. How dare that son of a whoring bitch judge him? It was one thing not to do more than what was demanded in order to make it clear he wasn\u2019t there by his own choice. It was quite another to have a stranger, a man who hadn\u2019t had the balls to remain with the Queen who had chosen him, say he wasn\u2019t worthy of serving.</p><p>He turned on his heel. In three strides, he caught up to the Gray Lady at the same moment Thera reached her. Thera didn\u2019t look at him. She couldn\u2019t have picked up the argument since it had been conducted on a Sapphire spear thread, so the implied disapproval was her own judgment. Stung, he reacted by grabbing the Gray Lady\u2019s arm hard enough to make her gasp. He loosened his hold without apologizing for causing her pain and struggled to keep his temper leashed while he and Thera assisted the Gray Lady to the wagon\u2019s door.</p><p>She tried to raise her right leg to step up, but the knee wouldn\u2019t bend.</p><p>Thera swore under her breath.</p><p>Whatever the Gray Lady might have said in response remained unsaid because she noticed the children solemnly watching her. Shadows filled her gray eyes as her gaze moved from Eryk to Corry to Cathryn and, finally, lingered on Tomas.</p><p>\u201cAt least one of them is safe now,\u201d she said so quietly Jared almost missed the words. Then she looked back at him. \u201cA mile or so down the road, there\u2019s a lane on the right-hand side. Follow the lane for another mile. On the left-hand side, there\u2019ll be an entrance to a clearing that has some kind of a shelter. We\u2019ll camp there tonight.\u201d</p><p>A lot of orders were implied in those words, the main one being that he would lead them to the shelter. If he was going to force her to acknowledge the enslavement instead of pretending he was serving her as if he were a free man, now was the time to make it clear she was going to have to give specific orders for each action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pain and weariness in her face, the shadows in her eyes, and the anxiety he could sense in her stopped him as much as the Warlord Prince\u2019s condemnation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Jared said quietly, making sure his voice remained neutral and in no way implied loyalty. He wasn\u2019t certain she deserved loyalty, no matter what that rogue bastard thought, but he was cold, wet, and hungry, and no defiance right now was worth delaying the moment when they could eat and rest. But, Hell\u2019s fire, seeing her in pain chewed at him until he wanted to lash out at something, anything, until her pain went away.</p><p>Leading with her left leg, the Gray Lady climbed the steps into the wagon. Thera glanced sharply at Jared and said nothing as she followed the Gray Lady inside.</p> <p>If the other men noticed an edge in his voice when he gave the order to move on, no one mentioned it. They didn\u2019t question his insistence that Cathryn and Corry sit on the driving seat and Eryk and Tomas ride the saddle horses tied to the back of the wagon since it was the most sensible way of keeping an eye on the children. Nor did they question his order that Brock and Randolf take up a rearguard position. And one look at his face made them swallow any comments they might have made about the oddly protective way Garth walked beside the wagon instead of rambling ahead as usual. He had made the decision that, at least for the time being, they weren\u2019t going to act like slaves, and no one was going to challenge that decision.</p><p>Taking point, Jared walked ahead of the wagon, trying to sort through his conflicting emotions. He\u2019dseen the Gray Lady hand a slave over to a pack of rogues, and he couldn\u2019t ignore the bitterness it produced in him any more than he could ignore the way his protective instincts kept pushing at him. But that Warlord Prince kissing her hand, making that deliberate gesture of respect. Was there a hidden reason for handing Polli over to that rogue bastard? Maybe not hidden, just not obvious. There were things about the Gray Lady that he didn\u2019t understand\u2014yet. That made him uneasy.</p><p>And where were the rest of them going if a pack of rogues was considered the safer choice?</p><p>Blaed had been walking a couple of steps behind him for several minutes. Jared waved him forward, no longer able to ignore the younger man\u2019s unhappiness or his own curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThayne knew about you,\u201d Jared said, keeping his voice conversational.</p> <p>Blaed shrugged, an action that seemed more resigned than unconcerned. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends since we were boys, even though he\u2019s a couple of years older than me, so he would have known.\u201d</p><p>And had been enough of a friend to say nothing. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Blaed said quickly, his hazel eyes holding a plea for acceptance\u2014and a hint of defiance that was more in keeping with his true nature.</p><p>You can\u2019t help being what you are, Jared thought as he looked at the young Warlord Prince,any more than men like Brock and Randolf can help being wary of what you are . \u201cSomeone else put a spell on you to hide your . . . ?\u201d His voice trailed off as he tried to think of some way to phrase it that wouldn\u2019t sound insulting.</p><p>Blaed bit his lip and nodded. \u201cHe said a Warlord Prince my age, being used as a pleasure slave, would be twisted out of all recognition or have the heart torn out of him.</p><p>He said I hadn\u2019t come into my strength yet and had too much potential to be wasted that way.\u201c Blaed gulped. \u201dSo he put this spell around me. He said it would mask what I was as long as I was around Warlords, but another Warlord Prince\u2019s presence could break it.\u201c</p> <p>He. A male who could create a spell so subtle no one had realized it existed. No blurring of Blaed\u2019s psychic scent, no sense of Craft. Just a masking of an essential difference between Blaed and the rest of them.</p><p>Jared felt a chill run up his spine that had nothing to do with the falling temperature or the rain. He studied Blaed as if he\u2019d never seen him before. A good-looking face that would mature into a handsome one. A well-toned body that needed to fill out a little more. Medium-brown hair that was long enough for a woman to run her hands through it. Hazel eyes that reflected a temperament that hadn\u2019t sharpened yet.</p><p>Looks meant nothing. It was the potential within the flesh that had to be considered carefully\u2014and, also, who would recognize that potential and want to shape and hone it into a fine, sharp weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou know the Sadist.\u201d Jared didn\u2019t make it a question.</p><p>Blaed paled a little. \u201cI think he\u2019s the reason I ended up at Raej so quickly. My training was . . . accelerated.\u201d</p><p>Jared snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet the part of the training you were supposed to be learning got accelerated, too.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>Jared\u2019s lips curled up in a twisted smile. \u201cHe trained me, too.\u201d</p> <p>There was no need to put into words that uneasy mixture of revulsion and excitement, the embarrassment of feeling like a voyeur when the young men who were being trained watched an experienced pleasure slave play a woman\u2019s body until mild arousal became blinding heat and she screamed throughout a prolonged climax. No need to talk about the shame they\u2019d felt because they had stiffened and ached for release while Sadi rose from the bed as flaccid as he\u2019d been before the first kiss. No need to talk about the private lessons, those times when that bored, cold expression that so effectively masked the Sadist\u2019s thoughts and feelings was set aside and they\u2019d seen enough of the man beneath to feel trust and terror.</p><p>\u201cI take it there wasn\u2019t a Warlord Prince serving your previous Queen,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cOnly him.\u201d Blaed shrugged. \u201cMinor Queens usually can\u2019t lure a Warlord Prince to serve in their courts. And Territory Queens usually won\u2019t let a minor Queen keep an enslaved Warlord Prince because he\u2019s too hard to control.\u201d</p><p>Minor Queens usually didn\u2019t get a chance to hold the Sadist\u2019s leash, either\u2014unless the High Priestess of Hayll was rewarding them for some reason.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in that court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months altogether. He was there for the first four, then the contract that that Queen had with Dorothea SaDiablo ended and he was \u2018loaned\u2019 to another Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueens don\u2019t usually give up a freshly trained pleasure slave,\u201d Jared said thoughtfully. \u201cEven if he is a Warlord Prince. Shedid know you were a Warlord Prince when she acquired you?\u201d</p><p>Blaed nodded. \u201cAlthough once he put the spell around me, everyone seemed to forget that. After he was gone, she became uneasy about using me, for no reason I could figure out, and sent me to Raej.\u201d</p><p>There could have been other spells Sadi had wrapped around Blaed to cause that uneasiness and ensure that the young man would end up at Raej quickly\u2014spells the Sadist wouldn\u2019t have mentioned.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared said quietly, thinking out loud. \u201cWhy would he go through the effort of making sure you ended up at Raej, where you\u2019d just be sold to another witch?\u201d</p><p>Blaed hesitated. \u201cHe was there when I was being sold. When it got down to his Lady and the Gray Lady being the only ones still bidding on me, his Lady stopped bidding all of a sudden. I think he ... arranged . . . that so that I would end up with the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>Jared swore under his breath. The Sadist and the Gray Lady. What in the name of Hell was he supposed to think aboutthat ?</p><p>Nothing, for the moment. Finding that clearing before they lost the light was the first priority.</p><p>They reached the lane. Hoping it was wide enough to accommodate the wagon, Jared waved at Thayne, who was leading the horses, and then pointed to the lane.</p><p>Thayne waved back.</p><p>As Jared and Blaed walked down the lane, looking for the entrance to the clearing, Jared thought of one thing that would change now that everyone knew Blaed was a Warlord Prince. \u201cSince a Warlord Prince is a higher caste than a Warlord, that makes you the domin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Blaed said sharply. \u201cI wear the Opal; you wear the Red. That still makes you dominant as far as Jewel rank is concerned. And you\u2019re older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by that much,\u201d Jared muttered.</p><p>\u201cBy enough. And you made the Offering to the Darkness before you were made a slave, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201dBut you didn\u2019t , Jared added silently. Which might explain why Blaed was willing to follow rather than lead. Maybe, despite Warlord Princes beingborn Warlord Princes, they had to mature into that temperament in the same way they matured into their full psychic strength. If Blaed had been a few years older or had made the Offering before he\u2019d been enslaved, he probably wouldn\u2019t have yielded so easily to another male regardless of which one of them wore the darker Jewel.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Blaed said, confirming Jared\u2019s speculations, \u201cyou haven\u2019t done anything I would have done differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you approve,\u201d Jared said sourly.</p><p>Blaed kept his eyes on the trees and thick clumps of bushes on the left-hand side of the lane. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to become a battleground the way you are. Maybe I\u2019m just trying to avoid that day for as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Jared stopped walking. Blaed stopped and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Jared said, choking on the words. \u201cYou all know, and yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Blaed said. \u201cThe rest of them don\u2019t know. They see what you\u2019ve chosen to let them see\u2014a dominant male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m standing on the edge of the same battleground.\u201d Blaed smiled bitterly. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a slave, I would\u2019ve made the Offering a couple of months ago and settled into what I am instead of trying to keep it leashed. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the same with you. My father would say you haven\u2019t grown into your skin yet.\u201d</p><p>Instead of responding to that remark, Jared started walking. He wouldn\u2019t think of it now.Couldn\u2019t think of it now\u2014 especially because he felt the wild stranger stirring deep inside him.</p><p>But he was so shaken by Blaed\u2019s words, he didn\u2019t notice the Sapphire psychic wire strung across the lane until he tripped over it and landed hard in the mud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A moment later, Blaed let out a shout that had Jared scrambling to his feet, expecting an ambush of some kind. When nothing happened, he swore with all the creative violence he could muster.</p><p>\u201cDo that again without a good reason and I\u2019ll break your neck,\u201d Jared snarled.</p><p>Blaed ignored that remark and pointed to thickly entwined bushes that didn\u2019t look any different than the others. \u201cThere\u2019s a gate there. Or something. Some of the bushes shimmered when you tripped.\u201d</p> <p>They tried every opening or unlocking spell they could think of. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a Warlord Prince put a Sapphire trip wire across the lane?\u201d Jared asked Blaed.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t meant as a trip wire,\u201d Blaed replied absently as he continued to study the bushes. \u201cYou were supposed to sense it and stop. Since he went through the effort of making sure we stopped here, that means the entrance to the clearing is here. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked around. If Blaed was right, the key to getting into the clearing had to be nearby.</p><p>Walking back to the place where he\u2019d tripped, Jared studied both sides of the lane. Opposite the bushes Blaed said had shimmered was a tumble of boulders as tall as an average man, and furry with moss.</p> <p>Something about their shape tugged at him, disappearing when he took a couple of steps closer. He stepped back, and kept stepping back, until he was on the other side of the lane. He looked at the stones again and swore silently.</p><p>He was either losing his mind or his self-control, because the way the boulders had tumbled together, they looked like a woman clothed in moss rising up from among the other stones.</p><p>Smiling bitterly, Jared crossed the lane, then reached out and cupped a stone breast.</p><p>Polli\u2019s face flashed through his mind.</p><p>His fingers bit into the moss as another face filled his mind. It wavered between young and old, but there was no mistaking those hard gray eyes. If any woman had stone breasts to match a stone heart, it was the Gray Lady.</p><p>He felt the slight tingle of a spell being keyed. A moment later, Blaed let out a yip of surprise.</p> <p>Jared twisted around, his eyes widening as a section of the bushes changed into a simple wood pole strung with vines.</p><p>He hurried away from the boulders before Blaed turned to look at him, not really sure why he felt the need to keep access to this place a secret from the rest of them.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you unkey the illusion spell?\u201d Blaed asked.</p><p>The wagon came around a curve in the lane, saving Jared from having to think of a lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check things out,\u201d Jared told Blaed as they lifted the wooden pole off its supporting posts and laid it aside. \u201c\u2018You bring the others in.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a deep breath and cautiously followed the straight path that led to the clearing. It was barely wide enough for the pedlar\u2019s wagon and longer than he expected. His careful psychic probes didn\u2019t tell him anything. That didn\u2019t make him feel easier. If that rogue had been able to persuade a Black Widow to make the illusion spell to hide the entrance to the clearing, were there other illusions he wasn\u2019t able to detect?</p><p>Passing between the two stone posts that marked the end of the path, Jared stepped into the clearing. He waited a moment, straining all of his senses to detect anything that might be a danger to them, then sighed with relief when nothing happened.</p><p>The clearing itself was fairly large\u2014a couple of acres surrounded by trees and thick undergrowth on three sides, backed by a steep, rocky hill. On the left side of the clearing was a corral and a small stone building built into the hill. It was large enough to shelter half a dozen animals in bad weather, or at least keep feed and gear dry. Also built into the hill was a one-story stone building. Between the building and the corral was a small wooden structure that probably contained the privy hole.</p> <p>Jared couldn\u2019t summon up enough interest for whatever else the clearing might contain. As soon as he figured out how to rekey the illusion spell on the gate, he was going to spend his thoughts and energy on nothing but getting dry, getting fed, and going to sleep.</p><p>The wagon passed him, its wheels almost scraping the stone posts that marked the clearing boundary. The other slaves followed behind the saddle horses.</p><p>As he passed Jared, Blaed said, \u201cI put the pole back in place,\u201d then pointed a thumb over his shoulder.</p><p>Jared\u2019s breath huffed out in an impatient sigh as he waited for Garth who was, for the first time, trailing behind everyone instead of roaming ahead.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Garth,\u201d Jared said, waving the big man forward.</p><p>Garth stopped two yards away from the stone posts, and shifted his weight from one foot to the other. His head swiveled in the opposite rhythm as he kept eyeing the posts.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jared snapped.</p><p>Garth raised his hands, then let them slap against his thighs. He seemed to want to say something, but he made no sound. Finally, he let out a low, distressed cry and bolted past the posts.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Jared muttered, watching Garth trot toward the others. The big man stumbled a little every time he looked anxiously over his shoulder at Jared.</p><p>Jared turned his back on the group and stared uneasily at the stone posts with their rounded tops. Were they supposed to be a rogue\u2019s idea of a bitter joke or a blatant symbol of male strength?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to decide because, seconds later, he realized Garth must have understood something about the posts that he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>A psychic storm swiftly began to surround the clearing. Jared felt it hum along his nerves and scratch at his bones, felt the pressure of power that would build and build until its destructive release tore through anyone who wasn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the onslaught. Hell\u2019s fire. There must be a spell set in the posts to trigger all the defensive spells around the clearing if some key wasn\u2019t used within a certain amount of time. Butwhat key?Where ? That rogue bastard hadn\u2019t mentioned this. Had the omission been deliberate?</p><p>With his heart beating so hard it pounded in his temples, Jared looked at the wagon pulled up close to the stone building and the people standing near it. There wasn\u2019t time for them to run across the clearing and down the path before the defensive spells triggered and the psychic storm hit.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been descending instinctively to the level of the Red until he felt the wild stranger\u2019s presence as keenly as if he\u2019d stepped into its lair. And, in a sense, he had. Here he could tap his full strength. Here his power was raw, primal\u2014and savage. Here it belonged to the part of himself he had tried to push away and deny.</p><p>Now he reached for the strength of the Red, regardless of the cost, using it to quickly probe the gathering storm.</p><p>Layer upon layer upon layer of protection spells, defensive spells, spells honed to destroy flesh but not hurt the land. White, Tiger Eye, Rose, Purple Dusk, Opal, Sapphire. Strength woven into strength.</p><p>Jared probed further, fully aware of how their time was running out. He almost withdrew, but decided to check the last couple of layers of spells just to be certain his idea would work.</p><p>Itshould work. If he formed a Red shield around everyone, and if the Gray Lady formed a Gray shield just behind it, theyshould be able to withstand the storm. They might lose the horses, but even all the spells combined shouldn\u2019t be able to completely destroy a Gr\u2014</p><p>As his Red probe touched the last layer, his heart stuttered. He forgot how to breathe.</p><p>They weren\u2019t going to survive.</p><p>Forming a tight net above all the other layers of strength was the Ebon-gray, the second-darkest Jewel.</p><p>The only Ebon-gray in the Realm of Terreille was Lucivar Yaslana, a half-breed Eyrien Warlord Prince who was Daemon Sadi\u2019s half brother.</p><p>He\u2019d only heard stories about Yaslana. They made the Sadist sound like an amiable man. He didn\u2019t want to imagine what had been added to that Ebon-gray spell, but he was certain it would be able to smash through Red and Gray shields\u2014and smash through their minds as well.</p><p>A shriek of terror and an anguished cry made him focus on the physical world.</p><p>Little Cathryn was doubled over, clutching her head. So was Tomas. Thera and the Gray Lady were reaching for the children.</p><p>Savage rage flooded through him, cooled by a growing fear as all the power around the clearing began to constrict and press down on their minds. He didn\u2019t feel anything yet except a pressure coming from beyond himself, but the weakest of them would be the first to be destroyed. And the weakest were the children and the two adults who were broken\u2014Garth and Thera.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, the rain had drowned his wits. The Warlord Prince would have told the Gray Lady! Not enough time to reach her physically, and no time to worry about breaking rules. He directed a Red communication thread at her. *Lady... *</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She was holding on to Tomas, probably shielding the boy\u2019s mind with her strength.</p><p>Which was no reason not to answer him!</p><p>Jared tried again. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful! She wore the Gray. Of course she could hear the Red!</p><p>Painfully aware he was losing precious seconds, he tried a Sapphire thread. When he got no answer, he used a Green communication thread, putting a bit of temper in the sending. *Lady.*</p><p>The Gray Lady whipped around to face him.</p><p>*How do we quiet the protection spells?* Jared demanded.</p><p>Her fear pounded against him. *He said you\u2019d know the key. I thought he toldyou.*</p><p>Jared\u2019s mind blanked for a second. *Why in the name of Hell would he thinkI\u2019d know?*</p><p>*I don\u2019t know.*</p><p>With the words, Jared caught a whiff of memory from her.Your Warlord will know the key .</p><p>Your Warlord. The words assumed a bond a slave would never dream of, an honorable bond of service between a male and his Queen.</p><p>Damn that rogue bastard to the bowels of Hell, was this some kind oftest !</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. If they were going to survive, he had to stop thinking like a slave and start thinking like a Warlord.</p><p>Jared turned back to the posts. Garth had sensed\u2014or understood\u2014something about them, and it made sense that the key wouldn\u2019t be hard to reach if the rogues weren\u2019t going to put themselves at risk every time they entered the clearing. Which meant ithad to be here! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn you, he thought as he felt the wild stranger pushing at him.Damn you.

A moment later, it retreated, leaving him feeling raw and viciously clear-minded.</p><p>Sweating heavily despite the cold and the rain, Jared created a large ball of witchlight.</p> <p>On the facing sides of the posts, someone had carved the thirteen ancient symbols of power deep into the stone\u2014six on the left post, seven on the right.</p><p>How was he supposed to choose the right three?</p><p>Jared paused, then shook his head. Of course it was three.</p><p>He found the symbol for male on the left stone. His finger hesitated over it before moving to the triangle beneath it. Using Craft, he traced the triangle\u2019s deep lines with one finger, filling them with witchlight.</p><p>In a court, the male triangle of Consort, Steward, and Master of the Guard formed the tightest bond with the Queen. They were companions, advisors, protectors.</p> <p>None of the other symbols on the left post pulled him, so he turned to the right. His finger traced the outline of the symbol for female.</p><p>The male triangle was the core of a court, but the Queen, the female, was always its heart.</p><p>He sank to his knees and traced the last symbol carved into the post, the Blood\u2019s most revered symbol\u2014the symbol for the Darkness.</p><p>The Blood honored the Darkness because it meant endings and beginnings; it was the fertile dark of land and womb that nurtured the seeds of life; it was the psychic river the Blood came from and returned to; it was the abyss the Self descended into to reach its own strength; it was the vastness that contained the spiderweb-shaped psychic roadways called the Winds. It was all those things, and more.</p><p>As the last line filled with witchlight, Jared felt the jolt of power funneling into the stone posts. The witchlight in the symbols became so bright he had to squint. It flashed once and then faded, the little bit of power he\u2019d used to create it already expended.</p><p>In that moment after the flash, Jared saw a pale triangle form between the three symbols before it, too, faded.</p> <p>The protection spells quieted. The psychic storm quickly dissipated. Rekeyed, the illusion spell turned a wood pole strung with vines into thick, unpassable undergrowth.</p><p>Jared stayed on his knees, too tired and shaken to stand up. He sank back on his heels, his head bent, his hands resting loosely on his thighs. This exhaustion wasn\u2019t caused by draining too much of his power. He used more than that for everyday living. It wasn\u2019t even caused by the sharp fear he\u2019d felt.</p><p>For a few moments when the wild stranger had filled him, he had felt so alive and whole. Now he felt empty and hollowed out again, and it cut at him. But he wasn\u2019t sure he was ready to fully embrace that part of himself, to bind himself to that kind of responsibility, and until he was . . .</p><p>Strong hands gripped his arms and pulled him up. Blaed smiled solemnly. Brock looked respectful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside,\u201d Brock said.</p><p>\u201cThe horses.\u201d Jared\u2019s voice sounded thick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help Thayne and Randolf with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough,\u201d Brock said sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough,\u201d Blaed agreed quietly.</p><p>Jared gave in, needing their support more than he wanted to admit.</p><p>As they walked toward the one-story stone building, Garth hurried up to them, stopping just short of barreling into Jared. The big man studied Jared\u2019s face for a moment, then made a sound like a grunt of satisfaction, and hurried away.</p><p>Thayne smiled shyly and raised his hand in a casual salute.</p><p>Randolf stood by the corral, watching Garth, his expression unreadable.</p><p>Jared was too tired for Randolfs moods, but he couldn\u2019t quite dismiss the man\u2019s animosity for the broken Warlord.</p><p>\u201cWe should pay more attention to Garth,\u201d Jared said quietly as they neared the building.</p><p>Brock made an exasperated sound. \u201cGarth\u2019s not that bad. It could\u2019ve happened to any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew about those protection spells before the rest of us did.\u201d</p><p>A brittle silence followed Jared\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cHe was the last one,\u201d Jared insisted. \u201cNothing started to happen while he was still on the path, so I\u2019d guess there\u2019s something built into those spells to make sure all the rogues have time to get into the clearing. It\u2019s the last person in who has to rekey the illusion spell in order to stop the defensive spells from triggering. If I\u2019d paid attention to his distress, we would have had more time to figure out the key before the storm came down on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Blaed protested, keeping his voice low.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is Garth seems to understand some things. Maybe it\u2019s a holdover from his training. Hell\u2019s fire, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019d be fools not to pay more attention to what sets him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Brock said. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Brock and Blaed released their supportive hold on Jared\u2019s arms.</p><p>Jared walked toward the Gray Lady, alone.</p><p>In the light coming through the open door, her gray eyes looked almost black from exhaustion. Her voice quavered when she quietly asked him if he was all right. She looked frail, and he suspected her pride was the only thing keeping her on her feet.</p><p>Her frailty made him want to push her until she struck out and proved she was still strong and powerful.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Warlord,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI live to serve, Lady,\u201d he replied, his voice lightly laced with bitterness to hide another emotion he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. She turned and retreated into the room as quickly as she could manage with her injured knee.</p><p>Jared rocked back as if she\u2019d slapped him. Shame filled him until he wasn\u2019t sure he could stand beneath the weight of it. He tried to dredge up enough anger to burn away the shame, but it wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Jared looked behind him. Brock and Blaed had discreetly disappeared to finish the chores.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d Tomas stood in the doorway. \u201cYou coming in or you going to stand there letting the rain in until Thera gets mad enough to hit you with a skillet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would help,\u201d Jared muttered as he followed the boy inside and firmly closed the door.</p><p>Silence strained tempers already frayed by fear and exhaustion, broken only by the scrape of utensils against plates and murmured requests to pass something that couldn\u2019t easily be reached. They choked on the food that had been bought with a young witch\u2019s life, but they ate it. Their bodies needed fuel. Landens might envy the Blood\u2019s magical powers, but they didn\u2019t understand the price that went with it; didn\u2019t understand how fiercely that inner fire could burn, especially in those who wore the darker Jewels; didn\u2019t understand how quickly it could consume the body that housed it if no other fuel was available.</p><p>So they ate in silence, never meeting each other\u2019s eyes, each one wondering whose life might pay for the next meal, the next shelter.</p><p>Jared sighed with relief when the meal finally ended.</p><p>Thera picked up her plate and walked over to the kitchen area of the large single room to begin cleaning up. Within moments, the only ones left sitting on the benches on either side of the long wooden table were Jared and the Gray Lady.</p><p>He\u2019d deliberately sat at the opposite end on the opposite side, as far away from her as he could get. Now, with the others dallying with the last chores in order to stay away from her and nothing but the long table separating them, he looked at her for the first time since she\u2019d met him at the doorway and thanked him.</p><p>After a minute, she raised her head and met his cold stare.</p><p>There was nothing in her gray eyes. Nothing at all. As if all the fire in her had been doused.</p><p>Then she flinched and fixed her eyes on the chipped blue jug filled with autumn wildflowers that sat on the table.</p><p>Why? Jared wanted to ask her. He could understand that Sapphire-Jeweled bastard riding back here ahead of them to create the psychic wire in order to make sure they found the clearing. But why had the man taken the time to fill a jug with flowers? Because he was certain the Warlord Prince had done just that.</p><p>He understood the rogues giving up the shelter and providing supplies in exchange for Polli, even if that son of a whoring bitchhadn\u2019t given them the key for the protection spells. But the flowers gnawed at him. They were a sign of affection, something a man gave a woman to lift her spirits. Was the Warlord Princethat grateful to get a female? Or was there another reason for the gesture?</p><p>Jared watched her reach out and delicately touch the petals of a dark-orange flower. He didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>His bitter reply when she had thanked him had wounded her deeply. It shouldn\u2019t have mattered, but it did\u2014because a rogue who should have hated her for owning slaves had given her flowers.</p><p>She rose slowly, her hands braced on the table to support her.</p><p>Jared clenched his fists and forced himself to stay seated as she slowly, painfully, limped toward the door.</p><p>The other men glanced at her, glanced at him, and quickly looked away. He was the dominant male. His refusal to help her amounted to an order for the rest of them, and only a direct order from her would countermand it.</p><p>She had reached the door before Tomas spoke up. \u201cLady? Aren\u2019t you going to tell us the next part of the story?\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to look at her. Her eyes were closed. Pain deepened the lines in her face.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said in a husky voice. She stepped out into the rain, hobbling over slippery ground to the wagon.</p><p>Guilt stabbed at Jared. As glad as they were to get away from her, she was even more relieved to get away from them. A Queen should never feel that way about the males who served her.</p><p>Jared shook his head. Hedidn\u2019t serve her. She had bought him. He owed her no loyalty. No matter how many back roads they traveled, they\u2019d have to come close to the Winds sooner or later. That\u2019s when he\u2019d try to slip the leash. To go home long enough to see his family, and talk to Reyna. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dishes were washed and put away about the same time the thin mattresses, blankets, and pillows that they\u2019d found in the cupboards that filled the left side wall were spread out over the floor.</p><p>As Jared started pulling off his boots, he noticed Thera\u2019s longing glance at the hipbath and folded screen that stood in one corner of the room. He understood the longing. He\u2019d been wet for three days, but that didn\u2019t mean he felt clean.</p><p>Shaking her head, Thera picked up the kettle heating on the stove, dropped a gauze herb bag into two mugs, and filled them with hot water.</p> <p>Jared shoved his foot back into the boot and went over to her. \u201cWe could move the hipbath over near the stove for warmth,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much Craft to heat the water, and the screen would give you privacy.\u201d</p><p>Thera didn\u2019t look at him. Picking up a spoon, she poked at the herb bags. \u201cIs that how it works among your people? Giving one woman an extra dollop of courtesy evens out giving another one none at all?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s temper flared, but he kept his voice even. \u201cYou approve of what she did today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven good Queens sometimes have to make bitter choices.\u201d Thera lifted the herb bags out of the mugs, set them in a small bowl, and picked up the mugs. \u201cStep aside, Lord Jared. I want to turn in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out to the wagon,\u201d he said accusingly.</p> <p>Her green eyes became shadowed with something that sent a shiver up his spine, reminding him that, even when she was broken, it was wiser not to tangle with a Black Widow.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to try and stop me?\u201d she asked too gently.</p><p>Jared stepped aside. When she closed the door behind her, he let out the breath he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding.</p><p>A few minutes later, little Cathryn realized she was the only female in a room full of men.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Thera?\u201d she asked, her eyes darting around the room as if looking for a way to escape.</p><p>\u201cThera\u2019s staying in the wagon,\u201d Jared said soothingly. \u201cShe and the Gray Lady need to be alone tonight.\u201d</p> <p>The men stirred, instinctively wanting to ease Cathryn\u2019s fear while bitterly knowing there was nothing they could do without escalating that fear into full-scale panic.</p><p>Corry worried his lower lip while he watched Cathryn. Then he pushed his mattress over until it touched hers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, Cathryn. I\u2019ll sleep right beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Cathryn said shrilly. \u201cYou\u2019re a boy.\u201d</p><p>Blaed cleared his throat. \u201cSince Corry\u2019s taken on the duties of an escort, it seems to me he\u2019s entitled to claim Escort\u2019s Privilege.\u201d</p><p>Cathryn looked uncertain.</p><p>Corry looked hopeful.</p><p>Eryk and Tomas looked envious.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes. Sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let them start squabbling. Cathryn couldn\u2019t handle it, and the rest of them wouldn\u2019t tolerate it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Cathryn finally asked.</p><p>Blaed tugged at his collar as if it had suddenly become too tight. \u201cWell, it means that, when a Lady is feeling a bit nervous for any reason, it\u2019s an escort\u2019s duty and privilege to stay nearby, especially when she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cathryn said doubtfully.</p><p>Blaed put one hand over his heart. \u201cReally. My cousin served as an escort, and he explained it to me.\u201d</p><p>No one spoke. No one dared move until Cathryn lay down on the mattress and shyly smiled while Corry tucked the blanket around her.</p><p>His eyes shining with pride and pleasure, Corry got settled on his own mattress, as close to the edge as possible.</p><p>Jared looked away to hide his smile. He\u2019d bet his boots that, by morning, those two would be curled up together like two puppies.</p><p>The rest of them settled down. The candlelights that sat on a couple of small tables tucked against the walls were extinguished, but the fire in the hearth still provided enough light to see by.</p><p>Jared pulled off his boots and set them beside his mattress. Tucking the blanket around him, he vanished the rest of his clothes and sighed with pleasure. With luck, he\u2019d be up early enough to wash before Cathryn woke up, before Thera and the Gray Lady stirred.</p><p>Despite his fatigue, sleep was a long time coming. The events of the day kept chasing each other, refusing to be stilled. He thought about the pride and pleasure in Corry\u2019s eyes, thought about Thera\u2019s remark about courtesy. No matter how he justified it, he couldn\u2019t dismiss the knowledge that he, not Thera, should have been sleeping in the wagon tonight. He was the experienced pleasure slave. This would have been a perfect opportunity for the Gray Lady to use him without calling attention to it. And he could have used those private hours to learn more about her, which was essential if he wanted to find a way around the Invisible Ring, to ease his way home.</p><p>Too late now.</p><p>Jared looked at the jug of flowers sitting on the wooden table and couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, somehow, he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Krelis settled into a corner of the small carriage, soothed by the driver\u2019s murmurs and the horse\u2019s clip-clop rhythm. He could have hired one of the horseless coaches that were starting to fill up Draega\u2019s wide streets and replace this quainter way of traveling, but they never felt quite right. Besides, there was something a little distasteful about using Craft to perform a task previously done by an animal. Oh, he\u2019d heard the arguments in favor of the new coaches\u2014no dependence on an animal\u2019s well-being, cleaner streets, work for the coach drivers who had gotten tired of draining so much of their strength so that their inferiors could ride the Winds\u2014but seeing another connection lost between the Blood and the land sometimes made him feel like he was standing in front of a closed window, trying to feel the wind.</p><p>Krelis shut his eyes. He was just tired and impatient for news\u2014and troubled by the High Priestess\u2019s coy remarks about giving him a little more help. He understood her wanting to eliminate an enemy whose existence continuously undermined her plans for Terreille, but to sidestep explaining the arrangements she had made . . .</p><p>He understood that, too. She was probably still feeling raw about the last Master\u2019s betrayal. It would take some time to earn her trust.</p><p>Besides, the first rule of the court was, Dorothea was never wrong.</p><p>Even with that interference, it shouldn\u2019t take the tame marauder bands long to find the Gray-Jeweled bitch. The spelled brass buttons he\u2019d given his pet would lead them right to her. And they, in turn, would send him the buttons they found so that he could extract any messages his pet might have added.</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t take much longer.</p><p>Then, maybe, he could get some sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Refreshed by a quick morning bath and a change of clothes, and fortified with strong, heavily sugared coffee, Jared stepped outside and wondered which would be more dangerous: asking Thera if she intended to make breakfast or having the men combine their limited cooking skills and risk her sharp-tongued wrath if the food was only marginally edible. Although, with Polli gone, Thera would need more help than Cathryn could give her, and no one expected a Queen to do chores, even though the Gray Lady had surprised them all by doing her share before she injured her knee. So Thera\u2019s new helper would have to be male, and she\u2019d just have to choke on it.</p><p>Jared smiled. Maybe they could draw straws every morning. Short straw got to help Thera for the day. That would certainly start the mornings off with a kick. And since everyone would have an equal chance, no one could resent him for getting stuck with the duty.</p><p>Still smiling, he started walking toward the pedlar\u2019s wagon. The air had a crisp, clean bite to it, and the sky, for the first time in days, held no threat of rain.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jared noticed Tomas trotting toward him from the direction of the privy hole. He raised his hand in greeting, but his smile faded when he saw the boy\u2019s worried expression.</p><p>Spiders and other insects were to be expected in a little wooden structure that enclosed a hole in the ground, although the herb bags that were hung in the corners not only freshened the air but seemed to discourage crawling company. Even though he hadn\u2019t seen them, there were probably mice around\u2014maybe even rats.</p><p>Jared stiffened. Ordinary rats could be enough of a nuisance, but disturbing a nest of viper rats could be deadly. And young boys weren\u2019t always sensible.</p><p>He could still feel the sharp fear that had jabbed at him the summer his brother Davin had been bitten by a viper rat; could still remember how the venom had caused the six-year-old boy\u2019s forearm to swell grotesquely. Even with Reyna\u2019s healing skill, Davin had been ill for several days.</p><p>\u201cTomas?\u201d Jared searched the boy\u2019s face for any sign of illness or injury. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tomas didn\u2019t look back at the privy hole. His worried brown eyes fastened on the wagon. \u201cThey\u2019re both feeling pissy this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, both annoyed and relieved. \u201cSo what else is new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I think Thera\u2019s sick. She acted real funny when I asked them if they wanted some coffee. And the Gray Lady didn\u2019t say nothing either, and youknow she likes coffee.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did. Jared had never thought of coffee as a sensual experience until he\u2019d watched the Gray Lady drink her morning cup.</p><p>Jared drained his cup and handed it to Tomas. \u201cTell Blaed and Thayne to do what they can with breakfast. I\u2019ll see what I can do for the Ladies.\u201d</p><p>Glad to hand the worry over to someone else, Tomas dashed for the stone building.</p><p>Jared squared his shoulders and forced his legs to move toward the wagon. Prudently standing to one side, he knocked on the door.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He knocked harder.</p><p>Still no answer.</p><p>Were they too weak or too sick to call out?</p><p>His heart climbed into his throat as he pushed the door open.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Thera\u2019s voice was full of temper edged with fear.</p><p>Jared stood on the top step and swore silently. Thera and the Gray Lady sat on the benches, two lumpy shapes hunched under a mound of blankets. Tomas was right; neither of them looked well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And, Hell\u2019s fire, it wascold in there! Were they both masochists or was this a subtle punishment for the males, a way to strip the pleasure out of having slept in a warm room? Maybe Thera couldn\u2019t have sustained a warming spell all night, but the Gray Lady certainly could have with a minimal amount of her Gray strength.</p><p>Jared opened his mouth to make a stinging comment. . . and tasted the difference in the air. Thera was in her moontime.</p><p>It was one of those things that remained unspoken between the genders. Once a Blood male passed puberty, he became sensitive to the smell of moon\u2019s blood and could recognize it no matter how carefully a woman tried to mask it. Jared wasn\u2019t sure if it was a subtle change in a woman\u2019s psychic scent or a slight difference in her physical scent or a combination of both that alerted the males, but they could taste it in the air, smell it when they passed her on the street.</p> <p>It was the time when every sexually mature witch became vulnerable. For the first two or three days, doing more than basic Craft was physically painful for her, and the stronger the witch, the more of her psychic strength had to be drained into the Jewels during those days because her body couldn\u2019t tolerate it.</p><p>During that time, unless she had the protection of other witches, she was at the mercy of the males around her.</p><p>Within a family, that sharpened the males\u2019 territorial and protective instincts. Within a court, it sharpened the tempers of all the males in the First Circle. Within a village, men learned to ride the ebb and flow of women\u2019s moods, concentrating their attention on the women in their families, their lovers, and particular friends who had to tolerate affectionate bullying and overprotectiveness.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d Jared asked, glancing at the Gray Lady. Hell\u2019s fire, she really didn\u2019t look well either. Maybe she had caught a chill. The Darkness only knew why the rest of them hadn\u2019t gotten sick after walking in cold rain for the past few days and sleeping outside on wet ground. Maybe that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t answered him yesterday until he\u2019d contacted her with a Green communication thread. Maybe she\u2019d already started to become ill and didn\u2019t feel physically strong enough to wear the Gray. The Green could be her Birthright Jewel. It would make sense that she\u2019d ease back to her Birthright Jewel if she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Damn. How sick was she? A chill could turn into something serious if it wasn\u2019t taken care of. But it could just be a griping belly. That could make a person feel miserable without being serious. If he asked, would she tell him what was wrong? Doubtful, unless she became very sick. And if she did . . . What in the name of Hell was he supposed to do if she did?</p><p>And why did it matter so much if she was sick or not?</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that. So he focused his attention on the fact that neither of them had answered his first question and tried again. \u201cHow about some hot water for a brew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the Gray Lady said dully. \u201cThat would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Jared closed the door and blew out a breath. After breakfast, he would clear everyone out of the building and give the two women some privacy if they wanted a hot bath. And he\u2019d have to remember to give Thera discreet opportunities to take care of her private needs.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything he could do for the Gray Lady without knowing what was wrong with her, but if she allowed him to look through her healing herbs, he knew several brews that would help ease Thera\u2019s discomfort.</p><p>The Sadist had taught him every one of them.</p><p>At the time, it had amazed him that a man who was a master at emotional cruelty was so well versed at easing a woman\u2019s physical discomfort. On the other hand, he never saw Daemon give one of those brews to the Queen who controlled them or the aristo witches in her First Circle. Those brews found their way to the female servants\u2019 living quarters and the women who would get no other pampering.</p> <p>Brock met him at the door when he returned to the stone building.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Brock asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThera\u2019s feeling a little bitchy,\u201d Jared replied, wondering if men from other Territories used that phrase in the same way.</p><p>Brock\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cAh. Well, we can give her breathing room and keep the pups from pestering her. What about the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged and lied to himself that he didn\u2019t feel concerned. \u201cShe might have a stomach chill or something.\u201d</p><p>Blaed and Thayne both had more skill at a stove than he\u2019d suspected, and a few minutes later he and Tomas were carrying full plates and cups of hot water to the wagon. Keeping his distance so that he wouldn\u2019t upset Thera, he set a plate and cup next to each of them and retreated after mentioning the availability of the hipbath.</p><p>After breakfast, while the Gray Lady and Thera took the opportunity to bathe, Jared opened the wagon\u2019s door and shutters to freshen the air inside. Tomas swept the narrow bit of floor with a broom he\u2019d found in a cupboard in the stone building. Jared shook out the blankets. Together, they made a cozy nest on each of the benches. Jared put a warming spell on the blankets, which would keep the women comfortable but wouldn\u2019t be as noticeable as warming the inside of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Tomas said, smoothing out a wrinkle in a blanket. \u201cThey\u2019ll be feeling better in next to no time.\u201d</p> <p>Jared just smiled and said nothing. Tomas was a clever boy, and since he obviously knew what a woman\u2019s moon-time was\u2014who wouldn\u2019t after a few days in Polli\u2019s company?\u2014he\u2019d figure it out fast enough.</p><p>By the time the Gray Lady and Thera were tucked into the wagon as comfortably as possible, the sun had been up a couple of hours\u2014not that anyone complained about getting a later start than usual.</p><p>After giving the order for them to move on, Jared waited until everyone else had reached the lane before stepping between the stone posts. He and Brock had already double-checked the buildings to be sure everything was just as they\u2019d found it. The rest of the fresh food that had been left for them was now in a cool-spelled box in the wagon. There was nothing . . .</p><p>The chipped blue jug had been empty when he\u2019d gone back to make the last check. Rinsed out and empty.</p><p>When he\u2019d checked outside the buildings, there had been no sign of a bouquet of flowers tossed aside.</p><p>It didn\u2019t bother him that she\u2019d taken that Sapphire-Jeweled bastard\u2019s flowers with her. Not at all. It was simply annoyance with himself that he hadn\u2019t thought of that ploy to gain favor with her. It was a natural response, an instinctive rivalry. A favored male was always granted special privileges. He needed that leniency more than a stranger who wasn\u2019t even around. It wasn\u2019t like the rogue would have any sexual interest in a woman old enough to be his mother\u2014Hell\u2019s fire, hisgrandmother. He certainly didn\u2019t have any interest. Not really. After all those years as a pleasure slave, his body was confused and just reacted to anything female. The fact that he didn\u2019t respond that way to Thera and sometimes wanted to kiss the Gray Lady until her bones melted didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>So it didn\u2019t mean a thing to him that she had taken that bastard\u2019s flowers with her because he wasnot jealous.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes and shook his head. He\u2019d gone about dealing with the Gray Lady all wrong. He should have remembered that she liked balls and sass, would probably have been more responsive to a male companion who made an effort to be charming. So from now on, he\u2019d be charming even if it choked him. He used to be able to charm women. How many times had he coaxed Reyna into letting him have an extra nutcake? A boy who could charm his mother into spoiling his appetite for dinner should be able to grow up into a man who could wrap an elderly Queen around his little finger\u2014especially when that man had received a year of intense, private training in how to do just that. He should be able to charm a Queen.</p><p>Even a Gray-Jeweled Queen.</p><p>Maybe even charm her enough to coax her into making a detour to Ranon\u2019s Wood, if he couldn\u2019t find a way to slip the control of the Invisible Ring.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jared opened his eyes and studied the posts. Today it seemed so obvious, so easy. He traced the symbols for wind, water, and fire, then walked down the path until he reached the lane. After putting the wooden pole back on its posts to hide the way into the clearing, he walked across the lane and stood in front of the moss-covered boulders.</p><p>Wind, water, fire . . .</p><p>He caressed the face of the woman rising from the stones\u2014and through the stone, felt the protection spells around the clearing rekey.</p><p>. . . and earth.</p><p>Because a Queen wasn\u2019t just the heart of a court, she was the heart of the land.</p><p>Slipping his hands into his coat pockets, Jared hurried to catch up with the others.</p><p>\u201cHand it over, you stupid turd!\u201d</p><p>Jared broke into a run. Randolf never had that edge in his voice with anyone except Garth.</p><p>Rounding a curve where the lane fed into another road, Jared slowed to a cautious walk.</p><p>Garth held one hand behind his back, dodging and circling while Randolf tried to grab that arm.</p><p>Jared wouldn\u2019t have been amused if he\u2019d found Eryk and Corry playing \u201cgimme.\u201d And he was less than amused to find Randolf baiting Garth, and not just because Garth was broken. Every man had his flash point, that inner line he wouldn\u2019t be pushed beyond without striking back. Garth stood a head taller than most of them, even topping Brock by a few inches, and outweighed all of them\u2014and all that weight was bone and hard muscle. It was easy to forget what a man his size could do because he always had that confused, kicked-puppy look on his face.</p><p>That look wasn\u2019t on Garth\u2019s face now. He moved with a warrior\u2019s assurance, and his pale blue eyes glittered with malevolence.</p><p>\u201cRandolf!\u201d Jared shouted.</p><p>Randolf lunged at Garth.</p><p>Garth dodged and gave Randolf a shove that sent the man flying.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d\u2018 Garth bellowed, striding toward him.</p><p>\u201cPull him down!\u201d Randolf yelled as he got to his feet.</p><p>Jared backed away. Shields weren\u2019t considered permissible Craft for slaves, so a smart man tried to frighten his victim into shielding without using Craft himself. That way, the witch who owned them, alerted by her controlling ring to a forbidden use of power, punished the offender\u2014the victim\u2014with pain sent through the Ring of Obedience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A man made helpless by a Ring was an easy man to kill.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t think Garth had that much cunning left, which really didn\u2019t matter since Garth wouldn\u2019t need Craft to snap him in half, and he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance in a fight without it.</p><p>Jared dodged, slipped, tried to scramble out of reach.</p> <p>Garth grabbed the back of Jared\u2019s coat and set him on his feet hard enough to make his teeth rattle.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Garth said, holding out his huge, clenched hand.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Jared held out his hand. He shuddered with revulsion as the brass button Garth had been holding dropped into his palm. The button had the same slimy feel as Garth\u2019s psychic scent.</p><p>Anger washed through Jared. All this over abutton ?</p><p>He looked up just in time to see the knife leave Randolf\u2019s hand, aimed straight for Garth\u2019s back. \u201cNO!\u201d</p> <p>Garth spun around, knocking the knife away with his forearm.</p><p>Randolf looked shocked.</p><p>Jared stared at Garth and wondered what the man had been before he\u2019d ended up on the auction block at Raej.</p><p>Cold fury filled Garth\u2019s face as he walked over to where the knife lay in the road. He stepped on the blade, grabbed the hilt, and snapped the knife in half. Returning to Jared, he pointed at Jared\u2019s hand. Sweat ran down his face and his hand shook as if he were fiercely struggling against something.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Garth said. The glitter faded from his eyes, replaced by the confused, imploring, familiar look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a button. Garth.\u201d</p> <p>Garth made a frustrated sound.</p><p>Jared waited, but he could see Garth was losing the inner battle.</p><p>Garth raised his arms and let them fall, his big hands slapping his thighs in a gesture of defeat. Shaking his head, he walked away.</p><p>Randolf didn\u2019t move until Garth was well past him. Then he turned on Jared. \u201cNow do you understand why I don\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at the brass button. Holding a handful of phlegm wouldn\u2019t make his stomach any queasier.</p><p>His face twisting with disgust, Randolf walked over to Jared, plucked the button out of his hand, and tossed it into the bushes beside the road.</p><p>Jared rubbed his hand on his trousers.</p><p>Randolf bared his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to convince you that he\u2019s a danger to us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Jared snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s not dangerous unless he\u2019s pushed. He can\u2019t help being broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just broken, he\u2019stainted .\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s body tightened until it shook. To call one of the Blood tainted was a vicious insult, because blood was the connection between the body and the psychic strength. Someone who was condemned as being tainted was considered so fouled that his blood would contaminate whatever it was used for. That person\u2019s blood couldn\u2019t be given for an offering, couldn\u2019t be used for any Blood ceremony, couldn\u2019t be used for a healing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Jared said, forcing the words out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know he\u2019s not. He\u2019s out of sight half of the time, and whenever he\u2019s around the rest of us, he\u2019s always watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mind-damaged, Randolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t argue that someone tampered with him, but after seeing him just now. do you still believe he\u2019s as mind-damaged as he seems?\u201d</p><p>Jared said nothing.</p><p>The anger gradually drained out of Randolf. \u201cIt\u2019s your decision, Lord Jared. You do what you think is best.\u201d He turned and walked away.</p><p>Jared waited until Randolf was out of sight before he walked over to the knife lying in the road.</p><p>The blade was broken into small pieces. A man\u2019s foot couldn\u2019t break tempered steel like that. Craft could.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>If Garth wasn\u2019t as damaged as he seemed to be ...</p><p>Jared raised his hand but stopped before he raked his fingers through his hair. His hand still felt slimy, fouled.</p><p>If someone had created a spell around Garth so that he wouldappear to be mind-damaged, in the same way Sadi had created a spell to hide Blaed\u2019s true nature ... Butwhy ?</p><p>His snarl echoed the wild stranger\u2019s fiercer one.</p><p>\u201cPet.\u201d A word slaves despised even more than \u201ctainted.\u201d</p><p>The wild stranger circled the thought and snarled again.</p><p>Pet.</p><p>Whyhad the Gray Lady excluded the adult males from the story time? Because she thought they wouldn\u2019t be interested, or because she didn\u2019t want them to hear a tale about an escape to a land where the Blood still lived with honor?</p><p>Pet.</p><p>Jared started up the road at a fast walk.</p><p>Could a man be a pet without being aware of it?</p><p>Thera would know. Being broken didn\u2019t erase her knowledge or training, merely kept her from using it.</p><p>Jared looked around.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see the wagon.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see any sign of Randolf or Garth.</p><p>He started running.</p><p>Thera was the only person in their group who might have the answers he needed; was the only one who understood the Black Widows\u2019 Craft.</p><p>The Gray Lady was the only person in the entire Realm of Terreille who wore the Gray Jewels; was the only Queen and the onlyfree person who outranked Dorothea SaDiablo.</p><p>Both of them were lying in the wagon, feeling unwell enough to be vulnerable to an unexpected attack.</p><p>And until he had some answers, there was no one he could trust to help keep them safe.</p><p>Jared stared at the swift-moving, mud-colored water. On either side of the swollen creek were the remains of the bridge they needed to cross. As he watched, the water seduced another plank of the bridge and took it for a wild ride downstream, abandoning it at the tangle of branches and debris that had piled up at the curve.</p><p>Brock hooked his thumbs into his leather belt, took a deep breath, and blew it out. \u201cWell, that\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us,\u201d Jared agreed.</p><p>Brock narrowed his eyes. \u201cI wondered if it could be a marauder ambush, so I took a chance and probed the area. There\u2019s no Blood around here but us. We\u2019ve been visible long enough to have company if it was coming.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think one of the trees that had been uprooted in the flood smashed into the bridge and pulled it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Jared wished he had insisted on talking to Thera. But when he caught up with the others, Blaed had curtly informed him that both women were sleeping, and there had been an edge to the young Warlord Prince\u2019s voice that had warned him not to push. Since his own anxiety had diminished once he could keep an eye on the women, and he didn\u2019t see any reason to aggravate the aggressive, protective instincts Blaed was fighting to keep leashed, he\u2019d decided to wait until he could talk to Thera without drawing the other men\u2019s attention. Now, looking at the remains of the bridge and wondering if it had been the flood or Craft that had destroyed it. he regretted that decision.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jared said again. \u201cOr maybe the company just hasn\u2019t gotten here yet. Or maybe there\u2019s Blood out there who outrank you and are shielded so you\u2019re not aware of them.\u201d</p><p>He tensed when Brock\u2019s hand closed on his arm, forcing him to turn and face the other man.</p><p>\u201cI was a First Circle guard, Warlord,\u201d Brock said, anger simmering in his voice. \u201cThe Purple Dusk may not be one of the darker Jewels, but I\u2019ve got the training, and I know what to look for. When I probe to find something, I find it, if it\u2019s there at all.\u201d</p><p>Jared wasn\u2019t sure of that, but he didn\u2019t know that much about a guard\u2019s training, so he didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Jared?\u201d Brock said, releasing Jared\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve been straight with me since we started out, and now all of a sudden you\u2019re talking smoke.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to face the water, not so much to turn away from Brock but to keep his back to the others. He and Brock worked well together, and he liked the man. But liking and trusting weren\u2019t the same thing, and trust was what Brock was asking for now.</p><p>Keeping his voice neutral, Jared said, \u201cIf you could kill the Gray Lady, would you do it?\u201d He flicked a glance at Brock, whose face and eyes were carefully blank.</p><p>\u201cIf she died out here, we\u2019d be free,\u201d Brock answered, his voice giving nothing away.</p><p>\u201cWould you kill her?\u201d Jared pressed.</p><p>Brock seemed reluctant to answer, but finally said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Brock\u2019s answer should have made Jared feel easier. It didn\u2019t. He watched the water steal another plank from the bridge. \u201cIt could have been marauders.\u201d</p><p>Brock huffed.</p><p>\u201cIt could have,\u201d Jared insisted. \u201cWhat if they destroyed the bridge to force us to take another road, find another bridge where they\u2019ll be waiting for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean waiting for her,\u201d Brock said slowly, rubbing his chin. \u201cThey\u2019d have no reason to think we\u2019d fight. Slaves, if they\u2019re smart, don\u2019t take sides. If their owner wins, they wouldn\u2019t survive the punishment if they\u2019d helped her enemy, and they wouldn\u2019t survive what the others would do to them if they fought for her and the enemy won. By doing nothing, a slave wouldn\u2019t be any worse off and might even be granted the freedom to serve without a Ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing he\u2019d be granted is the chance to whore his honor for the illusion of freedom,\u201d Jared snapped. \u201cHe\u2019d never really be trusted, never really be free. He wouldn\u2019t be wearing a Ring he could feel or see, but\u2014\u201d The words suddenly stuck in Jared\u2019s throat. \u201cBut he\u2019d be trapped by it all the same,\u201d he finished softly.</p><p>Freedom from pain. Freedom from the constant physical reminder that your body belonged to someone else who could use you, hurt you, sell you, maim you simply because she wanted to. Freedom to have a lover, maybe even children. Freedom, for the price of giving up honor.</p><p>And all a man would have to do was blindly obey.</p><p>Like he\u2019d been doing since they\u2019d started this fool\u2019s journey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rage boiled up in Jared.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>As Jared shook off Brock\u2019s restraining hand, he noticed the three boys scrambling among the boulders a little ways upstream, jostling each other as they threw sticks into the creek.</p> <p>Jared roared to vent some of his temper. \u201cTomas! Eryk! Corry! Get away from there!\u201d</p><p>Tomas grinned and waved. \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on them,\u201d Jared snapped, pushing past Brock.</p><p>Ignoring the worried looks of the others waiting by the wagon, Jared headed for the Gray Lady, who\u2019d been wandering around in the field next to the creek since they\u2019d had to stop. She limped toward him, her arms wrapped around her belly, too focused on the ground just ahead of her to notice his approach until he was almost on top of her.</p><p>Jared grabbed her arm, too angry to be careful. \u201cMake the Ring visible. Prove it\u2019s there.Prove it .\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.</p><p>His hand tightened. \u201cOr add the Ring of Obedience to it. I\u2019m not going to play your games. I\u2019m not going to fall for your tricks. You may own my body, but you\u2019re never going to own my soul.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>Right now, he wasn\u2019t so sure he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe Ring of Obedience,\u201d Jared snarled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to pull away from him. \u201cYou wear the Invisible Ring. That\u2019s sufficient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be sufficient for long. I\u2019ll fight you with everything I am. You\u2019re not going to own me. Not that way.\u201d She had to strike back now. Shehad to. No witch would allow a slave to state bluntly that he was going to fight without punishing him for it. And once that pain blazed along his nerves, he would know for certain the Invisible Ring existed and she hadn\u2019t played him for a fool.</p><p>She didn\u2019t strike back. Instead, she snapped, \u201cYou presume a great deal, Warlord. What makes you think I want to own you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bill of sale, Lady.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, his response upset her. She yanked her arm out of his grasp, stumbling back a couple of steps. \u201cIs wearing the Invisible Ring making you suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to blast her with the foulest language he knew . . . and tasted something in the air that shouldn\u2019t have been there.</p><p>Wariness and fear shadowed her eyes as he stared at her. She slowly backed away from him.</p> <p>Jared shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The scream came a second after he felt a surge of power.</p><p>Whipping around, Jared saw Eryk standing on top of the boulders, his arms windmilling frantically to keep from falling backward into the creek. Tomas held on to the front of Eryk\u2019s coat, leaning back and pulling hard, trying to keep the older, heavier boy from falling.</p><p>There was no sign of Corry.</p><p>Before Jared could move, another surge of power hit the boulders, shattering the rock and tossing both boys into the air. They screamed as they fell into the rushing water.</p><p>Garth burst out of the bushes at the same moment, holding up his trousers as he raced downstream and leaped into the water.</p><p>\u201cCORRY!\u201d</p><p>Jared whipped around again, responding to the Gray Lady\u2019s voice.</p><p>She was running\u2014running!\u2014toward a break in the trees a little ways downstream from the bridge.</p><p>Jared watched her for a moment in frozen disbelief. Then, swearing viciously as he gave in to instinct, he took off after her, counting on his longer legs, the difference in their ages, and her inexplicable moontime to stop her from doing something courageously foolish.</p><p>She must have used Craft somehow to make her knee work as if it were fully healed. And, Mother Night, she had speed!</p><p>In that moment, when he knew he wouldn\u2019t catch her in time, he would have admired her if he hadn\u2019t been so furious with her.</p><p>Instead of scrambling down the slope to the water\u2019s edge, she lengthened her stride for the last few paces and made a Craft-enhanced leap, flying over the sloping dry land and new shallows. As she neared the middle of the creek, a blast of power struck her, spinning her round and round, smashing through the Craft she\u2019d used.</p><p>She hit the water on her back and disappeared.</p><p>Thera\u2019s voice, shrill and furious, filled Jared\u2019s mind in the same instant the Gray Lady hit the water. *Don\u2019t use Craft!Don\u2019t use Craft ! There\u2019s a spell here that twists it and turns it back on you!*</p><p>Jared veered to the right, downstream, pushing himself harder. Using Craft, he could have lifted her out of the water as soon as he caught sight of her and floated her to dry ground. Instead all he could do was try to get ahead of her and think of something then.</p><p>He plunged down the slope, grabbing at trees to stay on his feet. As soon as he had a clear view of the creek, he stopped and scanned the water, looking for some sign of them. He spotted Corry thrashing helplessly, slowly drifting toward the tangle of branches and debris.</p><p>Slowly. As if something was holding the boy back. As if someone\u2019s feet were digging into the creek bottom.</p><p>Damnthat woman. This wasn\u2019t a chess game!</p><p>Muttering vile promises of what he was going to do when he finally got his hands on her, Jared looked around for something, anything he could use to reach them. Then he bared his teeth in a feral smile.</p><p>Like to like.</p><p>If he couldn\u2019t use Craft to help, he would play the game by the enemy\u2019s rules and use it to destroy.</p><p>Raising his right hand, he aimed for the ground in front of a slim, tall tree that stood at the water\u2019s edge several yards downstream and unleashed the Red.</p><p>The ground around the tree exploded, tearing out part of its roots before his Red strength rebounded, heading straight for him.</p><p>Jared dove, rolling the rest of the way down the slope.</p><p>The blast of power sizzled over his head, tearing up the ground where he\u2019d been standing.</p><p>Cautiously raising his head, Jared watched the tree topple into the creek. Still tethered to the land by what was left of its roots, it bounced on top of the water.</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, Jared plunged into the water, cursing as his feet tangled in submerged undergrowth. Once he pulled free, he swam across the current, fighting to reach Corry.</p><p>It took seconds, seemingly centuries for him to reach the middle of the creek. He pulled his legs under him and planted his feet to test the water\u2019s depth. It broke against his shoulders.</p><p>Too long, Jared thought as he ducked under the water, clamped his hands around the Gray Lady\u2019s waist, and yanked her to the surface.She\u2019s been under too long .</p><p>She gasped for air, swallowed water, and choked. Jared swore as he wormed one arm between her belly and Corry's back to hold her up. At least he didn\u2019t have to worry about losing Corry. She could barely breathe, and her arms were still wrapped so tightly around the boy it was going to take a couple of strong men to pry him away from her.</p><p>She coughed up water, and Jared swore again.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, damn you, breathe!\u201d Jared shouted at her. \u201cYou arenot going to die just to get out of a fight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Relieved that she could breathe enough to talk, Jared\u2019s arm tightened around her until she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to play hop frog,\u201d Jared said, working to keep his voice calm while his instincts shivered a warning that some terrible danger was coming closer.</p><p>\u201cI amnot going to jump over your shoulders,\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cNot leap frog.Hop frog. Didn\u2019t you play any games when you were a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hop if you can\u2019t touch the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tallest one hops. The shorter ones just hang on for the ride. I used to do this all the time with my little brothers when the creeks were running high. It\u2019s fun.\u201d And thank the Darkness Reyna had never found out about it.</p><p>\u201cOnly a boy would think a stupid, dangerous game was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, you\u2019ve got a lot of brass to call anything anyone else does stupid or dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He made the first hop before she could sputter a reply, letting the current push them a ways before planting his feet again. On the second hop, his foot slipped and they all went under. Since the Lady was too busy coughing and cursing him to say anything useful, he hopped again.</p><p>They reached the toppled tree on the fourth hop.</p><p>Jared grabbed the tree to keep his balance while he started to walk them toward the bank.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Blaed rushed down the slope to the water\u2019s edge. Bracing himself against the tree, he waded in far enough to yank Corry out of the Gray Lady\u2019s arms. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here. Thera says a spell\u2019s been triggered and the power feeding it is going to hit this place anytime now.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>They scrambled for the bank.</p><p>\u201cI brought the saddle horses,\u201d Blaed said. \u201cThe others took the wagon and will get as far away as they can before it hits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jared said as soon as Blaed reached dry ground.</p><p>Blaed didn\u2019t bother to answer. Carrying Corry, he climbed the slope as fast as he could.</p><p>Jared half carried the Gray Lady the last few steps to the bank and didn\u2019t think it strange that she was struggling so hard until she tried to take a step up the slope and almost fell.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, trying to push him away while balancing on her left leg. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeather-brained, mule-headed woman,\u201d Jared growled as he ducked under her batting hands and hoisted her over his shoulder. \u201cStop squirming, or you\u2019ll get us both killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Jared said in a deceptively mild tone that no one but a blithering idiot\u2014or a Queen\u2014could have failed to understand.</p><p>Her breath came out in an angry hiss.</p><p>Choosing to interpret that as agreement, he scrambled up the slope.</p><p>\u201cI told you to go,\u201d Jared said when he reached the top and saw Blaed holding both horses, waiting for them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy should he take orders any better than you do?\u201d the Gray Lady muttered against his back.</p><p>Jared set her down too hard next to the bay gelding. Her gasp of pain hurt him, but he didn\u2019t allow himself to think about it as he tossed her into the saddle and swung up behind her.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to think about anything.</p> <p>As soon as Blaed swung up behind Corry, they kicked the horses into a gallop and raced across the field, angling toward the road.</p><p>How much time did they have? And how would the spell unleash? Would it radiate from a central point or just fan out on this side of the creek? The damage a psychic unleashing could do would depend on the strength of the person who had fed the spell. His and the Gray Lady\u2019s inner barriers should be able to hold against that kind of unleashing, but the others might not survive it. If the spell manifested in some physical way . . .</p><p>Wind? Water?</p><p>They reached the road at the same moment the spell unleashed.</p><p>Jared glanced over his shoulder and saw a mature tree explode skyward like a burning arrow released from a bow.</p> <p>The muscles in his chest locked. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Behind them, a huge ball of witchfire consumed the trees around the creek and expanded outward at a fierce speed.</p><p>Jared urged the gelding on, trying to wring a little more speed out of the animal.</p><p>Witchfire had a radius. It had a limit that depended on the amount of power that had been used to create it. It could heat and it could burn\u2014sweet Darkness, how it could burn!\u2014but it couldn\u2019t continue expanding after the power was exhausted. With all the rain they\u2019d had over the past few days, it wasn\u2019t likely that the witchfire would spark a natural fire. They should be safe enough ... if they could outrun it.</p><p>He saw the wagon rattling down the road ahead of them.</p><p>He heard the witchfire roaring behind him.</p> <p>Too slow. Too slow!</p><p>Jared pressed against the Gray Lady. If the witchfire caught up to them, he\u2019d risk the working distance of that twisting spell and throw a Red shield behind them. Even if that spell turned his own strength against him, the shield might buy her enough time to escape the witchfire.</p><p>They were gaining on the wagon.</p><p>The witchfire was gaining on them.</p><p>The roan mare Blaed was riding squealed and shot ahead of them.</p><p>Jared felt the heat on his back.</p><p>He raised his hand at the same moment the Gray Lady raised hers.</p><p>Swearing when he saw the Green Jewel in her ring, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand down before she could throw up a shield. He\u2019d risk the range of the twisting spell and having his own power turned against him, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d lether risk it.</p> <p>Fire roared behind them.</p><p>The wagon was too close now. Too close.</p><p>The gelding raced past a tree a second before the fire consumed it.</p><p>\u201cWe made it!\u201d Blaed shouted. \u201cMother Night, we made it!\u201d</p><p>Jared glanced back.</p><p>A wall of witchfire filled the road behind them, but it wasn\u2019t moving forward anymore.</p><p>\u201cThank the Darkness.\u201d Jared pressed his cheek against the Gray Lady\u2019s head as he reined in the laboring horse. When the gelding slowed to a stumbling walk, he slid off its back. He wasn\u2019t sure his legs would hold him, but they couldn\u2019t afford to ruin the horses. \u201cCome on, boy,\u201d he soothed, sliding the reins over the gelding\u2019s lowered head so he could lead it. \u201cA little farther and you can rest.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the Gray Lady slumped in the saddle, her face hidden by her wet, tangled hair. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>Funny. He wouldn\u2019t have thought gray hair would look that dark when it was wet.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Brock shouted.</p><p>The wagon had slowed to a walk, too. Brock swung off the driving seat and jumped to the ground.</p><p>Jared waved at him. \u201cKeep them walking.\u201d</p><p>Brock started toward him, looked behind Jared at the Gray Lady, and hesitated. Then he waved an acknowledgment and turned around.</p><p>The wagon door opened. Looking pale, Thera braced herself in the opening. Her green eyes swept over Blaed, who was leading the mare, and Corry, who was still in the saddle, pale and shaking. They lingered for a moment on the Gray Lady, and finally settled on him.</p><p>Jared had the uneasy feeling she was looking for some kind of answer. Problem was, he didn\u2019t know the question.</p><p>Before he could say anything, she stepped back and closed the door.</p><p>Jared looked at Blaed and frowned. \u201cI told you to go.\u201d</p><p>Blaed shrugged. \u201cThera told me to bring you back. If I had to fight with someone about it, better you than her.\u201d</p><p>Jared grunted. Then he slanted another look at the young Warlord Prince. \u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a Harpy\u2019s temper,\u201d Blaed snapped as his face colored.</p><p>Jared grinned. \u201cYou like her.\u201d The grin faded. Slaves couldn\u2019t afford those kinds of feelings.</p><p>They walked for several minutes before Jared whistled sharply and raised his hand, calling a halt. The horses were cool enough to stand for a few minutes while they changed into dry clothes and got the Gray Lady settled into the wagon. She hadn\u2019t said anything since he\u2019d tossed her onto the gelding\u2019s back. She had to be in pain. Her enduring it in silence reminded him why he was so furious with her.</p><p>The moment the wagon stopped, Thera threw the door open and scrambled down the steps, almost falling in her haste.</p><p>Wondering why she seemed so tense now that the danger was over\u2014itwas over, wasn\u2019t it?\u2014Jared reached up to help the Gray Lady dismount.</p><p>And found himself reaching for a gray-eyed, dark-haired,young witch dressed in the Gray Lady\u2019s clothes.</p><p>She frowned at him. and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d at the same moment Thera said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fury blinded him. Hell\u2019s fire, he hadhated witches who hadn\u2019t made him this furious.</p><p>Snarling, he clamped his hands around her waist and hauled her out of the saddle. As she fell forward, the Green Jewel hanging from a gold chain around her neck slipped out of the torn coat and tunic. Her gasp of pain and surprise\u2014and the bruises already darkening on her shoulders and chest where she must have struck submerged rocks\u2014 stopped him from letting go of her until she had time to grab the gelding\u2019s saddle to keep her balance. Then he stepped back, not trusting himself not to strike out.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Thera said again.</p><p>Looking puzzled, the witch\u2019s gray eyes flicked to the men Jared could feel gathering behind him, to the children who had emerged from the wagon, to Thera, and, finally, to him.</p><p>She started to raise her hand to brush back her tangled hair, but didn\u2019t complete the gesture. Pulling what was left of her braid over her shoulder, she studied the dark hair, and then muttered, \u201cHell\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jared roared. He didn\u2019t know which made him more furious: that his mind had been tricked into believing this was the Gray Lady or that his body hadn\u2019t been fooled.</p><p>She wobbled a little when the gelding shifted nervously, but she squared her shoulders and raised her chin.</p><p>The admiration he felt for the strength and pride he saw in her eyes only fueled his temper, and the wild stranger inside him started howling at him to protect, protect, protect. He tried to push it away by reminding himself that he was a Ringed slave, but instincts that had been bred into Blood males over dozens of generations weren\u2019t easily banished by a Ring or a word.</p><p>In a commanding voice, she said, \u201cI am Lady Arabella Ardelia. On the Gray Lady\u2019s behalf, I\u2019m taking you to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Brock and Randolf swore quietly.</p><p>Jared ground his teeth. Arrogant, stubborn, courageous, feather-brained little fool! Did she really think men like Brock and Randolf would just shrug and continue to obey her unless she used the Ring of Obedience and brutally revived their fear of the kind of pain it inflicted? Especially once they realized she was handicapped right now by more than physical injuries?</p><p>He took a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d\u2018 she said, her body tensing.</p><p>Jared bared his teeth in a savage smile. \u201cYou want me to stay back?Use the Ring .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>Jared held his breath, waiting. Shehad to use the Invisible Ring now. She had to. She\u2019d been able to avoid using it when he\u2019d challenged her a short while ago, but she couldn\u2019t now that he\u2019d challenged her in front of the others. His Jewels outranked hers. He was a danger to her. If she didn\u2019t use the Ring to pull him down, he could smash through her inner barriers and tear her mind apart. Damn her, shehad to use it to protect herself, to reassert her control over all of them. Shehad to hurt him to prove that she could still brutally control the strongest male among them\u2014and would inflict the same kind of pain on the others if the males didn\u2019t continue to obey her.</p><p>Instead, she let go of the saddle and tried to brace herself for a fight.</p><p>Swearing, Jared closed the distance between them and scooped her up in his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a pleasure slave.\u201d he snarled as he stomped to the wagon, \u201cyou need a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Thera warned as he brushed past her and the children. \u201cShe needs attention and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d He shouldered the door open and kicked it closed in Thera\u2019s face. After setting his bundle of wet, bedraggled witch on the bench, he stepped back and leaned against the door, preventing anyone from interrupting them.</p><p>One of the shutters behind the driving seat had fallen open during the wild ride. Using Craft, he closed it and created a ball of witchlight, floating it near the bench so he could take a good look at her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t pretty\u2014he'd always associated pretty with delicate\u2014but there was a kind of strength in her face that would ripen into beauty in a few more years\u2014a beauty that was a reflection of the deep inner strength strong Blood males found more arousing than a lush body.</p><p>Sadi had once said strength attracted strength, that a strong witch\u2019s psychic scent acted like a catnip on strong Blood males. Even if the attraction wasn\u2019t sexual, they\u2019d still want to touch her, smell her, cuddle up next to her. It was part of a witch\u2019s power over the males, something that soothed her chosen as well as filling them with possessive savagery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing there, Jared felt the pull of her psychic scent\u2014 the same pull that had been luring and confusing him since she'd bought him. Knowing she wasn\u2019t the old woman he\u2019d thought she was, he felt his blood start to simmer with a dangerous hunger.</p><p>And flavoring all of it was fury fueled by relief.</p><p>Since fighting would help him keep his distance until he had time to think, he lashed out. \u201cYou mule-headed little idiot! You had no business jumping into that creek. You could have been killed\u2014or didn\u2019t you think about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t jumped in, Corry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared rode right over her. \u201cCony\u2019s male. Males are expendable.\u201d</p><p>Her gray eyes turned almost black with temper.</p><p>Remembering how their chess game had ended, he abandoned that line of attack and chose another. \u201cWas this some kind of game?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThe little witch decided to masquerade as a grown-up, go to Raej, and buy a few slaves for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for fun,\u201d she snapped. \u201cFor the Gray Lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the Gray Lady. Of course. How could I forget? Do you even know her? Or was that the best disguise you could think of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know her.\u201d She raised her chin and glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m in her First Circle.\u201d</p><p>Jared narrowed his green eyes. A young, talented witchmight serve in a Territory Queen\u2019s First Circle in order to receive special training before ruling a Province or District on that Queen\u2019s behalf. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-seven.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but there was no humor in the sound. If the little witch wanted to play games, he\u2019d play games.</p><p>He raked his eyes over her in a way that couldn\u2019t be interpreted as anything but an insult. \u201cI\u2019d guess fifteen. Maybe sixteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-one!\u201d</p><p>She sounded too outraged to be lying.</p><p>\u201cAnd with the Gray Lady\u2019s consent, you went trotting off to Raej, pretending to be a Gray-Jeweled Queen.\u201d He shook his head and tsked. \u201cNot a very sporting thing for a Queen to ask of a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e . . . unless, of course, she was trying to eliminate a rival.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered with suppressed fury, but her voice became dismissively chilly. \u201cI told you everything you need to know.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment. That she\u2019d taken an insult to the Gray Lady personally was a strong indication that shewas a member of the First Circle\u2014or at least a member of the court. And, perhaps, telling the truth.</p><p>He saw her shiver and leashed his temper. What was wrong with him that he was fighting with her when she needed attention? His father would have skinned him for neglecting his duties for such an indulgence.</p><p>Stepping away from the door, Jared reached for her coat. \u2018I\u2019ll help you get out of those wet clothes.\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, her hands clutching the front of the coat and tunic, holding them closed. She pressed her back against the storage boxes, her body tensing as he bent over her. \u201cI can manage.\u201d</p> <p>Jared closed his hand over one of her ice-cold fists and tugged gently. \u201cYou\u2019re cold, exhausted, bruised, and can\u2019t even stand up without falling over. According to all the rules my father thumped into my stubborn head, this is exactly the sort of circumstance when a Queen should put aside her pride and let someone help her.\u201d</p><p>He tugged again. Her fist tightened.</p><p>He tried dredging up the smile that used to charm Reyna into giving him an extra nutcake.</p><p>She stared at him as if he\u2019d grown fangs.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Lady,\u201d Jared growled as he tried to loosen her hands. \u201cThis can\u2019t be the first time a man has offered to undress you.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>All right, he understood her being nervous. They\u2019d been arguing. It was her moontime, and she was vulnerable. Her disguise had failed for some reason, and she didn\u2019t have the Gray Lady\u2019s reputation to hide behind anymore. But, Hell\u2019s fire, you\u2019d think she\u2019d never\u2014</p><p>Jared took a good look at her pale, tight face and backed away so fast he yelped when he hit the door. His hand shook as he pointed a finger at her, and said accusingly, \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful,you\u2019re a virgin .\u201d</p><p>Still clutching the coat, she eyed him warily. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get hysterical. It\u2019s not contagious.\u201d</p><p>Jared raked his fingers through his hair, dizzied by the conflicting emotions spinning through him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your people? What\u2019s wrong with yourfamily ? How could they let a virgin Queen out of her home village without an escort, let alone out of the Territory?\u201d His temper roared to life with a vengeance. \u201cWhat kind of man is your father to let you go to a place like Raej?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat doyou know about my people or my family?\u201d She swung her legs off the bench and sucked air through her teeth. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare insult my father!\u201d</p><p>Jared took a step forward. \u201cIf you stand on that leg, I\u2019ll do what your father should have done. I\u2019ll put you over my knee and wallop some sense into you! I swear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike some people, I don\u2019t sit on my brains, Warlord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s highly debatable, Lady!\u201d</p><p>Someone tried to open the door and smacked his arm since he was still blocking it.</p><p>Jared cursed, thought about throwing his weight against the door to give whoever was on the other side a taste of wood, heard the feminine snarl, and thought again. Rubbing his arm, he stepped farther into the wagon to let Thera enter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Thera said, her eyes chips of green ice. \u201cThe Lady needs care, which even a male should be able to figure out.\u201d</p><p>Jared bared his teeth at her, at the same time wondering if a man could be castrated by a look.</p><p>Thera tossed a blanket at him. \u201cHang that up and get out of those wet clothes before you get sick and become completely useless. I\u2019ll help the Lady.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just bet she\u2019d help the Lady, Jared thought as he used Craft to hang the blanket. He called in the cloth traveling bag he\u2019d been given to store his extra clothes and dug through it, looking for something to wear that didn\u2019t smell too ripe.</p><p>Of course Thera would help the Lady. Why wouldn\u2019t she? Two of a kind, that\u2019s what they were. Stubborn, temperamental, always sure they knew better than a man even if he had more experience, always so damn sure they could do just fine on their own, thank you very much.</p><p>Not finding anything clean to wear except the thin tunic and trousers he\u2019d been given at Raej didn\u2019t help his temper. He tossed them back into the bag and stripped. Smelling ripe would keep everyone away from him, which suited him just fine. Besides, after what they\u2019d just been through, they needed time to recover, time to think, time to plan. And while they were doing that, he was damn well going to find a way to wash these clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Thera said, her voice a little muffled by the blanket. \u201cWhen Garth got Eryk and Tomas out of the creek, I pulled out the chest with your heading supplies.</p><p>Foolish. My wits must have been scattered ... or else those damn spells were muddling my head. There was no reason to try to drag it outside since they were bringing the boys to the wagon. It was heavier than I thought.\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt would have gotten heavier,\u201d the Lady said quietly. \u201cSeveral spells had been put on it to prevent anyone but me from moving it.\u201d</p><p>Thera sighed. \u201cI should have realized that.I should have realized that .\u201d She sounded fierce and upset. Then she sighed again. \u201cAnyway, when I pulled it out the door, I dropped it on the steps. The back of it got punctured and must have torn the tangled web that created the illusion.\u201d</p><p>Jared kept still, hardly daring to breathe. He had the feeling whatever they might say to each other now might not be said at all if they remembered he was there.</p><p>\u2018\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the Lady said. After a moment, she added, \u201cBesides, you knew anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jared could almost feel Thera\u2019s shrug. \u201cI guessed. Since I was trained in it, it\u2019s easy enough for me to recognize the Hourglass\u2019s Craft.\u201d Another bit of silence. \u201cI guessed,\u201d Thera said, sounding careful, \u201cjust like you guessed I wasn\u2019t broken.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Jared stared at the blanket. Then he closed his eyes and swallowed hard. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Thera. Unbroken. They\u2019d all been fencing with a Black Widow who still wore the Jewels and had the full use of her particular Craft.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Thera said. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of those wet clothes.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the familiar sounds of someone getting undressed, Jared hurriedly pulled on layers of clothes. If he added warming spells to them, they should keep him comfortable enough for the next few hours since his coat was soaked. Even Craft couldn\u2019t instantly dry material. At least he didn\u2019t think it could. The next time he met a hearth-witch, he\u2019d ask her.</p><p>The rustling on the other side of the blanket stopped.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Thera said. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess. Didn\u2019t you missany of the rocks?\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his hands to keep from tearing down the blanket. He gritted his teeth to keep silent.</p><p>She was hurt. She was hurt. She was hurt.</p><p>All the training that had lain dormant for the past nine years came rushing back, overwhelming him with its fierceness. He wanted to lift his head and howl out his frustration. He wanted to hold her, yell at her, examine every bruise, and then kiss her to soothe the hurt.</p><p>How dare she be so careless, jumping into the creek like that? She was lucky she only had bruises instead of broken bones. How dare she, avirgin who was so terrifyingly vulnerable to a male attack, make a journey like this without evenone loyal male to look after her? Didn\u2019t she realize how precious Queens were, how vital to the Blood\u2019s survival? And how dare she create this frenzied need in him to protect without giving him the outlet of honorable service? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let her get away with it.</p><p>Fuming, Jared vanished the traveling bag and called in his Jewels. Two thin, wooden, rectangular boxes floated in front of him. He opened the first one and stared at his Birthright Opal, the gold jewelry gleaming against the box\u2019s black-velvet lining. He brushed his finger over the ring and pendant. He\u2019d worn the pendant since the Birthright Ceremony he\u2019d had when he was seven, but the Opal ring had been made just before he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness and came away with the Red. It had been a gift from his parents for his eighteenth birthday.</p><p>That was the only day he\u2019d ever worn it.</p> <p>He closed that box and vanished it, then opened the box that held the Red. Except for a few desperate moments over the years when he\u2019d slipped on the ring, craving the feel of it on his finger, he hadn\u2019t worn the Red Jewels\u2014 hadn\u2019t wornany Jewels\u2014since the night he was Ringed. Slaves weren\u2019t allowed to acknowledge their strength openly, not even the strength that was their birthright.</p><p>He slipped the Red-Jeweled ring onto the third finger of his right hand. His left hand covered it protectively as he savored the bond that had been denied for nine years.</p><p>Taking a steadying breath, he licked his lips and picked up the pendant. No clasp to break or open. Just a chain of carefully formed gold links, long enough to let the power in that reservoir rest beside his heart.</p><p>He used Craft to put on the pendant. The cool gold settled around his neck, then warmed against his skin.</p><p>As he vanished the wooden box, Jared realized it was very quiet on the other side of the blanket.</p> <p>Quiet and tense.</p><p>They knew he\u2019d called in the Jewels. Even during her moontime, the one thing a witch continued to channel power through was the controlling ring linked to the Rings of Obedience. The controlling ring\u2014and the males in the court who served her\u2014were her only defense against slaves who would have taken advantage of her vulnerability to break free or destroy her.</p><p>Right now it didn\u2019t matter if the Invisible Ring was linked to the controlling ring. The Queen who wore that ring was in no condition to fight him.</p><p>Which made him angry all over again.</p><p>He pushed the blanket aside.</p><p>Thera rose from the other bench, defiant.</p> <p>Ignoring her. he looked at the young Queen now dressed in a long gray skirt and gray sweater.</p><p>\u201cEven if we don\u2019t push the horses, we\u2019ll be able to get back to the clearing before dark,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Lady chewed her lower lip. \u201cWe have to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to go,\u201d Jared said, biting back his temper. \u201cShort of dragging them, you\u2019re not going to get anyone to go back to that creek. This road didn\u2019t branch off anywhere between here and the clearing. We won\u2019t make it any farther before nightfall anyway. We\u2019re going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go on,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>Jared ground his teeth and tried to find something to say that he wouldn\u2019t have to apologize for later.</p><p>\u201cJared\u2019s right,\u201d Thera said after a moment. \u201cWe need time to rest\u2014and to prepare. The clearing is the best place to do both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat attack might not have been meant for us,\u201d the Lady said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter, does it?\u201d Thera said just as quietly. \u201cWe were lucky this time. If we\u2019re not up to strength and able to think clearly, we might not be as lucky next time.\u201d</p><p>The Lady sighed. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll go back to the clearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady,\u201d Jared said testily. It galled him that she had argued with him but had yielded to Thera.</p><p>Squeezing past them, he reached the door.</p><p>\u201cOne thing,\u201d he said, looking over his shoulder at Thera. \u201cSince you\u2019re not broken, what Jewels do you wear?\u201d</p><p>Thera looked amused. \u201cI wear the Green, Lord Jared.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>Two of a kind, Jared thought, flinging open the door. He strode to the bay gelding and mounted. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the clearing,\u201d he told Brock. \u201cI\u2019ll take point. You and Randolf take the rear guard. Thayne, you lead the team. Blaed, you\u2019re with me.\u201d He looked at Eryk and Tomas, who were huddled in blankets, and little Cathryn, who was clinging to Corry. \u201cYou children ride inside the wagon.\u201d</p><p>Brock gave one pointed look at the Red-Jeweled ring on Jared\u2019s right hand and nodded.</p><p>As Jared nudged the gelding forward, he heard Tomas say, \u201cYou know, I thought she was kind of frisky for an old lady.\u201d</p><p>Great. Wonderful.</p><p>Was he the only one who hadn\u2019t figured it out?</p><p>As soon as he passed the wagon, he urged the gelding into a trot, not waiting for Blaed.</p><p>A minute later, he caught up to Garth. The big man hadn\u2019t changed his wet clothes before heading back down the road. Jared slowed the gelding to a walk and waited for Garth to look at him.</p><p>He studied the man\u2019s face. What lay behind those pale blue eyes? \u201cThank you for saving Eryk and Tomas.\u201d</p><p>Garth just looked at him. Then his lips curved in a slow smile. He raised one huge hand in a casual salute and turned his attention back to the road.</p><p>Too many things hidden, Jared thought, as Blaed joined him. A Green-Jeweled Queen pretending to be a Gray. A broken Black Widow who wasn\u2019t broken. A mind-damaged man who kept showing flashes of training and intelligence.</p><p>And, possibly, an enemy who might wear the face of a friend.</p><p>Too many questions.</p><p>Jared put those thoughts aside. There wasn\u2019t time for questions. But later, when they were all safely tucked away in the clearing, he intended to get some answers.</p><p>Using Craft to balance the two steaming mugs, Jared rapped once on the wagon\u2019s door and went in without waiting for a response.</p><p>The witchlight he\u2019d created earlier had grown small and dim, the power that had sustained it almost exhausted. He couldn\u2019t see her face in the gloom, but opening his first inner barrier a crack was enough to sense her pain\u2014and her fear of the male strength that might descend on her now that her ability to protect herself was so impaired. Wasn\u2019t that why she\u2019d chosen the cold solitude of the wagon to the warmth and company in the stone building?</p><p>After feeding the witchlight a few drops of his Red strength so that they\u2019d be able to see each other, he thought about using a warming spell to make the wagon more comfortable.</p><p>And decided against it.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jared said, handing her one of the mugs. \u2018\u201cThis brew won\u2019t help your bruises or your knee, but it should ease the other discomfort a little.\u201d</p><p>She cradled the mug for its warmth. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Jared sat on the opposite bench and sipped his coffee. He understood the hesitation. One of the first things the Blood learned when they began their formal training was how to probe food and drink for substances that shouldn\u2019t be there. It didn\u2019t always work. There were subtle poisons, substances that were harmless until they were added to something else, sedatives that could react fast enough to leave a person at the mercy of an unsuspected enemy. She\u2019d be a fool not to test it.</p><p>Watching her rub her finger around the mug\u2019s rim, he wondered if she could do even that much Craft right now.</p><p>\u201cI made a cup for Thera, too,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>She took a tiny sip, then stared at the mug in surprise. \u201cIt tastes good.\u201d She studied him without quite looking at him. \u201cWhere did you learn to make a healing brew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is a Healer. I picked up a few things.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t quite a lie. Hehad picked up some basic healing Craft from Reyna. The moontime brews just didn\u2019t happen to be part of it.</p><p>But the words did what he\u2019d expected them to do. A Healer was a respected woman, and there was the implicit faith that a Healer wouldn\u2019t create a brew that would harm.</p><p>He knew better. In places that stood in Hayll's shadow, Healers weren\u2019t always well trained or respected, and some had made the choice to harm others in order to save themselves.</p><p>Watching her shoulders relax as she took another sip, he felt relieved that the healing Craft was still strong in Dena Nehele.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt her. She was hurting so much already. But her self-imposed exile had made it possible for him to talk with her privately without calling attention to it, and there were questions he had put aside while they returned to the clearing, ate, and settled in for the evening, too weary to do anything more.</p><p>So he tried to keep his voice gentle and soothing, and sent out psychic tendrils of reassurance so that his strength and maleness wouldn\u2019t intimidate her so much she wouldn\u2019t talk to him.</p><p>\u201cLady . . .\u201d Jared paused. Frowning, he sipped his coffee. What was he supposed to call her? Did the people in the court address her as Lady Arabella Ardelia? Formally perhaps, but surely not in a normal conversation. Lady Arabella? That made him think of a fair, dainty woman who wore ruffles and lace, not this tall, strong-boned, solid-muscled young woman with generous curves. Lady Ardelia?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>A woman as strong as the land, with a heart of fire.</p><p>The Lady, on the other hand, might have a different opinion.</p><p>\u201cWhat do your people call you?\u201d he asked, surprised at how much her answer might disappoint him.</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d entered the wagon, she looked directly at him. Her lips twitched. \u201cMy father calls me Bella. My mother calls me Belle.\u201d Her expression darkened, and her lips curled in a silent snarl. \u201cMy cousin calls me belly button.\u201d She sipped the brew and muttered under her breath, \u201cI never liked my cousin.\u201d</p><p>Jared wisely raised his mug to his lips, covering the smile. \u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was seven, I decided I wanted to be called Lia. So that\u2019s what everyone calls me now\u2014 except my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your cousin,\u201d Jared added, not bothering to hide the grin.</p><p>She muttered something extremely uncomplimentary.</p><p>Lia. The name flowed over him like a warm summer wind. Lady Lia. He could imagine the village children calling to her to see the new puppy, the new kitten, the new bit of Craft that had been learned. He could hear the affectionate way the men and older women talked about her. Have you heard what Lady Lia\u2019s been up to lately? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And in the court, now and when she established her own . . . Lady Ardelia. The strong young Queen with too much courage.</p><p>Which brought him back to the beginning.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked quietly.</p> <p>For a while Lia just sipped the brew and didn\u2019t answer. Then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the last time, you see. The Gray Lady was attacked after the spring auction, and her escorts were killed. Dorothea SaDiablo was behind that attack. The Gray Lady insisted that she had to go to Raej one more time so that our enemies would know that the strength of a Gray-Jeweled Queen still protected Dena Nehele. The males in the First Circle felt that the risks far outweighed whatever might be gained. They politely requested that she remain within the borders of Dena Nehele\u2014and then they pulled out every scrap of Blood Law and Protocol they could find about the rights and privileges of males in the First Circle. By the time they were done, she realized their request really amounted to a command\u2014 which they vehemently denied, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jared said politely.</p><p>She looked at him with keen suspicion.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here,\u201d Jared pointed out.</p><p>She fiddled with her mug. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t go to Raej again. Even if the First Circle hadn\u2019t found a way to stop her, she couldn\u2019t go. We almost lost her the last time, and if we\u2019d lost her before\u2014\u201d Lia quickly sipped her brew.</p> <p>\u201cBefore?\u201d Jared\u2019s green eyes narrowed as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cBefore the new Queen was fully trained to take her place.\u201d</p><p>Which meant that the majority of the Warlord Princes and other Queens in Dena Nehele had already agreed to accept the Gray Lady\u2019s chosen successor.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they send you? Why not a more experienced Queen?\u201d</p><p>She worried the ragged edge of the blanket beneath her. \u201cWell, I look a lot like Gran, and I\u2019m the only other Queen in the family.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Jared couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. Couldn\u2019t think at all. \u201cGran?\u201d His voice cracked and rose to a squeak. \u201cGran? The Gray Lady is yourgrandmother ? How?\u201d</p> <p>Lia blinked. \u201cThe usual way. Her daughter had a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jared drained his mug. All right. An illusion web spun by a gifted Black Widow had been able to fool the eye, had been able to somehow mask the fact that Lia wore a Green Jewel so that strangers wouldn\u2019t be able to tell it wasn\u2019t the Gray Lady. But there was nothing that could fool a male into believing any other kind of witch was a Queen\u2014especially if he focused his attention on her.</p><p>So it made sense that they would need a Queen to impersonate a Queen. And maybe the family bond made it easier to create the illusion web, especially if Lia resembled her grandmother. Maybe there hadn\u2019t been another Queen willing to take the risk. Or maybe the Gray Lady hadn\u2019t felt she could ask someone outside of her family. Or ...</p><p>Jared\u2019s shoulder blades twitched. He kept hoping there was another answer because, if there wasn\u2019t, he was going to be furious all over again, and he couldn\u2019t afford the luxury of telling her what he thought of the males in her Territory.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said pleasantly while the anger started simmering his blood, \u201csince you were the only other Queen in the family, and the Gray Lady\u2019s successor, you decided to do this yourself.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily. \u201cYes.\u201d When he started swearing again, the kind of inventive curses that were designed to make another man flinch, she snarled at him. \u201cWhy are you so snappish about my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of man would stand back and let you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done if your Queen ordered you to let your daughter go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have fought it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did! He lost.\u201d She winced and wrapped her left arm around her belly. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s going to yell at me when I get home. He\u2019ll hug me and get teary about the bruises, and then he\u2019ll yell at me.\u201d</p><p>Since he wanted to do a bit of yelling himself, Jared leaned forward and patted her shoulder gently. And found he now understood his father\u2019s outbursts while still able to remember how it felt to be on the receiving end. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem fair, does it? Getting yelled at when you\u2019ve already been through a hard time and survived it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and sniffed.</p><p>The pats changed to soothing circles.</p><p>Jared hesitated. \u201cThere had to be other ways of letting Dorothea know the Gray Lady is still a formidable adversary. Was going to Raej to get a few more slaves really worth this risk?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became brutally hard. \u201cThere are no slaves in Dena Nehele,\u201d she said coldly, and shifted just enough to let him know his touch was no longer welcome.</p><p>Hurt by the withdrawal, he matched her coldness. \u201cWell, if you keep your precious Territory clean of the stink of slavery, whatdo you do with the slaves you buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend them home, of course. That is, if they want to go home.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him.</p><p>Stopped his brain, stopped his heart, and withered his anger.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Jared\u2019s voice broke. His heart started again with a leap. \u201cYou send them home?\u201d</p><p>Cupping both hands around her mug, Lia finished the brew. \u201cYes, we send them home\u2014or invite them to stay if \u2018home\u2019 is no longer a safe place for them.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment and took a couple of deep breaths. \u201cDorothea SaDiablo wants nothing less than to control the entire Realm of Terreille. That\u2019s been her goal since she became the High Priestess of Hayll centuries ago. Since outright war would have devastated the Realm, she had to find a different way of waging war on the rest of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear,\u201d Jared said softly. \u201cOver time, fear between the genders would undermine a Territory.\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded. \u201cAnd shehas time since Hayllians are a long-lived race. The seeds of distrust are sown village by village while she nurtures the lighter-Jeweled witches who have the same twisted nature that she does. Strong males who might not submit to one of her pet Queens are usually Ringed young, before they become \u2018dangerous.\u2019 Mature males who challenge the new rule are declared rogues and are either hunted down and killed or go into hiding. All of the dark-Jeweled witches and most of the Queens are broken young so there\u2019s no one left for the males to bond to except Dorothea\u2019s chosen.\u201d</p><p>Jared set his mug on the floor and clasped his hands tightly, unable to say anything. Would slavery have been his fate even without that youthful mistake? Would the Shalador Queens have demanded he submit to a Ring of Obedience in order to control his Red strength?</p><p>No. Not in Shalador.</p><p>\u201cIt happens slowly,\u201d Lia continued. \u201cOver several generations. On the surface, nothing seems to change because it\u2019s so subtle at first. A new interpretation of Protocol. A wariness when dealing with the stronger witches. Rumors. Stories of mistreatment. The alliance with, and dependence upon, Hayll grows and grows until the day comes when one of Dorothea\u2019s pet Queens rules the Territory. By breaking or enslaving the strongest and the best, they keep the rest of the people submissive, too afraid to fight or speak against them.</p><p>\u201cFor a long time, Gran couldn\u2019t see any way to fight Dorothea except to form strong alliances with the Queens in the neighboring Territories. Then, a few years ago, a Queen\u2019s nephew was taken from the court where he was in training, along with three other young Warlords. She searched for weeks, trying to find some trace of him. She\u2019d almost given up when she received an unsigned note that said the young Warlord was unharmed and continuing his training\u2014in the High Priestess of Hayll\u2019s court. If the Queen welcomed Hayll\u2019s next gesture of friendship by agreeing to meet with the Hayllian ambassadors to discuss some \u2018concessions,\u2019 her nephew would continue his training, unharmed. If she refused, as she\u2019d been doing for several years, her nephew would be sold as a slave at the Raej auction.\u201d</p><p>Feeling chilled, Jared wrapped a blanket around his shoulders. \u201cShe refused.\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded. \u201cOne of the witches in her First Circle volunteered to go to Raej to buy the Queen\u2019s nephew. She took two guards with her. None of them came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the Gray Lady went the next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Besides wearing the Gray Jewels, Gran can be very intimidating when she wants to be. Her friendships with Queens outside of Dena Nehele have always been discreet, so there was no reason to believe anyone at Raej would connect her with the young Warlord.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s heart thudded against his chest. \u201cShe bought him?\u201d</p><p>Lia shook her head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t there. Not that time. To justify her presence, she bought a couple of other males, choosing by instinct. Once she got them to Dena Nehele, she offered to help them return home. At first, they didn\u2019t believe her and kept looking for a trap. When they finallydid believe her, they didn\u2019t want to go home because, at best, it would put their families at risk and, at worst, they\u2019d end up dead or enslaved again. So they stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Gray Lady continued to buy slaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt became a subtle way to fight Dorothea. Some of the males went home, fiercely determined to keep Hayll\u2019s taint from spreading. Others settled in Dena Nehele or one of the surrounding Territories.\u201d</p><p>Jared cleared his throat. \u201cDid she ever find her friend\u2019s nephew?\u201d</p><p>Lia shuddered. \u201cYes. The fourth time she went to the auction.\u201d</p><p>Someone hesitantly knocked on the wagon\u2019s door. Grateful for the interruption, Jared answered swiftly.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Blaed grumbled, thrusting a plate of sandwiches and apple slices at Jared. \u201cThera got hungry. She also wanted another mug of that brew you made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prepared two more gauze bags before I came out here,\u201d Jared said as he took the plate and the two filled mugs.</p><p>\u201cI know. The brew\u2019s in one of those mugs, too.\u201d Blaed scowled at the mugs and then shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll know which one when you taste it.\u201d</p><p>Jared thanked him and hoped Blaed made it back to the stone building before he fell asleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They ate in companionable silence. Jared didn\u2019t want to break the easiness between them, but Lia had only told him the first half\u2014the half, he noticed, that didn\u2019t have much to do with her.</p><p>Jared rubbed his face, willing himself to stay awake a little longer. \u201cAll right. The Gray Lady needed to make one more appearance at Raej. I understand that. Sort of. But, Lia, once you\u2019d purchased the slaves, why didn\u2019t you buy passage to a Coach station closer to Dena Nehele\u2019s borders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to but . . .\u201d Lia bit her lip. \u201cThe message came, and I got scared.\u201d</p> <p>He remembered the note she\u2019d been given just before she went into the ticket station. And the fear in her after she\u2019d read it. \u201cWhat did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018They\u2019re waiting for you in the west.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who sent it?\u201d</p><p>Lia shook her head. \u201cA masculine hand, but I didn\u2019t recognize the writing. I thought it might be a trick, too. That\u2019s why . . .\u201d She waved a hand to indicate the wagon, supplies, everything. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did well, Lady,\u201d Jared said with warm approval. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t there a Coach station near the inn where you got the wagon and supplies? Why didn\u2019t we take another Coach from there to Dena Nehele instead of making this journey?\u201d</p> <p>Lia turned her face away from him. Her fingers worried the blanket. She nibbled her lower lip.</p><p>Jared felt the warning prickle between his shoulder blades. His heart began to pound painfully against his chest. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we take another Coach, Lady Ardelia?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cEverything cost more,\u201d she said hurriedly, defensively. \u201cYou have to hire two guard escorts if you\u2019re going to buy slaves so that one can stay with the slaves while the other accompanies the buyer, and they charged me a third more than the witch ahead of me. I couldn\u2019t go into the auction grounds without the escorts, and when I argued about it, that bastard in charge just smiled and said, \u2018That is the fee, Lady.\u2019 And the bidding went higher than we\u2019d anticipated, always more than the person\u2019s \u2018working value.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She was no longer talking to him, explaining to him. He wondered how many times over the past few days she\u2019d argued this with herself.</p><p>And what, exactly, was she trying to justify?</p><p>\u201cI think some of the other buyers were just bidding against me to force the price up,\u201d Lia continued, sounding more and more desperate. \u201cBut it was the last time, don\u2019t you see? I couldn\u2019t walk away from the ones we\u2019d been asked to look for. I couldn\u2019t. I tried to fool them by bidding on a few slaves and stopping when the price started to climb, but it didn\u2019t work, and after buying passage for the first Coach, there weren\u2019t enough marks left to buy passage again so I had to do something else, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>Jared considered the expense of purchasing the horses, wagon, clothing, and supplies for this desperate gamble. Outfitting them for this journey probably cost her half the fare for herself and twelve slaves.</p><p>But that still wasn\u2019t an answer. In his youth, he\u2019d given enough explanations at breakneck speed to know when someone else was trying to provide a smoky truth to hide the real reason for something.</p><p>He leaned over and covered her hands with his. The moment he touched her, he knew.</p><p>\u201cHow many were you supposed to bring back, Lia?\u201d he asked softly, baiting her. His anger was rising again. And beneath the anger was grief.</p><p>Soclose , he thought.So close .</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t set an exact number,\u201d Lia mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>She trembled beneath his hands and wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p> <p>\u201cWho were you asked to look for?\u201d Jared asked, struggling to keep his voice gentle.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cEryk and Corry. Blaed and Thayne. Polli.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s hands tightened until she made a small, hurt sound. Not trusting himself, he released her and shoved his fists into his pockets. \u201cIf you were supposed to bring Polli back, how could you give her to that rogue bastard?\u201d</p><p>Lia\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cPrince Talon isnot a bastard\u2014 of any kind,\u201d she said hotly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good, honorable man. Besides, he\u2019s Polli\u2019s uncle. Since he was the one who asked us to look for her, why shouldn\u2019t I send her with him when there was the chance?\u201d</p><p>Jared stared at Lia and then shook his head to clear it. That hard-eyed Warlord Prince was Polli\u2019s uncle? Well, that explained why she\u2019d been willing to go with him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I know the message wasn\u2019t a trick,\u201d Lia said, bristling. \u201cThe escorts who were waiting for us at the western Coach station were attacked. When we didn\u2019t meet Talon as planned, he and some of his men started looking for us.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. She slumped, as if her body couldn\u2019t stay upright once anger no longer supported her. \u201cMy uncle was leading the escorts who were supposed to bring us home.\u201d</p><p>Jared moved to her bench and put his arms around her. He stroked her hair and rocked her, murmuring soothing noises while she cried out the fear and grief she\u2019d had to hide.</p><p>When she finally quieted, he called in a handkerchief and let her sniffle into it for another minute before slipping a finger under her chin, forcing her head up.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me the real reason you didn\u2019t buy passage?\u201d he asked gently. Before she could say anything, he pressed a finger against her lips. \u201cLet me tell you what I think happened. You arrived at the auction ground as soon as it opened and spent the day going from auction block to auction block until you found all of the people you\u2019d come for. Probably took you the best part of the day, too. I imagine you bought a couple of the others while you were searching so that it wouldn\u2019t be obvious you were waiting for particular slaves to come to the block, but you would have been careful not to overspend at that point. Then, once you had the five you came for, you still had enough marks to buy three or four more slaves. But you wouldn\u2019t have settled for the first ones who came on the block after that. You would have looked for people who could still appreciate the gift of freedom. Since there were so many and you could take so few, making those hard choices took some time. Right?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, by the time you\u2019d made your next-to-last purchase, there were still plenty of gold marks left to buy the double passage that would get you to a Coach station close to the Tamanara Mountains. And don\u2019t give me any nonsense about the escorts bringing the marks with them for the next step of the journey. I had originally trained as an escort, Lady, and no man who serves in that capacity would have let you leave without making sure you had the means to get home on your own.\u201d He raised his voice to drown out her indignant sputters. \u201cSo there must have been a secondary plan if you couldn\u2019t meet them as agreed. Which meant you had the funds for that second passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared pressed his finger against her lips again. \u2018\u201cYou came to buy five, and they were expensive purchases. Brock and Randolf would have been expensive, too. But Garth? You might have paid more than a simple, expendable laborer was worth, but it wouldn\u2019t have lightened your purse by much.\u201d When she started to protest, he held his hand firmly over her mouth. \u201cRaej might be the prime slave fair and slave-owning might be an aristo indulgence, but even there a young, half-Blood male like Tomas wouldn\u2019t go for much. With the way aristo Blood males have been mounting Ian-den females, you can go into just about any village and buy a starving little bastard of either sex. And little Cathryn\u2014 a pretty Blood female that an aristo male would use as a breeder after his broken wife produced the one child she\u2019d be capable of bearing. But Cathryn\u2019s only nine, and if healthy offspring are the intention, she isn\u2019t going to be useful for several more years. So she wasn\u2019t going to go for much either. Thera? I can\u2019t imagine you had much competition bidding for a broken Black Widow with a vicious temper. Which leaves me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>Jared took his hand away from her mouth and found he needed a moment to steady himself. \u201cIt was me, wasn\u2019t it? Until you bought me, you still had the funds to buy passage on another Coach.\u201d</p><p>Lia shook her head, but he saw the truth in the shadows that darkened her gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know where the bidding starts for a fully trained pleasure slave\u2014even a vicious one. And even though you weren\u2019t bidding against anyone, the auction steward wouldn\u2019t have accepted a price that was much less than the starting bid would have been. So I was the purchase that emptied your purse a little too much.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me I have things in the wrong order, Lia. It was almost closing when you came down to those pens. So I was the last one.\u201d Taking the handkerchief, Jared wiped the fresh tears from her face. \u201cWhy, Lia? Why were you even down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lia said, her voice catching. \u201cI just needed to go down there. I knew there was something I needed to see.\u201d She gave him a defiant look through eyelashes that were spiky from the tears.</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cA compulsion spell?\u201d</p><p>Lia jerked. Her eyes widened, then narrowed thoughtfully. After a moment, she shook her head. \u201cI would have sensed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you? If a darker Jewel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the drills I was put through,\u201d Lia replied sourly. \u201cNo. I know what compulsion spells feel like. And I was drilled in how to look for all kinds of illusion webs, which is why I sensed something odd about Thera.\u201d She shook her head again. \u201cIf itwas a compulsion spell, it was awfully subtle.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have expected any other kind if it came from Hayll. Subtle and twisted. Now was probably not a good time to remind her that being able to recognize akind of spell didn\u2019t guarantee being able to recognize aparticular spell.</p><p>Had he been the bait for a trap? Had Dorothea deliberately warned Lia away from that Coach station so that she\u2019d be stranded still within Hayll\u2019s reach, forced to travel overland instead of riding the Winds? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jared said. \u201cIf you were planning to let us go, why didn\u2019t you tell us at the inn? Why did you buy the wagon at all? No, look.\u201d He gripped her shoulders. Remembering her bruises, he lightened his hold. \u201cIf you\u2019d told us then, there were five of us who could have ridden the Winds and you would have had plenty of marks to buy passage for the others.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face and, after a moment, reached a decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a ... wrongness . . . here. I can\u2019t explain it better than that. I didn\u2019t sense it until we were all together. In a way, Istill can\u2019t sense it, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt first I thought it was the illusion webs Thera and I were using, but it\u2019s more, Jared, and I can\u2019t pinpoint the source. It\u2019s like catching something out of the corner of your eye but not being able to see it when you try to look directly at it. I couldn\u2019t risk bringing that wrongness into Dena Nehele. I couldn\u2019t risk having someone who might be full of Hayll\u2019s kind of poison living freely among my people. So I decided to keep everyone together and let them think they were still slaves until I could find the source.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned back. \u2018\u201cYou let Polli go.\u201d</p><p>Lia took a deep breath, let it out slowly. \u201cI told Talon about the wrongness. He\u2019ll take . . . precautions.\u201d She smiled bleakly, her eyes so full of shadows. \u201cBesides, the wrongness is still here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a couple of minutes. Then he stood up. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep better on a mattress in front of the fire than on a hard bench out here in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lia hunched her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was more snap than shadow in her eyes now. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m claiming Escort\u2019s Privilege.\u201dCheckmate, little witch , Jared thought as he smiled at her. When a Queen\u2019s escorts weren\u2019t available, another male could take on the duties of looking after the Lady. Since it was a temporary arrangement, Queens rarely refused a male\u2019s claim\u2014especially if his Jewels happened to outrank hers.</p><p>She muttered and sputtered while he bundled her up and carried her out of the wagon. Her comments about escorts poking their noses into personal concerns became more pungent after he asked her if she needed to use the privy hole.</p><p>\u201cThere were extra mattresses, so I put down a double thickness for you,\u201d Jared said as he carried her to the building.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThera got a double mattress, too.\u201d</p><p>That shut her up so he didn\u2019t mention Thera\u2019s reaction to Blaed\u2019s proprietary courtesy, or that Thera had tried to bite Blaed when the young Warlord Prince tucked the covers around her. No point giving the little witch ideas.</p><p>The men were all awake when he brought Lia into the building, but no one spoke, no one stirred. Subdued by their presence, she let him settle her on the mattresses and fuss with the blankets. Her only response when he snugged his mattress up to hers was to turn her face away from him.</p><p>The rejection stung a little, but he stretched out beside her and tried to ignore it.</p><p>A few minutes later, the slow, steady breathing told him everyone else was asleep.</p><p>Jared propped himself up on one elbow and watched Lia.</p><p>Knowing he would be free once they reached Dena Nehele felt like a different kind of slavery. He couldn\u2019t run now, couldn\u2019t escape, couldn\u2019t go home. Her explanation had been fine as far as it went, but she hadn\u2019t known about the wrongness when she bought him\u2014which meant she had risked herself and the others to keep him from going to the salt mines of Pruul. How could he walk away when she needed his strength?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. As much as he wanted to go home, he couldn\u2019t leave her now.</p> <p>As he blinked back tears, he slipped his hand under Lia\u2019s blanket, searching for her hand. She might have turned her face away from him, but her fingers curled trustingly around his.</p><p>Lying there, watching her sleep, he was torn between what he wanted to do and what he had to do. He no longer needed any tangible proof that the Invisible Ring existed, because the Ring no longer mattered. There was only one choice he could make now and live with. Until this journey ended and Lia was safely home, his strength, his maleness, belonged to her.</p><p>Sighing, Jared settled down and closed his eyes.</p><p>My father would say you haven\u2019t grown into your skin yet.</p><p>He\u2019d barely had time to get used to the feel of his Red strength when he\u2019d been tricked into slavery. So maybe Blaed\u2019s father was right about that. And if thatwas true . . .</p><p>Had being enslaved somehow frozen him in that transition between youth and man? If he\u2019d remained in Ranon\u2019s Wood, would he have eased into the more aggressive nature of an adult Red-Jeweled male, the change happening slowly so that what he felt inside was justmore instead ofother ?</p><p>Jared opened his eyes and stared at the dark ceiling above him.</p><p>Other. Like the wild stranger. The part of himself that had been suppressed for nine years, until rage had let it burst free. Theadult Warlord who kept pushing at him to embrace it, accept it.</p><p>He would have to embrace it, would have to accept it, no matter how much he feared it. He needed that strength and aggression if he was going to keep Lia safe.</p><p>Two nights from now, the full moon after the autumn equinox would rise. For a Shalador male, it was the night of the dance.</p><p>And the dance would be the right time to call the Warlord back to himself.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Settled into one of the dainty chairs that were scattered around her sitting room, Dorothea SaDiablo sipped her morning coffee while she studied her Master of the Guard. She had one leg tucked under her, which made her red-silk dressing gown split enticingly high. Her hair flowed over her shoulders, creating a sleek, black frame for her half-bared breasts. She looked more like a whore in the most expensive Red Moon house than a High Priestess.</p><p>Then again, Krelis thought, all women were whores. Some were just honest about it.</p><p>\u201cHave you any news?\u201d Dorothea asked, setting her cup on the low table in front of her. She picked up a warm breakfast pastry shaped like a crescent, broke it in half, then delicately licked the torn edge. And all the time, she watched him.</p><p>It took effort not to shift his weight from foot to foot, but he reminded himself that he was no longer a Third Circle guard who didn\u2019t understand the dangers of accepting an aristo witch\u2019s sexual lures.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Dorothea put .the half crescent in her mouth, closed her lips around it, pulled it out again. Slowly. While she watched him.</p><p>Krelis had to clear his throat before he found his voice. \u201cNo, Priestess, I have no news. But even riding the Winds, it takes time to reach Hayll,\u201d he added quickly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dorothea purred. \u201cI\u2019m simply concerned that the more time it takes to complete this little task, the more chances she\u2019ll have to slip away.\u201d</p><p>He understood the threat beneath the pleasantly spoken words. \u201cShe won\u2019t escape, Priestess. I swear it on my life.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea smiled brilliantly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s legs turned to jelly. Before he could think of some way to respond, the door between the bedroom and sitting room opened.</p><p>The Warlord toy-boy didn\u2019t look sulky or defiant this morning. And he didn\u2019t have the sated look of a man who had spent a hot night in bed. He looked haunted, numb, as if he\u2019d passed beyond fear sometime in the early hours and was only beginning to feel the tingle of reawakened emotions. The hunger in his eyes was focused on the coffeepot and basket of pastries, not on the barely dressed woman.</p><p>Krelis watched Dorothea\u2019s expression change. She reminded him of a satisfied cat who had just remembered the mouse beneath her paw.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early, darling,\u201d Dorothea purred. \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Flinching, the Warlord obeyed.</p><p>After tossing the half crescent back into the basket, Dorothea raised her arms and stretched luxuriously. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing quite like staying in bed on a rainy morning, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, just a moment, Krelis pictured the three of them tangled in satin sheets and wasn\u2019t sure if he felt revolted or aroused. Then common sense\u2014and a healthy dose of fear\u2014grounded him. Hoping she\u2019d overlook his hesitation, he tried to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary indulgence for Ladies. Unfortunately, the mundane tasks we males perform don\u2019t disappear in rainy weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve kept you from your tasks long enough,\u201d Dorothea said with a knowing smile. \u201cI imagine your mother enjoys rainy mornings.\u201d</p><p>The verbal knife slipped past all his defenses and left him bleeding. \u201cI imagine so, Priestess,\u201d he said weakly.</p><p>A muffled, pitiful weeping came from behind the bedroom door.</p><p>Turning toward the sound, Dorothea stroked her breasts.</p><p>Krelis fled.</p><p>He walked back to the guards\u2019 quarters, completely unaware that he was getting soaked to the skin.</p><p>Aristo word games. Sentences with layers of meaning.</p><p>He remembered the mother of his childhood as a lovely woman content with her life; a woman who filled the house with her laughter and singing; a woman whose eyes lit up when his father was in the room.</p><p>He remembered the woman who fought with a witch\u2019s passion when the Healer tried to refuse to help Olvan; the woman whose pride and courage had shamed the merchants when they tried to insist that she pay immediately instead of sending her a monthly account as was customary; the woman who looked her neighbors in the eye until they avoided her.</p><p>He remembered the woman whose courage finally crumbled after so many years of isolation; the woman who became emotionally bitter and brittle; the woman whose eyes were full of contempt for the man she\u2019d loved; the woman who kept her distance from her son, as if he, too, would place a burden on her that was past bearing.</p><p>He remembered the woman who crept back to her family, leaving him to deal with the merchants and face the neighbors, leaving him with that soul-withered husk of a man who spent his days rereading beloved books and never going beyond the garden gate, leaving him to share in his father\u2019s shame for no other reason than because he was male. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he remembered the woman who brought him back into her family once he\u2019d severed all ties with Olvan; the woman who had looked at him out of dead eyes; the woman who flaunted a string of lovers, who spread her legs for any male who had some position and power.</p><p>Oh, yes, he imagined his mother stayed in bed on rainy mornings.</p><p>Krelis reached his rooms and stripped out of his wet clothes.</p> <p>Aristo games. Witches\u2019 games. He still didn\u2019t really know the rules. Despite having ties with the Hundred Families, his people had been countryfolk. He hadn\u2019t been raised to play these games. Dorothea must have known that.</p><p>Which made him wonder, for the first time, why she had chosen him to be her Master of the Guard.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Jared slipped out of the stone building, pausing to take a deep breath of crisp night air. No one would follow him. He\u2019d made it clear since the evening meal that he wanted to be alone. Lia was settled for the night and wouldn\u2019t need him for a little while.</p><p>Jared smiled. Lady Ardelia had spent the past two days resenting needing him at all, giving him dark looks and muttering under her breath every time he\u2019d carried her from the table to her mattress. Every time he\u2019d carried her to the privy hole, it had taken her resentment half an hour to thaw enough for her to speak to him again. And every time she\u2019d tried to get around him, he\u2019d remind her of Escort\u2019s Privilege and wisely stay out of reach for a few minutes while she muttered and snarled.</p> <p>But his \u201cunreasonable\u201d attitude and stubbornness about not letting her walk on her injured leg had produced swift results. By combining his basic healing skills with Thera\u2019s and Lia\u2019s knowledge of healing, they had almost fully healed her knee, enough so that this afternoon she\u2019d been able to hobble around as long as she held on to something\u2014usually Tomas\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Her efforts to resist help from him had irritated and amused him in equal measure. At least she\u2019d had sense enough to restrict her helpers to Thera and the children. It would be ludicrous to feel jealous about them, and he could tolerate Blaed\u2019s courtesies to Lia because Blaed was interested in Thera. But the other adult males . . .</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so much jealousy, he decided as he studied the full moon and clear sky. It was the possessiveness and territoriality that was a male\u2019s response to a witch\u2019s moontime.</p><p>Especially a witch who was also a virgin. It was the sexual potential of the other males that put him on edge, made him watch them with suspicious eyes whenever they got too close to Lia. After all, they hadn\u2019t known each other when Lia bought them a few days ago\u2014and a few days didn\u2019t buy a lot of trust when balanced against instincts bred into males for generations\u2014and those instincts had been riding him hard since they got back to the clearing.</p><p>Or, perhaps, it was the way his own blood heated every time he touched her that was making him edgy.</p><p>Fortunately, the other males had decided not to test his self-control.</p> <p>Shaking his head, Jared walked to the north end of the clearing.</p><p>He would have thought a Queen would enjoy a little pampering. The witches who had controlled his life for the past nine years certainly had. Hell\u2019s fire, a pleasure slave who didn\u2019t jump to satisfy the slightest whim could lose what few privileges he had\u2014or worse, find himself tied between the whipping posts.</p><p>Then again, Reyna had never been gracious about Belarr\u2019s pampering during the first three days of her moon-time either. The first day she\u2019d snap and snarl at him about his constant fussing, even though it hadn\u2019t been constant. Belarr had the administrative duties as the District Queen\u2019s agent for Ranon\u2019s Wood to handle, as well as three young sons to keep occupied so they would give Reyna some peace. It was like a moon\u2019s blood ritual between them. Reyna would snap and snarl until Belarr would respond with, \u201cWhen you married me, you granted me the right to fuss.\u201d That would usually silence her. Perhaps it was being so vulnerable that made it hard for her to yield, because on the fourth day, when shecould wear the Jewels again and use Craft, she enjoyed Belarr\u2019s pampering.</p><p>Once, after Reyna\u2019s temper had been especially harsh, Jared had asked his father why he tolerated being treated that way. Belarr had said, \u201cEven a man who is loved and trusted is feared a little during these days. If showing a bit of temper makes her feel safer, that\u2019s fine with me since there\u2019s no cruelty in it. Besides, this is a small price to pay for the rest of the days . . . and the nights,\u201d Belarr had added quietly, smiling.</p><p>Jared smiled at the memory. He didn\u2019t think Belarr had meant for his son to hear that last bit. Or maybe he had. The sons had understood early on that, when it came to Reyna, their father had the dominant claim.</p><p>Tomorrow would be the fourth day of Lia\u2019s moontime. Maybe she would let him fuss without snarling at him.</p><p>When he reached the edge of the clearing, his smile faded. He looked back at the stone building. Nothing stirred.</p><p>Good. This night, which was usually a public celebration, wasn\u2019t something he wanted to share. Not this time.</p> <p>Jared stepped into the woods beyond the clearing, following the winding footpath through the trees until he reached the narrow creek. Part of it had been diverted to spill over carefully arranged stones into a small, man-made stone pool, then spill over again to flow into a stone-supported channel for a few yards until it rejoined the rest of the water.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes. It had been so long, but if hereally listened, he could hear the drums in the wind gently stirring the trees, and the water dancing over the stones.</p><p>He opened his eyes and called in the crystal goblet. His uncles had given it to him, along with the small silver chalice, after he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness. Like the Jewels, he had carried the goblet and chalice with him, hidden from the witches who had owned him because he hadn\u2019t wanted to risk having them taken away from him.</p><p>Holding the goblet under the falling water, he filled it and drank, pouring out the last swallow to share it with the dark land.</p><p>Filling the goblet again, Jared stepped over the narrow creek and followed the path to the second clearing.</p><p>He\u2019d found it the first day they\u2019d returned to the main clearing. While Brock and Randolf had gone out to hunt fresh meat, he\u2019d cautiously probed the clearing\u2019s defensive shields and discovered they extended beyond the cleared land. So he\u2019d followed the path to this small, second clearing, also strongly shielded but for different reasons.</p><p>It was a perfect circle that had been seeded with grass. A few feet in from the perimeter, two large stones had been carefully placed to support a slab of granite, forming a small altar. In the center of the circle was a shallow fire pit surrounded by stones.</p><p>The land had absorbed the giving done here, becoming a sacred place. Unlike the Sanctuaries that had a formal altar and a Priestess to tend them, these small places were found throughout the Realm of Terreille. Private places, where the Blood came to reaffirm their bond to the land and the life that sprang from it; where they quietly made the descent into the abyss until they reached their cores and opened their inner barriers; where the power flowed through them and they became a channel between the night sky and the dark land, giving one kind of strength and taking back another. It was in places like this that the Blood came to honor the Darkness.</p><p>Placing the crystal goblet on one side of the altar, Jared called in the small silver chalice and set it on the other side. Moving with the measured step of ritual, he walked to the fire pit, created a tongue of witchfire, and lit the pile of kindling and wood he\u2019d gathered earlier to create a small bonfire.</p><p>Almost ready.</p><p>He undressed, leaving his clothes on the path just beyond the circle. Shivering, he returned to the altar and called in the folding knife he\u2019d honed that afternoon. He knelt before the altar, carefully opened his wrist, and let the blood, hot from the vein, flow into the small silver chalice. Once the chalice was filled, he put a warming spell on it to keep the blood heated. Then he vanished the knife, pressed his thumb over the wound, and walked back to the edge of the clearing.</p><p>On the edge of Ranon\u2019s Wood was a natural bowl. Surrounded by the grassy slopes was the large dance circle, its dirt carefully sifted and raked. At the new and full moons, the witches gathered there to dance privately with their Sisters. But the full moons after the spring and autumn equinox were the public celebration of the male.</p><p>As the sky darkened and the moon began to shine, the males would gather in the streets, quietly talking, watching the women drift casually toward the circle.</p><p>As they followed the women, they would hear the drums, the Craft-enhanced sound rising out of the bowl and filling the countryside. Then the Priestess\u2019s voice would rise above the drums in wordless song, calling them to the dance. Another witch\u2019s voice would be added to hers, and another\u2019s, and another\u2019s.</p><p>Slowly the males would flow up the slope and down the other side, filling in the spaces that had been left between the women as the Priestess lit the bonfire. One by one, the women\u2019s voices would quiet. The Priestess would tip the large silver chalice and cast the circle with Craft and the blood the witches had offered for the dance. By the time the circle was completed, it was only her voice and the drums, calling.</p><p>The Wisdom Dance, the elders\u2019 dance, came first. Standing at the edge of the circle, the Priestess would extend her hand and bring the first man across. She continued bringing men across the circle, finally stepping out as the last man who chose to dance stepped in.</p><p>The drums would change the beat. The fiddle and flutes would take the place of the women\u2019s voices. And the men would dance the steps that had been danced since the time of the great Queen Shal.</p><p>After the Wisdom Dance, the Priestess\u2019s voice would rise again with the drums. The elder males would come to the edge of the circle and bring across the young males who had gone through the Birthright Ceremony for the Boys\u2019 Dance.</p><p>The Wisdom Dance expressed experience and dignity; the Boys\u2019 Dance celebrated high spirits and energy.</p><p>Then came the Youths\u2019 Dance for the males who had gone through puberty but had not yet made the Offering to the Darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the Youths\u2019 Dance came the dance celebrating male power in all its primal glory. The Fire Dance. The dance of sex.</p><p>Consorts, husbands, and males who were handfasted could wear short loincloths if they wanted to. The other males, those who had made the Offering but were not yet formally bound to a woman, indicated their willingness to become lovers by wearing nothing but their Jewels and their pride.</p><p>A hot dance. A grinding dance whose steps were as formal as all the others and yet blatant and arousing, promising pleasure.</p> <p>You\u2019re not old enough for the Fire Dance, Jared.</p><p>But I\u2019ve made the Offering!</p><p>Yes, you have. But in most other ways, you\u2019re still a youth.</p><p>I\u2019m ready for the Fire Dance, Father.</p><p>Jewels or no, being a man is more than having a hard cock.</p> <p>But\u2014</p><p>We\u2019ll talk again before the spring dance. Everything has a price, Jared. You can\u2019t take a man\u2019s pleasure without taking a man\u2019s responsibilities, too. You may be ready for the one, but you aren\u2018t ready for the other.</p><p>Jared watched the fire rise toward the sky.</p><p>Had that been part of it? Still sulking like the youth he truly was, had he ignored the warnings and accepted that witch\u2019s invitation in order to defy his father\u2019s judgment and prove he was a man?</p><p>Except Belarr had been right. Hehadn\u2019t been ready for the Fire Dance. He had briefly enjoyed a man\u2019s pleasure and then paid a brutal price.</p><p>Stepping forward, Jared inspected the wound on his wrist. It had already begun to clot.</p> <p>He called in the knife again, reopened the wound, then vanished the knife. Using Craft and the blood dripping from his wrist, he cast a circle big enough to contain the altar and enough space around the bonfire for a single dancer.</p><p>As soon as the circle was cast, he used healing Craft to seal the wound.</p><p>He closed his eyes, swaying slightly. He could hear the drums and the women\u2019s voices calling the Shalador males to the dance.</p><p>His heart began to beat in time with the drums.</p><p>His blood heated.</p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p>On the other side of the bonfire was another male, a phantom shape with blazing green eyes and golden skin.</p><p>Jared\u2019s breath caught as the wild stranger bared its teeth in a smile that challenged him to embrace\u2014toaccept \u2014what it meant to be an adult Red-Jeweled male.</p> <p>Primal and savage, the Warlord had come to the dance.</p><p>The drums got louder.</p><p>Returning the smile, Jared began the Fire Dance.</p><p>Round and round they went as the music became more urgent, more demanding. Round and round. Skin glistened with sweat from the heat of the bonfire and the heat of the dance.</p><p>Emotional chains that he hadn\u2019t known were there broke and melted away. Social restraints burned in the fire.</p><p>Faster and faster. Heart pounding. Feet pounding.</p><p>Side by side now, they danced, drawing the male fire closer and closer to the surface until it consumed everything else.</p><p>The drums became more insistent as the music built to the climax.</p><p>Jared kept dancing, dancing, dancing.</p><p>His body throbbed as the Warlord, with a savage smile, slowly faded as it filled him, flooding him with a fierce, triumphant hunger.</p><p>The drums faded, and the Fire Dance came to the end.</p><p>Jared stumbled away from the fire and sank to the ground, exhausted and painfully aroused. His body quivered and burned as he stretched out full length on the cold ground.</p><p>Too sensitive to bear the prick of grass, he rolled onto his back and stared at the moon.</p><p>He needed. Mother Night, how he needed!</p><p>His rational mind supplied a terrifying word for the intensity of his condition.</p><p>Rut.</p><p>Except for Warlord Princes, Blood males rarely experienced the rut, that savage, almost uncontrollable need for sex. That Warlord Princes went through the rut once or twice a year was one of things that made them what they were\u2014and one of the reasons they were considered so dangerous. During the rut, their tempers rode the killing edge for so long almost anything could provoke them into violent destruction. Other males weren\u2019t safe around a male in rut. Even women weren\u2019t safe from the cold rage that was entwined with hot desire.</p><p>What made it so hard to control was that simple release brought no relief from the sexual madness. A male\u2019s need could easily outstrip a woman\u2019s endurance, but a male in rut focused all his energy on one woman and couldn\u2019t tolerate being handled by anyone except her, could barely tolerate other women\u2019s presence since they both excited and enraged him.</p><p>Jared started to shake. The rut shouldn\u2019t have happened. He was certain other males didn\u2019t experience this after the Fire Dance. There would have been whispers, warnings. And not every male who danced the Fire Dance had a lover waiting for him when it was done. Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d never sensed anything like this in his father. There had always been a light in Belarr\u2019s eyes after the dance, and he\u2019d been impatient for his sons to settle down and get to sleep once they got home, but there hadnever been any hint ofthis .</p><p>Could it be ...</p><p>Jared swallowed hard, dug his fingers into the earth.</p><p>Could this have happened because all the years when he should have done the Fire Dance and hadn\u2019t been able to had funneled into this time, his first time? That all the sexuality he should have celebrated and had to suppress during the nine years of slavery was the reason the hunger was so potent now?</p><p>His rational mind would be overwhelmed soon. If he didn\u2019t act in the next few minutes . . .</p><p>There was no one in their group who could contain him unless Lia used the Invisible Ring against him. Even if she did, would she use it forcefully enough to contain a male in rut?</p><p>Lia.</p><p>Involuntarily his hunger sharpened, found a focus.</p><p>Getting to his feet, he released the power in the circle he\u2019d created, retrieved his clothes, and dressed.</p><p>The fabric pressing against his throbbing cock maddened him, and he bared his teeth in a savage smile. His green eyes narrowed as he picked up the small silver chalice and took a sip of his own blood, pleased by the zing of power and strength it gave him.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d he whispered, raising the chalice to the sky for a moment. Lowering it, he slowly poured the blood onto the ground before the altar. \u201cSweet Darkness, accept this offering from one of your sons.\u201d</p><p>He drank half the water in the crystal goblet, then poured the rest into the chalice to clean it. He gave the blood-tinted water to the land, dried the goblet and chalice with his shirt, and vanished them. After placing a shield around the fire pit so that the bonfire could safely burn itself out, he left the small clearing.</p><p>As soon as he entered the main clearing, he saw her standing in the doorway, wrapped in a blanket. She was staring at the path that led to the lane and didn\u2019t notice his slow, predatory approach until he was close enough to see the sadness in her eyes change to surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here, Lia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I woke up and saw you were gone. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to tell him what she\u2019d thought before he pulled her into his arms and kissed her with rough desperation. He ran his hands over her body, frustrated by the blanket and the layers of clothes that separated skin from skin. He wanted to tear away those barriers so that he could kiss her, lick her, caress her until she was as frantic as he. When she tried to pull back, he tightened his hold and pressed her hips against his so that, even with all the layers between them, there was no way she could miss that he was fully aroused.</p><p>He kissed her again, tasted fear\u2014and realized her heart wasn\u2019t pounding with excitement and her body wasn\u2019t trembling because of building passion.</p><p>Let her go, a voice inside him warned.Let her go. No woman, especially a virgin Queen, should experience this kind of fear .</p><p>The warning disturbed him, but he couldn\u2019t let her go. He had no control over the hands exploring her body. He couldn\u2019t give up the maddening pleasure of rubbing against her.</p><p>He felt rage building in response to her fear. For one moment, his mind cleared and horror washed through him as he realized how easily he could destroy her right now.</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cLia, I\u2019m in rut. Your fear is making it worse.\u201d Pressing his lips against her temple, he licked the frantic pulse. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be afraid of me, Lia. I won\u2019t hurt you. I swear by the Jewels I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d She sounded breathless. \u201cJared, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. Could you . . .\u201d He took a deep breath to steady himself. \u201cCould you hold me? Please?\u201d</p><p>The shaking hands that had been pushing at his chest stilled.</p><p>Jared waited, hardly daring to breathe.</p><p>He stifled a groan as Lia\u2019s hands slowly, hesitantly, slid down his chest and settled at his waist. He forced his hips to stay still. After a minute, she gained enough courage to slide her arms around him and stroke his back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough, but as she relaxed against him, it soothed the hunger sufficiently that he didn\u2019t feel so wildly out of control.</p><p>After a while, she leaned back and looked at him.</p><p>His hands slid up her back and over her shoulders, finally cupping her face. He traced her lips with the tip of his tongue. Since she didn\u2019t protest that action, he kissed her again, this time letting his mouth softly melt into hers.</p><p>When he raised his head, he saw confusion in her eyes\u2014 and maybe a little hunger.</p><p>Looking flustered, Lia turned her head slightly, then frowned at his wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>A different kind of tremor went through him. He wanted her to turn her head a little more, close her mouth over the wound, and lap the drops of blood welling up from his wrist. He wanted to make a small nick in the hollow of her throat and drink from it.</p><p>Jared dropped his hands, shaken.</p><p>A Queen didn\u2019t accept blood from any but her First Circle.</p><p>A male didn\u2019t accept a Queen\u2019s blood unless he was offering to surrender his life to her will. A court contract was a formal, written agreement weighted by honor and Protocol. A blood bond was a lifetime commitment.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Lia said. \u201cYour wrist needs care and you need something to eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>She led him inside, walking slowly but more easily. When they reached the kitchen area, she created a small ball of witchlight, enough to see by but not enough to disturb the others.</p> <p>He stood passively while she used healing Craft on his wrist. He watched her dab an herb paste over the wound. All he could think of as she wrapped some gauze around his wrist to protect it was how good her hands felt and how much he wanted her to stroke him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using too much Craft,\u201d he said as she warmed some of the meat left over from dinner and sliced the bread without using a knife.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss now, Jared,\u201d Lia replied, keeping her voice low. \u201cYou can fuss tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>She looked startled for a moment and then sighed. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p> <p>Pleased by that, he managed to bite back another comment when she used Craft to heat a mug of water for an herbal brew.</p><p>A soft stirring. A change in the feel of the room as someone rose and approached them.</p><p>Snarling, Jared whirled around.</p><p>Thera gasped and took a step back.</p><p>The hunger inside him grew knife-edged teeth that savaged his self-control as he caught the slight muskiness in her psychic scent that signaled a sexually mature witch. Lia\u2019s scent was a blend of muskiness and innocence that helped sedate the hunger. Thera\u2019s scent enraged it.</p><p>After glancing at Lia, Thera licked her lips. \u201cLord Jared, if you require\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Jared snarled. He felt insulted by the offer. Insulted and a little humiliated that she had so little respect for him that she would offer to take him in front of Lia.</p><p>Which made him want to hurt her. Badly.</p><p>\u201cGo back to bed, Thera,\u201d Lia said softly.</p><p>Thera glanced at Lia again and nodded.</p><p>Jared stood there, saying nothing, not even daring to look at Lia until Thera was once more tucked in on the mattress next to Blaed\u2019s.</p><p>Lia touched his arm. \u201cYou need to eat and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m such a whore that I\u2019ll willingly go with any woman who snaps her fingers?\u201d he asked harshly.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re not a whore, Jared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what a pleasure slaveis , Lady.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed his arm to comfort him. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not a pleasure slave anymore.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThera made the offer out of friendship for you and concern for me. I don\u2019t think it was an easy thing for her to do. Let it go now. You\u2019re not thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>Rage and hurt swirled through him, confusing him. Submitting to her gentle coaxing, he felt a little steadier when she placed the food on the table and then sat next to him, even allowing him to feed her small bites of bread and meat. By the time he finished the meal, he was shivering from fatigue.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed now,\u201d Lia said, guiding him to the mattresses. \u201cCan you put a warming spell on the blankets?\u201d</p><p>Stretching out on his mattress, Jared nodded.</p><p>Her fingers lightly brushed his dark hair. \u201cSleep, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He tried because she\u2019d asked him to. But the spell-warmed blankets didn\u2019t stop the shivering, and the presence of the other males made him tense and angry. He also knew they were all awake now and aware of the reason for his tension . . . and feared it.</p><p>Half an hour later, he gave up and crept under Lia\u2019s blankets.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me hold you, Lia,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cI need to hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freezing,\u201d she hissed, tucking the blankets around them.</p><p>He settled her comfortably against his side, offering his shoulder for a pillow. Now that he had his arms around her, the other males didn\u2019t bother him as much. The tension eased. Warmed by the blankets and even more by Lia\u2019s presence, his body relaxed.</p><p>Resting his cheek against her soft hair, Jared slept.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d Dorothea SaDiablo shrieked.</p><p>Krelis\u2019s fury overwhelmed his usual fear of Dorothea\u2019s temper. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Gray Lady. It\u2019s some little Green-Jeweled bitch-Queen who used an illusion web to trick herself out so she could prance into Raejpretending to be the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea\u2019s gown swished like an angry cat\u2019s tail as she paced her private receiving room. Her eyes narrowed to slits. Every breath came out as a hiss.</p><p>Krelis watched her, saying nothing, unwilling to pull her attention back to him. While he waited, his left thumb rubbed the palm of his right hand. He\u2019d clenched the two brass buttons so hard while he\u2019d unraveled the spells on them and extracted the message that they\u2019d left a sharp impression in his flesh.</p><p>Those impressions would fade. The kind of impression Dorothea would make on his flesh if she decided this was somehow his fault . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dorothea finally said, slowing to a more thoughtful pace.</p><p>\u201cWe know the Gray Lady was hurt in the attack last spring,\u201d Krelis said cautiously. \u201cPerhaps more than we\u2019d realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not enough. The Gray is still strong in Dena Nehele.\u201d Dorothea tapped a long, red-tinted nail against her lips. \u201cBut if the body had been maimed . . .\u201d She waved a hand at Krelis, as if he had dared to interrupt her. \u201cAn illusion web would be able to hide any disfigurement, but a crippled limb wouldn\u2019t function properly and would be quite noticeable, especially since Grizelle\u2019s stride is as well known as her power. What did your pet have to say about the little bitch?\u201d</p><p>Watching Dorothea\u2019s hand stroke her rich red gown from breast to thigh, it took a moment for the words to sink in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a young Green-Jeweled Queen. Her name\u2019s Arabella Ardelia. Shesays she\u2019s taking them to Dena Nehele on the Gray Lady\u2019s behalf.\u201d He almost told her the rest and decided against it. Those kinds of details werehis problem.</p><p>\u201cGrizelle\u2019s daughter is a Black Widow,\u201d Dorothea said, more thinking out loud than talking to him. \u201cA well-trained one. She\u2019d certainly be capable of creating an illusion web like that. But to trust ayoung witch with the task . . .\u201d</p><p>Krelis shrugged. \u201cMaybe she resembles the Gray Lady more than other witches in the court.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea stopped pacing, an arrested look in her eyes. Then her lips curled in a malicious smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d She swayed toward him, lightly stroked his face, and drifted away. \u201cYou have a delightful mind, Lord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>Krelis wasn\u2019t sure if his knees had jellied from the hot little sexual jolt she\u2019d given him or from his fear of what her nails might have done to his face.</p><p>Then he remembered all the plans that were being threatened by that little bitch-witch, and his fury drove out everything else.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you, Priestess, this Arabella Ardelia will never reach Dena Nehele.\u201d Krelis laughed nastily. \u201cWell, she may reach it, but what\u2019s left of her won\u2019t be any good to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea gave him a sharp, assessing look. \u201cNo,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cShe is not to be harmed.\u201d</p><p>Krelis stared at her.</p><p>\u201cShe is not to be harmed,\u201d Dorothea repeated. \u201cBring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that filth in Hayll?\u201d Krelis\u2019s voice quivered with outrage.</p><p>Dorothea smiled as if he\u2019d done something pleasing. \u201cA young witch who would be trusted with such a task must be highly valued by the Queen and her First Circle, but she\u2019s still just a pawn we might be able to use against the Gray Jewels\u2014especially if Grizelle feels some emotional attachment to the girl. Here the little bitch can be taught to be of service.\u201d Dorothea\u2019s gold eyes glittered. \u201cAnd if her own stubbornness or Grizelle\u2019s unwillingness to extend some courtesies to Hayll results in the girl being disciplined, it\u2019s something the Master of the Guard should see to personally. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Krelis bowed. \u201cI would be pleased to teach the little witch how to serve.\u201d More than pleased.</p><p>Dorothea studied him for a moment, then smiled. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>With a measured stride, Krelis walked across the large courtyard that formed the center of the guards\u2019 quarters. Discreetly hidden from the SaDiablo mansion by a stand of trees, the quarters were close enough for the guards to answer a summons quickly and yet still far enough away not to intrude on aristo pleasures.</p><p>It also meant that the screams that accompanied punishment were distant enough not to arouse the Black Widows in Dorothea\u2019s coven or the other witches in her First Circle. Or the High Priestess herself.</p><p>And it meant that the female slaves who took care of the guards\u2019 needs weren\u2019t blatantly in evidence. Not that the witches didn\u2019t know about them. They knew, just as they knew that the common female servants were used by the court males in the same way.</p><p>Krelis walked toward the end of the courtyard, his eyes fixed on the naked man tied between the whipping posts. Using a hard cock was one way to get rid of anger.</p><p>This was another.</p><p>Krelis stopped a few yards away from the whipping post and waited for Lord Maryk to join him. \u201cEverything ready?\u201d he asked calmly, pleased that his voice betrayed none of his doubts or fears.</p><p>Lord Maryk looked at him for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>Moving slowly, as if he were stalking prey, Krelis circled the whipping posts until he stood in front of the marauder leader.</p><p>\u201cI helped you,\u201d the man spat as he struggled against the leather straps holding him taut. \u201cIs this how you honor your agreements?\u201d</p><p>Krelis slapped the marauder, just hard enough to sting. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d Krelis replied, filling his voice with contempt.</p><p>\u201cWe were ready for them. A perfect ambush about a mile from that bridge. I told you that. I brought you the buttons. How were we supposed to know the bitch would unleash witchfire like that?\u201d</p><p>Krelis cocked his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t try very hard to find out what happened to the wagon, did you? Didn\u2019t try very hard to catch up with the bitch when you could have taken her by surprise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man looked at him defiantly. \u201cWe found the clearing. Found that rogues\u2019 nest for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound it empty,\u201d Krelis snapped. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t taken youthree days to pick up the trail, it would have been stuffed with prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have mattered if they were there or not,\u201d the man argued. \u201cItold you what those protection spells were like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you told me,\u201d Krelis replied, making sure the man understood he hadn\u2019t believed half of what he\u2019d been told. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to take the risk. You didn\u2019t have to flush them out. All you had to do was keep them in and send a message to me. I would have been there with enough trained guards to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you sending any of your trained guards to do the hunting,\u201d the marauder sneered. \u201cI don\u2019t see any Hayllians risking themselves against the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>Rage burned Krelis.</p><p>Doubts and fear froze him for a moment, then, circling the whipping posts, he snatched the knotted, triple-tailed whip from a guard\u2019s hand.</p><p>The whip whistled through the air. Struck. Cut deep.</p> <p>\u201cBeg for mercy,\u201d Krelis snarled as he applied the lash over and over again. \u201cBeg for Hayll\u2019s mercy, and maybe I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>The man screamed, begged, pleaded.</p><p>Deaf to all of it, Krelis let his anger sing through the whip.</p><p>Long after the marauder stopped screaming, Krelis finally dropped the whip and turned away.</p><p>Eyeing him warily, Lord Maryk stepped forward. \u201cWhat should we do with that?\u201d</p><p>Krelis didn\u2019t look back at the mess that had once been a man. \u201cCastrate him and break him,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cThen let the slave Healer see what she can do. If he lives, work him.\u201d</p> <p>Krelis walked away, fighting the need to run.</p><p>Once he was safely inside his office, he closed the shutters on the windows that overlooked the courtyard and pulled a bottle and glass from a corner cabinet. His hands shook as he poured a large brandy, downed it, and poured another. By the third glass, he felt like he could take a steady breath.</p><p>Turning, he stared at the two brass buttons that sat in the center of his desk.</p><p>Deceitful, Gray-Jeweled bitch. Deceitful, cowardly bitch to hide within the borders of her Territory. It was one thing to be up against the Gray Lady\u2019s cunning; it was quite another to have some Green-Jeweled chit running around making a fool of him. He should have had her by now. It would have beenfinished by now if the little bitch had shown some sense or leadership ability. About the only rational thing she\u2019d done was continue to head northwest toward the Tamanara Mountains, and even then her choices had no rhyme or reason. She was either very smart or very stupid. Either way, it shamed him that she\u2019d eluded him so far.</p><p>Unless someone else was behind this.</p><p>Like that Shalador Warlord.</p><p>No. The man had spent the past nine years as a pleasure slave.He wouldn\u2019t have many useful skills outside the bedroom, while he, Krelis, had spent centuries training to be a warrior, a guard.</p><p>He would show everyone, including the older guards who still had doubts about his ability to command, that he was worthy of being Master of the Guard by bringing the Gray Lady to her knees.</p> <p>Except Dorothea wasn\u2019t helping, which was something he hadn\u2019t calculated on and didn\u2019t dare point out. Perhaps it was better to say she was helping too much. That trap she\u2019d convinced another Black Widow to set at the creek hadn\u2019t done anything except spoil a good ambush. And no amount of gold marks and promised favors would keep marauder bands on the hunt if they became worried about getting caught in someone else\u2019s trap.</p><p>There was nothing he could do about Dorothea, but that little bitch-witch . . .</p><p>She was threatening all his plans, all his dreams. What made these puny, flash-in-the-pan races think they could be anything but Hayll\u2019s servants? The Green-Jeweled bitch might see a hundred years. He could reach five thousand. Who was she to snuff out his ambitions? She would be gone in a finger-snap of time while he would reap the rewards or suffer the disappointments for centuries to come.</p><p>While he might fear being so close to her, Dorothea had the power and the vision to rule the entire Realm of Terreille. Hell\u2019s fire, almost half the Realm already stood in Hayll\u2019s shadow. And all those Territories would eventually need overseers to remind them of Hayll\u2019s greatness and ensure that they remained loyal.</p><p>When the time came, why shouldn\u2019t he be one of them? Why shouldn\u2019t he receive the wealth of a Territory\u2019s tithes and the power that was the right of those who ruled?</p><p>And with that influence, why shouldn\u2019t he have a light-Jeweled witch for a wife, one who would be so grateful for the safety he offered that she\u2019d submit to his wishes, in bed and out? Why shouldn\u2019t his children serve in important positions in a court?</p><p>Lady Arabella Ardelia threatened all of it.All of it.</p><p>Krelis carefully set the glass on the desk.</p><p>He would find her. He would bring her back to Hayll. He would teach her how to serve like a good little witch.</p><p>Just like he\u2019d taught that other little bitch-Queen.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with the horses?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Blaed and Thayne exchanged looks, each one waiting for the other to say something.</p><p>Watching them, Jared tried to still a growing uneasiness. He\u2019d pushed the group hard yesterday, partly to put as much distance between them and the clearing as possible and partly because pushing himself physically was the only way he knew to stay sane and not hurt anyone. Thank the Darkness, the rut had only lasted one day, but it had been a long, miserable day. If his pushing had injured the horses . . .</p><p>Jared eyed the team hitched to the wagon. \u201cIs one of them lame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing serious like that,\u201d Blaed said hastily.</p><p>Jared ground his teeth. The rut might be over, but his temper was still frayed. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t we moving?\u201d</p><p>Thayne gave Blaed a \u201cgo on, tell him\u201d look.</p><p>Blaed glared at his friend and then turned back to Jared. He looked like a man who had just bared his throat after handing a witch a well-honed knife. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Sighing, he raised his hands in a helpless gesture. \u201cWe think they\u2019re sulking.\u201d</p><p>Jared stared at the two younger men long enough to make them squirm. \u201cSulking?\u201d</p><p>Thayne flinched.</p><p>Blaed huffed, then gingerly put his hand on Jared\u2019s shoulder, leading him a little ways from the wagon.</p><p>Confused, Jared let himself be led. Brock and Randolf were on the saddle horses, scouting ahead. The others had stopped walking once they realized the wagon had fallen so far behind and were just starting to drift back to find out why. Lia was safely tucked in the wagon. And Thayne already knew what the problem was.</p><p>So who wasn\u2019t supposed to overhear this conversation? The horses?</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been feeling a little . . . overprotective . . . lately,\u201d Blaed began cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019vegot balls to say that to me,\u201d Jared snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Blaed hurried on, \u201cdoes Lady Liahave to stay in the wagon? And there\u2019s no point snarling about it not being the proper form of address. Tomas started calling her that and, since she didn\u2019t mind, the rest of us just followed his lead.\u201d</p><p>But not in front of him, Jared thought. They\u2019d called her Lady Ardelia when he\u2019d been within earshot. He understood why, but it still made him snappish. \u201cThe Lady has healed remarkably well, but she\u2019s in no condition to be walking for hours over rough ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to walk,\u201d Blaed soothed. \u201cIf we used some blankets for padding and she bundled up well so she wouldn\u2019t get chilled, couldn\u2019t she sit on the driving seat for a while?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s teeth hurt. He tried to relax his jaw. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with the horses?\u201d</p><p>Blaed sighed. \u201cThayne\u2019s real good with animals. Better than anyone else I know.\u201d He sighed again. \u201cHe thinks they miss her. You didn\u2019t spend much time leading them, so you probably didn\u2019t have the chance to notice the difference in how they responded whenever she took a turn at walking. Didn\u2019t you wonder why she always stayed near the wagon? It\u2019s because whenever she moved too far away, they tried to follow her. One time when she went into the bushes to answer a call of nature, the only thing that stopped them from going with her was Garth grabbing the harness and digging his heels in. And she sings to them.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed his hands over his face. Great. Wonderful. \u201cDidn\u2019t you explain to them that Lia\u2019s in the wagon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s downwind, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. All right. I\u2019ll ask her.\u201d</p><p>Giving Jared\u2019s shoulder a cautious pat, Blaed stepped out of reach.</p><p>Jared marched to the back of the wagon and spent a minute glaring at the door. The horses weren\u2019t the only ones sulking today. She\u2019d let him fuss yesterday. It was the only thing that had gotten him through the rut. Sex might have helped, but he wasn\u2019t sure. The kind of sexual fury that had roared through him wouldn\u2019t have been easy to control, and there had been times yesterday when he\u2019d been clearheaded enough to imagine what he\u2019d be like in bed.</p><p>It had terrified him, and he\u2019d clung to the knowledge of Lia\u2019s virginity like an emotional lifeline. Even the rut was daunted by the risks and responsibilities of the Virgin Night.</p><p>So he\u2019d fussed. He\u2019d pampered and petted. He\u2019d kissed and cuddled. She\u2019d asked him to brush her hair. She\u2019d let him feed her. She\u2019d rubbed his back, making him ache for release and yet soothing him until it was almost enough.</p><p>Between the times when he\u2019d gone to the wagon for the relief her presence gave him, he\u2019d tried to work off the energy, tried not to see the other males as rivals.</p><p>It had been a physical and emotional strain for everyone, and he\u2019d blinked back tears when, halfway through the restless night, he\u2019d felt the rut waning.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized something else would wane, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d said good night to Lady Cuddles, and woke up to Lady Grumpy.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d Tomas peeked around the side of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be around here during the next few minutes,\u201d Jared growled.</p> <p>Owl-eyed, Tomas darted back to the others.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jared rapped on the wagon door\u2014 more a warning than a request to enter\u2014opened the door, and ducked the boot that went whizzing over his head. He got the door closed before the second boot, aimed lower, could join its partner.</p><p>Retrieving the boot, he rushed into the wagon, tripped over the other boot, and swore.</p><p>She was sitting in the dark. Naturally. What good was sulking if you made yourself comfortable?</p><p>He made a ball of witchlight, then leaned against the door.</p> <p>After one good glare at him, Lia stared at her feet.</p><p>Jared waggled the boot. \u201cDidn\u2019t your grandmother ever tell you it isn\u2019t courteous to throw a boot at your escort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo sit on a pricker bush.\u201d</p><p>So much for courtesy.</p><p>On the other hand, since she wouldn\u2019t let him fuss, annoying her was almost as pleasing.</p><p>Settling back to enjoy himself, Jared shook his head and tsked sadly. \u201cIt wounds my tender sensibilities to hear you say that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you sat on a pricker bush, your sensibilities aren\u2019t the only tender things that would be wounded.\u201d</p><p>Jared narrowed his eyes and tried to remember he was enjoying himself. \u201cYou let me fuss yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was yesterday. I\u2019m mad at you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lia\u2019s voice rose to an outraged screech. \u201cWhy? Because I let you fuss yesterday. I let you treat me like some oversize baby bird whose mama keeps stuffing it with food\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stuff you,\u201d Jared grumbled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t argue with you when you snarled everyone out of the wagon or when you got nasty with Tomas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get nasty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t say a word when you bundled me up in so many blankets I couldn\u2019t move at all. All right. Fine. You needed to fuss. But that\u2019s no excuse for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d Jared raised his hand to rake his fingers through his hair and almost clobbered himself with the boot. Tossing it aside, he rubbed his hands over his face. Was aggravation supposed to be one of the privileges of serving? \u201cWhat did I do today?\u201d</p><p>His ignorance seemed to outrage her even more.</p><p>\u201cThera\u2019s moontime isn\u2019t any further along than mine, but do you fuss about her? No.\u201d</p><p>Jared bristled. \u201cBlaed doesn\u2019t need any help fussing about Thera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. The point is, you insisted that we stay in the wagon yesterday, and we did. But this morning, when Thera decided to walk, you didn\u2019t say a thing. Not the littlest yip or snarl. Then whenI said I wanted to walk, you bundled me up and chucked me in here.That\u2019s why I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d Lia sat back, crossed her arms, and pouted.</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with your moontime,\u201d Jared shouted. \u201cIt has everything to do with the fact that Thera has two legs that work and you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath and released it slowly. He\u2019d seen too many sulks and pouts used as manipulative games. Most of the time it had brought an edge to his temper and a stubborn refusal to respond. But he suspected this wasn\u2019t Lia\u2019s usual way of dealing with opposition of any kind. She had the safety of eleven other people weighing on her young shoulders, and she was feeling the strain.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jared said, trying to bring his voice back to soothing, \u201cwhen we stop to rest for the midday meal, you can walk around a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not moving now,\u201d Lia pointed out.</p><p>Which reminded him of why he was there in the first place. \u201cThat\u2019s because I wanted to see if you were willing to compromise.\u201d</p><p>Amazing how fast a pouting witch could change into an alert Queen.</p><p>\u201cWhat compromise?\u201d Lia asked, watching him a little too sharply.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought you might like to sit on the driving seat for a while. But you have to promise not to throw your boots at me, and you have to promise to keep the blankets tucked around you so that you don\u2019t get chilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much difference sitting on the driving seat and sitting in here,\u201d Lia said calmly. \u201cSo I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cSure there is. You can get some fresh air, see some of the countryside . . . hum to the horses.\u201d</p><p>Lia\u2019s smile was far too knowing and smug for his liking. \u201cHaving trouble with Boots and Button?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>Jared raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat kind of names are those?\u201d</p><p>Lia shrugged. \u201cThey answer to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you name the saddle horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirt and Handsome. If the bay had been a stallion, I would have named him Stubborn, after you.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled wickedly. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing a stallion and I have in common.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.</p><p>He liked the way she blushed, the way she suddenly turned shy.</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to go out and hum to the horses or stay in here with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t found it so amusing, he would have been insulted by the speedy way she burst out of the nest of blankets.</p><p>He carried her outside, ignoring her mutters about walking, and presented her to the horses\u2014and tried not to resent the cooing and petting they received. Then he settled his bundle of witch on the driving seat, tucking the blankets around her to his satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was simple enough,\u201d Blaed said as he and Jared watched the happy horses and Thayne set off at a brisk walk.</p><p>\u201cSimple as could be,\u201d Jared replied, dropping a hand on Blaed\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEspecially since you\u2019re going to keep her company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Blaed looked wistfully up the road.</p><p>Jared followed the direction of Blaed\u2019s attention. \u201cItwas your idea to have Lady Lia sit out here, Blaed. Not that I told her that. So there\u2019s no reason for her to feel annoyed withyou .\u201d He gave Blaed a friendly punch in the arm and smiled too innocently. \u201cTell you what. You look after my Lady, and I\u2019ll look after yours.\u201d</p><p>Knowing there was nothing Blaed could say to that, Jared jogged up the road to join Thera, leaving Blaed to entertain Lia.</p><p>Frustration felt so much better when shared.</p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d Jared asked when he caught up to Thera.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d Knowing Blaed was watching, Jared threw one arm around Thera\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Thera turned her head and stared at the hand so close to her teeth.</p><p>Resisting the instinct to jerk his hand away, Jared hoped she\u2019d let him keep all of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Jared said cheerfully. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just think of me as another older brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a brother, older or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a sister. Let\u2019s pretend.\u201d</p><p>Her huff turned into laughter.</p><p>It jabbed his heart.</p><p>He\u2019d thought she was in her late twenties, about his own age. Now, with her face softened by humor, he wondered if she was even close.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from, Thera?\u201d Jared asked, curious about her.</p><p>The laughter died. The softness disappeared from her face, making it look older again.</p><p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>He heard the pain in her voice and wanted to ease it without betraying Lia\u2019s confidence about their being set free. \u201cPerhaps, when we reach Dena Nehele, you can persuade the Gray Lady to let you return to your family.\u201d</p><p>Because he was touching her, he felt the fierce grief that flashed through her before she was able to lock it away again.</p><p>\u201cI have no family,\u201d Thera said coldly.</p><p>Sorry for having brushed against a heart-wound, Jared tried to find something else to talk about. \u201cBlaed likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlaed\u2019s a fool,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Thinking of how Blaed looked at her, with too much of his heart in his eyes, Jared\u2019s sympathy for Thera rapidly faded.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said politely, \u201cdoes being a bitch come naturally to you, or do you have to work at it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to lash out at him. It unnerved him to see tears fill her eyes and spill over.</p><p>\u201cThera,\u201d he said softly, trying to hold her close to comfort her while she struggled to break away from him.</p><p>She stopped fighting and rested her head against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s safer to be a bitch. Can you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can understand that,\u201d Jared said, gently wiping the tears away with his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to let go of a useful weapon. Hard to trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He hugged her once, then eased back, pleased when she didn\u2019t shake off the arm draped companionably around her shoulders.</p><p>After they\u2019d been walking for several minutes, he broached the question that had nagged at him for the past few days. \u201cWhat were you doing at Raej, Thera? Why was a Green-Jeweled, unbroken Black Widow submitting to the humiliation of the auction block?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo escape. Why else?\u201d</p><p>Dry, sharp amusement lit her green eyes for a moment. When it faded, Jared looked into a spiritual desert.</p><p>Thera took a deep breath, let it out slowly. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t very bright.\u201d Her laugh was tinged with bitterness. \u201cThe landens always think being Blood and using Craft has to mean we\u2019re all very powerful, very wealthy, very intelligent. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re any of those things. We\u2019re just Blood.</p><p>\u201cShe was pretty and gentle and had an innate sweetness that made her shine. Or it would have if she\u2019d stayed in her home village living a life that suited her. But one day, a Warlord from the Province Queen\u2019s court rode through the village and saw her. Courteous and admiring, he spent the afternoon with her, carrying her market basket and acting as if he\u2019d never seen anyone quite so wonderful. Then he rode back to the court, and she was pleased to have been admired. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA few weeks later, the Province Queen summoned her to the court and offered her a place in the Fifth Circle.

He gallantly offered to escort my mother through the intricacies of court life. Since he was the only person she knew there, she accepted his company with open arms.

Even with all the care that\u2019s taken, it happens sometimes. So sorry.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, he couldn\u2019t marry her after that. Neither his family nor his Queen would grant permission for an Opal-Jeweled Warlord to marry a broken witch who wasn\u2019t aristo. But she could be his lover, and in his heart she would always be his wife. It didn\u2019t take her long to discover there wasn\u2019t much difference between being a lover and a slave. At least, not in a court that had spread its legs for Hayll.</p><p>\u201cHe liked to hit. He enjoyed hurting anything or anyone who was weaker. He used to slap her to excite himself before he mounted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she leave him?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cShe had signed a contract to serve in the court. The Queen wouldn\u2019t release her. Staying with him protected her from the other males.\u201d Something fierce began to glow at the back of Thera\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think she\u2019d challenge him about anything. But when I had the Birthright Ceremony and it was time for her to formally grant him paternal rights, to give him a claim to me, she denied paternity. Said it wasn\u2019t his bloodline that ran in me. What could he do? Granting paternity is a public ceremony, and there are no second chances, no retractions.</p><p>\u201cShe sent me to her sister. My aunt had left the home village a few years before\u2014I never found out why.\u201d Thera paused for a moment. \u201cAuntie had a lover, a Purple Dusk Warlord. They\u2019d never formalized their union in any way. There were no records to link one to the other. He was a good man, solid and strong, easy-tempered. He worked hard for the first hug I freely gave him.\u201d</p> <p>Jared smiled sadly. He could imagine the pleasure and relief the man had felt when he finally overcame her sire\u2019s viciousness. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p><p>Thera shook her head. \u201cHe had a sister, a Sapphire-Jeweled Black Widow who lived in another village. She was a force to be reckoned with, and males who tried to force themselves on women, Blood or landen, usually found themselves impotent for weeks afterward. She spent a few days each month with her brother and Auntie. She had friends in her own village; she also had enemies. So she spent those first days of her moontime where she had the protection of the one male she could trust.</p><p>\u201cShe was born to the Hourglass, like me. Like calls to like. I\u2019d barely settled in with Auntie when I met her. The next day, she began my training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were very young to begin training in the Hourglass\u2019s ways,\u201d Jared murmured.</p><p>Thera nodded. \u201cYes. Because of that, there was a lot she couldn\u2019t teach me. I wasn\u2019t mature enough mentally or emotionally to endure it. It wasn\u2019t formal training. More like I\u2019d show her how much I could do of what she\u2019d shown me the last time. Sometimes we took the next step in that lesson; sometimes she began something new.</p><p>\u201cShe never actually said anything, but we all understood that her training me had to be a secret, that my being a Black Widow had to be a secret. By the time I reached puberty and would have been recognized for a child of the Hourglass, I\u2019d learned how to mask my psychic scent well enough to fool even a darker Jewel.</p> <p>\u201cThe ugliness had started by then\u2014Queens and darker-Jeweled males muttering about Black Widows being dangerous, how they were emotionally unstable because of their journeys into the Twisted Kingdom, how only Hayllian witches had the lifespan and the maturity needed to handle the Black Widows\u2019 Craft. The males began to break young Black Widows\u2014for their own good, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d Jared snarled softly.</p><p>\u201cThe month before I turned eighteen, the Black Widow showed up unexpectedly. She said she\u2019d been thinking about me while she was weaving a tangled web of dreams and visions. She said if I didn\u2019t make the Offering to the Darkness before the next moon, I never would. And if I didn\u2019t have my Virgin Night before the Offering, I would never reach my nineteenth year.\u201d</p><p>Thera leaned against Jared. Surprised by her sudden weariness, he slipped his arm from her shoulder to her waist to support her.</p><p>\u201cAuntie\u2019s lover saw me through my Virgin Night,\u201d Thera said quietly. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy about it, but there was no one else we could trust, so he accepted his duty. He was generous and kind. When it was over and we were sure my inner web was intact and I still had my Jewels and my Craft ... I think he was more relieved than I.</p><p>\u201cA week later, we went to a Sanctuary a couple of days\u2019 ride from Auntie\u2019s village. The Priestess there and the Black Widow were friends. I made the Offering and came away with the Green Jewels.</p><p>\u201cThe day after I turned eighteen, my sire sent a message. My mother was dying and asked to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went back to the court,\u201d Jared said, his temper simmering.</p> <p>\u201cI went back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a trick,\u201d Thera agreed.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wasn\u2019t dying, was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, she was,\u201d Thera replied too calmly. \u201cHe\u2019d tortured her. After what he\u2019d done to her, there was nothing shecould do but die.</p><p>\u201cShe hadn\u2019t asked for me. She hadn\u2019t wanted to see me. The anguish in her eyes was all the warning I needed. I was the last cruelty, you see. She\u2019d thwarted his having any control over me, so now he\u2019d take me. He wanted her to know that all the sacrifices she\u2019d made, all the pain she\u2019d suffered was for nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe dragged me into the next room. There was a grille in the wall beside the door. There was no way she couldn\u2019t hear what was happening in that room.</p><p>\u201cHe raped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Jared protested. \u201cYou said he wore the Opal. You outranked him. You were stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dragged herself to the grille and pleaded with him to stop. She couldn\u2019t really talk, couldn\u2019t really form words. Not that it would have made any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThera!\u201d Red mist coated the road and land around them. Jared shook his head to clear the rage from his vision.</p><p>Thera stared at nothing. \u201cWhen he found out he was too late to break me, he beat me.\u201d Her eyes frosted. She looked fiercely triumphant. \u201cAnd I let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared\u2019s voice broke.</p><p>\u201cTo buy time. I\u2019d slipped under his inner barriers just enough to find out why he\u2019d done this. Revenge, Jared. He knew where Auntie lived. He\u2019d learned enough to know about her lover and the Black Widow sister. He planned to have them all killed because my mother had defied him. He intended to make sure I had no one to run to if I managed to get away from him again. But he\u2019d wanted me under his control before he ordered the executions. That was his first mistake.</p><p>\u201cSo I fought hard enough to enrage him, to excite him with the spilled blood. And while he raped me again, I sent a message to Auntie on a distaff thread and told her to leave, to vanish and never look back. The Green was strong enough to reach that far. I knew they\u2019d warn the Black Widow.</p><p>\u201cEven Auntie wouldn\u2019t have recognized me when he was done. My mother died the next day. The day after that, he sold me to an acquaintance. He never told the man who I was. Since I couldn\u2019t speak clearly, my owner gave me a name. By the time the bruises and swelling went down, I\u2019d woven illusion spells around myself. I didn\u2019t look like a fresh, young eighteen-year-old.\u201d Thera laughed harshly. \u201cI drooled a lot. Staggered around glassy-eyed. Anytime a male sat down, I\u2019d climb into his lap and ask him if he\u2019d like to be castrated because I was sure it would make him feel better not to have those nasty urges.</p><p>\u201cThe son of a whoring bitch couldn\u2019t sell me fast enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had nine owners in the past year. Sometimes the old one remembered to tell the new one my name. When he didn\u2019t, I took another name, confusing the trail even more. My sire tried to keep track of me, you see. He never found my aunt or her lover or the Black Widow. Different names, a different place. They vanished like dreams.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t know what to say. His grief for her made him ache. \u201cYou\u2019ll never look for them, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My sire lost me two owners ago. The name doesn\u2019t match. The description doesn\u2019t match. And by manipulating the last bastard into putting me on the auction block . . . no name, no land, no people. I became no one and anyone. I\u2019d intended to snare some weak-willed fool who wouldn\u2019t even be able to remember buying a female on the auction block. Once he got me out of Raej, I, too, would vanish.\u201d</p><p>Thera bit her lip and shook her head. \u201cBut Lia bought me, so I guess I fouled that spell.\u201d Pulling away from Jared, she started walking quickly.</p><p>Staggered by what she\u2019d told him, Jared stood in the road for a full minute before he hurried to catch up to her. When he was an arm\u2019s length behind her, he said, \u201cThen your name isn\u2019t Thera?\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder. What he saw in her eyes chilled him. \u201cIt is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandens.\u201d Randolf made the word for the non-Blood of each race sound like an obscenity.</p><p>Ignoring Randolf\u2019s surliness, Jared rubbed his chin. The village nestled in the lowland a mile from the hilltop he\u2019d chosen as their midday resting place looked fairly prosperous. From a distance, anyway. His father had always been fair about the tithes required from the landen villages that were bound to Ranon\u2019s Wood, but he\u2019d seen ragged, half-starved people in other Territories who were stripped of so much of their goods and harvests there wasn\u2019t enough left for the whole village to get through the winter months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe might be able to get supplies there,\u201d Jared said slowly, turning to look at Lia.</p><p>She stared at something in the distance and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Jared waited, knowing her answer wouldn\u2019t really have anything to do with supplies\u2014because the Winds ran over that landen village, and anyone she sent was going to be tempted to catch one of those psychic roadways for a fast ride home.</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire,he was certainly tempted, and heknew freedom waited at the end of this journey. Would men like Brock and Randolf, who still believed they were slaves, be able to resist a chance to escape?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need marks to pay for the supplies,\u201d Lia said abruptly.</p><p>Jared narrowed his eyes and studied her stiff back as she slowly walked to the wagon and went inside. He felt the absence of something\u2014as if she\u2019d closed some inner door he hadn\u2019t been aware of, leaving him on the outside. He couldn\u2019t define it, couldn\u2019t even say what was suddenly missing except that, without warning, she\u2019d taken something away that she\u2019d shared with him until now.</p><p>And he resented the loss because he\u2019d done nothing to deserve it.</p><p>Fine, he thought as he brushed past the others and strode toward the wagon. If she wanted to give him the cold shoulder all of a sudden, that was just fine with him. He\u2019d be a good boy and run her errands for her. Just see if he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Why in the name of Hell had she shut him out?</p><p>He pulled up short to keep from knocking her down when she came around the corner of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lia said, holding out a thick bundle of folded marks.</p><p>Jared stared at her. There was no color in her voice, nothing he could read in her gray eyes.</p><p>She was hiding something from him.</p><p>Resentment simmered, deepened into hurt.</p> <p>He took the marks and riffled through the various denominations of gold and silver. She could have bought passage on a Coach for herself, Thera, and the children with what he held in his hand.</p><p>Which made him wonder just how much of her remaining funds she\u2019d given him . . . and why.</p><p>Working to make his voice as colorless as hers, he said, \u201cAm I supposed to buy supplies or the village with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have enough with you to buy what\u2019s needed,\u201d Lia replied carefully.</p><p>\u201cIf I needed more, I could contact you?\u201d Jared watched her, not sure what he was looking for. \u201cYou could use Craft to send it to me.\u201d Damn her, why was she doing this to him? Why was she holding herself as if he\u2019d just beaten her?</p><p>\u201cTake it with you, Jared.\u201d She took a deep breath.</p><p>Jared held his breath and waited. There was something else she wanted to say, something she wanted to tell him. He could feel it. Had she discovered something about the danger that traveled with them?</p><p>She let her breath out and said nothing.</p> <p>Vanishing the marks, Jared mounted the bay gelding. \u201cAnything in particular you want me to look for? Any\u2014\u201d No. he wouldn\u2019t ask her about personal needs. She didn\u2019t want him to meet any personal needs.</p><p>She was a good Queen. He\u2019d give her that. It was his error that he hadn\u2019t realized it was a Queen acting responsibly toward a strong, distressed male and not a woman responding as a woman when she\u2019d let him hold her, kiss her, caress her.</p><p>His mistake. One that wouldn\u2019t be repeated.</p><p>Thera approached them, followed by Blaed.</p><p>\u201cTake Blaed with you,\u201d Thera said.</p><p>Jared knew the words were meant for him, but Thera kept looking at Lia, who hissed in anger.</p><p>\u201cLord Jared\u2019s perfectly capable of obtaining supplies,\u201d Lia said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Thera agreed calmly. \u201cBut two of them will get it done faster. There\u2019s not enough food left to put together a midday meal. How much daylight do you want to waste?\u201d</p><p>The gelding snorted and backed away from the female tempers that gave the air a stormy tang as a silent, vicious argument took place.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lia finally said through clenched teeth. \u201cBlaed will accompany Jared to the village.\u201d</p><p>Circling wide around the two women, Blaed mounted the roan mare.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Jared said coldly.</p><p>Receiving no response, Jared shortened the gelding\u2019s reins and turned the eager horse toward the village. He couldn\u2019t blame it for wanting to get as far away from that anger as possible.</p><p>Blaed didn\u2019t break the silence until they reached the bottom of the hill. \u201cYou and Lady Lia have a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we did, I wasn\u2019t invited to participate,\u201d Jared snarled, urging the gelding into an easy canter.</p><p>\u201cLia trusts you,\u201d Blaed said, raising his voice above the rhythmic sound of pounding hooves. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jared reined the gelding in and slowed to a walk. He glared at the younger man, who met his temper with a steadying calm. \u201cDid Thera shove you into coming with me because you were fussing her too much or because she thought I needed a keeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she thought you needed a friend,\u201d Blaed replied quietly. \u201cLia\u2019s upset. It has something to do with you. Stands to reason you might need to do a bit of snarling yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your reasoning\u2019s faulty,\u201d Jared snapped. And then swore.</p><p>Blaed made no comment, which was all the comment he needed to make.</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with trust,\u201d Jared said after a minute. He wouldn\u2019t let it hurt him. He wouldn\u2019t. \u201cWho else could she have sent? Randolf with his surly contempt? The children? Garth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrock,\u201d Blaed countered. \u201cThera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThera would have needed an escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThera doesn\u2019t need anyone to watch her back.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the tightness in Blaed\u2019s voice, Jared studied the Warlord Prince thoughtfully. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed slowly. \u201cWhat she needs\u2014although she\u2019d deny it with her last breath\u2014is a patient man who could coax her into letting him warm her feet at night.\u201d</p><p>Blaed smiled. \u201cI could say the same about a certain Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could.\u201d</p><p>They sighed in unison.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jared said. \u201cMy mother always said a full belly dulls a sharp temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your mother have a sharp temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally, when we\u2019d annoyed her past her formidable endurance. But she was referring to my father, my brothers, and me. Not that any of us could compete with her temper when she was really fired up.\u201d Jared shifted in the saddle to get more comfortable. He smiled wryly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always easy for her, living with four males. After all, when a boy\u2019s first learning to serve, who better to practice on than his own mother? Shalador boys are given strict boundaries, but an intelligent boy can get into a fair amount of trouble without ever stepping over those lines. And my brothers and I were intelligent boys. Every so often, when all of us had frayed her temper, she\u2019d throw up her hands and shout at the top of her voice, \u2018I\u2019m an intelligent woman, a skilled Healer. Why am I living in a house with four males?\u2019 My father would answer meekly, \u2018Because you love us?\u2019 And she\u2019d look at him and start to laugh. We always got sent to bed early on those nights. Took me years to figure out it wasn\u2019t just so we wouldn\u2019t annoy her further.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s laughter faded as they approached the village.</p><p>Not a good time to stir up memories and unspoken longings, Jared thought. Not when the Winds were within reach.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about going home?\u201d Blaed asked quietly.</p><p>Jared fixed his gaze between the gelding\u2019s ears. \u201cI think about it.\u201d What would he do if Blaed tried to bolt? The Gray Lady was going to send the young Warlord Prince home anyway. Since he was one of the five Lia had been looking for, his family must know the Gray Lady intended to set him free. But what if his familydidn\u2019t know? What if the request to find him hadn\u2019t come from them? They, and Blaed, would believe he was rogue. His family might hide him for a few days, but after that? No chance to dream. No chance to love. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything foolish, are you?\u201d</p><p>Blaed stared straight ahead. He swallowed hard. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do anything foolish.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness.</p><p>They rode into the village.</p><p>It looked too well kept to be deserted, but the streets were empty.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone spotted us,\u201d Blaed said, watching the buildings on their right.</p><p>Jared nodded, keeping an eye on the buildings on their left. The lightest possible psychic probe had confirmed how many people were hiding within those buildings. Most of the time, landens realized it was suicide to attack one of the Blood, especially the Jeweled Blood, but sometimes desperation and sheer numbers could balance out power at a horrific cost.</p><p>\u201cCall in your Jewels,\u201d Jared said softly. He reached into his shirt and pulled out the Red Jewel so that it was visible. \u201cLet them see they\u2019re dealing with the Opal and the Red. If anyone has any ideas about tangling with the Blood, that should be enough to discourage them.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Blaed quickly used Craft to settle his Opal pendant around his neck, then slipped the Opal ring on his finger.</p><p>As they rode slowly down the empty main street, Jared added, \u201cAnd stay shielded.\u201d</p><p>As if realizing a deserted street would cause suspicion, a door opened a few yards ahead of them. An old man stepped out, leaning on a cane for support.</p><p>*The young bucks won\u2019t face us, so they shove an old man into the street to do what they don\u2019t have the balls to do,* Blaed said on a spear thread.</p><p>Worried by the bitterness in Blaed\u2019s voice, Jared reined in the gelding and nodded to the old man. \u201cGood day to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Lords.\u201d The old man clutched the cane with both hands.</p><p>Jared scanned the street. \u201cI see we haven\u2019t arrived on market day. Is there a place we can get supplies?\u201d</p><p>The old man hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t have a market day as such, Lord. But the old woman across the street keeps a store. Food and such. Likely you\u2019ll find what pleases you there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Blood couldn\u2019t read landens\u2019 thoughts without linking with them, which usually tore apart minds that had no inner barriers, but landen emotions were on the surface and easily read.</p><p>The old man\u2019s sorrow speared Jared. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, struggling to keep his voice neutral.</p><p>The old man raised a gnarled hand. One finger brushed the brim of his hat. \u201cThe Blood are good and kind.\u201d</p> <p>Blaed turned the mare sharply. *He might as well have cursed us.*</p><p>*Leash it,* Jared snarled. *They\u2019re frightened people.*</p><p>Blaed took a deep breath. *My apologies, Warlord. I\u2019ll brush off my good manners.*</p><p>Jared nodded, not trusting himself to reply. He understood the sting of the old man\u2019s words. He\u2019d never heard that phrase until he became a pleasure slave. Not a compliment and, in the Territories that stood in Hayll\u2019s shadow, far from a truth. Landens said it the same way a person said \u201cgood dog\u201d to a snarling, vicious animal\u2014as if saying it might make it true, might allow them to escape the encounter intact.</p><p>Tying the horses to a post outside the store, they stood in the doorway, giving their eyes time to adjust to the dim interior.</p> <p>An old woman stood behind a counter at the back of the store. Her shaking hands were pressed flat on the wood so they could see she held no weapons, would pose no threat.</p><p>Jared stepped inside, moving slowly.</p><p>\u201cA good day to you, Lords,\u201d the woman said. Her voice shook, but it wasn\u2019t because of age. \u201cMay the Darkness shine upon you.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cThank you, Lady. We\u2019re in need of supplies.\u201d</p><p>She gestured toward the neat shelves, the small, high-sided tables piled with vegetables and fruits. \u201cWhat I have is yours, Lords.\u201d</p><p>Wondering at the regret he heard in her voice, Jared nodded to Blaed, who began to explore one half of the store while Jared looked over the other half. Since she was obviously a shopkeeper, why would she regret selling her wares?</p> <p>The woman\u2019s behavior was forgotten as soon as Jared rounded a table and saw the fruit hidden behind the apples.</p><p>\u201cHoney pears!\u201d he exclaimed, delighted with the find. Grinning, he cradled one arm and began a careful selection. They\u2019d always been his favorite fruit, all the more special because they ripened after the first harvest celebrations. Small, sweet, and juicy, they didn\u2019t keep well unless they were preserved\u2014Reyna always put up jars of brandied honey pears for the Winsol feast\u2014but he\u2019d always thought the fresh fruit tasted better. And had always thought Reyna\u2019s grandmother extraordinarily farsighted to have planted two honey pear trees on the family land for the gluttonous pleasure of her great-grandsons.</p><p>Two apiece, he decided as he gathered the pears and wondered if Lia had ever tasted one. They\u2019d be expensive. Always were since . . .Jared\u2019s mind stuttered to a halt.... since the trees only thrived in the soil of southwestern Shalador . . . and the land that bordered it.</p><p>Jared walked to the counter and carefully set down his armful of pears at the same time Blaed set down a large bag of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cThese are practical,\u201d Blaed said, smiling indulgently at the pears. When Jared didn\u2019t respond, he shrugged and went back to gathering supplies.</p><p>It was the hardest thing he\u2019d done in a long, long time, but Jared kept his voice casual as he asked, \u201cHow far is it to Shalador?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo full days\u2019 ride north, Lord,\u201d the old woman replied.</p><p>Nodding, Jared turned away to select some apples.</p> <p>Two days to the border. Three days to Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>If he rode the Red Wind, he could be home in less than an hour.</p><p>He could send Blaed back to the wagon with the supplies and stable the gelding here. By the time they cooked and ate the midday meal, he\u2019d be home. Rested, the gelding could catch up to them easily before they stopped for the night.</p><p>An hour. All he needed was an hour to see his family, to talk to Reyna. He\u2019d be gone three hours altogether, four at the most.</p><p>He . . . couldn\u2019t go.</p><p>The pain almost doubled him over.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go. Three hours, three days, it made no difference. If it wasn\u2019t for Lia\u2019s compassion, he\u2019d be in the salt mines of Pruul right now. And she\u2019d be home. Oh, the unknown enemy Dorothea SaDiablo had set among them still would have been there, the danger still would have walked beside her, but surely the Gray Lady\u2019s warriors would have been waiting for her at the mountain pass and would have protected their young Queen at any cost.</p><p>But out here? Brock and Randolf still believed they were slaves, and both were bitter enough to step aside rather than risk themselves for their owner. Eryk and Corry wore Birthright Jewels, but they were too young and had too little training. Whatever useful knowledge Garth had was locked inside him. Little Cathryn had few defenses; Tomas, none. Thayne was a light-Jeweled Warlord but not a fighter. Blaed would fight, if for no other reason than to protect Thera.</p><p>And Thera would fight for reasons of her own.</p><p>Jared straightened up. A shiver ran down his spine.</p><p>Unless she really served elsewhere.</p><p>Unless her past was just a story shrouded in a Black Widow\u2019s Craft.</p><p>Unless there was another reason why she\u2019d changed her name.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t among the ones Lia had been sent to bring back. She\u2019d admitted she\u2019d used a spell to draw the right kind of owner.</p><p>Or just a particular one?</p><p>She and Lia spent a lot of time in the wagon. Alone.</p><p>Green against Green. But if one of those Greens was somehow backed by a Red-Jeweled Black Widow High Priestess?</p><p>Hastily gathering the apples, Jared set them on the counter, noticing that Blaed had added a bag of flour, a small block of salt, and two bags of sugar.</p><p>\u201cI think that will do it,\u201d Jared said, fighting the urge to abandon the supplies and race back to the wagon.</p><p>Fool! Thrice-times fool for leaving her. She was too trusting, too gentle. She\u2019d see the enemy\u2019s smile but not the knife until it was too late. She didn\u2019t have any experience with this kind of treachery.</p><p>\u201cI think we should add a few vegetables to this,\u201d Blaed said. \u201cOnions, at least. And we need meat.\u201d</p><p>Why was Blaed watching him like that? Why was Blaedreally here? To help? Or to warn Thera if he returned sooner than expected?</p><p>*What\u2019s wrong, Jared?* Blaed asked. *All of a sudden, you\u2019re jumping at shadows.*</p><p>Jared added a braid of onions to the supplies. *Am I?*</p><p>A flash of Opal-strength anger touched him.</p><p>*I\u2019m worried about them, too. Lia\u2019s upset, Thera\u2019s edgy Neither of them will say why.* Blaed\u2019s temper flared. *You\u2019re not the only one who believes in honor, Warlord.*</p><p>They turned away from each other and began selecting vegetables at random, ignoring the old woman who watched them anxiously.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath. Returning to the full counter, he used Craft to float the vegetables so they wouldn\u2019t bruise the fruit and offered the wide-eyed woman a shrug and a smile.</p><p>Deciding that he, at least, was finished, he watched Blaed pick up winter squashes and put them down without choosing any of them. And remembered something about the Warlord Prince\u2019s training that he shouldn\u2019t have discounted.</p><p>*What do you think Sadi would do if he were here?* Jared asked.</p><p>*I wish he was,* Blaed replied, facing Jared. *Then whatever was troubling Thera and Lia wouldn\u2019t trouble them for long.*</p><p>Their eyes met and held.</p><p>Yes, if the Sadist had been with them, at least one of their group would have quietly disappeared by now.</p><p>Jared turned to the old woman. \u201cMeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lord,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a butcher just down the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What do we owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have is yours, good Lords,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Blaed\u2019s snarl had her backing away from the counter, her hands protecting her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe came here to buy supplies, not steal them,\u201d Blaed said.</p><p>The woman looked pleadingly at Jared. \u201cI meant no insult, Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jared soothed. \u201cI know.\u201d Worried that she might collapse, he waited until she seemed a little calmer. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darting from him to Blaed and back again, she pulled a piece of coarse paper and a slim stick of charcoal from beneath the counter and began writing figures. She totaled them, then licked her lips and said nothing.</p><p>Jared tugged the paper out from under her hand, read the total, called in the wad of silver marks, and paid her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of telling me it\u2019s fair that we carry what we each selected, think again,\u201d Blaed said dryly.</p><p>Relieved that Blaed had shaken off his anger so quickly, Jared gave him a wicked grin and obligingly vanished half the supplies, including the bag of potatoes. The Warlord Prince could have taken all the supplies without thinking twice. It was just the principle of sharing the work. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstatic.\u201d Blaed vanished his half. Facing the old woman, he gave her the slight bow that denoted courtesy to a woman of less rank.</p><p>Flustered, she smiled shyly.</p><p>\u201cA moment, Lord,\u201d she said when Jared started to leave.</p><p>Nodding to Blaed, who went out, he turned back to the old woman.</p><p>She went to a small shelf behind the counter and took down a sealed glass jar. \u201cFruit preserves,\u201d she said, handing the jar to Jared. \u201cI make it myself. It\u2019s good on morning biscuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift, Lord. Please take it.\u201d</p><p>Touched, Jared kissed her hand. He vanished the jar and gave her the same slight bow. \u201cLady.\u201d</p><p>When he turned again to leave, she placed a hand on his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t go back to Shalador, Lord,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you there. Shalador lies in ruins. They say all the good Queens are dead, and those who are left have sold themselves for Hayll\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared said sharply. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cTerrible war.\u201d</p><p>Jared braced his hands on the counter and closed his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Belarr was a Red-Jeweled Warlord.

Old enough to die.</p><p>He swallowed hard, afraid he was going to be sick.</p> <p>\u201cLord?\u201d The old woman patted his arm.</p><p>Jared opened his eyes His vision blurred when he saw her concern.</p><p>\u201cI ... I do not understand this Darkness that the Blood honor,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cIt is not . . . evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s not evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen may it watch over you, Lord, and protect you.\u201d</p> <p>Jared tried to smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She walked around the counter and took his arm. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll walk you to the butcher\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find it.\u201d</p><p>She led him out of the store. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you.\u201d</p><p>Blaed took one look at him and stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. He called in the silver marks and handed them to Blaed. \u201cGo to the tavern and see if you can buy a few bottles of brandy and whiskey. That should be enough. I\u2019ll get the meat.\u201d</p> <p>*Is it a good idea to dull our wits?* Blaed asked.</p><p>*It\u2019s always a good idea to dull pain.*</p><p>Jared followed the old woman to the butcher\u2019s. There were a few men on the street now. Silent. Watching. Including a man in a bloodstained apron.</p><p>The old woman raised a hand in greeting. \u201cThis Lord would like to buy some meat.\u201d</p><p>The butcher eyed Jared warily. \u201cThe Blood are good and kind.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, the old woman reached up and patted Jared\u2019s cheek. \u201cSome of them truly are.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned back to the man in time to see his startled expression shift to a more businesslike one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re traveling, Lord?\u201d the butcher asked once they\u2019d entered the shop and the small glass-enclosed counter was between them.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot some beef that would cook up just fine over a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot some fresh sausages, too. Quick and easy in a skillet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jared watched the butcher efficiently select and wrap up the meat.</p><p>The butcher glanced at Jared, then at the packages. When Jared said nothing, he cut and wrapped more meat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want more than this, Lord. It would only go bad before you could eat it, even with magic.\u201d</p><p>Jared called in the gold marks and handed two of them to the butcher.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much, Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Jared vanished the rest of the gold marks and the packages of meat.</p><p>The butcher fingered the gold marks thoughtfully. \u201cA gang of men\u2014Blood\u2014came through here two days ago. They were looking for a pedlar\u2019s wagon and a group of travelers. A vicious witch, they said. Dangerous. Thought she might be running to Shalador for some reason. Asked about a Shalador Warlord who might be with her.\u201d</p><p>Jared finally focused his attention. \u201cAnd what did you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could I tell them? No one like that had come through here, had they?\u201d</p><p>His attention sharpened. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d The butcher shrugged. \u201cWhat could I tell them now that\u2019s any different? Haven\u2019t seen a wagon or a witch. Two Lords rode in to buy supplies. Who can tell what Territory they came from? Was busy with my shop, wasn\u2019t I? Didn\u2019t see what direction they came from ... or what direction they took when they rode out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jared said quietly.</p><p>The butcher hesitated, scratched his jaw. \u201cEven in a tucked-away village like this, we hear things. You know?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t heading someplace in particular, I\u2019ve heard some talk that going west is the best choice. The Tamanara Mountains are still some distance away, and they\u2019re full of rogues\u2014vicious bastards who\u2019ll gut you faster than you can spit\u2014-but if you can slip past them ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that, too. About the rogues,\u201d Jared said, opening the shop door. \u201cMight be better to head south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might at that,\u201d the butcher said, smiling.</p><p>Outside, Blaed was mounted and waiting for him.</p><p>They rode out of the village at a walk.</p><p>Blaed caressed the Opal-Jeweled ring on his right hand. \u201cI know I should put it away, but, Hell\u2019s fire, it feels good to wear it again.\u201d</p><p>Jared twisted in his saddle. \u201cIf you put those Jewels aside before we get to Dena Nehele, I\u2019ll cut your balls off. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Blaed stared at him. Then he lowered his head and pursed his lips. \u201cSince she treats us like a court circle and not bought flesh, we should act like a court circle. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Blaed studied the glowing Red Jewel hanging from the chain around Jared\u2019s neck. \u201cSuits me.\u201d He paused, and added, \u201cYou going to insist on the Jewels all around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who can wear them.\u201d</p><p>Blaed nodded thoughtfully. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be a problem. At least, it shouldn\u2019t add to the ones we already have.\u201d</p><p>Jared felt a prickle between his shoulder blades. \u201cWhat problems are those?\u201d</p><p>Blaed snorted. He sounded amused.</p><p>Warlord Princes were a law unto themselves, Jared thought as he watched something shift in Blaed\u2019s hazel eyes. A different breed of men, no matter what Jewels they wore. Men who rose to the killing edge as easily as other men slipped on a comfortable coat. Men who spent their lives dancing on the knife edge. Violently passionate\u2014and passionately violent.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m dangerous,\u201d Blaed said softly, as if he\u2019d heard Jared\u2019s thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m younger than you and less experienced, but you can\u2019t dismiss what I am. You came close to what it\u2019s like to be a Warlord Prince that night when you were in rut. Do you know why you didn\u2019t kill the rest of us? She balanced you, grounded you. If Lia wasn\u2019t the kind of Queen she is, you would have come out of it surrounded by corpses. That\u2019s what\u2019s inside me, all the time. Banked, that\u2019s true, except for those times when it becomes too fierce to control and I have to surrender to the bed and give in to the rut. The only hope I have of not becoming a vicious killer, of not being a butcher when I\u2019m sheathed between a woman\u2019s thighs is serving a Queen who can balance me, ground me. It\u2019s not so fierce then. In fact, as long as there\u2019s no provocation, it\u2019s fairly easy to control when you\u2019re grounded by a strong Queen. Or so my father told me.\u201d</p><p>Jared licked his dry lips. \u201cWhat if you couldn\u2019t . . . what if there\u2019s no relief, no release?\u201d</p><p>Blaed didn\u2019t have to ask who Jared was talking about. \u201cHe never gets aroused. Never. But the rut has to be siphoned off somehow.\u201d Blaed shuddered. \u201cI think it\u2019s best not to think about how he does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re running,\u201d Jared said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Blaed nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re being hunted. I know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us serves Dorothea SaDiablo.\u201d</p><p>Blaed digested this and nodded again. \u201cAt least one of us.\u201d</p><p>Jared narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Garth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard not to.\u201d</p><p>Jared scanned the countryside. Then he opened his inner barriers enough to make a strong psychic probe.</p><p>Nothing. Not even a pocket of emptiness that might have indicated a psychic shield. A lighter-Jeweled psychic shield, he amended. If there was a Red Jewel out there, he might not be able to sense it. But a Red wouldn\u2019t go up against another Red. Not alone.</p><p>\u201cWhom do you trust among us?\u201d Jared asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cBesides Lia? Thera. Thayne because we grew up together. You.\u201d</p><p>Jared hesitated but had to ask. \u201cDo you trust Thera because you\u2019re attracted to her or because you truly believe she\u2019s not a danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s a danger,\u201d Blaed replied, \u201cbut not to Lia.\u201d He paused, then chose his words as if he were picking his way over rough ground. \u201cEven when they were both trying to deceive everyone with those illusion spells, I think they recognized something in each other, something that made them friends despite the deception. Hell\u2019s fire, Jared. Right from the start, they quarreled like friends who just couldn\u2019t see eye to eye. So, yes, I trust Thera. Besides, I think she\u2019s the kind of witch Dorothea would see as a rival, not a tool.\u201d</p><p>Jared thought that over and, reluctantly, had to agree. \u201cWhat about the children? Do you trust them?\u201d</p><p>Blaed shook his head. \u201cToo vulnerable. Useful as a weapon against us, though, unless you can hold Lia down during an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in our favor is that Dorothea\u2019s pet has to be in a constant cold sweat by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared asked, curious.</p><p>Blaed made that amused snort. \u201cJared, do you know where we\u2019re making camp tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jared thought about it for a moment and huffed. \u201cNo.\u201d Then he started to sweat. Hedidn\u2019t know. Lia wandered off the main roads for no reason he could figure out, sometimes wandered off the roads altogether for a little while whenever the terrain permitted. Always heading north or northwest, true, but this was rolling countryside, sufficiently wooded to provide plenty of hiding places for a pedlar\u2019s wagon and a small group of people. If a man didn\u2019t know where to look for her . . .</p><p>He\u2019d assumed he\u2019d be able to catch up to them if he left for a few hours. He\u2019d assumed he\u2019d be able tofind them.</p><p>\u201cHave we got any spare rope?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the leads we were using for the saddle horses. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of tying one end around Lia\u2019s waist and the other end around mine.\u201d</p><p>Blaed chuckled. \u201cBetter make sure it\u2019s long enough for her to go into the bushes by herself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>Blaed\u2019s laughter stopped almost before it began. The roan mare snorted and danced as his hands tightened on the reins. Something predatory flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Jared started probing, searching. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThayne,\u201d Blaed said through gritted teeth. \u201cHe says Thera and Lia are snapping at each other. Everyone\u2019s uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Jared dug his heels into the gelding\u2019s sides a second after Blaed kicked the mare into a full gallop.</p><p>*Blaed,* Jared said a minute later as they charged up the hill and swept past an anxious-looking Thayne. *We\u2019ve got two lead ropes.*</p><p>Blaed bared his teeth. *That suits me just fine.*</p><p>Yes, Jared thought as he and Blaed dismounted and strode toward the quarreling women. That would suit both of them just fine.</p> <p>Jared picked up a fist-sized rock and threw it as hard as he could. The midday meal he\u2019d eaten an hour ago felt as hard as that rock in his stomach. Even the honey pear, ripened to perfection, had tasted bitter.</p><p>Fool. Thrice-times fool!</p><p>What was he doing here? He could have been with his family now. He could have talked to Reyna. He could have beenhome instead of walking along another of these excuses for a road.</p><p>He could have been in his mother\u2019s house again and, if she\u2019d been willing to forgive him, could have felt her arms around him, easing the hurts and worries like she used to do when he was a boy. Mother Night, how he\u2019d missed being held by Reyna.</p><p>He threw another rock.</p><p>Lia hadn\u2019t expected him to come back. He\u2019d seen it in her eyes before she could hide it. She\u2019d expected him to grab the chance of a little distance, catch the Winds, and disappear.</p> <p>That\u2019swhy she had given him all those marks.That\u2019s why she had intended to send him alone.</p><p>What would she have done when he didn\u2019t return? Ride into the village herself to buy whatever she could with the remaining marks?</p><p>Had Thera guessed? Was that why she\u2019d insisted on Blaed going with him? So that Blaed could return with the gelding and supplies?</p><p>Well, if Lia was going to let one male slip the leash, why not all of them? They wouldn\u2019t assume it was because he outranked her. Any man who had worn a Ring of Obedience knew how well it could control a darker-Jeweled male. Or would they assume he\u2019d been able to slip the leash because he wore the Invisible Ring?</p><p>Which was the point, damn it!He wore a Ring . So it wasn\u2019t the Ring of Obedience. She\u2019d placed a Ring on him, and even if his body couldn\u2019t feel it, his heart did\u2014and that Ring got heavier with every step he took away from a fast journey to Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the Invisible Ring that held him back. The fact that she had expected him to escape was proof enough that she didn\u2019t intend to use it to control him. What really kept him here was the debt he owed Lia\u2014his strength on the journey in exchange for the freedom she\u2019d purchased.</p><p>And, damn her, she had hurt him. The witches who had owned and used his body had never been able to hurt him as deeply as she had.</p><p>He watched Blaed canter toward him. He must have fallen so far behind someone had started to worry. Not Lady Ardelia, of course.</p> <p>He liked Blaed, but he wished it had been Brock who had come looking, a man closer to his own age. Then again, despite pleasure slaves being at the top of the slave hierarchy, most other slaves seemed to think that once a man was used in bed he couldn\u2019t remember what the word \u201chonor\u201d meant, let alone live by it.</p><p>Maybe Lia thought the same thing.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d take whatever company he could get. He was tired of sulking by himself.</p><p>Thera swung down from behind Blaed.</p><p>Jared swore under his breath.</p><p>Blaed wheeled the roan mare and cantered back to the wagon.</p><p>Thera fell in step beside Jared. \u201cWant some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lengthened his stride.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d Since she wasn\u2019t tall enough to throw her arm over his shoulders, she settled for wrapping both arms around one of his, forcing him either to slow down or drag her.</p><p>He slowed down. Reluctantly. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the snarled order. \u201cBeing an only child, I don\u2019t have any firsthand experience, but it\u2019s been my observation that one of the duties and privileges of a younger sister is to be a ripe boil on her older brother\u2019s backside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you certainly qualify for that,\u201d Jared growled. \u201cThough you should keep in mind that the way to get rid of a boil is to lance it.\u201d</p><p>They walked in silence for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong in the village, Jared?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at the cool eyes watching him so intently. Then he looked away. \u201cNothing went wrong in the village. We left to get some supplies. We came back.\u201d</p><p>Thera tucked some stray hairs back into her braid. \u201cLia was glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she was.\u201d</p><p>Thera nodded as if something finally made sense. \u201cI don\u2019t think Brock or Randolf would have come back.\u201d</p><p>Which had nothing to do with anything. Lia should have knownhe would come back. Damn her.</p><p>Thera waited a minute; then, when he didn\u2019t say anything, asked, \u201cWhat do you think will happen once we get to Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth. Damn damn damn.</p><p>\u201cLia\u2019s asked me several times, privately, if I had finished my formal training. Each time, when I told her that I hadn\u2019t, she mentioned that her mother was a Sapphire-Jeweled Black Widow who would be very pleased to have a Green-Jeweled apprentice or journeymaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Jared muttered.</p><p>\u201cOnly a cruel person would say that to a slave\u2014unless the slave was never intended to be a slave. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jared bit his tongue.</p><p>Thera nodded as if he\u2019d answered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too. You know what else I think? I think she had a reason for the choices she made in Raej, that she chose each of us because she felt she had something to offer us. Except you.\u201d</p><p>Stung, Jared stopped walking. \u201cShe has something to offer anyone with the sense to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Blaed said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlaed\u2019s a fool.\u201d</p><p>Thera bristled. \u201cHe is not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he was. This morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was this morn\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared sucked air when Thera\u2019s hands clamped on his arm.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, cocking her head.</p><p>A rhythmic pounding. Off to their right. Out of sight.</p><p>He probed cautiously, recoiling when he brushed against a slimy psychic scent. \u201cIt\u2019s Garth.\u201d</p><p>Thera released him and started walking toward the sound.</p><p>Swearing, Jared grabbed the back of her coat. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>She turned icy green eyes on him. \u201cYou can come with me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping a firm grip on her coat, Jared muttered, \u201cBlaed and I are going to have a little talk about tethers.\u201d</p><p>Thera made a sound a feral dog would envy.</p><p>They found Garth, his large hand filled with a stone that he was using to pound something he\u2019d placed on a flat rock. His teeth were bared. His face was contorted. He grunted with each impact as he pounded, pounded, pounded.</p><p>\u201cGarth,\u201d Jared called, approaching warily. \u201cGarth!\u201d</p><p>Garth stared at Jared with blue eyes filled with a killing rage.</p><p>Jared hesitated, then stepped closer because he\u2019d caught a glimpse of something shiny. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Garth\u2019s mouth kept working, but no words came out. With an anguished bellow, he threw down the stone and ran away from them.</p><p>Jared took another step toward the rock.</p><p>\u201cJared, be careful,\u201d Thera said.</p><p>Shiny brass buttons, mashed and useless, with pieces broken off.</p><p>Buttons.</p><p>And something else. Something in the buttons he could almost sense.</p><p>\u201cJared . . .\u201d</p><p>He heard the sharpness, the intensity in Thera\u2019s voice.</p><p>Careful. Careful.</p><p>With a delicate psychic tendril, he probed one of the buttons.</p><p>It happened too fast. One moment there was only that psychic sliminess. Then a psychic fog shot out of the buttons and rapidly changed into thick, sticky strands full of tiny hooks.</p><p>It looked like a badly woven net, Jared thought as it came down over his mind. The tiny hooks dug into his inner barriers, securing the strand. Another strand touched. More hooks dug in.</p><p>More strands. More hooks.</p><p>It surrounded him in seconds and immediately started to constrict. If it sealed his inner barriers, it would lock him inside himself.</p><p>Like Garth.</p><p>And then he knew what it was.</p><p>He poured the strength of the Red into his inner barriers, poured everything he had into his inner defenses.</p><p>It was a tangled web. The kind of web Black Widows used for their dreams and visions. The kind they used to entangle a mind and draw it into a living nightmare.</p><p>He struck out desperately, but the power only got through the shrinking spaces between the strands. Fed by his own strength, the strands in the tangled web swelled like fat slugs.</p><p>Panicked, he tried again and again.</p><p>*No, Jared! Don\u2019t attack it! Don\u2019t feed it!* Thera\u2019s voice sounded like ice-coated fire.</p><p>Trembling, he obeyed.</p><p>Was this how Garth had felt? Had he done the same thing, unwittingly aiding in his own destruction?</p><p>*Hold your inner barriers, Jared,* Thera said. *I know how to get rid of this.*</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound as confident as her words, but since he didn\u2019t see another choice, he again obeyed. His body was shaking, but he felt distanced from it, unconnected. If he tried to raise his arm, how long would it take his body to receive the message\u2014if it received it at all?</p><p>Without warning, a psychic knife came whistling down\u2014 a long, sleek blade, its edge glowing with icy Green fire.</p><p>It hit his inner barriers with enough force to make him gasp. It struck again and again, slicing through the sticky strands, charring the severed ends.</p><p>As sections of the tangled web fell away from him, little balls of psychic fire struck them, burning them to ash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He endured the blows as Thera\u2019s Green knife continued to hack at the tangled web.</p><p>Finally, enough had been cut away for him to be aware of something outside himself. Something that sounded like a roll of thunder, like the roar of a waterfall.</p><p>Like the sound of power gathering before it was unleashed.</p> <p>*Leave it, Thera!* Jared shouted. *Get away from here!*</p><p>The Green knife paused.</p><p>*Mother Night,* Thera whispered, swiftly breaking contact with him.</p><p>Jared shook his head to clear it. His connection to his body still felt sluggish. Strands of the tangled web were clinging to his inner barriers, making him feel tainted, but he was no longer imprisoned.</p><p>Hands grabbed him. He stumbled.</p> <p>\u201cJared!\u201d Thera shouted. \u201cThere must have been another spell in those buttons. I can\u2019t tell how strong it is. I don\u2019t know if we can shield against it. We have to run.\u201d</p><p>His legs just wouldn\u2019t obey him. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>Swearing, Thera tugged him away from the rock, toward the road. \u201cDamn you to the bowels of Hell, you stupid man. RUN!\u201d</p><p>She gave him a vicious clout. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was physical or psychic, but it got his legs moving until he was running away from the rock, running up the road.</p><p>Feet pounded behind him. Two horses galloped toward him.</p><p>Seeing them burned away the last of the sluggishness.</p> <p>He ran faster.</p><p>How dare she ride toward danger? How dare she risk herself? When they got out of here, he\u2019d show her the sharp edge of his temper. Just see if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>*Blaed!* Jared roared. *Protect Lia! Shield Lia!*</p><p>*Get down!* Thera yelled. *GET DOWN!*</p><p>He saw Blaed sweep Lia out of the gelding\u2019s saddle, pull her to the ground, and cover her.</p><p>He tasted bitter jealousy that he was still too scrambled to use Craft, that he wasn\u2019t the one shielding her, protecting her.</p><p>Thera knocked his legs out from under him. He went down hard, then tried to shake her off when she landed on his back. Wrapping her arms around his head, she buried her face against his neck, and enclosed them both in a Green shield.</p><p>The ground shook under him as the area around the flat rock exploded. Small stones and dirt rained down on them.</p> <p>Thera pressed against him harder and kept muttering, \u201cMother Night, Mother Night, Mother Night.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, years later, there was silence.</p><p>Thera rolled off him, quickly stood up, and moved a few feet away.</p><p>Shaken by everything that had happened, Jared moved more slowly. He noticed that Blaed, too, was slow getting to his feet.</p><p>Lia, on the other hand, strode toward Thera, her face tightened by anger. Her gray eyes looked stone hard.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid bitch,\u201d Lia shouted. \u201cI\u2019ve been lenient about allowing you to use more than basic Craft, but Idid not give you leave to play around with spells you have no training to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing would have happened,Lady , if you hadn\u2019t tried to block it,\u201d Thera shouted back. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s to blame for this, it\u2019syou .\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, as if that would clear away the confusion. What were they talking about?</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you\u2019re talking to?\u201d Lia shrieked.</p><p>\u201cA sexless bitch, that\u2019s who! If you had any heat between your legs, you wouldn\u2019t be wasting a male like him.\u201d Thera jabbed a finger in Jared\u2019s direction. \u201cYou would have ridden him for all he was worth long before now.\u201d</p><p>Lia hissed. \u201cHow would you know what a normal woman feels? You\u2019d sheath anything that was willing to get between your thighs!\u201d</p><p>Letting out an outraged howl, Thera threw herself on Lia.</p><p>Jared watched them go down in a tangle of limbs just as he got to his feet. He watched them roll on the ground, hitting, shrieking, scratching, tearing at each other\u2019s clothes and hair.</p><p>Shock locked him in place.</p><p>Witches didn\u2019t fight. At least, not physically. Never physically. Witches fought with words, fought with Craft. But not physically.</p><p>Because something happened to witches when they crossed that line.</p><p>Blood males were fiercely aggressive and might engage in quarrels that ended in blows, but they never completely lost themselves in that kind of fight. Witches did. They became feral, cold-blooded, deadly. They became something even strong males feared because their savagery surpassed anything a male was capable of, and they had no mercy.</p><p>Thera and Lia rolled toward him. The shock cracked, shattered. A leg kicked out and hit him hard, knocking his feet out from under him.</p><p>He fell on top of them. His fear turned into white-hot anger.</p><p>He was only going to separate them, he assured himself as he tried to ram an arm between them. He wasn\u2019t going to attack them, wasn\u2019t going to hurt either one of them\u2014 especially because he wasn\u2019t quite sure which body parts went with which woman.</p><p>One of them threw a punch that skimmed the side of his head.</p><p>Snarling, Jared tried to plant his palm on the bottom witch\u2019s chin and give her head a good thump\u2014and then yelled when two sets of teeth clamped down on his hand.</p><p>Hearing another male\u2019s angry roar, Jared rolled, dragging Thera and Lia with him. He realized his mistake a moment later when he opened his mouth to try to draw a breath and inhaled a mouthful of long hair.</p><p>Another roar. A shriek as the weight on top of him suddenly lightened. Blaed yelling, \u201cNo, Garth! NO! That\u2019s Lia! THAT\u2019S LIA!\u201d</p><p>One shove got Thera off him. Jared scrambled to his feet.</p><p>Garth held Lia over his head. Blaed stood in front of Garth, but not close enough to help if the big man flung Lia to the ground. Brock and Randolf were a careful distance up the road, breathing hard as if they\u2019d come running to help but now were no longer sure of what to do.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Garth,\u201d Jared said firmly.</p><p>Garth turned to face him. \u201cP-p-protect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did protect Lia. You got her out of the fight.\u201d</p><p>The angry flush that colored Garth\u2019s face slowly changed to bewilderment.</p><p>Jared noticed the fresh blood darkening Garth\u2019s left sleeve.</p><p>Probably something had cut him during the explosion\u2014 a sharp stone or even a small branch with enough force behind it to act like an arrow.</p><p>\u201cYou did well, Garth,\u201d Jared said, walking toward the big man and hoping he looked far more sure of himself than he felt. \u201cStopping the fight was good. Prince Blaed and I will handle the rest.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arms.</p><p>Garth hesitated, finally gave a grunt that could have meant anything, then carefully lowered Lia into Jared\u2019s waiting arms. After giving Lia\u2019s shoulder a thumping pat, he started walking up the road toward the wagon.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d Lia said, squirming.</p><p>Jared tightened his hold on her and bared his teeth. \u201cWhen the sun shines in Hell.\u201d Hearing a vicious curse, he looked over his shoulder in time to see Blaed haul Thera to her feet. Apparently Blaed\u2019s temper was as sharp and hot as his own, and that pleased him.</p><p>Lia squirmed again, then yipped when his fingers clamped down harder. \u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Jared\u2019s temper soared a little higher when he saw Thayne jogging toward them with the saddle horses. With Thayne there, that meant there wasn\u2019t an adult looking after the wagon or the children.</p><p>*It\u2019s all right,* Blaed said on an Opal spear thread. *Eryk and Tomas are holding the team, and Thayne put a shield around everything. He\u2019ll know if anything touches it before we get there.*</p><p>*Get her to the wagon, Blaed.* He couldn\u2019t even say Thera\u2019s name. She\u2019d saved him, but she also had attacked Lia, and he couldn\u2019t untangle the feelings.</p><p>Blaed had Thera up on the roan mare and was galloping toward the wagon between one curse and the next.</p><p>Jared found his way to the gelding blocked by Brock and Randolf. Randolf was sweating and thoroughly shaken. Brock looked grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Brock asked.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Jared snapped, shoving between them to reach the gelding.</p><p>The trip back to the wagon was too swift to cool his temper or soothe the fear that still jangled his nerves.</p><p>Handing the gelding\u2019s reins to Tomas, Jared pulled Lia out of the saddle. The other three children clustered around the roan mare, watching him. \u201cStay here,\u201d Jared told them. Not that he thought any of them would be anxious to be in a small, enclosed space with two snarling witches who had just torn into each other. Hell\u2019s fire,he didn\u2019t want to be inside the wagon with them either.</p><p>Ignoring Lia\u2019s muttered protests when he picked her up, Jared marched into the wagon and dumped her on the bench opposite Thera. Blaed stood nearby, blocking any escape through the shutters that opened onto the driving seat, his muscles quivering with the effort of keeping his own anger in check.</p><p>Rubbing his teeth-marked hand, Jared leaned against the door and started putting shields around the wagon\u2014physical shield, psychic shield, aural shield. No one was going to interrupt or overhear this little discussion.</p><p>Blaed gave him a look that said,what do we do now ?</p><p>The women weren\u2019t paying any attention to him or Blaed. A good thing, too, since he had no idea what to do next.</p><p>Still breathing hard, Thera dabbed at her lip, then stared at the fresh blood on the back of her hand. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Lia, you split my lip.\u201d</p><p>Lia pushed her hair away from her face, and said contritely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She studied all the strands of hair now tangled around her fingers. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThen again, maybe I\u2019m not. Did you have to rip so much hair out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t deliberate. My arm jerked whensomeone who didn\u2019t have enough sense to get out of the way fell on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>They looked at him.</p><p>Jared gave them a cold, hard stare.</p><p>Their eyes dropped to the hand he was still rubbing. Both of them shifted on the benches, putting them a little closer to Blaed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry we bit you, Jared,\u201d Lia said meekly, glancing at him through her lashes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who got hurt,\u201d Thera complained, rubbing her shin. \u201cI slammed my leg into something miserably hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said coldly. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d After an awkward silence, Thera huffed and pushed her hair back. \u201cWell, I doubt anyone\u2019s going to have the balls to ask questions about what happened.\u201d</p><p>Blaed growled.</p> <p>\u201cExcept you two,\u201d Thera added, regarding Blaed with respectful wariness. \u201cWhich was the point.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s muscles seemed to swell with the anger he was holding in.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes narrowed. Where was the fury that had made Thera and Lia tear into each other? Their tempers couldn\u2019t have cooledthat fast. But they were sitting there like friends who had had a minor spat instead of ...</p><p>\u201cYou did this deliberately,\u201d Jared said slowly. \u201cYou scared the shit out of all of us deliberately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lia replied, looking surprised. \u201cThera and I realized we had to shift everyone\u2019s attention away from the explosion so that no one would ask about it until we had time to figure out what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYoulied to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019tlie ,\u201d Lia said indignantly. \u201cWe werepretending to have a fight in order to create a distraction.\u201d</p><p>His mind understood the distinction between \u201clie\u201d and \u201cpretend,\u201d but his emotions weren\u2019t interested in being that picky.</p><p>\u201cThe fightdid provide a reason for the explosion,\u201d Thera said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we used Craft to make sure our voices carried far enough so that everyone in the group would know,\u201d Lia added.</p><p>Jared forced his teeth apart before he cracked some of them. A few seconds. That\u2019s all it had taken for one of them to send a thought to the other. Something like,We have to do something to keep the males from asking questions . \u201cYou planned this in the time it took for you to get to your feet, but you couldn\u2019t take a few more seconds to send a communication thread to Blaed and me to tellus ?\u201d He smacked a fist against the door, causing both women to jump. \u201cYou just started flinging out insults and tearing into each other without a thought about how we\u2019d feel. You used Craft so that everyone could hear\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The air in the wagon chilled. He saw the shift in their eyes. They\u2019d been willing to placate him up to a point, and he\u2019d reached it.</p><p>\u201cYou forget yourself, Warlord,\u201d Lia said coldly. \u201cA Queen doesn\u2019t have to explain herself to any man.\u201d</p><p>True, Jared thought, but hadn\u2019t he earned a little consideration?</p><p>Lia\u2019s expression softened. \u201cIf we\u2019d told both of you it was an act, you wouldn\u2019t have responded the same way. Not emotionally. And the other males would have wondered why.\u201d</p><p>Jared couldn\u2019t say anything.Wouldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Thera added with deadly calm, \u201cyou responded to it even though youknew what had happened back there. In fact, you know better than the rest of us. What exactly was Garth trying to destroy, Jared?\u201d</p><p>Jared shuddered as it came rushing back, making him realize how right they\u2019d been about a witch fight shifting the focus of the males\u2019 attention. \u201cButtons,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThree brass buttons. He was smashing them with a stone.\u201d</p><p>Thera nodded. \u201cMetal holds a spell fairly well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having exploding buttons?\u201d Blaed asked.</p><p>\u201cA weapon,\u201d Lia said.</p><p>Thera shook her head. \u201cThe explosion happened because Jared tried to probe them\u2014or maybe because I cut through the tangled web closing around Jared\u2019s inner barriers.\u201d</p><p>Lia paled, and Jared felt a swift, light brush against his inner barriers\u2014a feminine touch seeking reassurance that he was all right.</p><p>\u201cThe buttons must have had another use,\u201d Thera said. \u201cThe explosion and the tangled web were there to prevent anyone who didn\u2019t have the key from finding outwhat they were being used for. I wish we had one of them intact to study.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through Jared. \u201cCould they be used to track us?\u201d</p><p>Thera shrugged. \u201cSure. A drawing spell, a summoning spell. Either of those can be fine-tuned so that anyone who wasn\u2019t looking for a specific signal wouldn\u2019t notice it.\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded thoughtfully. \u201cAnd using a button is very clever. Even if someone noticed it, who would think twice about a brass button lying beside the road? You\u2019d just think it fell off someone\u2019s coat. You might pick it up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jared realized he\u2019d been rubbing his hand against his thigh. \u201cThey feel slimy. No one would keep it after touching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarth did,\u201d Lia pointed out.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cGarth had one the day we left the clearing. The day we reached the creek. Randolf had been trying to get it away from him. Garth had his hand closed, behind his back. I don\u2019t know if Randolf knew what Garth was holding or simply wanted to be difficult because he hates Garth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the button?\u201d Thera asked, watching him sharply.</p><p>\u201cGarth gave it to me. Then Randolf took it out of my hand and threw it into the bushes. He said Garth was tainted. He said maybe Garth wasn\u2019t as mind-damaged as he seems.\u201d Jared swallowed hard. \u201cI began to wonder about one of us being a pet even before\u2014\u201d He stopped, remembering in time that Lia hadn\u2019t told anyone else about the wrongness she felt.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I had a little talk with Garth,\u201d Thera said grimly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need an excuse to be alone with him, something that won\u2019t make anyone wonder why I want to see him right after the explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was bleeding,\u201d Blaed said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat would do it. The bad-tempered Queen making me patch up the male hurt by my careless spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tangled web like the one that almost entangled Jared means a fully trained Black Widow,\u201d Lia said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Thera replied.</p><p>The two women stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said about your not having skill,\u201d Lia said. Then she glanced at Blaed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of what I said.\u201d</p><p>A wicked twinkle lit Thera\u2019s eyes. She slanted a look at Jared. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t mean what I said about your interfering with the spell\u2014or being a sexless bitch.\u201d</p><p>When Thera didn\u2019t add anything, Lia blushed.</p><p>Jared decided that Thera had being a younger sister down pat. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if we could put some distance between us and anyone who might become curious about an unleashing. Can we move the wagon while you\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p><p>Thera nodded. \u201cKeep the others away from it though. In case I trigger something.\u201d</p><p>Blaed jerked. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d He snarled at Lia when she started pulling him toward the door.</p><p>Jared snarled at him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Thera said dryly, \u201ca pissing contest between you two ought to keep everyone occupied.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Lia was clear of the steps, Jared pushed Blaed out the door. Then he looked at Thera, said, \u201cHe gets to fuss tonight,\u201d and closed the door before she could throw something at him.</p><p>Thayne had joined the children and the saddle horses, trying to soothe all of them\u2014not an easy task since Randolf kept pacing and throwing dark looks at the wagon and Garth. Blaed stood an arm\u2019s length from Lia, looking sulky. Still and silent, Brock kept his distance from everyone.</p><p>Jared met Brock\u2019s eyes for a moment, then turned his attention to Lia, who was staring at Garth as if she\u2019d like to gut him.</p><p>\u201cGarth!\u201d Lia\u2019s voice had a whiplash sharpness that made every man flinch. \u201cInto the wagon. That arm needs tending.\u201d</p><p>Garth shifted his feet but didn\u2019t come forward.</p><p>\u201cGarth!\u201d</p><p>Garth\u2019s pale blue eyes focused on Jared.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Garth,\u201d Jared said, keeping his voice firm but kind. \u201cThe arm needs tending.\u201d</p><p>Cautiously circling around Lia, Garth entered the wagon.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move out,\u201d Lia said. \u201cThayne, you lead the team. Corry and Cathryn, you ride the mare. Tomas, you and Eryk take turns leading her. When you get tired, switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lady,\u201d Tomas said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI may not like him,\u201d Randolf said, \u201cbut if you let that Black Widow bitch tend Garth, he\u2019s liable to walk out of that wagon with one arm instead of two.\u201d</p><p>Lia took a swing at Randolf, only missing because he jerked his chin back at the same time Jared grabbed her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever problem I have with her is my business, but you\u2019d damn well better remember that she outranks you, Warlord.\u201d</p><p>Swearing under his breath, Jared dragged Lia over to the bay gelding. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse them to the point of panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to confuse him,\u201d Lia said through gritted teeth. \u201cI was trying to hit him.\u201d</p><p>Jared boosted her into the saddle, then handed the reins to Blaed before he stormed back to Randolf. The only thing that kept him from throwing a punch of his own was Brock joining them. He settled for a searing look that made Randolf shift uneasily.</p><p>\u201cTempers are running hot right now,\u201d Jared said. \u201cIf they get any hotter, it\u2019s going to be real uncomfortable for us. So keep your tongue and your temper leashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis really started over some messed-up spell?\u201d Brock asked.</p><p>Jared caught a flicker of worry underneath Brock\u2019s bland tone. Understandable, certainly. If he hadn\u2019t seen the two of them in the wagon, hadn\u2019t been told straight out the fight had been staged, he\u2019d be more than a little worried, too, about having two Green-Jeweled witches going for each other\u2019s throats.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d Jared said, shrugging. \u201cI was just tucking myself back into my pants when Thera came rushing toward me, yelling at me to run. It didn\u2019t seem like a good time to start asking questions. And after ...\u201d Jared rubbed the back of his neck and looked away.</p><p>Brock snorted. \u201cThe whole damn Territory probably heardthat.\u2018\u201d He paused, snorted again, then gave Randolf a friendly slap on the shoulder. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll take point. No sense riling things up more than they are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared waited until the two guards were moving up the road before returning to Lia.</p><p>*Everything all right?* Blaed asked, handing the reins to Jared.</p><p>*For now,* Jared replied.</p> <p>*I\u2019ll stay behind the wagon and keep on eye on things.*</p><p>*Thera wants ... * Seeing the look in Blaed\u2019s eyes, Jared let it go. Blaed the man might care a great deal about what Thera wanted, but Blaed the Warlord Prince would do whatever he felt was necessary\u2014regardless of what Thera wanted.</p><p>Nodding to acknowledge Blaed\u2019s choice, Jared mounted behind Lia and gave Thayne the signal to move on.</p><p>They were right, he thought as he wrapped one arm protectively around Lia\u2019s waist. He\u2019d never admit it to either of them, but, damn them, they were right. He wouldn\u2019t have responded the same way if they\u2019d told him the fight was an act. They shouldn\u2019t haveneeded to tell him. If he hadn\u2019t been so mentally scrambled, he should have realized it after the first shouted exchange.</p><p>And a Queendidn\u2019t have to explain herself to any man, even the ones who served in her First Circle. Lia was right about that, too. A Queen might talk to all of her First Circle about the day-to-day concerns of the court, but there were also circumstances when only her Steward and Master of the Guard were toldwhy something was required. Sometimes she didn\u2019t even tellthem .</p> <p>Blind trust was part of the price of service, and the day a male couldn\u2019t give that kind of trust to his Queen was the day when, in his heart, he no longer served.</p><p>Jared understood that, had been raised to accept it.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>An hour later, Garth left the wagon, looking dazed.</p><p>Half an hour after that, there was still no sign of Thera.</p><p>Jared handed the gelding over to Tomas, then hurried to the back of the wagon to join Lia and Blaed.</p> <p>They found Thera curled up on one of the benches, shaking.</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d she said as Blaed raised her to a sitting position and Lia wrapped her in spell-warmed blankets. \u201cSo cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey would help,\u201d Jared said, settling on the other bench to get out of the way.</p><p>Blaed called in two bottles of whiskey. He handed one to Jared, opened the other, and helped Thera take a couple of swallows since she was shaking too hard to hold the bottle.</p><p>Jared offered the other bottle to Lia. After shuddering through a couple of sips, she handed the bottle back and settled next to him on the bench. He took a healthy swallow, hoping it would soothe nerves frayed from waiting.</p><p>Thera pressed her face against Blaed\u2019s shoulder and continued to shake. Blaed held her tightly, murmuring reassurances while he coaxed more whiskey into her.</p><p>\u201cI need to wash,\u201d Thera said plaintively. \u201cI need to wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Blaed promised. \u201cI\u2019ll heat some water and help you.\u201d</p> <p>When Thera didn\u2019t protest, Blaed raised worried eyes to Jared.</p><p>Jared shared the worry, and not just because he liked Thera and was concerned about her. She was a strong witch, and something that could shake her this badly was a danger to all of them.</p><p>Lia held out her hand. Thera grabbed it.</p><p>In the confined space, Jared felt power flow between them\u2014not just the power of the Jewels and Craft, but the power of the feminine, strength anchoring strength.</p><p>Thera\u2019s shallow breathing eased, became deeper. She took another sip of whiskey. \u201cGarth knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Lia asked quietly.</p><p>Thera started shaking again. Her hand clamped on Lia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTell us what you can,\u201d Lia urged. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with the rest.\u201d</p><p>Thera took a deep breath. \u201cGarth knows.\u201d Pressing closer to Blaed, she stared at Jared as if each kind of contact was a thread that helped anchor her.</p><p>Slipping off the bench, Jared knelt beside her, keeping his eyes locked to hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like the tangled web that almost trapped you,\u201d Thera told him. \u201cIt\u2019s less and more and worse.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like someone rooted a psychic weed inside Garth\u2019s inner barriers that produced runners that could cover an area with voracious speed. Some of the runners went down below his inner web and then turned upward outside his barriers, forming a tangled net to keep him locked in. Other runners spread out inside his barriers, so he\u2019s doubly caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Lia asked, watching Thera intently.</p><p>Thera licked her lips. \u201cI\u2014Mother Night, Lia, the mind that created that is so vile, so obscene.\u201d It took her a minute before she could continue. \u201cThere\u2019s great anger inside him. He must have tried to rip the runners away from the root because I noticed that he could open his first inner barrier a little. So I cut away the tangle surrounding his inner barriers and then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou squeezed through that little opening, not knowing how fast that \u2018weed\u2019 might reclaim its ground, to clear a path to wherever Garth had retreated within himself,\u201d Lia said, her voice flattened by anger.</p><p>\u201cYou would have done the same thing,\u201d Thera said defensively.</p><p>She would have, Jared thought, and couldn\u2019t choke back the snarl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what I cut will grow back. I think that\u2019s why something was added to make his psychic scent so repulsive\u2014so no one would push past it. It felt like . . . like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalling headfirst into a giant spittoon,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Blaed shuddered. Thera and Lia turned a little green.</p><p>\u201cIf I throw up on you, it\u2019s your own fault,\u201d Thera said. She took a quick sip of whiskey.</p><p>Lia pressed a hand to her stomach and swallowed. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about throwing up.\u201d Releasing Thera\u2019s hand, she sat back. \u201cIs he broken?\u201d</p><p>Thera\u2019s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I had the impression this was done hurriedly.\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded. \u201cBecause it was meant to be temporary. He could have been broken back to his Birthright Jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all this?\u201d Blaed asked.</p><p>Jared eased back onto the bench. \u201cDestroying the one Queen capable of opposing Dorothea SaDiablo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lia isn\u2019t the Gray\u2014\u201d Blaed stopped.</p><p>Jared knew the moment Blaed put some of the pieces together and realized Lia must be more than just a young Queen serving in the Gray Lady\u2019s court.</p><p>The young Warlord Prince swore quietly, passionately.</p><p>Lia squirmed.</p><p>\u201cSo Garth\u2019s the only one who knows who the enemy is,\u201d Blaed said through clenched teeth, \u201cbut there\u2019s no way to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a few more days,\u201d Thera said. \u201cBy then, all the runners I cut will have withered enough for him to break through.\u201d</p><p>Lia closed her eyes. \u201cA few more days,\u201d she said wearily.</p><p>Jared slipped an arm around her shoulders to support her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few advantages now. First, there were three buttons. That means three attempts to signal someone or leave an indication of our direction have been fouled. Second, whoever\u2019s following us isn\u2019t going to expect slaves to be wearing their Jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the bastard somehow reported that you\u2019re wearing the Red,\u201d Blaed pointed out. \u201cBut you\u2019re right that they\u2019ll have more opposition than they\u2019re expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd third,\u201d Jared continued, \u201cwe\u2019re less than three days away from my home village. If we push, we might be able to make it in two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lia said, trying to pull away from him. \u201cWe knew bringing people out of Raej would be risky, and it was a risk they\u2019d have to share for the chance of freedom. But I\u2019m not going to let a village of people who have nothing at stake take the risk of having Dorothea\u2019s wrath descend on them.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at Blaed and Thera. \u201cMy father is the Warlord of Ranon\u2019s Wood.\u201d If the war in Shalador had reached a small village like Ranon\u2019s Wood . . . No. He wasn\u2019t going to think about that.Couldn\u2019t think about that. \u201cWe can get shelter and help there. And we can get a Coach to take us to the mountain pass.\u201d He squeezed Lia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe Gray Lady\u2019s warriors would be waiting at the pass for you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about all the rogues?\u201d Blaed asked.</p><p>Lia rubbed her hands on her trousers. \u201cGran has an arrangement with all of the rogues in the Tamanara Mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran?\u201d Blaed and Thera said in unison.</p><p>\u201cThe Gray Lady is Lia\u2019s grandmother,\u201d Jared said, watching them. \u201cLia is her successor.\u201d</p><p>Thera started sputtering. \u201cYou fool. You idiot.\u201d She stopped because Blaed\u2019s response was much pithier and far more creative. She nodded approvingly. \u201cWhat he said.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s hazel eyes blazed with anger. \u201cAre you sure about getting a Coach that will get us safely to the pass?\u201d he asked Jared.</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cIf, for whatever reason, my father turns down the request, I\u2019ll steal the damn thing. We\u2019ll get to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get any say in this?\u201d Lia muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared and Blaed said.</p><p>She gave Thera a dark look. \u201cYou\u2019re not being helpful.\u201d</p><p>Thera responded with a cool, measuring stare. \u201cYou\u2019ve risked yourself and your land\u2019s future to bring some people out of Raej\u2014which really means out of Dorothea\u2019s control. One of those people has been trying to betray you during every step of this journey. The enemy\u2019s remained undetected because he\u2019s linked somehow with Garth. I got that much. It\u2019s ingenious, actually. That link produces a sense of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrongness,\u201d Lia whispered.</p><p>\u201cWrongness,\u201d Thera agreed. \u201cNothing to trace, nothing to detect, no stray thoughts or emotions that might alert someone. All of that is channeled to the one person whose psychic scent is already fouled.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m with Jared on this. Once the enemy realizes the protection he\u2019s been hiding behind has fallen, he\u2019ll have to bolt or strike. You need a stronger escort than we can give you to get back to Dena Nehele.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Lia said, sitting up straight.</p><p>\u201cNo,you wait, Lady.\u201d Thera\u2019s green eyes flashed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been the target all along. Not us, Lia.You . Don\u2019t try to deny it. You\u2019ll only sound like a fool.\u201d</p><p>Gray eyes clashed with green.</p> <p>Jared braced himself, not sure what to expect.</p><p>Lia lowered her eyes first. Leaning forward, she rammed her fingers into her hair. \u201cHow did it go so wrong?\u201d she asked no one.</p><p>\u201cDorothea\u2019s probably asking the same thing,\u201d Thera said dryly.</p><p>Lia looked up. \u201cYou could go. There\u2019s nothing to hold you. No one will stop you, any of you, from catching the Winds and going home.\u201d</p><p>Thera took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cIf you make that same offer to everyone here, some, like Tomas and Cathryn, will stay with you because there\u2019s nowhere they\u2019d rather be; some will stay to safeguard Dena Nehele\u2019s future; and one will stay to destroy it.\u201d</p> <p>Thera took a last sip of whiskey and handed the bottle to Blaed. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019d like to settle in Dena Nehele and take you up on your offer to finish my training with your mother, if she\u2019ll have me. So I have a strong interest in the land\u2019s future and the Queen who will rule there. Besides, I\u2019m not going to raise my children in a Territory that stands in Hayll\u2019s shadow.\u201d</p><p>Blaed paled, then gulped some whiskey. \u201cW-whose children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably yours.\u201d Thera snapped. \u201cUnless you annoy me too much.\u201d</p><p>Blaed took another gulp of whiskey. As he linked his fingers with Thera\u2019s, he gave them all a silly grin. \u201cWe\u2019re really not slaves?\u201d</p><p>Lia wrapped her arms around her stomach, bit her lower lip, and shook her head.</p><p>Blaed\u2019s grin got sillier when he looked at Jared. \u201cIs there a Priestess in this village of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thera yelped.</p><p>Jared coughed politely. \u201cThere used to be. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be pleased to officiate over a handfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Thera growled, tugging futilely to free her hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Lia said in a strangled voice. \u201cI have to find a bush.\u201d She flung the door open and tumbled out of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better\u2014\u201d Jared began.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d Thera said.</p><p>Tomas was right. Shedid get a look in her eyes that could singe a man\u2019s ball hairs.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jared muttered as he bolted out the door.</p> <p>Thera\u2019s shout was muffled by the wagon door banging shut.</p><p>Ignoring a stab of envy, Jared corked the whiskey bottle and vanished it.</p><p>And realized he was missing a witch.</p><p>A quick probe of the surrounding area was rewarded by an annoyed mental jab.</p><p>A minute later, Lia emerged from behind the bushes, less than pleased to see him.</p><p>He matched her stride and waited.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Ranon\u2019s Wood,\u201d Lia said quietly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jared replied politely.</p><p>He knew that would be her decision\u2014not because of the help they\u2019d find there, but because it was his home. If she\u2019d realized it was that close, she probably would have headed there a lot sooner.</p><p>Getting her charges home. Getting one more to safety before her luck ran out. She\u2019d focus on that until they reached Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>Too late, she\u2019d realize her error.</p><p>Jared smiled in anticipation. It was going to be such fun watching Lia try to dodge around his father\u2019s code of honor.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Barely dawn. Barely light enough to see. Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Krelis drove his knife into the straw man that hung from the whipping posts. He didn\u2019t strike between the ribs and into the heart for a fast kill, but in the belly, in the guts. Over and over again.</p><p>The straw man swung back and forth with each blow. Back and forth.</p><p>Over and over and over.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with his plan.Nothing .</p><p>Except that bitch-Queen had tricked him from the very beginning.</p><p>Except the High Priestess was becoming impatient.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good. It wasn\u2019tsafe .</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t his fault that Gray-Jeweled bitch had tricked him. It wasn\u2019t his fault that the side scheme Dorothea had arranged with another Black Widow had ruined a good ambush. It wasn\u2019t his fault that his relatives regarded his mother as the family whore, an accommodation when a more socially powerful male deigned to visit them. It wasn\u2019t his fault that the damn man who had sired him couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, couldn\u2019t accept that all ofTerreille was slowly changing, not just the lousy little Province he lived in.</p><p>It wasn \u2018t his fault.</p><p>Stab stab stab.</p><p>\u201cLord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>And now he had to deal with that aristo bastard Maryk who must resent every breath he took because Maryk now had to yield to him when, just six months ago, Maryk had been giving him orders.</p><p>\u201cLord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, Krelis stepped away from the straw man and stared at his second-in-command.</p><p>Something slithered in the depths of Maryk\u2019s eyes as he regarded the figure tied to the whipping posts.</p><p>\u201cHe was a difficult slave,\u201d Maryk said carefully, lifting his voice at the end to make it almost a question.</p><p>Puzzled. Krelis looked at the straw man.</p><p>He saw the blood. Smelled the bowel. And couldn\u2019t remember the exact moment he\u2019d exchanged the straw practice figure for a living man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Maryk said quietly. \u201cGet cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Krelis dropped the knife and walked away, stumbling a little now that the fury was gone. Stumbling a little, and feeling more than a little sick, because the something in Maryk\u2019s eyes was pity.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201c Jared asked when Blaed met him where the main road forked with a stony track.</p><p>Blaed patted the sweating mare\u2019s neck, then lengthened the reins to give her a chance to stretch her back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any sign of riders passing down that track,\u201d Blaed said cautiously, \u201cbut it\u2019s stony ground.\u201d Then he took a deep breath and huffed it out. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Jared, I\u2019m not a trained guard. I can handle a knife, and I know how to fight with Craft, but I could have looked at something obvious and not known it. The track does seem to run straight north. It\u2019s wide enough to accommodate the wagon, although there\u2019s a stretch that looks like it was cut out of the rock. No maneuvering room there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo once we\u2019re in that stretch, we\u2019re committed to going forward.\u201d</p><p>Blaed nodded.</p><p>Jared rubbed his thumb over the saddle horn. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a large nest of viper rats among the boulders. I didn\u2019t see them, but I heard them.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled grimly. \u201cIf we lock the boys in the wagon, we just might avoid having one of them get bit.\u201d</p><p>Blaed waited. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked back up the road he\u2019d spent the past hour scouting, probing. \u201cI found signs of a large group of riders having come this way recently. A day ago. Maybe two. But I didn\u2019t find them.\u201d</p><p>Blaed rubbed his neck. \u201cA Red probe can cover a lot of ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Black Widow can spin a web that would defeat that probe.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence settled between them.</p><p>The four of them had gathered inside the wagon late last night. During the talking and planning, a lot of things had been revealed.</p><p>Lia had told Thera and Blaed the reasons the \u201cGray Lady\u201d had gone to Raej one last time. She\u2019d told them about the wrongness she had felt and about the warning note that had sent them fleeing cross-country.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t tell them why she hadn\u2019t been able to buy passage on a second Coach.</p><p>Then Thera had told the three of them about the tangled webs she\u2019d created for the wagon.</p><p>Jared still wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d have felt easier if he\u2019d known about Thera\u2019s precaution earlier, but that kind of skill in a witch not fully trained had served as a sharp reminder of why Black Widows, with their ability to ensnare or deceive a person\u2019s mind, were so dangerous.</p><p>She\u2019d called it a mirroring web. A fairly simple tangled web. When triggered by a psychic probe, the web returned a message more subtle than a thought or a feeling. The probe would touch the web and deliver a simple message:Nothing there .</p><p>While they were still at the inn Lia had brought them to after leaving Raej, Thera had embedded four of those tangled webs into the wood of the wagon\u2014one on each side. She couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014say why she\u2019d done it. But Jared suspected she\u2019d been covering her own tracks, just in case her sire had somehow been able to trace her to the slave auction. It didn\u2019t really matter who she\u2019d originally created those webs to hide, the result was the same: How many times during their journey had someone probed for them after finding one of those brass buttons and found \u201cnothing there\u201d?</p><p>And had he really seen evidence of an abandoned camp when he\u2019d scouted the road an hour ago, or could those men have been hiding nearby in the land\u2019s many dips and hollows, shielded by a similar kind of tangled web?</p><p>Jared broke the silence first. \u201cThe road loops, then heads north.\u201d</p><p>Blaed nodded slowly, looking at the track that forked with the road. \u201cThe track\u2019s a shortcut then. If marauders blocked both ends, we\u2019d be trapped on it.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cJared, the Winds cross that track right near the stretch of boulders.\u201d</p><p>Jared swore fiercely. While it was customary to use the official landing places\u2014and it was certainly safer since there wasn\u2019t the risk of dropping from the Webs onto precarious ground\u2014the Blood could catch the Winds or drop from them anywhere along the way. Which meant they could have unwelcome company without any warning.</p><p>If they abandoned the wagon and horses, he could put a Red shield around all of them and they could ride the Winds the rest of the way to Ranon\u2019s Wood. Even shielded, riding that dark a Web would be an uncomfortable ride for the lighter-Jeweled among them\u2014and a desperate one for Cathryn, Tomas, and Garth, who couldn\u2019t rideany of the Winds without the protection of a Coach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If they did it, it would have to be the Red Wind. A lighter Web would be easier on the others. It would also increase the risk of having enemies riding the Wind with them.</p><p>But all it would take was one Red-Jeweled marauder unleashing enough power to break his shield and the others would have no time to drop from the Wind before their minds were torn apart by the power in the Red Web.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Blaed said quietly. \u201cI did think of it. I also considered letting everyone capable of it ride the Wind of their Jewels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d let Thera ride alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Even if Iwas willing, she wouldn\u2019t ride the Winds alone. Between them, she and Lia would gather up the children and Garth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking all the same risks with none of the strength to back them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we stay and take the risks overland.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed his forehead, trying to quiet the headache that was starting to bloom. \u201cSo we stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cServing in a First Circle\u2019s not easy, is it?\u201d Blaed said dryly. He shifted in the saddle. \u201cA trained guard would know how to defend against an ambush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trained guard would know how to create one, too,\u201d Jared countered. The headache was pounding in time with his heart. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about Thayne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure about Thayne. And we all agreed that, while a child could be misled enough to drop the buttons for someone to find, none of them is old enough or strong enough to handle a connection with the spells tangling up Garth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat narrows our choices, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jared sighed. \u201cDoes taking an innocent life get balanced somehow by destroying an enemy? I couldn\u2019t sleep last night, so I kept asking myself what my father would do if he were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get an answer?\u201d</p><p>Jared snorted. \u201cNo. Not from him anyway. But I know what my mother\u2019s answer would be. Then again, she\u2019s a Healer, and Healers feel quite strongly about life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do some Queens,\u201d Blaed replied.</p><p>Jared shortened the gelding\u2019s reins. \u201cYes, may the Darkness help us, so do some Queens.\u201d</p><p>Jared climbed among the tumbled boulders, looking for a place that would give him a little privacy. After a minute, he found a spot cupped by surrounding boulders that rose a little higher than a man\u2019s waist. Anyone who noticed him would think he\u2019d just climbed up to take a look around. In fact\u2014he unfastened his trousers and grinned at the wet rock in front of him\u2014someone had already found this place.</p><p>The grin faded. As he took care of business, he studied the people gathered around the wagon.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, why had the back axle broken now? Was it an accident caused by the stress of traveling over rough ground or a deliberate act to delay them in the worst possible section of this track?</p><p>As Jared straightened his clothes and turned to climb down, he caught a glint of metal among the rocks.</p><p>His heart slammed into his throat as he stared at the brass button.</p><p>Then a prickle between his shoulder blades made him look up.</p> <p>The dust cloud coming down the road made no sense\u2014 until he realized a sight shield hiding horses and riders hadn\u2019t been extended far enough to cover the sign of their passing.</p><p>Looking in the other direction, he saw another dust cloud rapidly approaching the wagon.</p><p>*Blaed!*Jared roared. *It\u2019s a trap!*</p><p>Blaed didn\u2019t turn, didn\u2019t answer. For a moment, Jared wondered if he\u2019d been wrong to trust the Warlord Prince. Then Blaed ran to the front of the wagon while the others scattered among the boulders.</p><p>Taking one deep breath to steady his hard-pounding heart, Jared turned south again, raised his hand, and created a Red shield that spanned the road, extending it upward until a rider wouldn\u2019t be able to unleash his power without hitting the shield.</p><p>The sound of boots scrambling on stone came from behind him.</p><p>Whirling, Jared saw the three marauders just before one of them unleashed a bolt of Purple Dusk power directly at him.</p><p>Throwing a Red shield around himself, he flung himself to one side, gritting his teeth as the boulder that had been behind him exploded. Chunks of rock hit his shield hard enough to make him feel the blow.</p><p>Before the marauders could strike again, he unleashed the Red in two short bursts. The first blast shattered the marauders\u2019 shields. The second tore through their bodies.</p><p>Jared scrambled through the boulders, reaching the road at the same time the marauders reached the Red shield. It sizzled as they unleashed their Jewels against it.</p><p>They\u2019d come on foot. A good move, Jared realized as he extended the shield so that it formed a barrier along the top of the boulders on either side of the road. A few dead horses would have made an effective barricade.</p><p>Jared started backing away, extending the Red shields as he moved toward the wagon.</p><p>Strikes against the side shield pulled his attention away from the men in the road. As he turned to strengthen that side, he saw a dozen more marauders suddenly appear.</p><p>Not only had they come down the road from both directions, the bastards were dropping down from the Winds!</p><p>The next few minutes passed in lightning-fast images. The wagon exploded when blasts of power struck it from two sides. A ball of witchfire set what was left on fire. A horse screamed. A man roared. More and more marauders gathered a few feet behind the Red shields, unleashing their Jewels against it, forcing him to draw more and more of his own strength into maintaining and extending the shields as he continued to creep back toward the wagon.</p><p>Suddenly, the Green Jewels unleashed farther up the road, one on each side.</p><p>Jared heard men scream, felt something in the land die as it exploded and burned. He couldn\u2019t extend his shields to surround their little group because he didn\u2019t know where the others were, didn\u2019t know where Lia was among all the shattering boulders. There was so much power sizzling around them, his efforts to contact the others through a psychic link yielded nothing.</p><p>A blast of power coming from behind him hit the boulders above his head, knocking him down. Momentarily stunned, Jared felt the Red shield across the track break.</p><p>He created another a few yards in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGive it up,\u201d one of the marauders yelled when he reached the new shield. \u201cYou can\u2019t win against us, slave. Give it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun shines in Hell,\u201d Jared muttered, strengthening the shields. He darted among the boulders that had fallen into the track, constantly extending the shields as he continued to work his way to the burning wagon and the section of the road where he\u2019d seen the others run for cover.</p><p>Blast after blast rocked the shields. Jared continued to unleash short bursts of power to break through personal shields and inner barriers, but for every marauder who fell, two more took his place.</p><p>Two bursts of power were unleashed on the road directly in front of him, and a thick cloud of dirt rose up, blinding him while he tried to regain his footing on the edge of the newly made pit. Choking, he rubbed his eyes to clear away the tears and dirt and didn\u2019t see the man rushing out of the cloud.</p><p>Strong hands grabbed him and hauled him behind some boulders.</p><p>A Purple Dusk shield formed a dome around them and the boulders in front of them.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, even the Black Widow knows how to fight better than you do,\u201d Randolf growled, crouching beside Jared.</p><p>Resisting the urge to ram a fist into Randolf\u2019s face. Jared snapped. \u201c\u2018I was never trained for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was she, but she knows enough not to be polite or dainty about it,\u201d Randolf snapped back. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting our best weapon.\u201d</p><p>Refusing to respond, Jared started to extend the shield on his side of the road and hit a Green shield that returned the contact with enough punch to make him feel like a baby bolt of lightning had run up his spine and scorched his lungs.</p><p>Jared shook his head to clear it and tried to convince his chest to expand enough so that he could try to breathe.</p><p>\u201cTold you she fights better than you,\u201d Randolf said.</p><p>Marauders dashed among the boulders on the other side of the track. Collisions of psychic power caused the energy to veer off in all directions, striking wildly.</p><p>A woman screamed in rage.</p><p>A man roared a fierce battle cry.</p><p>Somewhere among the boulders, a child screamed in terror.</p><p>That scream chilled Jared. He turned to Randolf. \u201cWhat\u2019s our best weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Red Jewels,\u201d Randolf said abruptly. Shoving Jared closer to the ground, he raised his right hand, which now wore a Purple Dusk ring, and unleashed fast arrow bolts of power.</p><p>Pushing against Randolfs restraining left hand, Jared raised his head high enough to see a marauder trying to crawl back between the shattered boulders and the bottom of the Red shield. Blood gushed from the man\u2019s severed leg.</p><p>Randolf waited until the man\u2019s body filled the gap. He unleashed the Purple Dusk again, severing the other leg just above the knee.</p><p>Jared stared at the Warlord guard. Crouching comfortably, Randolf returned the stare with a steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou did exactly what they counted on you doing,\u201d Randolf said quietly. \u201cYou threw your strength into defending instead of fighting. If I were up there, I would have gambled that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Randolf ignored the question. \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown twice as many men against you as they\u2019ve got pinning down the rest of us because they want to eliminate the Red.\u201d He snorted. \u201cI doubt they were expecting our Ladies to show so much teeth and temper. Once you\u2019re gone, though, they\u2019ve got the numbers to pull the rest of us down and take whatever they\u2019ve come to take.\u201d</p><p>Randolf didn\u2019t need to say the obvious. There was only one person\u2014now, maybe two\u2014who was worth this much effort and this kind of cost.</p><p>\u201cYou defend well, Warlord,\u201d Randolf said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bodies lying among the boulders aren\u2019t resting,Warlord ,\u201d Jared replied, feeling foolishly like an adolescent who\u2019d just had an older male dismiss his efforts as barely adequate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your strength that way. The way you\u2019ve been doing it, you need two strikes\u2014one for a man\u2019s shield and one for the inner barriers. Plus you\u2019re feeding the shields.\u201d</p><p>Jared ground his teeth. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop feeding the shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do that, they\u2019ll fall in a minute,\u201d Jared protested.</p> <p>Randolf eyed him grimly. \u201cThen a minute\u2019s all you have. A fast descent to your core, come up under their inner barriers and unleash. Hold your strength in a half circle.\u201d He drew a small figure in the air with his finger. \u201cKeep the baseline directly in front of you. Then fan out the Red in front of that line. If you unleash in a circle, you\u2019ll take out all of us as well as them.\u201d</p><p>Jared swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried anything like that. What if I can\u2019t control it that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll all be destroyed completely,\u201d Randolf replied harshly. \u201cIf we\u2019re not lucky, you\u2019ll be looking at a lot of empty but still-living husks.\u201d His hand clamped down on Jared\u2019s arm. \u201cNo mistakes. No second chances. And no time to get squeamish. It\u2019s a fast kill. We need to cut the odds.\u201d The hand on Jared\u2019s arm gentled. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t tell anyone if you puke your guts out afterward.\u201d</p><p>Not understanding that last comment, Jared swallowed again, took a deep breath, turned inward, and dove into the abyss.</p><p>Except during his training when he\u2019d been mentally tethered to an instructor, he\u2019d never made a fast dive down to his core, his inner web. The speed and the panicky feeling that he was falling and out of control terrified him. If he plunged through his inner web, at best he\u2019d cut himself off from his own power and destroy his ability to wear the Jewels; at worst, he\u2019d shatter his own mind.</p> <p>He flashed past the level of the lighter Jewels, gaining speed.</p><p>White, Yellow.</p><p>He was falling too fast. But there was no time to slow down the descent.</p><p>Tiger Eye, Rose.</p><p>If he failed, Lia . . .</p><p>Summer-sky, Purple Dusk.</p> <p>A woman had screamed.</p><p>Opal, Green.</p><p>A woman had screamed.</p><p>He stopped thinking, let the Warlord in him reign. The dive changed instantly from a frantic, barely controlled plunge into a graceful, savage dive. His heartbeat drum kept the slow, steady rhythm as he flashed past the depth of the Sapphire and gathered his strength, preparing to make the turn just above his inner web.</p><p>This is what Blood males meant when they talked of rising to the killing edge. The mind cleared of all distractions. A lifetime was contained between heartbeats. He had all the time he needed to think, to act.</p><p>Jared made the turn and began his ascent. Above him, he saw those other minds as flickering, Jewel-colored stars, as candle flames that were about to be snuffed out by a wild Red wind. He drew a mental line, creating the half circle the way Randolf had told him.</p><p>As he continued to rise, he waited, waited.</p><p>A few Opals, but nothing stronger.</p> <p>As he rose to the level of the Green, he unleashed the Red, flooding those smaller containers until they burst from within.</p><p>Up, up, up. Jewel stars exploded. Above the White were the colorless candles of the non-Jeweled Blood. He snuffed them out, too.</p><p>A hand clamped on his shoulder. Fingers dug into his arm.</p><p>Ignoring the hand, he turned and made another leisurely descent. Not so deep this time. He didn\u2019t need to go deep. The Red still throbbed in his blood.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Jared,\u201d a harsh voice yelled in his ear.</p><p>He understood it now. Create a frame around the Jewel stars. Hold the power within that frame.</p><p>He turned slightly, his eyes seeing and yet not seeing the boulders on the other side of the road.</p><p>A box. A neat box to hold those little candles. His mental frame brushed against a Summer-sky star. Recognizing the psychic scent, he pulled the frame away from Corry\u2019s terrified mind.</p><p>And unleashed again.</p><p>More Jewel stars burst. Died.</p><p>A fist clipped his chin, snapping his head back.</p><p>Snarling, Jared twisted to face whoever dared interfere with him.</p><p>Fear filled Randolf s brown eyes\u2014fear and grim acceptance.</p><p>Jared blinked.</p><p>The heartbeat drum sped up.</p><p>Before he was aware of it, he slid away from the killing edge.</p><p>He blinked again and looked around.</p><p>Randolf hadn\u2019t told him the psychic explosion might also manifest as physical destruction.</p><p>Jared stared at the shattered faces, the exploded heads.</p><p>Breaking away from Randolf\u2019s restraining hands, Jared leaned over the boulder that had been giving them a little cover and heaved.</p><p>A strong, callused hand covered his forehead. Another hand soothingly rubbed his back.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me,\u201d Jared gasped. He heaved again.</p><p>\u201cWould have made it harder for you,\u201d Randolf said roughly.</p><p>Panting, Jared tried to spit out the sick taste. He straightened up slowly.</p><p>Randolf took a step back.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done that?\u201d Jared asked, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p><p>Randolf nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve done it. There are good reasons why the dark-Jeweled Blood are feared, Jared.\u201d</p><p>A blast of power striking a nearby boulder reminded them that the battle wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Jared threw a Red shield around both of them. They sprinted across the road, choosing a place that would hide them from anyone above them.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Randolf said with grudging admiration. \u201cDespite all the power they\u2019re throwing against her, the Black Widow is still managing to hold that Green shield.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of that shield, dozens of marauders continued to unleash the strength of their Jewels, trying to break through.</p><p>The blasts of power coming from their side of the road were mostly focused on the remains of the wagon. Thera was probably using it for cover. Was Lia with her?</p><p>Jared pushed away from the boulders, feeling a little light-headed. \u201cShall we give the Ladies a hand?\u201d</p><p>Randolf grabbed his arm and yanked him down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something odd about that shield,\u201d Randolf said, narrowing his eyes. \u201cNever seen anything like that. Didn\u2019t even know you coulddo that.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t see anything at first. Then he noticed the weird flickering inside the shield\u2014flashes of Purple Dusk inside the Green. He could almost feel the elation of the men who were sending bolt after bolt of power against the shield.</p><p>\u201cThe Purple Dusk is probably her Birthright Jewel,\u201d Jared said. \u201cIf the reservoir of power in her Green Jewel is almost gone, she\u2019d switch to her Birthright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case, there would be a Purple Dusk shieldbehind the Green one. But it looks like she\u2019s blending the strength of her Birthright Jewel with the strength of her Green. Damned if I know how.\u201d</p><p>One of the marauders shouted something. The blasts stopped. A few seconds later,all of them unleashed at the same time.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>On the third collective strike, the Green shield broke and the Purple Dusk power inside it turned into a roaring wall of witchfire that swept across the boulders.</p><p>Men screamed in agony, caught in that flood of fire.</p><p>The witchfire burned out in a few seconds.</p><p>It was more than enough.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes, unable to watch as the bodies ravaged by the fire began to fall.</p><p>\u201cMother Night.\u201d Randolf whispered sickly. \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>Shuddering, Jared pressed his forehead against his knees.</p><p>He heard horrified shouts coming from the boulders above him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t move. Hehad to move. Had to find the others. Had to find Lia.</p><p>In the tense seconds that followed, there were no more blasts of unleashed power. No more shouts.</p><p>Silence, except for a rhythmic pounding somewhere close by.</p><p>\u201cThe bastards who were left caught the Winds and fled,\u201d Randolf said, cautiously getting to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t think there were many of them.\u201d</p><p>Jared slowly raised his head, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to look across the road. Even using the boulders for support, it took a couple of tries to get to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d Jared stumbled over the words.</p><p>Randolf wiped a sleeve across his clammy face. \u201cNor I. Not like that. Never like that.\u201d</p><p>Jared raked a dirty hand through his hair. He took a deep breath and willed his quivering legs to move. \u201cLet\u2019s find the others.\u201d</p><p>They found Corry and Cathryn a few feet up the road, half-hidden by piles of stones that had been large boulders a short time ago.</p><p>\u201cYou can drop the shield now, Corry,\u201d Jared said, noting that the Summer-sky Jewel the boy wore around his neck didn\u2019t have even a flicker of reserve power left.</p><p>\u201cI-is it done?\u201d Corry whispered. The faint freckles on his nose and cheeks stood out lividly against the pasty skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Corry slowly uncurled. Cathryn remained in a tight ball.</p><p>Corry patted Cathryn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all right now. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Cathryn\u2019s eyes remained terrifyingly blank.</p><p>Corry shook her gently. \u201cCathryn? It\u2019s all right now.\u201d</p><p>Jared crouched down, wondering if he dared to touch her.</p><p>A minute passed before Cathryn took a shuddering breath and blinked. She looked at Jared and burst into tears.</p><p>Corry put his arms around her and rocked her. Then he pressed his face against her shoulder and started crying.</p><p>Jared rested a hand on Corry\u2019s bright red hair. Recognizing there was nothing he could do for either of them, he left them.</p><p>A few moments later, Eryk stumbled into the road. He would have fallen if Randolf hadn\u2019t caught him. He looked at Jared, and his eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d Eryk sobbed. \u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>Randolf pulled the boy into a fierce embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-Tomas.\u201d Eryk said. \u201cTomas ... I tried!\u201d</p><p>Leaving Randolf to deal with Eryk, Jared hurried toward the wagon. Thayne was nearby, swaying on his feet as he soothed the gelding, mare, and one of the wagon horses. When he turned, Jared saw the burns that covered the left side of his face and his left arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shielded the horses,\u201d Jared said. Seeing the sorrow and pain in Thayne\u2019s eyes, Jared glanced at the wagon. He quickly looked away from the remains of the other horse. \u201cHow badly are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Thayne tried to smile. \u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>Blaed walked down the road toward them, moving so carefully Jared\u2019s body ached in sympathy.</p> <p>Do my eyes look that haunted? Jared wondered.</p><p>\u201cI killed them,\u201d Blaed said, his voice trailing away.</p><p>Jared understood what wasn\u2019t being said. To protect Thera and Lia, Blaed had made the choice to step onto that private battlefield inside himself and wholly embrace the violent nature of a Warlord Prince. What Jared had needed Randolf\u2019s instruction to do, Blaed had done instinctively\u2014and had been no more prepared for the results of that kind of killing than Jared had been.</p><p>Before Jared could think of something to say to Blaed, Thera suddenly appeared, staggering from exhaustion and sobbing uncontrollably. Thin to begin with, she now had the gaunt, dried-husk look of a witch who had channeled too much power through her body.</p><p>\u201cLia?\u201d she said plaintively, a desperate look in her eyes.</p> <p>No answer.</p><p>When Blaed moved toward her, she stumbled away from him, holding her arms out for balance.</p><p>\u201cLia!\u201d Thera looked around frantically.</p><p>Ice coated Jared\u2019s spine. Wherewas Lia? Was she too hurt to answer?</p><p>\u201cLIA!\u201d Staggering over to the boulders, Thera tried to climb. Her body shook with the effort. Sobbing hysterically, she sank to the ground. \u201cLIIIAA!\u201d</p><p>Jared turned toward the boulders, opening his inner barriers as he searched for Lia\u2019s psychic scent, probed for some trace of a Green Jewel.</p> <p>He found nothing.</p><p>\u201cLIA!\u201d Jared shouted.</p><p>He scrambled through the boulders, slipped on torn-apart bodies, barely aware of them except to feel relief that they were male.</p><p>A groan to his left made him tense, crouch.</p><p>A male hand wearing a Purple Dusk ring appeared above a boulder, found a handhold.</p><p>Jared pointed his Red-Jeweled ring toward the man rising behind the boulder and waited.</p><p>Brock stared at Jared, blood streaming down his face.</p><p>\u201cDid they take her?\u201d Brock asked hoarsely.</p> <p>Jared didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIs the Lady safe? Is the boy all right?\u201d Brock\u2019s blue eyes begged for an answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jared asked. Somewhere in the rocks behind him, he heard Thera calling for Lia.</p><p>Brock licked his lips. He coughed and spat out blood. \u201cToo many of the bastards. One group came at me. While I was trying to hold them, a couple of them circled around. Eryk was trying to shield Tomas, but he only wears the Yellow. They broke through his shield. Tossed him aside and grabbed Tomas. Next thing I know, they\u2019re standing up on that rock over there\u201d\u2014Brock jerked his chin toward a flat boulder a few yards away\u2014\u201cyelling if she didn\u2019t give herself to them, they\u2019d throw the boy to his death. I told her\u2014Itold her to stay down, stay hidden. Told her I\u2019d get Tomas. Made it this far when my shields broke and they were on me. Last thing I saw before I went down was Lady Lia running toward that boulder and Garth swinging that damn broken axle like a club.\u201d</p><p>Brock spat again and then said in a bewildered voice, \u201cShe was shielding that broken bastard. And there was some kind of Craft wrapped around that axle. They couldn\u2019t touch him. and he was smashing through skulls like they were ripe tomatoes. Why did she do it, Jared? Why did she shield a male who\u2019s already half-dead? Why did she risk herself for a half-Blood?\u201d</p><p>There are no pawns.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t answer. There was something he\u2019d forgotten. Something important. But how, in the name of Hell, was a man supposed to think with that damn pounding?</p><p>A woman screaming in rage.</p><p>A man roaring a battle cry.</p><p>A child screaming in terror.</p><p>Then he remembered the other danger that lived among the boulders.</p><p>Jared ran to the flat-topped boulder and climbed up it as fast as he could.</p><p>He saw Garth first.</p><p>The big man stood at the edge of the large nest of viper rats, pounding, pounding, pounding the faintly squeaking bodies into pulp. Tears ran down his face, and each breath came out as a sob.</p><p>Jared looked to the right and saw Lia crawling away from the nest, dragging Tomas with her.</p><p>Jared slid down the boulder, landing hard on his hands and knees. \u201cLia!\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, he crawled after her and grabbed her foot. \u201cLia!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, didn\u2019t notice him. With one arm wrapped around Tomas\u2019s chest, she kept trying to crawl away from the nest.</p><p>Jared leaned forward to grab the back of her coat, lost his balance, and fell on top of her.</p><p>She still tried to crawl.</p><p>\u201cLia!\u201d Thera cried.</p><p>Jared rolled off Lia and looked up.</p><p>Blaed and Thera stumbled toward him.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Lia,\u201d Thera gasped, dropping to her knees beside the now-still body. When she couldn\u2019t pry Lia\u2019s fingers open, she used Craft to rip Tomas\u2019s tunic around the clenched hand.</p><p>Blaed dragged the boy a few feet. Thera went with him.</p><p>Breathing hard, Jared turned Lia onto her back.</p><p>Her tunic was so torn, she was almost bare to the waist.</p><p>He looked into glazed gray eyes that stared back at him, unseeing.</p><p>Numb, Jared saw the smears of blood, the grotesque swelling of the viper rat bites on her jaw and neck, the swelling above her left breast. Aching, he listened as Lia struggled to breathe. Desperate, he tried to remember something,anything , about healing Craft that would save her.</p><p>Thera knelt beside him. Tears ran down her face.</p><p>\u201cTomas?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll honor him as Blood,\u201d Thera replied.</p><p>Jared waited for Thera to do something.</p><p>She simply knelt beside him, her hands pressed against her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHelp her,\u201d Jared said, frightened by Thera\u2019s calm shell.</p><p>Thera licked the tears from the corners of her mouth. \u201cI only know a little basic healing, Jared. My knowledge of poisons is limited to what a Black Widow needs to know for herself. There\u2019s too much venom in her. I\u2019m s-sorry. I don\u2019t h-have the s-skill.\u201d</p><p>Watching Thera curl in on herself, Jared didn\u2019t realize the pounding had stopped until the broken axle, now slimed with gore, thumped down beside him and a heavy hand squeezed his shoulder hard enough to crack bone.</p><p>He looked up at Garth\u2019s tear-stained face.</p><p>\u201cYyyou fffind help,\u201d Garth said, fighting for each word. \u201cYyyou go. Yyyou take\u2014\u201d He pointed at Lia. \u201cFffind help. Fffind sssafe place.\u201d</p><p>Help. Safe place.</p><p>Hope shot through Jared.</p><p>Closing his eyes to concentrate, he sent out a summons on a Red spear thread. North, toward Ranon\u2019s Wood. *Belarr!*</p><p>He waited a moment, then tried again. *Belarr! I need help!*</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Even if Belarr was still angry with him, he wouldn\u2019t ignore a call for help.</p><p>*Father!*</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He tried an Opal thread. *Mother! We need a Healer!*</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Lia\u2019s breathing sounded harsher.</p><p>Jared sent out a broad summons at the depth of the Red, letting it spread in an ever-widening circle as far as he could push it. There was the risk that an enemy might answer, but he felt desperate enough to believe any answer was better than none. *Please! I need help!*</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, he tried again and again.</p><p>Here.</p><p>At first, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d been answered.</p><p>Here.</p><p>Not a communication thread. This was far more subtle. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was a male or female who had answered him. Couldn\u2019t even tell what direction it had come from.</p><p>Here.</p><p>It would guide him. He couldn\u2019t have explained why he believed that, but as he felt that coaxing tug, he was sure of it.</p><p>Jared opened his eyes and got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d Thera whispered.</p><p>The painful hope in Thera\u2019s voice decided him. \u201cA chance,\u201d he said as he picked up Lia.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t go like that,\u201d Thera said, calling in her dark-green, hooded cloak. \u201cShe\u2019ll get cold.\u201d</p><p>Jared wasn\u2019t sure Lia could feel anything at this point, but he didn\u2019t argue. He and Blaed held her upright while Thera draped the cloak around her and pulled up the hood.</p><p>Jared wrapped his arms around Lia, resting her head against his shoulder. He looked at Blaed. \u201cGet to Ranon\u2019s Wood as fast as you can, any way you can.\u201d He hesitated, hoping it would be true. \u201cWe\u2019ll join you there.\u201d</p><p>Blaed slipped an arm around Thera\u2019s waist. \u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>Here.</p><p>Putting a Red shield around Lia, Jared caught the Red Wind and followed the promise of help.</p><p>Had it been a trick after all?</p><p>Jared stared at the large, rough-looking traveler\u2019s inn. Somehow, the clean windows and the small flower beds on either side of the brightly painted door made the rambling stone building look rougher, like a sweaty laborer standing next to a woman dressed for an afternoon tea.</p><p>Not a sleek or refined place, Jared decided. Definitely not to aristo tastes, but definitely Blood. There was an unmistakable feel to a place where the Blood resided, a psychic residue that was absorbed by wood and stone.</p><p>Turning away from the inn, Jared focused his attention on the nearby road that led to a Blood village a couple of miles away. Was that his destination?</p><p>Sighing, he reluctantly turned back to the inn. The coaxing tug that had guided him had stopped here. If whoever had answered him was in the village, wouldn\u2019t the tugging have continued? Here, then.</p><p>A cautious probe had told him there were twenty people in the inn, three of them women. Maybe one was a Healer.</p><p>Jared looked over his shoulder at the faint outline of a cloaked body. He\u2019d taken the precaution of wrapping a Red sight shield around Lia before they\u2019d dropped from the Winds to this landing place, and he\u2019d used Craft to float her so that it wouldn\u2019t be obvious to anyone who might look out a window that he wasn\u2019t alone. For a moment, he listened to her labored breathing, both pained and relieved by the sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t found the Red-Jeweled person who had guided him there when he\u2019d probed the inn on his arrival. That\u2019s why he was still standing on the landing place, even though he knew Lia\u2019s life was trickling away with every minute he hesitated.</p><p>Decide, he thought.Decide before she takes a breath and then doesn\u2019t take another .</p><p>Jared raked his hands through his hair and brushed at his clothes. He smiled grimly. He doubted the owner or the customers were dressed much better, so at least he wasn\u2019t going to look out of place.</p> <p>All right. He\u2019d rent a room where he could safely tuck Lia while he tried to find someone with the healing skills to help her. Failing that, he\u2019d use the healing skills he had. Failing that . . .</p><p>Jared straightened his shoulders. He wouldn\u2019t fail. No matter what he had to do, he wasnot going to just sit back and watch her die.</p><p>He added an aural shield and a psychic shield to the sight and protective shields already around Lia so that the others wouldn\u2019t detect her psychic scent or hear any sounds she might make. The shields would make her completely invisible to anyone who wore less than the Red. Even another Red would only pick up a faint outline.</p><p>Jared took a deep breath. As he breathed out, he wrapped psychic threads around himself and Lia that sent out a feeling of danger and violence. With his Red Jewel hanging in plain sight, those projected feelings should be enough to keep everyone at a distance. All his efforts to prevent anyone from knowing she was there wouldn\u2019t be worth anything if someone bumped into her.</p><p>With Lia floating upright behind him, Jared strode to the inn.</p> <p>Balls and sass, he repeated under his breath.Balls and sass .</p><p>The door opened onto the common drinking room. To the left was a partially open door that led into a small, private room.</p><p>A heavy silence descended as every man in the room turned toward the door, including the bushy-bearded, Green-Jeweled Warlord standing behind the bar\u2014a man who looked big enough and strong enough to wrestle with Garth and come out the winner.</p><p>Standing in the doorway. Jared looked at every face. No one but the innkeeper met his eyes for more than a second. Except for the innkeeper, the men were either lighter-Jeweled Warlords or Blood males who wore no Jewels at all.</p><p>Jared slowly walked to the bar. relieved that the men, picking up the scent of danger and violence that swirled around him, carefully moved out of his way. Calling in the gold marks he hadn\u2019t returned to Lia after his trip to the village, Jared placed one on the bar and looked the Green-Jeweled Warlord in the eyes.</p><p>The innkeeper calmly returned the look, but Jared noticed a flicker of something else in the depths of the man\u2019s eyes. Relief?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure, Warlord?\u201d the innkeeper rumbled.</p><p>Jared let the silence spin out a little before he answered. \u201cA room with a bath, if you have it. Dinner. A bottle of good whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a room that shares a bath with one other. All the others use the common bathing rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the other room occupied?\u201d</p><p>That flicker again in the innkeeper\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Jared turned slightly away from the bar and scanned the room. No one admitted being the other room\u2019s occupant. However, tucked between the staircase leading to the upstairs rooms and the inner wall of the small, private room was a round table that held an open bottle and a half-full glass of red wine.</p><p>The prickling started between Jared\u2019s shoulder blades as two things struck him: Wine wasn\u2019t usually served in a place like this, and all the men were standing or sitting on this side of the room, as if no one wanted to get too close to that table.</p> <p>He had to get Lia out of this room before whoever was sitting at that table returned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the room,\u201d he said to the innkeeper.</p><p>The man took the gold mark. He set a bottle of whiskey and a key on the bar. \u201cThere are glasses and a jug of water in the room.\u201d</p><p>Noting the number, Jared slipped the key into his pocket and picked up the whiskey.</p><p>He took a couple of steps toward the stairs and stopped, clutching the bottle with suddenly numb fingers.</p><p>The table was no longer unoccupied.</p><p>Daemon Sadi raised the wineglass in a mocking salute.</p><p>Balls and sass, Jared muttered silently as he walked over to the table, careful to keep Lia hidden behind him. Balls and sass.</p><p>\u201cPrince Sadi,\u201d Jared said politely.</p><p>\u201cLord Jared,\u201d Daemon murmured.</p><p>The golden eyes watching him looked deceptively sleepy. That deep voice flowed over him like warm water over bare skin. That beautiful face might have been carved from ice for all the feeling it revealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Jared asked, feeling sweat trickle down his sides. He didn\u2019t have time for this.Lia didn\u2019t have time for this. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of place I\u2019d expect to find you or your Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about my current Lady. This wouldn\u2019t be to her taste.\u201d Daemon sipped his wine. \u201cBut I sometimes find places like this a refreshing change from a court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re alone?\u201d Jared couldn\u2019t mask his surprise fast enough.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady and I have reached an agreement. I spend a few days away from the court each month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she get in return?\u201d</p><p>The Sadist smiled.</p><p>Jared shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hurt her as much as I want to,\u201d Daemon said too softly. Another wineglass appeared on the table. \u201cJoin me, Lord Jared.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an invitation or a request.</p><p>Feeling sick, Jared tried to smile. \u201cIt would be a pleasure, but let me wash the travel dirt off first.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for Daemon\u2019s consent, but turned toward the stairs, using Craft to float Lia in a counterturn so that she ended up in front of him.</p><p>Sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let the Sadist notice her, Jared silently prayed as he climbed the stairs, painfully aware of those golden eyes watching every move.</p><p>As soon as he was out of Daemon\u2019s line of sight, Jared grabbed Lia and hurried down the corridor. The inn was larger than he\u2019d thought, and it took him a couple of minutes to find the side corridor that held his room.</p><p>He put a Red shield around the room, a Red lock on the door. He pulled back the bedcovers, dropped all the shields around Lia. and laid her carefully on the bed.</p><p>When he vanished her clothes and looked at her, the strength went out of his legs. He sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the viper rat bites.</p><p>They had swollen to twice the size they\u2019d been when he\u2019d taken Lia away from the wagon a short time ago. In the center, where the rats\u2019 teeth had broken the skin, the bites looked pus-filled and yellow. The rest of the swollen skin was an angry, red-streaked purple that darkened to black.</p><p>The only viper rat bite he\u2019d ever seen was the one his little brother Davin had gotten. Granted, that was years ago, but he didn\u2019t remember it looking so dark and malignant.</p><p>Jared tucked the bedcovers around Lia\u2019s still body. \u201cI\u2019ll find someone to help,\u201d he whispered, gently brushing her dark hair away from her pale face. \u201cI swear it.\u2018\u201d</p><p>There had to be a back staircase, a servants\u2019 staircase,some other way to reach the ground floor without using the stairs where Sadi waited for him. Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d climb out a window if he had to. One way or another, he was going to find a Healer and drag her back here. And no one, not even the Sadist, was going to stop him.</p><p>After probing the corridor to be sure it was empty, Jared slipped out of the room and Red-locked the door.</p><p>He\u2019d taken one step when a phantom hand clamped around his throat and slammed him against the wall next to the door. Strong, slender fingers squeezed, cutting off his air. Long nails pricked his skin.</p><p>Jared tried using Craft to pry that crushing hand away from his throat, but it just absorbed the strength of the Red and squeezed harder. Knowing it was useless, he raised his hands as if he could physically pull the hand away. His own nails scratched his neck as his efforts became more desperate, but there was nothing to fight, nothing to grab. He could do nothing, while it could kill him.</p><p>Finally, too breathless to fight, he dropped his hands to his sides and leaned against the wall.</p><p>A sight shield slowly faded.</p><p>Daemon leaned against the opposite wall, his hands in his trouser pockets, his golden eyes still sleepy.</p><p>\u201cGive me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t tear your throat out,\u201d Daemon said too quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no reason to,\u201d Jared gasped. \u201cIsn\u2019t that reason enough?\u201d</p><p>Daemon made a sound that might have been laughter. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t play games with anyone from such a perverted race as Hayll, little Warlord. You say I have no reason. I say I do. Where do you think that leaves you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, it hurt to swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Jared?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>Working to breathe, Jared studied Daemon. The man looked as if he was just making small talk with an acquaintance instead of choking someone to death. Then again, unlike his half brother, who was known to be a walking explosion, Daemon seldom gave any indication of his mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Daemon repeated.</p><p>This time Jared heard the snarl of temper under the calmly spoken words.</p><p>Struggling to sound calm despite the phantom fingers pressing into his neck, Jared replied, \u201cThe witch who owns me is ill. I was ordered to find a place where she can rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t find a closer Blood community between where you were and here?\u201d Daemon shook his head. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t dare blink let alone breathe. How did Daemon know where they\u2019d been?</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Daemon cut him off. \u201cWhen the Gray Lady left Raej, you were with her. Why aren\u2019t you still with her, Jared?\u201d</p><p>Jared swallowed carefully and wondered how to answer. If he could trust Daemon, there was no one better to help him. If he couldn\u2019t . . . \u201cOwnership changed hands a few days after we left.\u201d That was true in a way. Once Lia\u2019s illusion web had broken, the Gray Lady was no longer part of their little group. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>Jared tried to shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s probably back in Dena Nehele by now.\u201d</p><p>The phantom hand pulled him away from the wall and slammed him back into it.</p> <p>Something malevolent flickered in Daemon\u2019s eyes. \u201cDorothea\u2019s Master of the Guard is hunting for the Gray Lady. Every band of marauders who preys in this part of the Realm has been sniffing around for a particular quarry. Does that sound like Grizelle\u2019s safely returned to Dena Nehele?\u201d Daemon sighed and looked at the ceiling. \u201cThis is becoming tedious, so I\u2019ll make it easy for you. You have three chances to give me a believable answer. After that, I\u2019ll take the information I want. But I\u2019ll make sure I leave enough of your mind intact so that you\u2019re able to fully understand what I\u2019m doing when I tear your little witch apart.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Jared?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Jared felt too stunned to even try to answer. Even the agony of the Ring of Obedience was a mild threat compared to this. He\u2019d have no chance against Daemon. His inner barriers would be forced open, his thoughts, feelings, memories picked over like tawdry goods at a market stall. At best, it would be a mental rape. At worst, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily be broken, but he could still be savaged so badly he\u2019d never fully recover.</p><p>And what would happen to Lia? Daemon made no secret of his revulsion for the distaff gender.</p><p>Jared licked his dry lips. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Daemon.\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled, a sweetly murderous smile. \u201cPuppy, when you wailed for help, and I answered, you made it my business.\u201d</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that sooner?</p><p>\u201cAlthough,\u201d Daemon added, \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected you to show up shielding some battered slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a slut,\u201d Jared said hotly, pushing away from the wall.</p><p>The phantom hand slammed him back again, hard enough to make him wonder if he\u2019d have cracked ribs as well as a crushed throat.</p><p>Daemon said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jared said through gritted teeth. \u201cThe witch who owns me ordered me to bring her\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The phantom nails stabbed him, breaking the skin. Blood trickled down his neck.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Daemon snarled quietly.</p><p>Jared shivered as he watched the gold eyes glaze with cold fury. He bit his tongue to keep from whimpering.</p><p>\u201cShe owns me,\u201d he said weakly as the fingers tightened a bit more.</p><p>Contempt joined the fury in Daemon\u2019s eyes. He looked pointedly at Jared\u2019s groin. \u201cYou wear no Ring, Warlord. And you\u2019re down to your last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do wear a Ring,\u201d Jared said, gasping for breath. \u201cI wear the Invisible Ring.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, the phantom hand eased its vicious grip.</p><p>Daemon studied Jared. Then one finely shaped black eyebrow rose, and he asked mildly, \u201cWhich one? The Silver or the Gold?\u201d</p> <p>Which one? Jared thought desperately.Which one ? How in the name of Hell was he supposed to know which one?</p><p>It wasinvisible ! \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>A loud thump came from his room.</p><p>Jared turned toward the door without thinking. Releasing the Red lock, he rushed inside.</p><p>Lia was crawling toward the door, her eyes glazed and unseeing. Her right arm was curled, as if she were still dragging Tomas\u2019s body away from the viper rats\u2019 nest.</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d Jared murmured, hurrying to reach her.</p><p>As he crouched in front of her, he heard the door quietly close. Heard the snick of a lock.</p><p>He slowly straightened and turned.</p><p>Daemon leaned against the closed door, his hands still tucked in his trouser pockets. In silence, he watched Lia\u2019s efforts.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Daemon asked quietly. ?</p><p>Jared took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cLady Arabella Ardelia. The Gray Lady\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Daemon didn\u2019t move, but Jared sensed a change. Not exactly surprise, but a swift reassessment.</p><p>\u201cViper rats?\u201d Daemon said, his eyes narrowing as he studied Lia.</p><p>Jared nodded. He had no chance against the Sadist, but he\u2019d make Daemon go through him in order to get to Lia.</p><p>Daemon shrugged out of his tailored black jacket, tossed it on a chair, and began rolling up the sleeves of his white-silk shirt. \u201cGet her on the bed. We\u2019ll finish this discussion later.\u201d He stepped through the bathroom door.</p><p>Daemon returned before Jared had a chance to settle Lia.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Daemon said. He unfolded two sheets, then refolded them to make a pad. Placing them on the left side of the double bed, he smoothed the sheets.</p><p>What kind of spells was Daemon putting on the sheets? Jared wondered, holding Lia a little tighter to his chest.</p><p>Satisfied, Daemon said, \u201cPut her on those. It\u2019ll be easier than stripping the bed later and disturbing her.\u201d</p><p>Jared did as he was told. He bit back a snarl when Daemon knelt on the bed beside Lia. \u201cIs there a Healer in the village?\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s hands glided over Lia\u2019s head, slid down her swollen neck. \u201cEven if there is, I doubt she\u2019d be much help. You need someone who has some skill in healing Craft and a knowledge of poisons.\u201d His hands glided over her shoulders, over her breasts.</p><p>Thera had said the same thing, Jared reminded himself as he watched Daemon\u2019s hands move over Lia\u2019s body. There was nothing personal or sexual about the way Daemon explored her, but Jared couldn\u2019t push aside the memory of watching those hands with their long, black-tinted nails roam over other female bodies for a very different purpose.</p><p>Especially when those strong, slender fingers drifted through the triangle of hair between Lia\u2019s legs and curved to cup her.</p><p>Jared snarled at the intimacy.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to behave in a sickroom, get out,\u201d Daemon said mildly, giving Jared one piercing look before he turned his attention back to Lia.</p><p>Stung, Jared clenched his teeth. Of course he knew how to behave in a sickroom. His mother was a Healer. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath to steady himself.</p><p>The first rule of a sickroom was that no anger, no fear, no violent emotions were permitted because they could be absorbed into a healing, neutralizing or even destroying a Healer\u2019s efforts.</p><p>He opened his eyes when Daemon sat back.</p><p>\u201cIf someone hadn\u2019t taught her how to contain an injected poison, she\u2019d be dead by now,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cHer mother is a Black Widow.\u201d The bites looked bigger, darker. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone . . .\u201d Jared\u2019s voice faded.</p><p>Daemon got off the bed. He called in two leather carrying boxes, opened them, and started looking through the various jars. \u201cI know enough healing Craft.\u201d Amusement and something else Jared couldn\u2019t identify flickered in Daemon\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd poisons are an interest of mine. Those bites have to be opened and the venom drawn out. If you don\u2019t have a strong stomach, you\u2019ve got five minutes to acquire one.\u201d</p><p>Jared swallowed hard. Frowning, he gingerly touched his throat.</p><p>Daemon gave him a knowing look before calling in a mortar and pestle. \u201cThere\u2019s no physical damage. Well, not much. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually have to crush your throat to convince you to be reasonable. There are many kinds of illusions. Jared.\u201d</p><p>Jared winced when his fingers brushed against one of the cuts made by the phantom nails. \u201cBut you would have.\u201d</p><p>Daemon poured a jar of dried herbs into the mortar. \u201cIf you\u2019d done something to harm the Gray Lady, yes, I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so interested in the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s golden eyes turned to hard, yellow stones. \u201cBecause she stands against Dorothea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do,\u201d Daemon said wearily, wiping his hands on a soiled towel.</p><p>Jared braced his forearms on the bed, too tired to sit up straight.</p><p>They had done all they could, but had they done enough?</p><p>They\u2019d worked for hours, applying herb poultices to draw the venom, draining the pus and fluid that Daemon had explained were the result of the healing Craft Lia had used. They\u2019d gone through the cycle three times. In between those cycles, Daemon stroked Lia\u2019s body, soothing her while she burned with fever. Sure that Reyna had never used her hands quite that way, Jared had clenched his teeth and leashed his emotions while he assisted by doing all the mundane tasks required.</p><p>At the end of it, though, the swelling had gone down and the ugly, malignant look of the bites had faded to the color of pale bruises. Lia was breathing easily and no longer feverish.</p><p>Jared smoothed the already smooth covers and stood up. He swayed from fatigue.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Daemon said, calling in a long dressing robe. \u201cGet cleaned up. I\u2019ll see about getting something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the robe. Maybe a hot bath would ease his aching muscles enough to convince his body to keep going. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing tired is no excuse for being an idiot.\u201d Daemon finished putting the empty jars back into the leather carrying cases. He vanished them, along with the mortar and pestle. \u201cIf you expect to be of any use to her tomorrow when she needs you, you\u2019ll eat and get some rest tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t argue. What was the point of arguing with someone who was right?</p><p>Nodding agreement, he stumbled into the bathroom. It was a bit primitive, but it had running water and indoor plumbing. He fit the plug into the bottom of the bathtub, turned the single faucet, and stifled a yelp when cold water gushed out.</p><p>He sank to his knees and stared at the rising water, wondering how he was going to convince himself to get into that tub of cold water.</p><p>He scrubbed his hands over his face, trying to clear away enough of the fatigue to think. If the innkeeper wasn\u2019t supplying hot water, that meant the guests were expected to make their own.</p><p>Jared lowered his hands. Of course. This wasn\u2019t an aristo inn where servants would be responsible for the warming spells that would keep tanks of water hot for the guests. He\u2019d have to use Craft to heat the water. A small thing, really. Certainly nothing a Red-Jeweled Warlord would have to think twice about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took several tries before he got the water to the temperature he wanted, too mentally and physically drained to get even the simplest spell right the first time.</p><p>Finally, he got in the tub and let the hot water soak away the sweat and grime, the ache in his muscles, and the tension that had ridden him hard since he\u2019d seen the brass button among the boulders.</p><p>By the time he returned to the bedroom, a square wooden table and two straight-backed chairs were positioned in front of the fire. The table held two steaming bowls of beef stew, a small loaf of bread, a dish of butter, cheese, fruit, a bottle of wine, and two glasses.</p> <p>Daemon sat comfortably in one of the chairs, smoking one of his black cigarettes. \u201cYou\u2019re almost recognizable now,\u201d he said as he flicked the cigarette into the fire. \u201cCome and eat.\u201d</p><p>Jared went to the bed first to check on Lia. He noticed a cup on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cA healing brew,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cShe woke?\u201d Jared leashed the emotion that bubbled up before he had a chance to identify it. Before he had to acknowledge it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I brought her up out of the healing sleep enough for her to drink, but she wasn\u2019t aware of anything.\u201d</p> <p>So she didn\u2019t know he hadn\u2019t been in the room. Didn\u2019t know it had been Daemon who had held her and coaxed her to drink.</p><p>Feeling his body relax, Jared joined Daemon at the table.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Daemon said, picking up his spoon.</p><p>They concentrated on their food for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right?\u201d Jared asked, carefully buttering a thick slice of bread.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know by morning.\u201d</p> <p>Jared forced a mouthful of bread past the lump in his throat. Right now, he couldn\u2019t bear kindness or understanding from Daemon. \u201cCould you tell anything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>One of Daemon\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cDo you have something specific in mind?\u201d He sounded amused. \u201cCould I tell she\u2019s still a virgin? Considering how many centuries I\u2019ve been playing bedroom games, it\u2019s a little insulting if you think a detail like that would slip past me. Or did you mean, could I tell that she\u2019s recently injured her knee and hasn\u2019t stayed off it enough to let it fully heal? Or that she hasn\u2019t made the Offering to the Darkness yet? Is that what you meant?\u201d</p><p>Jared dropped his spoon. His body went ice cold. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t made the Offering to the Darkness yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jared raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Daemon said patiently, \u201cyou wear the Opal and the Red. I can sense both levels of strength in you. I only sense one level in her\u2014the Green\u2014and the . . . potential . . . for a much darker strength. If nothing interferes when she makes the Offering, my guess is she\u2019ll wear the Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can tell beforehand what Jewels a person will wear after the Offering,\u201d Jared protested.</p><p>Daemon mopped up the last of his stew with a piece of bread. \u201cShe carried off the masquerade of being Grizelle so successfully, no one had doubted they were seeing a Gray-Jeweled Queen.\u201d Mild irritation flickered across his face and was gone.</p> <p>\u201cShe had good illusion spells,\u201d Jared argued.</p><p>\u201cAn illusion spell wouldn\u2019t have hidden the truth from someone who wears a Jewel darker than the Gray.\u201d</p><p>There was something in Daemon\u2019s voice that told Jared that was as far as he would go toward acknowledging the rumors that he wore the. rare Black Jewel.</p><p>\u201cWhich means,\u201d Daemon continued, \u201cthat there must be something inher that resonates with the Gray in order to complete that illusion. That\u2019s why I think Lady Arabella Ardelia is a Gray-Jeweled Queen who hasn\u2019t taken the final step necessary to actually wear the Gray Jewels.\u201d He paused, gave Jared a considering look. \u201cBut you had sensed the illusion before she revealed the truth. How?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Jared ate a spoonful of stew. It was a guess that hit the target. Since he didn\u2019t want to admit it was his body not his brain that had picked up the signals, which he then dismissed as being wrong, he mumbled, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of the Invisible Ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I imagine it is,\u201d Daemon replied dryly. Before Jared could say anything, he added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me how you ended up here.\u201d</p><p>So Jared told Daemon everything that had happened since he left Raej. Well, almost everything. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to mention the Fire Dance and the rut. But he told Daemon what he knew about the others. He told him about Thera\u2019s tangled webs. He told him about Blaed\u2019s romantic interest in the young Black Widow. He told him about the brass buttons and Garth . . . and about the fight that had ended with a half-Blood boy dead and Lia desperately ill.</p><p>Using Craft and his thumbnail, Daemon delicately pealed an apple. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she buy passage on another Coach and head for the Tamanara Mountains as fast as possible?\u201d</p><p>A bite of cheese stuck in Jared\u2019s throat. He took a large swallow of wine to force it down. \u201cAfter she sensed the wrongness, she didn\u2019t know whom she could trust, and she wasn\u2019t willing to bring an unknown enemy into Dena Nehele. Traveling cross-country was the only way she could bring everyone with her and give herself the time to find Dorothea\u2019s pet.\u201d He struggled to take a deep breath. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t have enough marks to buy a second passage for all of us because she bought me.\u201d</p><p>Daemon stared at Jared. Then he swore softly, viciously.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYouput the compulsion spell on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so crude,\u201d Daemon snapped. He drained his wineglass, filled it, and drained it again. \u201cI didn\u2019t force her to buy you, Jared. I nudged her toward that part of the auction grounds, and that\u2019s all I did. I knew if she was the Queen she seemed to be, she wouldn\u2019t let a Red-Jeweled Warlord like you be destroyed in the salt mines of Pruul. Not if there was a chance of winning your loyalty.\u201d He swore again. \u201cIt never occurred to me that she might not have brought enough marks with her.\u201d</p><p>Jared cut two more slabs out of the half wheel of cheese and offered one to Daemon. \u201cApparently, everything was more expensive than the Gray Lady\u2019s court had anticipated, from the guard escorts to the slaves. There\u2019s no way you could have known that. There\u2019s no way you could have known she\u2019d spend more than she could afford in order to get one more person out of Raej.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Daemon agreed. \u201cBut, Hell\u2019s fire, if I\u2019d suspected she was cutting it that tight, I\u2019d have slipped her enough marks to cover the extra expenses when I had that note delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Jared\u2019s voice cracked. He hastily swallowed some wine. \u201cYousent that note? But you were in Raej. How could you know?\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled indulgently. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that, after the attack on the Gray Lady last spring, I wondered what might be waiting for her at the Coach stations she\u2019d be most likely to head for and made arrangements to be informed. Unfortunately, my source arrived too late to help the men who walked into that trap. But she sent the warning\u2014and I\u2019d guess there were fewer males who saw the sun rise than saw it set.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Jared pushed his plate to one side and nodded. He toyed with the silverware and watched Daemon smoke another cigarette while they waited. \u201cYou said \u2018she.\u2019 \u201d Jared\u2019s hand curled into a fist. \u201cKnowing it might be dangerous, you still sent a witch to check out a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have been hurt. How could you be so careless, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel?\u201d Daemon said too softly. His face changed subtly when Jared didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Jared recognized that cold mask. He winced when Daemon\u2019s deep voice lost every hint of color. That bored tone could cut someone as mercilessly as a sharp knife.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of Surreal?\u201d Daemon asked, lighting another black cigarette.</p><p>Jared swallowed. Oh, yes, he\u2019d heard about the most expensive whore in the entire Realm of Terreille. When he was seventeen and trying to gather up enough nerve to ask Reyna\u2019s permission to visit a Red Moon house, he\u2019d spent several sweaty nights fantasizing that Surreal would come to Ranon\u2019s Wood for some reason and find him interesting enough to waive her usual fee.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a whore,\u201d Jared said tightly. Had Daemon ever . . . ? \u201cWhat was she supposed to do? Distract an entire troop of guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she could have if she wanted to,\u201d Daemon said with such dismissive casualness it made Jared clench his teeth.</p><p>A chime sounded. A moment later a tray floated beside the table. The dirty dishes vanished. Daemon transferred the pot of coffee, mugs, cream, and sugar to the table and vanished the tray. He poured the coffee, making a small sound of approval after his first sip.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Daemon continued as Jared spooned sugar into the other mug, \u201cshe\u2019s also a first-rate assassin. So gracefully vicious when she\u2019s holding a knife.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cPuppy, do you have any idea how much sugar you\u2019ve just dumped into your coffee?\u201d</p><p>Because his mind had stuttered on the word \u201cassassin\u201d and he really didn\u2019t know, Jared poured the heaping spoonful of sugar back into the sugar bowl. He stirred carefully, trying not to disturb the half inch of sugary sludge at the bottom of the mug. He raised the mug to his lips and hesitated.</p><p>Daemon coughed politely. Several times.</p><p>Jared took a sip. Shuddered. Set the mug down.</p><p>Daemon\u2019s shoulders quivered. He pressed a fist against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood coffee,\u201d Jared murmured. Hell\u2019s fire, his teeth itched.</p><p>Daemon bolted for the bathroom.</p><p>Listening to the muffled laughter behind the closed door, Jared considered switching the mugs but decided he wasn\u2019t up for whatever Daemon\u2019s response might be after choking on the first mouthful.</p><p>Jared\u2019s mug vanished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daemon returned a couple of minutes later, placed the cleaned mug in front of Jared, sank into his chair, and grinned wickedly.</p><p>Jared fixed another mug of coffee. \u201cThis is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased.\u201d</p> <p>Jared almost gave in to the urge to give Daemon one hard kick. \u201cThey\u2019re rather opposing professions,\u201d he said, his thoughts circling back to the woman who, it was said, had exotic looks and enough bedroom skills to melt a man\u2019s bones.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Daemon sat up, gave Jared a sharp look, and then drank his coffee. \u201cEspecially when one profession is part of the tools used for the other.\u201d</p><p>Jared choked.</p><p>\u201cDid I just ruin a long-held fantasy?\u201d Daemon asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t killevery male she beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t matter if she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Thera would like her.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night, banish the thought. \u201cShe\u2019s not my Thera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlaed\u2019s Thera, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got the possessive turned around? Shouldn\u2019t you say Thera\u2019s Blaed?\u201d He thought about that for a second, then set his mug down with a thump.</p> <p>\u201cThera\u2019s blade.\u201d Looking too much like a cat that has one paw firmly on the mouse\u2019s tail, Daemon poured more coffee. \u201cWhich is something you shouldn\u2019t forget, Warlord.\u201d</p><p>The dinner that had tasted good a few minutes ago swam greasily in Jared\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Daemon made an exasperated sound. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re too tired to think straight, I\u2019d knock some sense into you. Listen, and listen well. Blaed\u2019s a good man and a good Warlord Prince. In a few years, when he matures, he\u2019ll be an even better one\u2014and a dangerous one. From what you\u2019ve said, Thera\u2019s a strong-willed young woman who\u2019s been on a battleground for far too long. A Green-Jeweled Black Widow with that kind of fire in her isn\u2019t the kind of witch Dorothea would allow to stay whole no matter what sort of games were being played. Because that kind of witch is a serious rival.\u201d</p><p>Jared sipped his coffee. \u201cThayne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because he protected some innocent, terrified animals that were caught in a battle? Because, no matter how he feels about them, he might have realized how much harder the rest of the journey would be without them, especially if any of you were injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\u201d And now, remembering Thayne\u2019s burned face, he wished hehad thought of it. He rubbed his eyes, fighting to stay awake. \u201cWho, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Daemon said gently. \u201cYou\u2019re too deep into the game, Jared. Your presence\u2014and Blaed\u2019s and Thera\u2019s\u2014combined with Lia\u2019s wonderfully erratic actions, tangled up what was probably supposed to be a quick kill. Besides, how can a bargain to kill the Gray Lady be fulfilled if she isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still need to know who the enemy is,\u201d Jared insisted.</p> <p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Daemon countered. \u201cDorothea SaDiablo\u2014 and her Master of the Guard. The rest doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d He stood up and stretched the muscles in his back. \u201cYou can stay here tomorrow. The owner and I have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cIf anyone puts together the Shalador Warlord who was in that fight and the one staying here . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will put it together. No one will remember seeing a Shalador Warlord walk into the tavern room\u2014at least, no one will remember until he\u2019s been away from this place for a day.\u201d</p><p>Even dulled by fatigue, Jared understood. Daemon had cast a spell around this place, a kind of psychic fog that hid one specific memory.</p><p>Daemon rolled down his sleeves, fastened the ruby cuff links, and shrugged into his black jacket. \u201c\u2018I have to return to the court. I\u2019ll be leaving before dawn. Stay in the room. Get some rest. The owner or his wife will make sure you have everything you need. I\u2019ve left a change of clothes for you. We\u2019re about the same size, so they should fit well enough. Something will be found for Lia tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Thank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>Daemon slipped his hands into his trouser pockets. \u201cGet some sleep. In the bed. A warm body next to her will be more comforting\u2014for both of you\u2014than a pile of blankets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she snarls about it, I\u2019ll blame you.\u201d If she was still alive to snarl.</p><p>Daemon smiled gently. \u201cFair enough.\u201d As he opened the door, he looked back at Jared. \u201cBy the way, you wear the Silver.\u201d</p><p>Jared wasn\u2019t sure how long he stared at the closed door. By the time he got his legs to move and got the door open, the hallway was empty. No point searching. He could spend the rest of the night turning this place inside out with Daemon, fully shielded, standing nearby the whole time, and he\u2019d never know.</p><p>After Red-locking the door. Jared pulled off the dressing robe and slipped cautiously into the bed. He felt Lia shivering despite the warming spells on the blankets. He settled beside her, tucked the covers around them, and slid his arm around her waist. Slowly her chilled skin warmed. She made a sleepy, contented sound.</p><p>Jared dimmed the candle-lights in the room. But sleep didn\u2019t come for a while.</p><p>Maybe being able to sense the Invisible Ring depended on whether a man wore a Jewel lighter or darker than the Gray since Grizelle had probably created it. He still couldn\u2019t sense it, but Daemon had been able to tell which kind he wore. And Daemon wouldn\u2019t lie to him. Not about something like that.</p><p>He wore the Invisible Ring. He wore the Silver.</p><p>Whatever that meant.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Krelis stared at the male organs neatly arranged on a thick pad of blood-soaked cloth. There were wounds on all of them, which meant the agony had begun long before the barber had used the knife.</p><p>His vision grayed. He swallowed hard against the sickness clogging his throat.</p><p>Gliding behind him, Dorothea brushed the back of his neck with the tip of a large, white feather, and purred, \u201cRecognize anyone?\u201d</p><p>Krelis squeezed his eyes shut. Sweet Darkness, he hoped thosethings had belonged to landens or slaves. Something expendable. Something that required no thoughts, no feelings.</p><p>\u201cI want you to choose five guards, men you value,\u201d Dorothea said. \u201cI understand one of your cousins recently became one of my guards.\u201d</p><p>Krelis took a few steps away from the table. \u201cYes, Priestess. A distant cousin from the distaff side of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be one of the five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a special assignment?\u201d Krelis asked. His cousin was only Sixth Circle. Being noticed so quickly would please the family.</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. You\u2019ll also include the young guard you\u2019ve been personally training as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Priestess.\u201d Krelis narrowed his eyes, trying to remember who was immediately available in the First Circle who could balance the two less-experienced men. \u201cWhat will be required of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery little.\u201d Dorothea brushed her chin with the white feather and smiled malevolently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been something of a disappointment, Lord Krelis. Difficulties with the Gray Lady were one thing. But having this little bitch elude you ...\u201d She shook her head. \u2018\u2019It troubles me. It makes me wonder if your loyalty is as strong as it should be. It makes me wonder if I made an error in my choice of Master of the Guard.\u201c</p><p>Krelis felt light-headed. \u201cPriestess . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided to give you a bit more incentive.\u201d As she moved toward him, Krelis wondered how he\u2019d ever mistaken that predatory walk for something enticing, inviting.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your predecessor, Lord Krelis?\u201d Dorothea purred. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bring those five men to me. And every day that little bitch runs free, one of those men will pay for your failure.\u201d Her eyes slid to the blood-soaked cloth. \u201cSince you\u2019re the one selecting them for this, the last four, at least, will understand who\u2019s responsible for their suffering. You may choose whether your cousin or your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is the last. I hope you find her before then, Krelis. I truly do.\u201d She waved the feather, tickling his lips. \u201cI expect them here within the hour. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Krelis wanted to lick his dry lips, but he was terrified his tongue might touch that feather. Since there was no chance of handing over the little bitch-Queen tomorrow, he knew how that feather would soon be used. \u201cI understand, Priestess,\u201d he choked. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>How could it have gone so wrong? Krelis wondered a couple of hours later as he leaned back in his chair, a half-full bottle of brandy cradled to his chest. He\u2019d anticipated so much, had taken such care.</p><p>How could it have gone so wrong?</p><p>With the bounty he\u2019d offered, every marauder band in that part of the Realm was hunting her, and they\u2019dstill found nothing but cold trails and the buttons his pet had left.</p><p>And his pet hadn\u2019t even left those lately.</p><p>His fault for believing the bastard hadn\u2019t had something vital snipped out of him when the Ring of Obedience had been placed around his cock. The fear of the pain changed most of them. They never again felt the arrogant assurance that honor and Protocol would protect them. Warlord Princes became savage over time. Warlords shriveled up inside.</p><p>But his pet hadn\u2019t been a slave that long, only long enough to feel desperate, and bitter enough about the betrayal that had sent him into slavery that the offer of service without a Ring sounded sweet enough to rape honor and justify betrayal. He\u2019d been intelligent enough to realize the quality of his life would rest on Hayll\u2019s whims, and doing such an extensive favor for the High Priestess would almost guarantee that he\u2019d never feel the pain of the lash or the agony of the Ring again.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Krelis laughed bitterly. The bastard had believed that by killing the one Queen who had successfully stood against Dorothea over these past decades, he\u2019d earn a promise of safety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except there was no promise. And there was no safety. Krelis had finally understood that when he watched five pairs of eyes fill with terror when he left them in that barren room.</p><p>He\u2019d always been ambitious. He\u2019d thought it was because he wanted the kind of power that could only be attained by serving in the First Circle of a strong court. Now he knew it was because he\u2019d wanted to be safe. And hewas safe. Safe from the minor Queens who didn\u2019t believe a strong male could be trusted at all unless he was Ringed. Safe from the petty abuse inflicted on males by any witch who wore a darker Jewel. Safe from torments designed to soothe a bitch\u2019s ego.</p><p>Safe from everything except Dorothea.</p> <p>Which meant he wasn\u2019t safe at all.</p><p>But she was all he had now. He\u2019d realized that, too, when he\u2019d seen how carefully the guards who were posted outside that barren room had shuttered their expressions, closing him out. He\u2019d betrayed the unspoken understanding that the Master would protect his men from the whims of the witches in the court. They would obey him to escape punishment, but they would never respect him.</p><p>With one order, Dorothea had isolated him from everyone but her First Circle\u2014and he\u2019d even be isolated from them if he didn\u2019t succeed brilliantly enough to erase his failure up to this point. If his cousin was subjected to that gruesome maiming, his family would tolerate his presence when he joined them but would never welcome him. His dream of a pretty, placid, broodmare wife would wither and die with his unborn children. He\u2019d be left mounting the whores who worked in the Red Moon houses.</p><p>Krelis raised the bottle of brandy to his lips and kept swallowing until he needed to breathe.</p><p>He\u2019d find the little bitch before his cousin felt Dorothea\u2019s knife.</p> <p>And his pet would learn the price of failure.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cWould you like to play chess?\u201d Jared asked as he set up the game board the innkeeper had provided and tried\u2014hard\u2014not to throw a fine fit of male hysterics. That\u2019s what Lia had called his reaction when her legs had buckled while she\u2019d been pacing the room earlier in the day. Working the stiffness out of them, she\u2019d said. Scaring the shit out ofhim , he\u2019d shouted.</p><p>Then his wobbly-legged little Queen had threatened to dump the hot soup that had been part of the midday meal into his lap if he didn\u2019t stop pestering her to take a nap.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pester. He never pestered. He wasconcerned . Couldn\u2019t she tell the difference?</p><p>\u201cOne game,\u201d Jared coaxed, grinding his teeth so he wouldn\u2019t yell at her to sit down. \u201cJust to pass the time.\u201d</p> <p>Looking much too fragile and very young in the too-large sweater and snug trousers that had belonged to one of the innkeeper\u2019s sons, Lia crossed her arms and gave Jared a stony stare that would have made him nervous if it hadn\u2019t been accompanied by a hint of a pout. \u201cYou snarled the last time we played.\u201d</p><p>Jared placed one hand over his heart. \u201cI promise not to snarl.\u201d About the game, anyway. \u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t want to play, we could just turn in for the night.\u201d</p><p>She snarled at him.</p><p>\u201cShe who snarls shouldn\u2019t comment on someone else\u2019s little grumbles,\u201d Jared said virtuously.</p><p>Her hands balled into fists.</p><p>Jared watched her, fighting against the desire to provoke her a little more. In her weakened condition, if she threw a punch at him, she\u2019d probably end up on the floor and would be even madder when he had to help her up.</p><p>After he\u2019d finished setting up his red pieces to his satisfaction, Jared reached for the black pieces.</p><p>\u201cMine!\u201d Lia said, sitting down too abruptly for the movement to have been completely intended.</p> <p>While she set up her pieces, Jared poured a glass of fruit juice for her and a glass of wine for himself.</p><p>He\u2019d wrapped himself around her last night, more out of a need to feel each reassuring breath she took than any belief that his presence would help her. This morning, he\u2019d been rudely awakened when her elbow jabbed his belly and she started swearing to do vile things to his most valued body parts if he didn\u2019t let go. When his still-sleepy brain had finally understood the reason for the desperation that laced her curses, he\u2019d made her madder by carrying her into the bathroom.</p><p>He\u2019d chuckled at her muttering when he tucked her back into bed and climbed in with her, so pleased to have her alive and well enough to be angry that he never gave a thought to how she might react to having a naked male beside her. He\u2019d cuddled her for an hour.</p><p>And he\u2019d held her and cried with her when she asked about Tomas.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to spoon-feed her at breakfast.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to give her a bath.</p><p>He\u2019d mentioned taking a nap every hour or so, politely pointing out that she\u2019d been very ill the night before and needed a lot of rest.</p><p>So maybe he\u2019d fussed a bit too much, but he was entitled to fuss. She\u2019d scared him. She\u2019d more than scared him.</p><p>But he hadnot pestered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re muttering already,\u201d Lia grumbled, watching him through narrowed eyes. She tossed her hair over her shoulders and picked up the glass of fruit juice.</p><p>Her hair was like a soft, dark cloud, Jared thought, sipping his wine. She\u2019d let him brush it after her bath\u2014had to let him brush it because, after a few strokes, her arms had felt too heavy to lift. Daemon had drawn most of the venom out of her, but her body still felt the deep fatigue of fighting to survive on top of the demands she\u2019d made of it during the ambush. While he\u2019d brushed her hair, he\u2019d woven a soothing spell around her that Daemon had taught him during the year they\u2019d been in the same court. It had put her to sleep for a couple of hours.</p><p>Remembering that, he grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lia said. \u201cDid you put something in the fruit juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jared huffed. \u201cRoll the dice. Let\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>She rolled a five for a Summer-sky Queen. He rolled a three for a Tiger Eye. Giving her a sassy grin, he opened by moving one of his Black Widows.</p><p>Several moves later, he began to worry about the change in her game. Her Queen remained in the background while her stronger pieces\u2014especially the Black Widows and Warlord Princes\u2014were doing most of the defending, supporting the weaker pieces who only captured one of his when there was no possibility of an exchange. Again and again, she retreated, giving up more ground and growing more timid each time he captured one of her pieces.</p><p>And all the while, her Queen did nothing.</p><p>Her brash courage might have enraged him when the instincts bred into Blood males howled to defend the female, but seeing her act timid and uncertain produced a deeper anger\u2014and a deeper kind of fear.</p><p>Losing Tomas had produced an emotional wound that would heal in time, but she\u2019d carry the scar of it the rest of her life. And there would be more scars. Dena Nehele\u2019s continued freedom would be paid for in blood.</p><p>Her mind knew it, but her heart couldn\u2019t accept it yet.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t allow her the luxury of thinking retreat would keep her people safe.</p><p>He moved one of his Warlords to threaten a Blood male pawn. If she moved her Queen to challenge, he\u2019d let the pawn go. If she didn\u2019t . . .</p><p>It felt like half the night had passed before she hesitantly moved her Queen. Her hand trembled a little, and her face lost the little color she\u2019d gained throughout the day.</p><p>Wanting to distract her and give himself time to choose a move that would seem a logical alternative to capturing the pawn, he said, \u201cDoes your grandmother really look that intimidating?\u201d</p><p>Lia had just taken a sip of juice when he asked the question. She clamped a hand over her mouth until she managed to swallow. \u201cGran?\u201d she finally gasped. Then she started laughing.</p><p>Jared moved a Priestess nearer to the protection of his Sanctuary.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lia huffed, sitting forward. \u201cNo fair moving a piece when I\u2019m too teary-eyed to see you do it.\u201d She frowned when she figured out his move.</p><p>Before she could comment, he gave her another nudge. \u201cIs she?\u201d</p><p>Lia caught her lower lip between her teeth. \u201cWell, thoseare the clothes she wears when she has to travel outside our borders. And shedoes look impressive when she wears her Queen clothes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen clothes?\u201d Jared interrupted. He held up a hand. \u201cMove first, then explain Queen clothes.\u201d</p><p>Lia scooted a Warlord Prince across the board.</p><p>Not sure if that was meant to do something besides move a piece, Jared studied the board for a minute but didn\u2019t make a move.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Gran calls the fancy gowns and things she wears once or twice a month to keep her First Circle happy,\u201d Lia said. \u201cShe says, if males really don\u2019t notice female fashions the way they swear they don\u2019t, then why do they start drooling like a dog with a large soup bone whenever women wear evening gowns?\u201d</p><p>Jared choked on his wine. \u201cWe don\u2019t drool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Oh. Well, that\u2019s good. One of my cousins had this big dog who drooled buckets and always wanted to put his head in your lap. She\u2014my cousin, that is\u2014wanted to train the dog to put his head into just the boys\u2019 laps so they\u2019d have to explain why the fronts of their trousers were wet, but she only got to the lap part and not the boy part before the adult males in the family found out about it and roared. So we all got drooled on.\u201d</p><p>Wondering if he\u2019d had a game plan when he started, Jared moved a Prince to support a Healer. \u201cIf she only wears Queen clothes once or twice a month, what does she wear the rest of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Lia moved her other Warlord Prince. \u201cWell, clothes like this.\u201d She pinched a bit of sweater between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cPapa says that if you enter a large room full of people and there\u2019s one woman there who looks like she should be out weeding the garden, she\u2019s probably the Queen. Prince Harland\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran\u2019s lover. He says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerwhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLover. He\u2019s also her Consort. Anyway, he says a Queen is a Queen no matter what she wears\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jared added under his breath, not quite able to picture the Gray Lady as part of an elderly couple having a tickle and tussle in a rumpled bed\u2014even if hehad been able to picture it quite clearly when he\u2019d imagined himself as the lover. But that was different. Somehow.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and that it\u2019s more important for her to be comfortable and happy than it is to have her measure up to someone else\u2019s idea of proper dress, and ifhe didn\u2019t have any complaints, Papa shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour papa should listen to an elder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHarland\u2019s not Papa\u2019s elder. They trained together.\u201d</p><p>Jared wheezed.</p><p>Lia leaned forward. \u201cAre you coming down with something?\u201d</p><p>A terminal case of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d Jared bit his tongue. There were some things a man did not ask a twenty-one-year-old virgin about her grandmother.</p> <p>Lia shook her head and tsked sadly. \u201cSomeone your age really should know about these things. Didn\u2019t your papa ever talk to you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talked to me at great length about a great many things. Including that.\u201d</p><p>Spiffing primly, Jared added, \u201cHe even demonstrated once.\u201d</p><p>Lia almost spilled the juice all over her lap.</p><p>\u201cNot likethat ,\u201d Jared growled. He made a circle with his left hand and brought it toward the pointing forefinger of his right. When his hands were half a hand apart, he noticed how huge Lia\u2019s eyes had gotten\u2014and quickly lowered his hands.</p><p>Lia gulped some juice. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the gist of it.\u201d And if he had to explain any more of it, he wouldn\u2019t be putting a warming spell on the bathwater. Which reminded him of why heshouldn\u2019t have to explain it. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mama ever talk to you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did,\u201d Lia huffed. Then she added, giving him a speculative look, \u201cBut she never said anything that looked quite like that.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was going to kill him. He just knew it. \u201cYour move,\u201d he said a bit desperately, wanting to distract her.</p><p>She looked at the game board. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMove anyway.\u201d</p><p>She moved a Blood male pawn.</p><p>He pounced on it with a Warlord.</p><p>Her pained gasp broke his heart.</p><p>He caught her as she stumbled away from the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms around her. \u201cLia, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d still be alive if it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Lia sobbed. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t bought him, he\u2019d still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jared said. He gently stroked her back.</p><p>\u201cHe would.\u201d She clutched his shirt and pressed her face against his shoulder. \u201cHe would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, sweetheart.\u201d Jared gave her a little shake. \u201cListen to me. You may have heard the women the Gray Lady brought out of Raej talk about being enslaved and the brutality they endured, but you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for the males. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard nothing,\u201d Jared said, sharpening his voice enough to prick her pride and make her raise her head and look at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard what they would admit to, what the scars on their bodies won\u2019t allow them to deny. But they aren\u2019t going to tell you about the other kinds of wounds or the deep scars you can\u2019t see.No man would tell a young Queen about the kinds of twisted games that are played in those courts. We\u2019re all scarred, Lia. We\u2019re stripped of our honor and our pride. We\u2019re punished when we act like Blood males and punished when we don\u2019t. Dorothea SaDiablo and the Queens who dance to her tune don\u2019t just rape a man\u2019s body, they rape his soul. They take what\u2019s good in a man and twist it out of all recognition.\u201d</p><p>Jared captured Lia\u2019s face between his hands. \u201cAs bad as it is for a Jeweled male, it\u2019s ten times worse for a Blood male whose inner barriers can be pried open by any Jeweled female who wants to toy with him. And half-Blood males, who have no barriers at all, don\u2019t have any kind of a chance. Unless they\u2019re sired by an aristo male, most of them never reach maturity. They\u2019re used until they start showing signs of becoming men, and then\u2014\u201d Jared stopped. Took a deep breath. \u201cTomas might have lived another year or two. But if you hadn\u2019t bought him, he never would have known kindness, never would have known what it was liked to serve a Lady who cared about him.\u201d</p><p>Fresh tears spilled down Lia\u2019s face. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t a slave,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>Jared wiped away the tears with his thumbs. \u201cHe served, Lady Ardelia. He was too bright not to understand the difference whether you actually said the words or not. He deserved more time. He deserved a better life. But he didn\u2019t die because of you, Lia. He died because of Dorothea\u2019s greedy ambition to devour the entire Realm of Terreille. If you want to avenge Tomas, continue to be the strong Queen you are. Don\u2019t let Hayll\u2019s shadow fall over Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Lia leaned against him, wrapping her arms around his waist.</p><p>Jared swayed back and forth, rocking her as he softly sang an old song that Reyna used to sing when he needed comforting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Lia murmured.</p><p>Jared sank the fingers of one hand into her hair. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a pleasing voice. Deep but smooth.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cMy father always said I got my mother\u2019s voice but an octave lower.\u201d His arms tightened around her. \u201cLia, we have to leave in the morning, and I\u2019ve been thinking . . .\u201d</p><p>Lia raised her head and studied his face. \u201cWhy does that sound like something I should worry about?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned at her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Lia agreed thoughtfully. \u201cYour being so bossy when you start fussing has nothing to do with your brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him.</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll go to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019re safely home, I\u2019ll go to Ranon\u2019s Wood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and bring the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>Lia shoved him hard enough to break his hold on her. She stumbled back a couple of steps before she regained her balance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn about this, Lia,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>Her gray eyes darkened. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to accuse anyone else of being stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Jared gritted his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the risks when I agreed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew nothing!\u201d Jared shouted. \u201cYou were supposed to meet an escort at a Coach station who would get you safely home.You , Lia. Despite what you may want to believe, those men weren\u2019t there to make sure the rest of us got to Dena Nehele. So get it into your stubborn little head that you\u2019re going home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Ration\u2019s Wood\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared spewed every obscenity he could think of.</p><p>\u201cThose people are my responsibility, Lord Jared.Mine .\u201d</p><p>Jared bared his teeth. \u201cMy Jewels are darker than yours, which makes me stronger. If I have to, I\u2019ll truss you up in enough psychic restraints it\u2019ll take your granny half a day to undo them all and dump you on your father\u2019s doorstep. He may have yielded about letting you go in the first place, but if his balls still work, he won\u2019t let you go again no matter what your grandmother says!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you say that about my father! What right do you have to make demands of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI serve you.\u201d</p><p>Lia shook her head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. The others, yes, until the journey ends. But not you.\u201d</p><p>It felt like a large fist had just punched him under the heart. Jared stared at her, trying to get his breath. \u201cI serve you,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI wear the Invisible Ring.\u201d The Silver Ring.</p><p>\u201cThere is no Ring!\u201d Lia raked her fingers through her hair. \u201cThere never was a Ring! It was only a bit of Craft my mother calls lightning and smoke to fool them so they wouldn\u2019t question my not using the Ring of Obedience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wear your Ring,\u201d Jared insisted.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, you feather-brained mule.There is no Ring . I made it up. AH of it. Whoever heard of an Invisible Ring?\u201d</p><p>Daemon Sadi.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t say that. He took the verbal blows, unwilling to consider why they hurt so much. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Lia took a couple of wobbly steps and made it to the chair before she fell down. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Jared. And you\u2019re a strong Warlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known that about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Queen,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cI knew. But as you just pointed out, your Jewels outrank mine, and there was a lot of hate in you that day. I couldn\u2019t leave you there, and I couldn\u2019t control you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have used the Ring of Obedience.\u201d</p><p>Lia paled. \u201cDo you\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cDo you think I could have used that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Either she couldn\u2019t think of a word obscene enough or couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it.</p><p>No, Jared thought as he carefully sat on the edge of the bed. She couldn\u2019t have used the Ring of Obedience.</p><p>\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t control you,\u201d Lia said. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t afford to fight you. I thought you\u2019d escape as soon as your body healed. Then you folded up inside yourself and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I kept thinking you\u2019d go. As soon as you realized there was nothing holding you, you\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>But somethinghad held him back.</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck as he stared at his feet. Had she really counted on him going at the beginning of the journey? Had she counted on one less male to feed? Or ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up. She watched him so carefully, as if she were trying to gauge the impact of her words.</p><p>\u201cI wear no Ring,\u201d Jared said, watching her with equal care as he remembered how well she could put on an act when she felt it was necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou wear no Ring,\u201d Lia agreed. She looked away.</p> <p>\u201cYou have no claim on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I walk out of this room, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet the others in Ranon\u2019s Wood and take them to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>When she looked at him again, he saw a Queen with shadows in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI took them out of Raej. I hold their lives in my hands because of that choice. So until we stand within the borders of Dena Nehele, they\u2019re my people, Lord Jared.\u201d</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t? Oh, no, she wasn\u2019t getting away with that.</p><p>Smiling, Jared walked up to her and held out his hands. \u201cTime for bed. We need a good night\u2019s sleep if we\u2019re heading for Ranon\u2019s Wood at first light.\u201d</p><p>She looked wary, but she slipped her hands into his.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said pleasantly as he helped her to her feet, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to remember how good a liar you are when your back\u2019s against the wall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lia said weakly.</p><p>He kept a firm grip on her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve spent this entire journey chasing my own tail because I couldn\u2019t sense the Ring in order to confirm that it existed. If you\u2019d told me a couple of days ago that you had made it all up, I would have believed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you believe me now?\u201d Lia wailed.</p><p>Jared gave her a sharp smile. \u201cBecause we had help last night. A Warlord Prince I know did the healing. Just before he left, he confirmed that I wear the Invisible Ring. The Silver Ring.\u201d</p><p>Lia tried to tug her hands free. \u201cWhy would you believehim ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no reason to lie. You, on the other hand, didn\u2019t mention it until I threatened to drag you back to Dena Nehele. If you were in my place, what would you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Slipping an arm around her waist, Jared led her to the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an idiot. It was just bad timing on your part.\u201d</p> <p>She muttered something that sounded nasty.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lady Grumpy. Put your nightgown on, and I\u2019ll tell you a bedtime story. Unless, of course, you\u2019re like me and prefer to sleep in nothing but your skin.\u201d</p><p>Her face had a lot of color now.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could sleep somewhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I ... I\u2019ll change in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d He waited until she was at the bathroom door. \u201cOh, Lia. Just in case you get any ideas about slipping out of here without me, you should know that I\u2019ve put a Red shield around the bathroom as well as this room and a Red lock on the door that leads to the adjoining bedroom.\u201d</p><p>The mutter that got cut off by the bathroom door closing wasdefinitely nasty.</p><p>Her brains were still as wobbly as her legs, Jared decided as he undressed. Why bother to tell him now, even if it was true? He\u2019d just go to Ranon\u2019s Wood, andshe was going to Ranon\u2019s Wood, may the Darkness protect the stubborn little idiot. She thought she could push him out of her life before he was ready to go? Well, she could think again.</p><p>And hewould go as soon as he got her safely to Dena Nehele. He\u2019d said nothing less than the truth when he\u2019d told her all male slaves carried scars. Nine years as a pleasure slave had carved some deep ones into his soul.</p><p>He had no future in Dena Nehele. Or maybe it was more honest to say that he wouldn\u2019t allow his heart to show him something that could never be more than a wistful dream.</p><p>Jared settled into bed and waited for Lia.</p><p>But he\u2019d keep her safe until then. Safe so that, someday, a man without scars on his soul would be able to love her the way she deserved to be loved.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Krelis pressed his palms against the desk to keep his hands from curling into fists.</p><p>Don\u2019t believe too quickly, he reminded himself as he stared at the Second Circle guard standing in front of him.Don\u2019t hope at all .</p><p>\u201cAre you sure the man wasn\u2019t selling you a lie for a few silver marks?\u201d Krelis finally asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard had no reason to lie, Lord Krelis,\u201d the guard replied with a feral smile. \u201cAnd I paid him nothing. Whenever I take leave time outside Hayll, I find it more ... lucrative . . . not to travel as a guard. These loose-tongued merchants and traders from other Territories are much more willing to complain and gossip with a fellow trader trying to make a little profit. They say things they wouldn\u2019t even dare think in the presence of a Hayllian court guard.\u201d</p><p>A clever man, Krelis thought as he leaned back in his chair. A dangerous man. A man who knew how to fashion lies to look like bright truths. A man who, one day soon, would find a way to speak to the High Priestess directly. And if he, Krelis, wasn\u2019t very careful, he\u2019d find himself condemned by compliments. \u201cThis loose-tongued merchant is sure he saw a Shalador Warlord at a traveler\u2019s inn?\u201d</p><p>The guard nodded. \u201cA Red-Jeweled Shalador Warlord who looked like he\u2019d been doing some hard traveling lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was alone?\u201d</p><p>The guard shrugged. \u201cThe bitch didn\u2019t walk through the front door with him. Maybe he slipped the leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she slipped in the back way.\u201d Krelis rubbed his chin. The bitch-Queen had been traveling north or northwest since his pet had left the first message. So what was that Shadalor bastard doing so far south? Where were the others? If the bitch really wasn\u2019t with him, if hehad slipped the leash, why wasn\u2019t he heading for his home Territory to hide for a few days?</p><p>Unless he was deliberately showing himself to lay a false trail. Or had the fool gone to that inn hoping to strike a bargain?</p><p>\u201cThis merchant. He was sure about the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>The guard shifted his feet. He pressed his lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to mistakethat one for any other.\u201d</p><p>A chill started in Krelis\u2019s lower back and crept up his spine. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire, he needed a drink! \u201cYour diligence to your duty is highly commendable, Warlord. You may be certain I\u2019ll keep it in mind. Inform Lord Maryk that his presence is required.\u201d Krelis gestured toward the door.</p><p>Accepting the dismissal, the guard bowed and left.</p><p>Krelis called in a bottle of brandy, but Maryk knocked on the door before he could consume enough of it to settle his nerves. Smothering a curse, he vanished the bottle, and snapped, \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>Maryk\u2019s bland expression was a subtle insult, but he hadn\u2019t been able to completely extinguish the contempt from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve received some information about the little bitch-Queen who\u2019s been such an annoyance to the High Priestess,\u201d Krelis said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look into it personally. Until I return, you\u2019re in charge. If the High Priestess summons, you\u2019ll have to answer her.\u201d</p><p>Maryk swallowed carefully. They both knew what could happen to males when Dorothea was annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Lord Krelis. Is there anything that will require special attention?\u201d</p><p>Krelis shook his head. \u201cYou have the assignment roster. I\u2019ve been informed of nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, may the Darkness grant you a safe and speedy journey.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Krelis thought, as Maryk escorted him to the landing place. The guards\u2014especially the First Circle guards\u2014 might despise him, but they\u2019d rather have him standing between them and the High Priestess of Hayll than nothing at all. And not one of them would envy him this journey.</p><p>Krelis didn\u2019t bother to knock before he opened the door of the small receiving room. Men didn\u2019t have to extend any kind of courtesy to pleasure slaves. Even this one. Besides, he\u2019d already used up his courtesy on the pouty Queen who ruled this forsaken Province. Hell\u2019s fire! What had the High Priestess been thinking of to loan the Sadist to a witch who\u2019d had half of her brains bred out of her?</p><p>Daemon Sadi stood with his back to the door, looking out a window.</p><p>Krelis closed the door hard enough to make anyone else jump. Daemon didn\u2019t even twitch.</p><p>\u201cSadi,\u201d Krelis said, coming into the room far enough to see the beautiful face in profile.</p><p>\u201cLord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>The boredom in that deep voice grated on Krelis\u2019s nerves. That Sadi didn\u2019t bother to look at him grated even more.</p><p>Krelis\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>If Sadi\u2019s voice and face were any gauge to measure by, he also didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cIt seems your Lady grants you a lot of liberties,\u201d Krelis said.</p><p>\u201cShe has a low threshold for pain.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing how to respond to that, Krelis said nothing for a minute. \u201cYou were seen at a traveler\u2019s inn a couple of days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met a Red-Jeweled Shalador Warlord named Jared there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you arrange to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have required effort. He\u2019s not that interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he rented a room, he wasn\u2019t seen again. You left the common room shortly after he arrived and weren\u2019t seen again either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears someone else was as bored as I was if keeping track of everyone else\u2019s movements was the best entertainment available.\u201d</p><p>Krelis clenched his teeth. \u201cYou met with him. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in the same court a few years ago. When he showed up at the inn, having dinner together seemed like a way to pass some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing interesting enough to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there a woman with him? A witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d gone to that hovel to get away from the stink of witches. I wouldn\u2019t have stayed in the room if one of them had been present.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Krelis took a deep breath and forgot what he was going to say. The air in the room felt soft, heavy. An elusive scent drifted past him, a scent that warmed the muscles in his groin at the same time it melted the tension from the rest of his body.</p><p>He took another deep breath. What had they been talking about? The Shalador Warlord. Now he remembered. \u201cYou talked all evening and remember nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked during dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he mention the Gray Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t quite that boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Krelis bit his lip. The pain cleared his head a little. \u201cI want to know what the two of you did that evening.\u201d</p><p>Daemon turned and looked at him. \u201cDo you?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>Krelis nodded slowly.</p> <p>Daemon smiled that cold, cruel smile.</p><p>Krelis shuddered and then gasped.</p><p>Long-nailed fingers whispered down his back, over his buttocks, down the backs of his thighs. They were still drifting over his calves when another pair of phantom hands brushed the back of his neck and began the journey.</p><p>\u201cHe bored me.\u201d Daemon took a couple of graceful, predatory steps toward Krelis. \u201cIt left me feeling mean, so I seduced him.\u201d</p><p>Another pair of phantom hands whispered over Krelis\u2019s chest and belly, separating just before they reached his groin to travel down the front of his legs.</p><p>\u201cHe was begging by the time I began to feel amused,\u201d Daemon crooned, taking another step toward Krelis.</p> <p>Krelis opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>The tip of a phantom tongue delicately licked his upper lip.</p><p>Another tongue licked the inside of his thigh, moving upward.</p><p>Warm breath washed over his balls, over his hard organ.</p><p>\u201cHe was sobbing by the time I left the room,\u201d Daemon crooned, coming just a little closer, but still not close enough to touch.</p><p>A phantom mouth brushed against Krelis\u2019s throat. Sucked gently.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to show you what I did to him?\u201d</p><p>Krelis couldn\u2019t think. Didn\u2019t want to think about anything but that beautiful face, about the moment when that real mouth would glide over his hot skin, when that real tongue would\u2014</p> <p>Daemon smiled. \u201cI thought not.\u201d</p><p>Everything stopped. Instantly.</p><p>Krelis swayed. His vision blurred. Every breath made his body throb. In that moment, he would have promised anything, done anything to make Daemon finish it.</p><p>Knowing that revolted him.</p><p>He bit his lip until it bled. By the time he could think again, Daemon was looking out the window as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Krelis wanted to lash out, wanted to threaten some kind of dire punishment that would make up for his body\u2019s screaming need for relief.</p><p>Daemon turned his head and smiled that cold, cruel smile.</p><p>Krelis staggered out of the room.</p><p>A few steps away from the door, he leaned against the wall while he waited to get some strength back in his quivering legs.</p><p>Now he understood why Queens and favored witches from aristo families paid Dorothea such exorbitant fees for the loan of Daemon Sadi. Now he understood why they were willing to endure his cruelty, why they were willing to risk his temper. To have that exquisite pleasure brought to completion . . .</p><p>Krelis pushed away from the wall, desperate to get away from this place. Maybe, with distance, he could deny the terrible feeling that, no matter how skilled the whore or how much relief he took between her thighs, he would never again experience the kind of pleasure he\u2019d felt with the Sadist.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Lia stopped abruptly at the edge of the official landing place outside Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>Jared grabbed her, drawing her back against him while he absorbed the significance of what he was seeing\u2014of what hewasn\u2019t seeing.</p><p>The section of the Coach station roof that had been torn away.</p><p>The broken windows.</p><p>The empty corral where the horses for hire would have been kept during the day.</p><p>The pieces of the stable door that were scattered around the yard.</p><p>The absence of people.</p><p>And the deeper feeling of emptiness.</p><p>\u201cThe land\u2019s been wounded,\u201d Lia said in a hushed, aching voice. \u201cOh, Jared, the land\u2019s been deeply wounded.\u201d</p><p>Hay fields that should have been thick with stubble from the harvest had small islands of yellow grass growing out of a sea of barren ground. Trees that had been landmarks for generations scarred the morning sky with their dead branches.</p><p>\u201cThe Blood fought here,\u201d Lia whispered. Her hand shook as she wiped a tear from her cheek.</p><p>Hearing her unspoken question, Jared chained his grief, leashed his growing fear. \u201cThis didn\u2019t happen because of our coming here. Look at the land, Lia. This happened during the growing season, not the harvest. When we got the supplies at the landen village, the old woman warned me that there was trouble in Shalador.\u201d He took her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Ranon\u2019s Wood is about a half a mile from here.\u201d</p><p>It would have been easy to probe the village, would have been easy to reach for the familiar minds of his family. He didn\u2019t do either.</p><p>The second time Lia stumbled because he\u2019d increased the pace beyond her ability to keep up, she planted her feet and refused to move.</p><p>\u201cYou go on, Jared. Find out what\u2019s happened to your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s nothing here that will harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>As they stared at each other, the words seemed to echo.</p><p>Jared swallowed. Tasted bitterness. Silently acknowledged the lie beneath the sincere words. As much as he didn\u2019t want to, hewould leave her\u2014as soon as he saw her safely home.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d</p><p>Jared whirled, putting Lia behind him. Hell\u2019s fire, where were his wits? No one should have gotten this close to them without his sensing it, especially someone cantering toward them on horseback.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Blaed!\u201d Lia said, stepping around Jared and waving.</p><p>Reining in a few yards away from them, Blaed slid off the roan mare\u2019s bare back and dropped the reins to ground-tie her. He spared one quick glance for Jared before focusing on Lia with a hunger that made Jared tense.</p><p>Not a sexual hunger, Jared realized as Blaed\u2019s eyes traveled over the body that was covered from neck to mid-thigh by the bulky sweater, but the hunger a strong Blood male feels when he\u2019s bonded to a Queen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re well?\u201d Blaed asked hesitantly.</p><p>Lia gave him a dazzling smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blaed pulled her into his arms. \u201cThera\u2019s been frantic about you.\u201d</p><p>*Thera\u2019s not the one hugging her hard enough to crack her ribs,* Jared said on a spear thread.</p><p>Blaed let go too fast.</p><p>Jared lunged to catch her. Blaed grabbed the front of the sweater.</p><p>A minute later, Lia was standing out of reach of both of them, eyeing them warily. \u201cWhoever said males were sensible obviously never met either of you,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Blaed grinned at Jared. \u201cSheis well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her too much,\u201d Jared said dryly. \u201cShe needs more rest than she thinks she does.\u201d</p><p>Lia straightened her sweater. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the village. I\u2019d like to talk to someone sensible. Someonefemale .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to talk to someone sensible,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Blaed coughed.</p><p>Lia looked at the sky and threw up her hands.</p><p>The gesture, so like Reyna\u2019s, stabbed Jared. As he turned away, he met Blaed\u2019s now-solemn hazel eyes.</p><p>Feeling the prickle between his shoulder blades, Jared chose each word as if it were a step he had to take on a trail filled with hidden traps. \u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast evening,\u201d Blaed said in a neutral voice. \u201cThayne\u2019s always been able to call animals to him. Enough of the marauders\u2019 horses survived, so we each had a mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s a good Healer. She\u2019ll take care of the witchfire burns for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father got you settled in all right? Did you talk to him about getting a Coach to the Tamanara Mountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared . . .\u201d Blaed\u2019s hand closed on Jared\u2019s arm.</p><p>Feeling the sympathy that flowed out of that touch, Jared jerked away, circling Blaed cautiously as he moved toward the roan mare.</p><p>\u201cGo home. Jared,\u201d Blaed said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll escort Lia.\u201d</p><p>Torn, again, between two needs, Jared froze.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Jared,\u201d Lia said.</p><p>Because it was the woman and not the Queen who said the words, he found himself galloping down the road to Ranon\u2019s Wood. His mind refused to see the images his eyes collected, and he was grateful. There would be time enough to deal with the destruction later.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to reach the lane that ended at the weathered, rambling house that had been in Reyna\u2019s family for generations. The Healer\u2019s House, passed on, not from mother to daughter, but from the old Healer to the strongest, or only, Healer in the next generation. Year after year, the land had been tended by and yielded its bounty to the women of that bloodline. Generation after generation, strong Blood males had sought out those women, settling for a long-term contract as a consort if they weren\u2019t able to win the coveted title of husband.</p><p>Jared tied the mare\u2019s reins to the hitching post near the path that led to the front door.</p><p>Every spring, all the women in the family gathered for a few days to help plant the gardens at the Healer\u2019s House. The males of all ages divided their time between helping with whatever repairs might be needed after the winter and watching indulgently while the women laughed and squabbled over the planting.</p><p>Jared opened the gate. It didn\u2019t hang true and got stuck. He went sideways through the narrow opening.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>No one had planted this year. He felt the absence of laughter as keenly as he felt the land\u2019s wounds. Flower beds that had dazzled him with color when he was young held a few wind-seeded flowers that looked spindly and faded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared took a hesitant step toward the house. Took another. He raised his voice. \u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>Another step.</p><p>He saw the smears of old blood around the front door.</p> <p>Hurrying now, he flung the door open. \u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>Sweating and freezing, he rapidly explored the downstairs rooms the family used. Then the healing rooms. Then the stillroom. Out the back door to the greenhouse. He didn\u2019t notice anything except that there was no one there.</p><p>\u201cMOTHER!\u201d</p><p>Inside again, he took the stairs two at a time, checking his brothers\u2019 rooms first.</p><p>Davin\u2019s room was bare of personal belongings. Janos\u2019s looked as if someone had hurriedly searched through it and had left the clothes and books where they\u2019d fallen.</p> <p>No one in the second-floor guest rooms.</p><p>No one in the third-floor rooms.</p><p>Back to the second floor.</p><p>His clothes no longer hung in the wardrobe, but his books still filled the low bookcase next to the writing desk that had stood in front of the window for as long as he could remember. The same quilt covered the bed that had once felt so huge and that he now knew would be a snug fit for two people.</p><p>One room left.</p><p>His hand shook as he opened the door to his parents\u2019 room.</p> <p>Pain and grief entwined with love hit him at the threshold.</p><p>He closed his eyes and clung to the doorframe, unable to step back, unable to go forward.</p><p>Walls remembered. Over time, wood and stone absorbed the feelings of those who lived in a place and could be sensed by anyone with power.</p><p>This was different. Stronger. As if ...</p><p>Jared opened his eyes and looked at the large double bed that Reyna had shared with Belarr\u2014the bed that a male child, no matter how young, didn\u2019t climb into without his father\u2019s permission.</p><p>At first, he thought Reyna had bought a new quilt for the bed, but he couldn\u2019t figure out why she, who loved bright things, would choose such a dull color.</p><p>Then he saw a patch of blues and greens at the bottom corner, and then he realized the quilt had been soaked with blood.</p><p>Jared staggered toward the bed, fighting the sickness that churned in his stomach.</p> <p>Blood sings to blood. That\u2019s why the feelings were so strong. They weren\u2019t in the wood and stone, they were in the blood.</p><p>His hand shook violently as he reached for the quilt.</p><p>The blood was old, but there was so much of it. All he had to do was open his inner barriers and touch it, and he\u2019d know.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d a gravelly voice said.</p><p>His hand hovered over the quilt. Another inch. Just another inch.</p><p>His hand wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>Jared spun around, his heart pounding wildly.</p><p>An old man stood in the doorway. Unkempt gray hair hung to his shoulders. Grief and pain had carved deep lines into his face. His left sleeve was pinned above where the elbow had been.</p><p>Jared stared at the old man. His eyes widened. \u201cUncle Yarek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Yarek,\u201d the old man agreed, smiling sadly. \u201cReyna said you\u2019d be coming home this autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo\u2014\u201d Jared\u2019s voice broke. In a rush, he crossed the room and hugged his uncle. Terrified of the fierce grief rising inside of him, he choked it back, chaining it down.</p><p>\u201cCome away, Jared,\u201d Yarek said softly as he stepped back into the hallway, drawing Jared with him. \u201cCome away from this room. It\u2019s too painful to look on. We\u2019ll go outside. We\u2019ll go out and sit in the garden, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Saying nothing, Jared followed Yarek to a stone bench at the far end of the garden. Near the bench was a small, covered well.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some water?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Grimacing a little, Yarek settled on the bench. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Jared lifted the cover and lowered the wooden bucket. When he looked around for the dipper, Yarek said, \u201cHere,\u201d and called in a mug.</p><p>Jared filled the mug and handed it to Yarek. \u201cWhenever my friends and I spent the afternoon playing in the woods, we\u2019d all end up here because this well had the sweetest water in Ranon\u2019s Wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d Yarek drained the mug and handed it back to Jared. \u201cNow it\u2019s as bitter as a woman\u2019s tears.\u201d</p><p>Jared hesitated, finally dipped the mug into the bucket and drank.</p><p>As bitter as a woman\u2019s tears. Or was it the land\u2019s tears he was tasting now? For the Blood, was there really any difference?</p><p>Because he was thirsty, he drank another mug of water before settling on the bench next to his uncle.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here, Uncle Yarek?\u201d</p><p>Yarek looked at the sparse garden and sighed. \u201cWar\u2019s what happened, Jared. War between the tribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve been united since the time of Shal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone had remembered Shal\u2019s warnings about the long-lived races, we might have stayed united and strong. But that slut who controls Hayll has a way about her. It\u2019s like finding a weed in the garden. You know it doesn\u2019t belong there, but it looks small and pretty so you let it stay, not realizing that, although it looks small and pretty above the ground, underneath it\u2019s sinking a tap root so deep you can never cut out all of it, and it sends out all these other runners that choke out everything but other weeds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened to Shalador. One by one, place by place, we lost our strong Queens, our good Queens. Some to age. Some to \u2018accidents.\u2019 One by one, until all that was left were the weeds.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed his forehead. \u201cAnd even a good man will eventually yield to a bad Queen if the hunger for the bond gnaws at him long enough and hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Yarek nodded. \u201cA strong love bond eases that hunger, too. A Blood male needs one or the other. I guess that\u2019s why the warriors who came to demand we yield to the new Queen did what they did.\u201d</p><p>Unable to look at Yarek, Jared focused on the cracked, barren ground in front of him. \u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>Yarek shuddered. \u201cThey slaughtered the witches. They butchered our hearts. They didn\u2019t give a call to battle and wait for the ones who chose to fight to come to the killing field. When every family in Wolfs Creek refused to yield and every male told them what they could do with their damned Rings of Obedience, the delegation left. Thirteen men. That\u2019s all we saw until the next day when hundreds of them surrounded the village and attacked. They weren\u2019t after the men. Our wounds and deaths happened because we were in the way. It was the witches those bastards wanted. Little girls, old women, Ladies in their prime, the darker-Jeweled girls on the verge of womanhood . . .</p><p>\u201cThey raped some of them, just like they raped the land. Left some alive, broken and mutilated. Some of the lighter-Jeweled young witches were captured and taken away. A few\u2014very few\u2014escaped the breaking and slaughtering, but they weren\u2019t old enough or strong enough for the males to bond to comfortably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone left at Wolf\u2019s Creek?\u201d\u2018 Jared asked, carefully circling around the questions that needed to be asked.</p><p>Yarek shook his head. \u201cOnly a couple of houses were left standing by the time it was done. They took most of the livestock, and we knew the land couldn\u2019t yield enough for us to eat even if we were able to tend it and could find a Queen to heal it\u2014and there was nothing to get us through from a new planting to the harvest.</p><p>\u201cBelarr arrived that evening with forty men . . . and Reyna. She did what she could to keep us alive. Then Belarr and the other men brought us to Ranon\u2019s Wood. There\u2019s always been strong family ties between Wolfs Creek and Ranon\u2019s Wood, so Reyna didn\u2019t have to look far to find hands to help her.\u201d Yarek cleared his throat. \u201cI told her to take the arm. It wasn\u2019t hanging on by much anyway, and I\u2019d managed to stop the bleeding before they arrived. I told her to put her strength into the young ones. She cried but, may the Darkness embrace a true daughter, she did what I asked.</p><p>\u201cA week later, the bastards came to Ranon\u2019s Wood. Belarr had set up a watch, so they didn\u2019t come in without warning, but they came, and it was Wolf\u2019s Creek all over again\u2014except they didn\u2019t even give Belarr or anyone else a chance to refuse to yield.</p><p>\u201cHe fought. Mother Night, how he fought! But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t trained as a guard,\u201d Jared said quietly. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t trained as a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was a strong man and a fine administrator and he\u2019d served his Queen and Ranon\u2019s Wood well, but he wasn\u2019t a trained warrior.\u201d</p><p>Belarr had had the strength of the Red, but hadn\u2019t had someone like Randolf to show him how to use that strength to kill, hadn\u2019t had a Warlord Prince like Blaed with him who would surrender to instinct and find the killing field within himself.</p><p>\u201cThey had to kill him, you see,\u201d Yarek continued in a low voice. \u201cThey had to. They couldn\u2019t let a Red-Jeweled Warlord live after they\u2019d torn his wife\u2019s body apart enough to make her scream but not enough to let her die quickly.\u201d</p><p>Jared made a choking sound.</p><p>Yarek didn\u2019t notice. \u201cThey paid dearly, Jared. The bastards paid for Reyna with their own blood. And they didn\u2019t really win in the end.</p><p>\u201cShe was in the village when the attack started. Janos died trying to reach her. And she went down fighting to protect a young girl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how Belarr reached her or where he found the strength to get her away from them. They were both dying by the time he got her home, and she . . . she kept trying to heal him. He asked me to leave them be, to look for Janos when the fighting was over. Then he carried her up to their room and lay down with her on the bed. Wasn\u2019t my place to be there, so I closed the door.\u201d</p><p>Yarek pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his nose. \u201cI left the house and hid in the woods. Sounds cowardly ...\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d already fought one battle. You weren\u2019t strong enough to fight another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have another reason,\u201d Yarek said slowly, tucking the handkerchief into his pocket. \u201cOn and off all through the winter, Reyna kept saying you were coming home this autumn. I didn\u2019t have much hope for Janos. I figured someone from the family should be here to meet you, and I was the only one left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe only one?\u201d Jared whispered. \u201cThose bastards killedall of them? All the aunts and uncles? All the cousins?\u201d He put his head between his knees and tried to breathe. \u2018\u201cAunt Janine?\u201d</p><p>Yarek rubbed Jared\u2019s back. \u201cMy Lady died at Wolfs Creek.\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cShira and Mariel? Mother Night, they didn\u2019t take Shira and Mariel, did they?\u201d He sat up too fast.</p> <p>Yarek pushed Jared\u2019s head back down. \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t get Shira and Mariel. My girls crossed the Tamanara Mountains last autumn, with Davin as their escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavin?\u201d Jared braced his hands on his knees and pushed himself upright. \u201cDavin as escort? But he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld enough,\u201d Yarek said firmly. He rubbed his chin. \u201cReyna was fretful last autumn. One day she showed up and talked to Janine. The next thing I knew, the girls were sent off with Davin and some travelers who were resting up in Ranon\u2019s Wood before heading west, hoping to serve that Queen on the other side of the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went to Dena Nehele.\u201d Jared sighed. \u201cThank the Darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something about the Gray Lady?\u201d Yarek asked sharply.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Queen worthy of the best a man can give. If she took Davin into her court, he\u2019ll do well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she may be the only Queen left whois worthy of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said softly, \u201cthere\u2019s one other.\u201d</p><p>Yarek gave his nephew a considering look. \u201cYou rode in alone. What happened to the witchling?\u201d</p><p>Jared blinked. \u201cThe witchling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one bitten by the viper rats. The one the little Black Widow\u2019s been fretting about so much.\u201d</p> <p>Jared blinked again. \u201cLittle Black Widow?\u201d He rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth. \u201cWhat did she say about Lia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbush. Viper rats. You taking off with the witchling to find help. The rest of them hightailing it here.\u201d Yarek shook his head and huffed. \u201cPoor thing was making herself sick with all the fretting, and that young Warlord Prince knew about as much as an ant can piss about soothing a witch who\u2019s got herself fretted. Now, me\u201d\u2014he waved his hand\u2014\u201cIknow something about soothing a fretting witch. Janine wasn\u2019t much of a fretter. All I had to do for her was keep some cheap clay pottery around that she could smash whenever she got really annoyed. That and a long, hot ride between the sheets usually eased her mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared said weakly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t settle things the same way with a daughter\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared choked.</p><p>\u201c\u2014so I had to learn other ways of soothing, didn\u2019t I? Wasn\u2019t Janine who got Shira to stop fretting when Tavi performed the Fire Dance and then turned down her invitation to be her lover, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Sweetheart,\u2019 I said, \u2018a young Warlord\u2019s got a right to choose his lover same as a young witch.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell was she doing invitinganyone to her bed?\u201d Jared shouted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d had her Virgin Night. She was free to try out a man if it pleased her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShira\u2019s not old enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twenty-five now,\u201d Yarek said, looking fierce.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t her lover escort her over the mountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t find one she wanted to keep. Damn shame, but there it is. I wanted Mariel to have her Virgin Night before she left\u2014have a Shalador male take care of it so I\u2019d know it was done right\u2014but there was too much upset at the time, and it would have been too risky with her emotions all stirred up like that.\u201d</p><p>Jared braced his head in his hands and moaned. He\u2019d been able to picture Janos and Davin grown\u2014up to a point\u2014but Shira and Mariel? Shira, with lovers. Mariel, ready for her Virgin Night and probably spending her evenings dreamily thinking about which consort she\u2019d like to request for that night.</p><p>Lia, who wasn\u2019t thinking about any of it.</p><p>He moaned again.</p><p>Yarek narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou acting so prudish about Shira and Mariel for a reason, or are you just trying to dodge my question about the witchling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witchling.\u201d Jared rammed his fingers through his hair. What would Lia say about being called a witchling? What wouldThera say about being called thelittle Black Widow? \u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>They both tensed when they heard a horse approaching at an easy pace, but they couldn\u2019t see the road from that part of the garden.</p><p>The roan mare whickered a greeting. Minutes later, Lia and Blaed came around the side of the house.</p><p>Jared ground his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the witchling?\u201d Yarek asked, jumping to his feet. He whistled silently. \u201cEven dressed like that, she\u2019s a lovely woman.\u201d</p><p>Pleased to feel his blood simmering and more than willing to let grief find its release through anger, Jared stood up more slowly. \u201cShe\u2019s also the Gray Lady\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Yarek gurgled a bit, but didn\u2019t have time to say anything before Lia and Blaed reached them.</p><p>\u201cWarlord,\u201d Lia said politely, smiling at Yarek. \u201cJared,\u201d she added cautiously.</p><p>Yarek bowed low, then grinned. \u201cLady. I hope my nephew\u2019s remembered his manners while he\u2019s been serving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have any?\u201d Lia murmured, a hint of mischief in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just keep pushing yourself until you collapse?\u201d Jared shouted at her. \u201cWatching you crawl in the dirt will certainly make us all feel better.\u201d</p><p>Lia paled.</p><p>\u201cJARED!\u201d Yarek clouted Jared\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou shame your mother to say such a thing!\u201d</p><p>Jared closed his eyes and hunched his shoulders. He stood there, trembling, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Warlord,\u201d Lia whispered.</p><p>As soon as she was out of earshot, Blaed turned on Jared. \u201cDamn it, Jared. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Jared glared at Blaed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong withme! What\u2019s wrong withyou , bringing her out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdidn\u2019t bring heranywhere . I managed to climb up behind her before she went looking foryou .\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s hands curled into fists.</p><p>Blaed took a wider stance and braced his feet.</p><p>\u201cYoungsters,\u201d Yarek said firmly. \u201cEnough blood\u2019s been spilled on this land.\u201d</p><p>Jared swayed. He resisted Yarek\u2019s embrace for a moment before giving in and clinging. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been sitting here, becoming incensed because the cousin I still remember as a girl is old enough to have lovers. I lash out at you. I lash out at Lia. Mother Night, will I ever stop lashing out at people who don\u2019t deserve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the grieving pain, Jared,\u201d Yarek said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s something too big to give in to all at once. I know, boy. I know.\u201d</p><p>Jared stepped back. Took a deep breath. \u201cBlaed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blaed shook his head. \u201cI understand.\u201d He looked at the garden. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you come without some warning, but I didn\u2019t know how to tell you about this. Any of this.\u201d</p><p>The three men turned and watched Lia enter the greenhouse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave Thera alone too long,\u201d Blaed said. \u201cShe\u2019s still too edgy.\u201d He looked at Yarek. \u201cI could give you a ride back to the village. Jared and Lia can ride double on the gelding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take the gelding,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cNot if Lia\u2019s staying I can\u2019t,\u201d Blaed replied sourly. \u201cDamn horse caught a whiff of her and has been acting like a stallion who\u2019s caught the scent of the only mare in season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, young Prince.\u201d Yarek squeezed Jared\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t stay too long. The bastards shouldn\u2019t come back, but it would be too easy to get cut off out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing,\u201d Jared said, drawing Yarek a few feet away. \u201cWhat . . . What happened to the bodies?\u201d</p><p>Yarek rubbed his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said the bastards didn\u2019t win in the end. They hadn\u2019t been interested in the bodies at Wolfs Creek. Just left them there. But they took the time to look for Belarr. I guess they wanted to make sure he was dead. It was after sunset before they came here. I could hear them smashing things while they searched. They came out again, cursing for all they were worth, shouting at each other that they\u2019d find him, and the Healer, too.</p><p>\u201cI waited a while before going inside.</p><p>\u201cBelarr and Reyna were gone, Jared. Just gone. There was that quilt soaked with their blood, but that was all.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched the clouds move slowly across an autumn-blue sky. \u201cDo you believe in the Dark Realm, Uncle Yarek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place where the Blood\u2019s dead go before their power fades enough for them to return to the Darkness? Myself, I always thought stories about the demon-dead were just that\u2014stories. Now I\u2019m not so sure. Belarr would have done anything to stop them from taking her. If going to such a place would have given him a little more time with her, he would have found a way.\u201d Yarek paused. \u201cI never found Janos, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it does exist,\u201d Jared said quietly. \u201cI hope they found the way to get there, and they\u2019re still together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, Jared. Me too. Now make your peace with the witchling and try not to fret her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother male flaw,\u201d Jared grumbled. \u201cI fuss. I pester. Now I\u2019ll be accused of fretting her.\u201d</p><p>Yarek gave Jared a long look before patting his shoulder. \u201cThey all say that. And they all get used to it. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>Jared waited until he heard the mare\u2019s hoofbeats before he approached Reyna\u2019s greenhouse.</p><p>She\u2019d found a bucket of water and the specially shaped dipper Reyna had used to water the seedlings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLia.\u201d Jared waited for her to acknowledge his presence.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>Feeling awkward, he shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he watched her move from pot to pot, speaking so softly he couldn\u2019t make out the words that weren\u2019t meant for him anyway.</p> <p>She held the dipper in her left hand. Two fingers of her right hand rested just above the soil in the pot. She poured the water over her fingers and murmured a phrase. The same movements, the same words, over and over.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he really looked at the seedlings in the first pots and saw how much stronger and greener they looked than the rest of the plants that he realized what she was doing.</p><p>Queen\u2019s magic.</p><p>According to their oldest legends, the Blood had been created to be the caretakers of the Realm, to use the awesome power they\u2019d been given to maintain the balance between the land and all its creatures. As the caretakers, they became the rulers of everything that walked upon Terreille or flew above it or swam in its waters.</p><p>The price of power was service. Or so the legends said.</p> <p>The Blood had a deep respect for the land. Many had a special gift for nurturing it.</p><p>But only a Queen could heal it once it had been wounded. Only a Queen\u2019s blood and a Queen\u2019s strength could turn barren ground back into fertile soil.</p><p>They were, after all, the land\u2019s heart.</p><p>Coming up behind her, Jared lifted her right hand and poured water from the dipper over it to clean the cuts she\u2019d made on her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cNo, Lia,\u201d he said gently, turning her around.</p><p>She stared at his chest. \u201cLet me do this. I need to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Jared shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to plant them. There\u2019s nowhere for them to go.\u201d Was that true for the Shalador people as well? he wondered. Would they, too, wither and die?</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t pull away from him, he slipped his arms around her and nudged her closer. He sighed when her hands touched his waist.</p><p>\u201cI used to help her in here,\u201d Jared said in a hushed voice. \u201cShe always said I had to make myself useful if I was going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to what?\u201d Lia asked when he didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Jared grimaced. \u201cIf I was going to pester her.\u201d</p><p>Lia chuckled. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so good at it. You\u2019ve been in training your whole life.\u201d</p><p>Jared made a rumbling sound, which amused her even more.</p><p>Drawing her closer, he rested -his cheek on the top of her head. \u201cI saw her once, a few months after I was Ringed.</p> <p>During the training time. I don\u2019t know if she was in that particular Territory for another reason and just happened to be walking in that plaza that day or if she\u2019d somehow found out where I was and had come to see me.</p><p>\u201cI saw her. It would have been hard to miss a golden-skinned woman with shining black hair that flowed to her waist and those rare green eyes.\u201d He paused. \u201cI have her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lia stroked his back.</p><p>\u201cThe witches in charge of the training saw her, too. They didn\u2019t know, or care, who she was, only that her presence there was important to me. One of them walked over to me and fondled me through my clothes. And there was nothing I could do about it. There was nothing they\u2019d done to me up to that point that had humiliated me quite that much. In a way, it\u2019s ironic that I felt so much shame because Shalador boys look forward to the day when we\u2019re old enough for the Fire Dance, for the time when we\u2019ll step into the dance circle and display ourselves to every woman in the village. I wouldn\u2019t have been dancing for my mother, but I would have danced in front of her and never given it a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Lia murmured. \u201cThat would have been your choice, and it was part of the male rites among your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared whispered, not sure he could bear her understanding. \u201cSo I went up to her, and I told her it was her fault. That all of it was her fault. That it was because of her that I was Ringed and would never know any pleasure with a woman. That if she\u2019d been a different kind of woman, this wouldn\u2019t have happened to me.</p><p>\u201cThen I told her I hated her, and I walked away.</p><p>\u201cI looked back just once. She was on the ground, curled up in a tight ball. No one stopped. No one touched her or tried to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blamed her for a long time because it was safer to blame someone else. But I couldn\u2019t forget the look in her eyes when I said those things. I couldn\u2019t forget seeing her on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhen I stopped blaming her, the only thing I wanted to do was go home. I even made a couple of timid attempts to escape, but I was too terrified of the agony the Ring can produce to manage it. So I used to lie in my bed and imagine that I\u2019d gotten home somehow. Just for an hour. Just long enough to see her, to talk to her. Just long enough . . . And now I\u2019m home, and it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m too late, and I\u2019ll never be able to take back the words.\u201d</p><p>Lia held him while he cried. He had no tears yet for his father and brother. There would be time enough to mourn them later. There was no room in him to grieve for anyone but Reyna.</p><p>She held him long after the last tear.</p><p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d Lia asked softly.</p><p>Jared wiped his face on his coat sleeve. \u201cCompassionate. Generous, stubborn, strong, loving, patient, courageous.\u201dLike you .</p><p>Lia took his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>She led him to the back of the greenhouse and pointed to three large, glazed pots. Each one was divided into two sections and contained two seedling trees. \u201cSomeone must be caring for them. They\u2019re the only healthy plants here.\u201d</p><p>Love formed a lump in Jared\u2019s throat that was sharper than grief. \u201cThose are our luck and love pots,\u201d he said, his voice husky. \u201cAnd these\u201d\u2014he brushed a leaf with his fingertip\u2014\u201care honey pear trees.\u201d</p><p>Lia leaned over, brushing her fingers over the leaves and thin trunks while she crooned to the little trees.</p><p>\u201cReyna gave each of us one of these pots on our sixth birthday. Luck and love, she called them. There\u2019s a hollow in the base. In the spring, we\u2019d write down a wish or a dream or a desire and then fold the paper and pass it through the base into the hollow. Then we could plant any seeds or seedlings we wanted in the pot. They were ours to care for. Some years they grew. There were a lot of years when the seedlings started out well enough, but then we\u2019d forget about them.</p><p>\u201cShe never touched them. I planted honey pear seedlings one year because I wanted a honey pear tree that I didn\u2019t have to share with anyone. I drenched them whenever I remembered and then forgot to water them for weeks at a time. When they died, I got mad at her. She waited through my undignified tantrum and then quietly told me that the plants were a symbol, a way for me to learn that no one else could nurture my wishes or dreams or desires. If I wanted them to thrive, I had to take care of them myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese seedlings can\u2019t be more than a year old,\u201d Lia said. \u201cSo she must have planted them and tended them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Two honey pear trees for each of her sons\u2014 even the son who had walked away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the papers you tucked in the hollows?\u201d Lia asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d take them out after the harvest to compare what had happened during those months to what we\u2019d written.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get your wishes if the plants thrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d Jared smiled crookedly. \u201cAlthough one year I had to wait until the next horse fair to get the pony I\u2019d admired so much because it wasn\u2019t for sale until then.\u201d</p><p>Lia smiled with him. \u201cIs your last wish still in the hollow?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s smile faded. It had been years since he\u2019d thought about the luck and love pots. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He took a couple of deep breaths before using Craft to pass his fingers through the pot\u2019s base.</p><p>His fingers brushed against paper. Touched sealing wax.</p><p>Frowning, he drew the paper out of the hollow. When he turned it over, he saw his name written in a feminine hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d Lia said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lia touched his arm. \u201cI won\u2019t go far.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched her until he felt convinced she wouldn\u2019t wander out of his sight. Then he settled on the stool Reyna had kept in the greenhouse and broke the letter\u2019s seal.</p><p>Jared,</p><p>A few weeks ago, a Black Widow came through Ranon\u2019s Wood with her brother and his Lady. They were exhausted and the Warlord had been wounded in a fight. After the healing, they stayed with us a few days to recover their strength. Since whatever marks they had between them would be needed for the rest of their journey, I had refused payment. The Black Widow offered to trade a skill for a skill, so I asked if she could make a tangled web that could show how you fared.</p><p>When she approached me several hours later, I knew she didn\u2019t want to tell me what the web of visions had revealed.</p><p>She told me you would return to Ranon\u2019s Wood this autumn.</p><p>Then she told me I wouldn\u2019t be here to see you.</p><p>At first I thought she meant that I\u2019d be away from the village or committed to a healing and you wouldn\u2019t be able to wait. But I\u2019ve been a Healer too long not to understand words that are left unspoken. I didn\u2019t ask if it would be an accident or illness or if I could do something to prevent it. What matters is there are things to be said, and this may be the only chance I\u2019ll have to say them.</p><p>I won\u2019t insult you by saying that your words didn\u2019t hurt or that I didn\u2019t cry. They did hurt. I did cry. But I understood even then why you needed to say them. Since that day, Belarr and I have had to accept the bitter truth that, in some ways, you were right. Because of our mistakes, no matter how well intentioned, a son lost his freedom and a precious part of his life.</p><p>The Blood survive on trust, Jared. We trust that everyone will follow the Laws and Protocol that keep the weaker safe from the stronger. We trust that males won\u2019t use their strength against a female except in self-defense. We trust that every witch who is served will respect the males who hand over their lives into her keeping. When the code of honor we\u2019ve lived by for thousands upon thousands of years is broken, fear seeps in, and no man trusts what he fears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite the risks of the Virgin Night and the vulnerable days of our moontimes, yours is the more vulnerable gender. The need to serve has been bred into Blood males for so long, you can\u2019t be emotionally whole without it. Driven by the most intrinsic part of yourself to need what you fear\u2014I can\u2019t imagine a deeper, more personal nightmare.</p><p>We wanted your ability to trust to be deeply rooted before you had to see the dangers that were the other side of the bond. We waited too long. For that, we\u2019re both sorry.</p><p>Having lost one son, Belarr didn\u2019t wait with your brothers. Sometimes it hurts to see the wariness in their eyes. Sometimes I fear that they\u2019ll never be able to give their hearts fully to a woman because of it.</p> <p>The night the Black Widow told me you\u2019d be coming home, I had a dream. I\u2019ve wondered since if she\u2019d cast some spell that allowed me to see the visions in her tangled web that she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell me. I couldn\u2019t remember the dream, but I woke up terrified.</p><p>The next day, I talked to Janine, and we arranged for Shira, Mariel, and Davin to travel over the Tamanara Mountains with the Black Widow and her family. I tried to get Janos to go with them, but the distrust of unknown witches runs too deep in him. He feels safe in Ranon \u2018s Wood.</p><p>I received one letter from Davin before the snow closed the mountain passes. He and the girls are serving in a District Queen\u2019s court in the Territory called Dena Nehele. He misses his home and family, but I think he\u2019ll be able to put down roots and be happy.</p><p>There are two more things I have to tell you.</p><p>Before they left, the Black Widow asked that you deliver a message when you reached Ranon\u2019s Wood. I\u2019m to tell you that she and her brother and his Lady are going to Dena Nehele and hope to serve the Gray Lady. She said she wouldn\u2019t say more than that because they were being hunted, but you would know who the message was meant for.</p> <p>The second thing. There were many things Belarr regretted that he didn\u2019t get the chance to tell you. One night he said if he could tell you just one thing, it would be this: that he\u2019d known since you were a boy that you would wear the silver, but if you ever had a chance to wear the gold, you should grab that chance and hold on to it with everything that\u2019s in you. It upset him, so I didn\u2019t ask him what he meant. I simply give you his words in the hope that they have meaning for you.</p><p>If you feel you need my forgiveness, you have it. You\u2019ve always had my love.</p><p>May the Darkness embrace you, my son.</p><p>Reyna</p><p>Jared carefully folded the letter and vanished it.</p><p>The Silver and the Gold.</p> <p>Belarr had known about the Invisible Ring.</p><p>Was that why he\u2019d felt sure he\u2019d heard of it before? Was it the echo of something Belarr had said that had kept him from doubting its existence? On one of their rambles through the woods, perhaps. Maybe it had been the kind of comment an adult made in passing and then forgot, but a child never did.</p><p>Belarr had known he\u2019d wear the Silver and had hoped he\u2019d have a chance to wear the Gold.</p><p>Jared paused at the greenhouse door.</p><p>Looking a little guilty, Lia wandered through the herb garden, touching each plant as she passed.</p><p>Shaking his head, Jared went to join her.</p><p>He\u2019d pretend not to see the drops of blood on the leaves.</p><p>This time.</p> <p>But he wouldn\u2019t pretend the Invisible Ring didn\u2019t exist. It didn\u2019t matter if she denied it with every breath. He wasn\u2019t going to give up this last tie to his father.</p><p>Lia stuck her fingers in her mouth as soon as she saw him.</p><p>\u201cPrick yourself?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>She pulled her fingers out of her mouth, and mumbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jared put his arm around her shoulders and guided her toward the lane, ignoring her attempts to slow down and touch another plant. \u201cThe letter was from my mother.\u201d</p><p>That distracted her long enough for them to reach the lane.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be.\u201d Lia studied his face. \u201cShe knew you wanted to take the words back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she knew.\u201d He helped her mount the gelding and then swung up behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s time we got back to the village. My mother left a message for Thera.\u201d</p><p>It did his heart good to have her pester him all the way back to the village to explain what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Krelis stared at the bloody, quivering thing kneeling in front of him. Three days ago, it had been a man. One of his guards.</p><p>Now it was missing so many pieces, he couldn\u2019t identify it.</p><p>It looked at him without really seeing him and made harsh, pleading sounds. Bloody spittle leaked from one corner of its mouth.</p><p>Krelis swallowed hard.</p><p>It was better this way. It would have hurt to recognize it enough to be able to call it by name.</p><p>Krelis turned away. The blood-streaked white feather that was inserted into the stub of flesh kept moving with each jerky breath, as if it were waving at him.</p><p>Or mocking him.</p><p>This was why the witches called it the Brotherhood of the Quill.</p><p>Dorothea came out of the adjoining room, slowly rolling the handle of a curved, thin-bladed knife between her hands. She spared him one withering glance before going to the table that held the rest of her sharp, bloody toys. She set the knife gently in its place.</p><p>\u201cLord Krelis.\u201d</p><p>The way she said his name told him that he\u2019d done nothing but disappoint her lately, and she didn\u2019t expect this report to be any different.</p><p>Cold-blooded, malevolent bitch, Krelis thought fiercely.</p><p>A moment after the thought formed, marrow-freezing fear swept through him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant it, would never think it again. She was the answer to everything he wanted, the answer to centuries of work and sweat. As her Master of the Guard, he was one of the most powerful men in Hayll. Respected. Feared.</p><p>He turned that thought over and over. He\u2019d worked hard to gain enough status to keep the fear at bay. Now he was in the position of being feared.</p><p>Krelis felt some of the tension ease.</p><p>Now he was one of the males the witches couldn\u2019t strike against, couldn\u2019t Ring. Unless they, too, served in Dorothea\u2019s court, they had no safety from him.</p><p>He smiled. His smile widened when he caught Dorothea\u2019s sudden, arrested look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you wish to say to me, Krelis?\u201d</p><p>Her voice had gone a little breathy, like a woman at the beginning of arousal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found them, Priestess,\u201d Krelis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone to ground in a Shalador village called Ranon\u2019s Wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>Krelis clenched his teeth. \u201cThe Shalador bastard disappeared with the little bitch-Queen, but they\u2019re supposed to meet the others there.\u201d</p><p>Selecting a short-bladed knife, Dorothea glided over to one of the large, potted, flowering bushes that sat near her playroom windows and cut off two overblown yellow flowers. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to assume he\u2019ll take her to that village. He could just as easily take her to Dena Nehele and claim whatever rewards he can for his brave service,\u201d she added with a sneer.</p><p>Krelis had thought of that, had sweated over that. It pleased him that he'd worked out an answer he felt sure would suit her. \u201dRanon\u2019s Wood is his home village. It had been softened this spring when the new Shalador Queens wisely decided to bring the Territory into Hayll\u2019s shadow. He\u2019ll find little help there, whereas we\u2019ll have an entire village of hostages.\u201c</p><p>\u201cTell me more,\u201d Dorothea purred as she cut the flower stems until they were barely an inch long.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll offer a trade. His village for the little bitch Queen. If she\u2019s turned over to us, we\u2019ll let everyone else go.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea looked up from her stem trimming. \u201cWill we?\u201d</p><p>Krelis smiled, feeling more sure of himself than he\u2019d felt in days. \u201cNo, Priestess. The useful ones will be taken as slaves. The rest will be eliminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll well and good if the bitch is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also have the slaves she bought at Raej. They must have some bargaining value for her to be so determined to get them to Dena Nehele. There\u2019s no reason Hayll can\u2019t bargain more keenly and get further concessions from the Queens or aristo families in the slaves\u2019 Territories.\u201d He wanted to laugh. His pet could tell his fellow travelers a good many things about being part of a bargain with Hayll. \u201cIf she\u2019s not there, we can demand a trade\u2014 the slaves for the bitch-Queen. Some of them aren\u2019t worth much, true, but if the children are aristo, their families are going to think hard about believing any promises the Gray Lady makes if she doesn\u2019t trade her kin for theirs since it was her buying them that put them in this danger. And the Shalador Warlord isn\u2019t willingly going to sacrifice his family for a witch he\u2019s only known for a short time.\u201d</p><p>Walking up to the quivering thing, Dorothea tucked the flowers into the holes where its ears had been. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a thousand Hayllian guards to Ranon\u2019s Wood and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many?\u201d Annoyance crept back into Dorothea\u2019s voice. \u201cSurely there can\u2019t bethat many Jeweled Blood left in that privy hole of a village. You\u2019ll have the courts thinking the Gray Lady\u2019s an enemy to be respected, even feared, if you need that many Hayllian warriors to subdue the little bitch who serves her.\u201d</p><p>Did shewant them to fail? Krelis wondered. Why deny a fierce enemy when the denial fooled no one? Taking that many men was a sound fighting decision.</p><p>He hesitated, almost tempted to explain this to Dorothea. Instead he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for guards to be called from various stations throughout a Territory to participate in a specific training exercise or a special assignment. The Masters of the Guard in the minor courts won\u2019t give it a second thought. And the guards themselves won\u2019t think past having an opportunity to be observed by the Masters in the stronger courts in the hopes of being offered a contract. There\u2019s no reason they have to know this isn\u2019t a chance for them to show off their skills. And there won\u2019t be anyone else to say differently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorothea began her slow, hip-swaying pacing. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Krelis swallowed carefully, keeping his eyes away from the thing. \u201cA couple of days, Priestess, before I\u2019ll be able to hand the Gray Lady\u2019s bitch into your keeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of days,\u201d Dorothea murmured.</p> <p>He caught a flash of amusement in her eyes. He held his breath and waited. By tomorrow evening, his cousin or the young Warlord whose training he\u2019d been overseeing would look like that quivering thing. His pet\u2019s information had come two days too late, which was something Krelis wasn\u2019t going to forget when he got to Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>\u201cA couple of days,\u201d Dorothea murmured again. Pausing at the table, she selected a knife and looked at the quivering thing.</p><p>It whimpered. Tried to shift its position.</p><p>Dorothea put the knife down and approached Krelis. \u201cThis has been a difficult time for you, hasn\u2019t it, darling?\u201d she said as she stroked his cheek. \u201cAnd I do understand how wearing it can be when a person\u2019s concentration is split between business and family. Since you\u2019ve obviously taken my incentives to heart, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do. Your cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 will remain confined but untouched. We\u2019ll discuss their future upon your return.\u201d</p><p>Krelis turned his face just enough to kiss her palm. \u201cThank you, Priestess.\u201d When she lifted her hand, he stepped back and bowed low. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, there\u2019s a great deal to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward the door. Stopped. Turned back. Cutting off his ability to feel anything, he carefully studied the thing that had been a man.</p><p>Dorothea eyed him curiously. \u201cIs there a problem. Lord Krelis?\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s lips curved in a small smile. \u201cMy pet has not fulfilled his duties satisfactorily and will, I fear, require discipline.\u201d</p><p>Dorothea\u2019s eyes filled with glittering pleasure. \u201cYes, fear is always a useful tool. Something your predecessor didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Krelis almost reached the door when she added quietly, \u201cBut then,he was an honorable man.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Jared poured another two fingers of whiskey into his glass. Raising it to eye level, he studied it.</p><p>A liquid cloak to cover the heart and protect it from lethal shards of pain. A fluid wall to keep grief at bay.</p><p>He turned away from such thoughts. If he kept his mind harnessed to practical matters, he didn\u2019t really have to think at all.</p><p>And right now, he couldn\u2019t afford to think.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d Yarek sipped his whiskey, hesitated.</p><p>Jared leaned back and waited. He and Yarek were the only ones left in the inn\u2019s dining room. Lia, Thera, and Blaed had gone for a walk after the midday meal. He suspected Lia needed a little time away from the pulsing needs everyone in the village was trying so hard to keep reined in. He\u2019d seen the hunger in the males\u2019 eyes, the relief in the witches\u2018. And he\u2019d seen the way Lia had quietly accepted and eaten the full bowl of stew that had been placed before her\u2014theonly full bowl that had been served. She hadn\u2019t shamed the village by refusing the food offered, hadn\u2019t denied them the honor of serving a Queen.</p><p>She must have choked on every mouthful with all those eyes anxiously watching her, but she never showed it.</p> <p>Sitting beside her, his heart had swelled with pride . . . and something more.</p><p>He would never burden her with his feelings. Having been a pleasure slave\u2014having his self so divided and debased\u2014made it impossible for him to have what he wanted most.</p><p>But he would love her for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Yarek said again.</p><p>Jared pulled his attention back to his uncle. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Yarek cleared his throat. Took another sip of whiskey. \u201cThe witchling . . . the Lady. She\u2019s got a kind heart, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she says there\u2019s a place for all of you in Dena Nehele, then there is,\u201d Jared replied.</p><p>\u201cA land can only give so much, can only hold so many before the scales tip and we take too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Dena Nehele can absorb a hundred of Shalador\u2019s own.\u201d A hundred survivors out of two thriving villages. Jared took another swallow of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cMore and more people are going over the mountains,\u201d Yarek said worriedly. \u201cPlenty of them settle in the other Territories, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared laid a hand over Yarek\u2019s. \u201cYou were the one who always told me not to plant troubles where there aren\u2019t any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Dena Nehele will gain Shalador\u2019s best and be better for it.\u201d</p><p>Naked grief filled Yarek\u2019s eyes before he looked away.</p><p>Jared leaned back, unable to offer any words of comfort that wouldn\u2019t shatter his own fragile control.</p><p>Shalador\u2019s best would never leave Shalador\u2014unless they found their way to the Dark Realm. The war had seen to that.</p><p>\u201cThe Coaches are intact?\u201d Yarek asked after a moment.</p><p>Jared nodded. The two Coaches that belonged to the destroyed Coach station hadn\u2019t been damaged in the attack, but he still hadn\u2019t figured out how they were going to fit everyone who couldn\u2019t ride the Winds on their own into two Coaches that comfortably held thirty people between them. And he didn\u2019t know who would handle them. The three Warlord brothers who had run the Coach station hadn\u2019t survived the attack, and no one else had the training.</p><p>Yarek frowned, gave Jared an uneasy glance, frowned harder. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a Black Widow in Wolfs Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every village has one, any more than they have a Priestess or a Queen,\u201d Jared said, wondering where this was leading.</p><p>Yarek rubbed his chin. \u201cThe Hourglass covens have different ways. Stands to reason considering the kind of Craft they do.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Jared waited.</p><p>Yarek shrugged, and asked hesitantly, \u201cDo they eat different?\u201d</p><p>Jared narrowed his eyes. That hint of fear hadn\u2019t been there a few hours ago when Yarek talked about Thera fretting.</p><p>\u201cThe women asked about it, you see, and I said I\u2019d ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jared said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWell, they butchered the two pigs and the chickens that were left.\u201d Yarek held up a hand as if Jared had protested. \u201cNo room to take them with us and no point leaving them to fill someone else\u2019s belly. But a cool box filled with cooked meat won\u2019t take up much room in the Coaches and would make everyone feel a little easier having a bit of their own for the first day or two. So we\u2019ll eat hearty tonight and tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with Thera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems she came along early this morning and saw what they were doing. Came back a few minutes later carrying a couple of wash buckets and insisted on having all the offal she could fit in them. Soon as they were filled, she vanished the buckets and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you how she was fretting last night, remember?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, after I got her calmed down a bit, she went up to the room she\u2019s sharing with the young Warlord Prince. He went up with her, then came down a few minutes later in a snarling mood. At the time, I just thought she wanted to be alone for a little bit and had shown him the door. Now I\u2019m thinking she wanted some privacy to spin one of those tangled webs. When she came back downstairs a couple of hours later, she was troubled but a lot calmer\u2014and very hungry. Didn\u2019t have much to offer her last night. That\u2019s why the women started wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Yarek! Lord Yarek!\u201d A boy barreled into the dining room. \u201cRiders coming,\u201d he gasped. \u201cThirteen of them.\u201d</p><p>Jared jumped to his feet, knocking the chair over.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Yarek whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ve come back.\u201d</p><p>The descent to the Red was swift but controlled. By the time Jared stepped into the street, he was centered in his strength and ready, almost eager, to rise to the killing edge.</p><p>He looked east.</p><p>Lia and Thera, returning from their walk with Blaed, slowed down when they saw him.</p><p>Blaed gave Jared a swift look, then dragged the two women into the nearest building.</p><p>Jared turned and began walking down the street.</p><p>Brock and Randolf came out of one building, but neither of them stepped into the street to join him.</p><p>It was his uncle Yarek and Thayne\u2014and Garth\u2014and the Jeweled Warlords and witches who were left who formed a wall at his back.</p><p>The riders turned into the main street and rode forward slowly. Six pairs of Warlords behind a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>The Warlords stopped.</p><p>The Warlord Prince kept coming. He reined in a few yards from Jared, dismounted, and closed the rest of the distance on foot until he stood a man\u2019s length away.</p><p>\u201cWarlord,\u201d he said with deceptive pleasantness.</p><p>\u201cPrince Talon,\u201d Jared replied, keeping his face and voice neutral.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Warlord. Privately.\u201d</p><p>Jared jerked his head at the building to his left. \u201cThis will do.\u201d</p><p>He barely got into the room before Talon slammed him into the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell were you thinking\u2014ifyou were thinking?\u201d Talon roared as he jammed his tunic-filled fists under Jared\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staggering around in a hostile Territory like a drunken landen! If we hadn\u2019t come across that slaughter and followed the tracks, we\u2019dstill be searching.\u201d</p><p>Jared bared his teeth. He clamped his hands around Talon\u2019s wrists. \u201cMaybe your tracking abilities are at fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best tracker around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen think how much trouble the second-best tracker has had.\u201d</p><p>Talon\u2019s eyes glazed with fury.</p><p>Remembering how easily a Warlord Prince rose to the killing edge, Jared leashed his own anger. \u201cTalon\u2014\u201d</p><p>Talon just shook him and roared.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Jared snarled. \u201cYou got your niece back. Lia\u2019s not your concern.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Talon slammed him into the wall again. \u201cI\u2019mthe one who taught her to ride.I\u2019m the one who taught her how to use a bow.I\u2019m the one who taught her how to fight with Craft. Don\u2019t youdare tell me she\u2019s not my concern.\u201d</p><p>Jared stared at Talon. Finally, he said, \u201cHave you ever played chess with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201d The glaze of fury slowly faded from Talon\u2019s eyes. Releasing Jared, he stepped back. After a minute, he shook his head, and said dryly, \u201cI think I just did.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Talon\u2019s anger had passed, Jared felt the sting of the accusations. \u201cIf you were so concerned, why didn\u2019t you stay to escort her to the Tamanara Mountains?\u201d</p><p>There was no way to describe the look in Talon\u2019s eyes. \u201cWarlord,\u201d he said quietly, \u201ceven a rogue knows when to yield to a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Jared squirmed a little, like a boy chastised by an elder. \u201cBut you came back. You\u2019ve been searching for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Talon said with a genuine smile, \u201cIam a rogue.\u201d He gave Jared a rough clap on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go see the witchling. She deserves a good scolding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I watch?\u201d Jared asked, falling into step beside Talon.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Talon replied, laughing. \u201cHow else will you learn how to do it right?</p><p>Jared knocked on the bedroom door but didn\u2019t wait for Lia to answer before he slipped into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d he asked, studying her with some concern. She seemed subdued and a little pale. He understood her feeling subdued. Talon\u2019s skill at scolding far exceeded any instructorhe\u2019d ever had. \u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Lia murmured, twisting the bottom of her sweater. She wasn\u2019t quite pacing, but she also couldn\u2019t seem to stand still. \u201cJared, I have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Lia pressed her lips together and stared at the floor. Finally, she sighed. \u201cOne of the reasons\u2014the main reason\u2014 I haven\u2019t had my Virgin Night is that I never wanted to ask one of the males in the court to do something so intimate out of a sense of duty.\u201d</p> <p>Jared thought the males in the court would be appalled to hear her say that, but he could understand how Lia might think of it as some unwanted \u201cduty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Lia took a couple of deep breaths. \u201cWould you do it?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s mind went blank. To have this much. To give this much. To know that she trusted him this much.</p><p>Lia flicked a nervous glance at him.</p><p>Jared ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYes. Of course. When we get to Dena Nehele\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lia scraped her teeth over her bottom lip. \u201cIt has to be now. Before sunset.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a step back. His legs hit the edge of the bed. He sat down abruptly. \u201cNow?Right now?\u201d</p><p>Lia nodded. \u201cThera says if I don\u2019t have my Virgin Night before sunset, I never will.\u201d</p> <p>Jared opened his mouth, sure that he\u2019d been about to express a reasonable opinion, but nothing came out.</p><p>If only it hadn\u2019t been Thera, who had heeded a similar warning and had survived because of it.That he couldn\u2019t dismiss.</p><p>\u201cLia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable with it, I can ask Talon\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared shot to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him first.\u201d</p><p>Lia blinked. Frowned. Finally said, \u201cIf you kill him first, won\u2019t that make the rest of it ... awkward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will make it impossible,\u201d Jared replied, spacing out each word.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed his hands over his face. His body remembered what it felt like to hold her, kiss her, and itwanted . His heart yearned to make love to her. His mind kept squeaking the words \u201cVirgin Night\u201d like some terrified mouse.</p><p>Jared lowered his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly. You stay right here.\u201d He gestured toward a chair. \u201cSit down. Relax. Concentrate on breathing or something.\u201d</p><p>He bolted from the room.</p><p>Out in the corridor, Jared sagged against the wall.</p><p>He\u2019d have to find Talon and ask him. Hell\u2019s fire, he had to asksomeone . Being a pleasure slave didn\u2019t qualify him for seeing a witch through her Virgin Night. He\u2019d seen plenty of witches who\u2019d been broken during that first intimacy. They all had a lost, slightly vacant look in their eyes. Any fire that had burned in their hearts had been snuffed out under a man\u2019s body.</p><p>If something went wrong, he didn\u2019t think he could bear seeing Lia\u2019s eyes filled with that lost, vacant expression.</p><p>Oh, witches adjusted to the loss of their Jewels and their Craft. The ones from aristo families were sent into arranged marriages. He wasn\u2019t sure what kind of life the others endured. They adjusted. But they were never again whole. Many of them just faded away until there was little more than a husk left going through the motions of living. Some of them slipped into madness. None of them could be seeded more than once after being broken, and more than half of those pregnancies ended with an early miscarriage.</p><p>When he was younger, he thought it was unfair that broken witches should be stripped of their ability to have children as well as being stripped of their Jewels. But after having lived in the Territories that stood in Hayll\u2019s shadow, he doubted any of them regretted that barrenness. It was not in a witch\u2019s nature to become a breeder for the gender she would consider as the enemy.</p><p>Jared pushed away from the wall. He and Talon had spent the early afternoon removing the seats in the two small Coaches so they could fit more people in, while Yarek oversaw packing the storage spaces\u2014and finding a safe place for the six honey pear trees Lia insisted come with them.</p><p>Thank the Darkness, some of Talon\u2019s men knew how to handle a Coach, so there was no problem now about finding drivers.</p><p>With luck, Talon would be checking on something else that had to be readied for their departure, and it would take some time to find him. Maybe by then, Lia would have reconsidered.</p><p>He shook his head. Not with Thera\u2019s warning riding her.</p><p>Before he took two steps, Talon turned the corner.</p><p>Groaning, Jared sagged against the wall again.</p><p>\u201cShe still upset?\u201d Talon asked, eyeing the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Jared muttered.</p><p>Talon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cShe feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing fine.\u201d Jared looked Talon in the eyes. \u201cShe wants her Virgin Night.\u201d</p><p>Talon gaped at him. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now. I was just coming to look for you.\u201d</p><p>Watching Talon sag against the wall made Jared feel better.</p><p>Talon rubbed a hand over his chest. \u201cShe wants me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said too quickly.</p><p>A slow, wicked smile curved Talon\u2019s mouth. \u201cIn that case, Warlord, since the woman and the bed are in there, why are you out here?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s face heated. He shifted so that his back was fully pressed against the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve been a pleasure slave since I was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Talon nodded in understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to know the bed without ever knowing intimacy or pleasure. And at that age . . . Hell\u2019s fire, you can probably count the number of times you werereally with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could count it on one hand and not use all my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Talon rubbed his forehead. \u201cMother Night, you\u2019re almost a virgin yourself. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Jared stared at the opposite wall. \u201cShe asked me.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you consider seeing a witch through her Virgin Night a duty?\u201d</p><p>Talon stiffened. \u201cI\u2019d call it an honor.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, Jared nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times. It\u2019s safer when the male wears the darker Jewel.\u201d</p><p>Talon settled more comfortably against the wall and crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Jared argued.</p><p>\u201cIt can be if you forget why you\u2019re in the bed\u2014or if she panics.\u201d</p><p>Well, that helped.</p><p>It took less than five minutes for Talon to explain what he had to do for the Virgin Night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Talon shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Just take it slow. Let her get comfortable with each step before you go on to the next, and you\u2019ll do all right.\u201d</p><p>Jared glanced at the end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Talon said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here and make sure she doesn\u2019t bolt.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a deep breath, blew it out, and then walked to the bathroom at the end of the hall.</p><p>After cleaning his teeth, he paused and sniffed himself. He shook his head and stripped. Halfway through the fast bath, he realized he\u2019d accepted what he was about to do and felt steady.</p><p>More than steady.</p><p>He dried off, vanished the sweaty clothes he\u2019d been working in, then called in the trousers Daemon had given him and put them on. No point wearing anything more, he thought as his hand closed over the Red Jewel around his neck. He ran his other hand over the trousers. Did clothes retain something of the person who had worn them? Right now, he wouldn\u2019t mind absorbing some of Daemon\u2019s bedroom skills.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes and took a couple of deep, quiet breaths. He thought of the way Daemon\u2019s hands glided over a woman\u2019s body, coaxing, caressing. It became a slow, delicious dance that a woman was helpless to resist. It changed so subtly from cool water to fire she never had a chance to see the blaze before it consumed her in pleasure.</p><p>Smiling, Jared returned to the bedroom door.</p><p>Talon gave him an assessing look, returned the smile, and walked away. At the corner, he raised his hand. A Sapphire shield blocked the hall.</p><p>\u201cThat will make sure you\u2019re not disturbed,\u201d Talon said. He gave Jared an easy salute and left.</p><p>Taking one last deep breath, Jared opened the bedroom door.</p><p>Lia sat in the chair, fretting the sweater.</p><p>Jared leaned against the door and smiled when she peeked at him through her lashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if you haven\u2019t seen me before,\u201d Jared said, charmed by the shyness.</p><p>\u201cThat was different,\u201d Lia muttered, focusing on his bare feet.</p><p>Jared took another breath . . .</p> <p>. . . and heard the drums.</p><p>Heard the Priestess\u2019s voice rising out of the twilight to call the men to the dance.</p><p>His nostrils flared. His blood heated. Tension flowed out of him as desire saturated his body.</p><p>He flicked a glance at the hearth. The wood that had been readied to take the evening chill out of the room began to burn.</p><p>A flick of his hand closed the curtains. Only the young fire lit the room, smudging all the sharp lines until there were no lines, until the walls seemed to disappear and go on forever.</p> <p>Another flick of his hand vanished all the furniture except the bed and the small tables on either side of it.</p><p>Lia yelped when she landed on the floor. \u201cJared, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>He walked toward her. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear the drums, Lia?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear them? Like the land\u2019s heartbeat. Or the heartbeat of the Shalador people.\u201d He held out his hands. \u201cLet me show you the Fire Dance.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her up and pulled her against him. Her heart beat a staccato rhythm. Her cold hands pushed at his waist.</p> <p>He did nothing but hold her, letting his eyes wander over her face.</p><p>When she stopped trying to push him away, he slowly lowered his head, his lips parting for a kiss.</p><p>She arched back to escape his lips. He smiled because it only pushed her hips tighter against his.</p><p>Since she wouldn\u2019t give him her mouth, he took her throat. Soft kisses. Gentle sucking.</p><p>He licked her jaw.</p><p>Her hands clamped on his waist.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear them, Lia?\u201d he asked as he licked the corner of her mouth with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I hear something beating.\u201d Her voice had gone husky.</p> <p>\u201cThe drums.\u201d Jared brushed his lips over hers.</p><p>Her eyes were dark smoke. \u201cIs there someone singing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cListen to her. Follow her. The Fire Dance lies at the end of her voice.\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his and let them both sink into the drums and the voice and the musky twilight.</p><p>Stepping back, he drew her into the center of the room.</p><p>Lia plucked at the sweater. \u201cIt\u2019s warm in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d Jared suggested quietly as he slowly circled her, his feet automatically following the set pattern of steps.</p><p>Lia tossed the sweater aside. She puffed out her cheeks. \u201cMaybe we should open a window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take off the shirt.\u201d His fingertips brushed down her arm as he moved past her. \u201cThe Fire\u2019s supposed to be hot.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the first button. Her hand froze. Her eyes locked on the golden chest that glistened from more than one kind of heat.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d Jared gave her a feathery kiss while he used Craft to undo all the buttons. His hands brushed the shirt aside, brushed it over her shoulders, brushed it down her back.</p><p>She made breathy little sounds.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d He stepped back into his circle. \u201cWatch the Dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t\u2014\u201d Lia puffed out her cheeks again. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be naked when you do that?\u201d</p><p>He vanished the trousers.</p><p>She gulped and tried to stare at her feet, but he\u2019d already drawn her in too deeply. She raised her head and watched him dance, watched the muscles flex, watched him smile as he moved his hips, watched the shadows form into other dancers.</p><p>Listening to the drums, Jared increased the tempo, stepping close enough to brush against her, stepping back to widen the circle.</p><p>She pivoted in the center of the circle, her eyes following him, no longer shy enough to look away from a male celebrating his maleness.</p><p>As the drums began to fade, Jared wrapped an arm around Lia\u2019s waist and whirled her around the room until they reached the side of the bed.</p><p>Cupping her face in his hands, he kissed her long and deep.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you the rest of the Fire Dance,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. But the look in her eyes was answer enough.</p><p>He undressed her slowly, coaxed her into the bed, and stretched out beside her.</p><p>She shifted a little to move her hips away from his throbbing cock.</p><p>He shifted with her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said as his hand glided down her arm and back again. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>While he brushed his lips against hers, he reached with his mind and brushed lightly against her inner barriers.</p><p>She recoiled with a gasp.</p><p>Jared murmured soothing nothings while he kissed and caressed her.</p><p>Always before, he\u2019d given pleasure in order to escape the pain of punishment. Now he gave pleasure for the pleasure of giving it. He explored her body, fascinated by the muscles that quivered, and finally relaxed, under his light touch. He tasted her, rubbed himself against her so that her scent would be on his skin and his on hers. He laughed silently when her fingers dove into his hair to hold his mouth to her breast. He enjoyed the way her body both pulled away from and reached for the finger lightly brushing between her legs.</p><p>And all the while he slowly seduced her body, he stroked her inner barriers until she was so used to his presence she didn\u2019t react at all.</p><p>Then he began the journey into the abyss. Down, down, down while his mouth and fingers made her quietly desperate, while her grasping hands made him burn.</p><p>Down, down, down until he slipped under her inner barriers and saw the shining green web of herself.</p><p>Jared flowed upward. Carefully, delicately, he brushed a strand of her inner web.</p><p>Her body tensed. Thrashed.</p><p>His rolled, half-covering her to keep her still.</p><p>*It\u2019s all right, Lia.* He brushed the strand again.</p><p>*Yes,* she said, but her body shuddered, and she didn\u2019t sound at all convinced.</p><p>Following Talon\u2019s instructions, Jared carefully flowed his Red strength between the strands of her web, then formed a shield above her. That, Talon had explained, was why it was better for the male to wear the darker Jewel. If the witch panicked for some reason and tried to descend into the abyss, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get past the shield and inadvertently rip through her own inner web.</p><p>When he was done, he kissed her\u2014and jerked back in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d Lia said, her eyes wide with shock.</p><p>Jared caressed her breast, and felt the caress.</p><p>She pulled his head down and kissed him with a hunger that, when added to his own, left him reeling.</p><p>This was the seduction and the danger, Jared realized as he kissed her again. When a man was inside a woman\u2019s inner barriers, he could become so tangled up in the physical sensations of being both the giver and receiver that he wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish his body from hers.</p><p>He covered her. Felt his body pressing her down. Felt the bed under her back. Felt himself press into the opening until he met the physical barrier.</p><p>Jared buried his face against her neck.</p><p>Breathing hard, Lia gripped his shoulders. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>He thrust.</p><p>And took the pain as well as the pleasure.</p><p>For a moment, the world turned end over end, whirling them in a storm of sensations.</p><p>He wanted to thrust again, to feel that pleasure.</p><p>He was terrified of the blood that covered him.</p><p>Lia dug her nails into his shoulders hard enough to break the skin and cried out in pain.</p><p>Sheathed inside her, the impaled and the impaler, Jared forced his body to remain still while they rode out the storm.</p><p>And realized that he could have stepped away from it. That he could have kept himself disengaged enough not to be swept away.</p><p>That\u2019show a Jeweled male broke a witch. He mired her in the duality of sensations while staying in the eye of the storm. And then he gave pain instead of pleasure. The witch became her own enemy, feeling as if she were inflicting the pain upon herself. Unbalanced by the conflict, she would try to flee, but the pain would follow, driving her to her own destruction.</p><p>The knowledge made him shake.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d Lia wrapped her arms around him. \u201cJared?\u201d She shifted under him.</p><p>He struggled to find the self-control that would let him pull back enough not to get swept away by the physical sensations, not to lose control completely.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Lia murmured, stroking his back urgently. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Even if he could have distanced himself from her body, he couldn\u2019t bear to pull away fromLia .</p><p>So he wrapped her in his strength\u2014body, mind, and heart\u2014and surrendered both of them to the pleasure of the Fire.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Leaning against his desk, Krelis slowly twisted the Sapphire-Jeweled ring on his right hand.</p><p>Darker than the Green Jewel, lighter than the Red.</p><p>But skill and training counted for something, didn\u2019t they? What was a pleasure slave\u2019s raw strength compared with centuries of learning how to fight? What difference did it make if the bastard wore the Red? He didn\u2019t really know how to use it.</p><p>Except the Shalador Warlordhad held off the marauders who had banded together to capture the Green-Jeweled bitch-Queen. Had done a lot more than hold them off.</p><p>Had his pet been partially responsible for that? Krelis wondered as the Sapphire Jewel appeared and disappeared with each turn of the ring. Had he used his own training to support and guide the Red? It could have ended with that ambush.Should have ended with it.</p><p>His pet had been a serious miscalculation. He hadn\u2019t expected loyalty. No Hayllian expectedreal loyalty from these here-and-gone races. But a man who allowed himself to be bought should have the good sense tostay bought.</p><p>Well, that was one other thing he\u2019d take care of when he got to that privy hole called Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Krelis snapped in response to a knock on his office door.</p><p>Lord Maryk stepped into the room just far enough not to be noticeably still in the corridor. \u201cAll the supplies have been gathered, Lord Krelis. The guards from the last two southern Provinces are expected within the hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d thought my instructions were simple enough to be clear,\u201d Krelis said, keeping his eyes on his Sapphire ring.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a lot of supplies. We\u2019ll be back here by tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur men will need to eat after a fight,\u201d Maryk replied stiffly.</p> <p>A fight, Krelis thought, resisting the urge to laugh in Maryk\u2019s face. How much fight would a village that had already sustained an emotional belly wound have left?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting other warriors,\u201d Krelis said curtly. \u201cWhoever is left in that village already lost a battle with their own people. How much of a challenge can they be to a thousand Hayllian warriors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser to fifteen hundred.\u201d</p><p>Krelis finally looked up.</p><p>Maryk shrugged. \u201cBecause this was a special request from the High Priestess\u2019s court, every Master sent along a few more than we\u2019d asked for.\u201d</p> <p>The other Masters had undoubtedly added a few to keep tempers from flaring as well\u2014not only in the guards\u2019 quarters but in the manor houses of the Hundred Families. What young, ambitious male serving in a lesser courtwouldn\u2019t resent being kept from an assignment that might bring him to the notice of the most powerful witch in Hayll?</p><p>He\u2019d felt that way himself not all that long ago.</p><p>Some things, however, were best seen from a distance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already wasted enough time waiting for these young bucks to finish buttoning up their pants and shining their boots,\u201d Krelis said. \u201cWe leave in one hour. If the southern guards aren\u2019t here by then, they can stay behind or catch up to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Lord Krelis.\u201d But Maryk didn\u2019t leave. \u201cHave you decided who will take command of the men?\u201d</p><p>Krelis rounded the desk, opened a drawer, and took out a large, white feather. Tucking it inside his leather vest, he said, \u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Shivering, Jared gratefully accepted the mug of coffee Blaed handed him. The night air had a sharp bite to it, but worry seemed to bleed more heat from his body than the elements could.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s packed,\u201d Blaed said quietly. \u201cWe were ready to leave hours ago. Even riding the White Wind, it won\u2019t take more than a few hours to reach the Tamanara Mountains. Couldn\u2019t this have waited?\u201d</p><p>Jared sipped his coffee and wondered the same thing\u2014 and tried not to resent that Lia had asked Thera to stay with her instead of him.</p><p>Talon silently came around the corner of the Sanctuary that was located a mile outside of Ranon\u2019s Wood. He\u2019d made a circle around the building every hour since Lia and Thera had entered it, getting personal reports from the men who were standing guard and rotating the watch often enough to make sure everyone had a chance to warm up by the fire and eat a bowl of stew. Four of his men had stayed in Ranon\u2019s Wood to keep watch. The other eight had come with Talon, taking their turns in the rotation.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Talon asked softly when he joined them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready to leave,\u201d Blaed said, his voice ripe with impatience and nerves.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen isn\u2019t,\u201d Talon replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Offering to the Darkness takes from sunset to sunrise.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d When Talon hissed in anger, he looked back at the men warming themselves around the fire and lowered his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s making the Offering to the Darkness?Now ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you choose the time to make the Offering. Sometimes the time chooses you,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Blaed made a frustrated sound.</p><p>Jared understood exactly how Blaed felt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go back to the village or go on to the mountains,\u201d Talon said curtly.</p><p>Blaed glared at Talon before retreating to the fire.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jab at him,\u201d Jared said quietly. \u201cYou know Thera won\u2019t leave without Lia, and Blaed won\u2019t leave without Thera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Talon said just as quietly. \u201cBut he needs to learn now that there are times when a man can, and should, argue about a Queen\u2019s choice of action and there are times when he should keep silent and do what needs to be done. Lia understands the risks she\u2019s taking by staying here to make the Offering. She must have felt the need outweighed the risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been safer if she\u2019d waited until we reached Dena Nehele, until she\u2019d had time to recover from her Virgin Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it would have been safer\u2014ifwe can reach Dena Nehele without another fight. If we can\u2019t . . . The Green Jewel is still vulnerable in a one-on-one attack by a darker Jewel, but there are only two Jewels that can overwhelm a Gray.\u201d</p><p>The Ebon-gray and the Black. And only two Blood in the entire Realm of Terreille wore them: Lucivar Yaslana and Daemon Sadi.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t think Dorothea SaDiablo would be foolish enough to let either ofthem be part of a welcoming committee.</p><p>But thinking of Daemon reminded him of something else.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of the Invisible Ring?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Talon looked startled, then thoughtful. He blew on his hands to warm them before slipping them into his coat pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a few years since I\u2019ve heard anyone mention the Invisible Ring,\u201d he said a little sadly, a little bitterly. \u201cSeems like once the Ring of Obedience starts being used in a Territory, men shy away from any mention of a Ring of any kind.\u201d</p><p>Jared let his breath out slowly. \u201cI wear the Silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did.\u201d Talon looked at him and smiled. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Talon looked up at the sky. It had been drizzling a couple of hours ago, making everyone uncomfortable. Now the clouds had passed, and the star-filled sky was clear.</p><p>Talon said quietly, \u201cThese two things a man may choose as long as stars shine up above. For the Silver Ring is Honor, and the Ring of Gold is Love.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cNot good poetry, but that\u2019s how I was taught it.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned against the Sanctuary. \u201cNot a tangible Ring, then, but real all the same.\u201d</p><p>Talon nodded. \u201cVery real. And sometimes it weighs heavily enough on a man to almost feel tangible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said softly.</p><p>Talon nodded again but continued to look at the stars. \u201cI was about your age when I turned rogue. I still had two years left to the contract I\u2019d signed to serve a Province Queen, but things started happening in the court. She started to change, started showing a little too much deference to the Hayllian ambassadors and aristos who visited the court. One day I realized that the only way I could continue to serve her was to give up the Silver Ring.\u201d He paused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to give it up. Not then. Not now. So I used the first excuse I could find to be away from the court for a couple of days . . . and I just kept going. I promised myself then that I\u2019d never serve in another court, that I\u2019d never put myself in the position of having to choose between breaking a solemn vow or giving up my honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t formally serve the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made no vows, so I\u2019ll break no vows. But make no mistake about it, Jared. In my own way, I do serve her.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of a mistake made by the boy he had been, Jared sighed wearily. \u201cHow many men become ensnared by what they think is love and then find that they\u2019ve sacrificed something precious?\u201d</p><p>Talon rested a hand on Jared\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe Gold doesn\u2019t ensnare, Warlord. The Gold doesn\u2019t demand the Silver in exchange. That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s the Gold.\u201d</p><p>Jared studied the older man. \u201cHave you ever loved?\u201d</p><p>Talon hesitated. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn the Gold. Come on. Let\u2019s warm up by the fire for a bit. We\u2019ve still got a few hours before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>Thoughtful, Jared followed Talon to the fire.</p><p>Maybe it was because he was cold and tired and concerned about Lia that he had thought he\u2019d heard something that hadn\u2019t been there.</p><p>Or maybe there reallyhad been a touch of wistfulness\u2014 and envy\u2014beneath Talon\u2019s words.</p><p>The sky was starting to lighten when Lia and Thera walked out of the Sanctuary.</p><p>Jared strode toward the two pale, exhausted women who had their arms around each other as if they needed the support. But he stopped abruptly before he reached them, too shocked to continue moving.</p><p>Lia\u2019s psychic scent hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>Itshould have changed. He should have been able to sense the deeper, richer power of the Gray in her. But all he picked up was a solid, unmistakable Green.</p><p>Lia glanced at him but wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>Jared struggled to breathe.</p><p>What had he seen in her eyes before she looked away? Sorrow that her attempt to descend to her full strength had failed? Regret that she\u2019d tried to make the Offering to the Darkness when she was physically, mentally, and emotionally tired, and, because of it, had failed that ultimate test of Self?</p><p>No second chances. The Offering could be made only once. Whatever potential depth of power a person might have reached was lost forever if it wasn\u2019t won during that one grueling night. Whatever Jewels a person came away with after the Offering were the darkest Jewels he or she couldever wear.</p><p>Which is why a witch who should have been a Gray-Jeweled Queen had ended up wearing the Green Jewels of her birthright. She might hone her Craft and gain more skill with the power she had, but because she\u2019d gambled on one night, she wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to protect her Territory or her people against Dorothea SaDiablo.</p><p>Thera looked at Blaed and Talon before focusing on him. \u201cWe\u2019d like to return to the village and leave as soon as possible,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth until the muscles in his jaw began to jump. \u201cWhatever you Ladies wish.\u201d</p><p>Lia flicked an uneasy glance in his direction before hurrying toward the horses.</p><p>Watching them, Jared pivoted slowly until he could see the men around the fire. How many of them knew he\u2019d given Lia her Virgin Night? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of them, judging by the way they kept their expressions carefully blank and politely looked around or through him.</p><p>Only Randolf didn\u2019t look away, and his eyes held something that might have been sharp regret.</p><p>Even Brock just shook his head and turned his attention to smothering the fire and preparing to leave the Sanctuary.</p> <p>As resentment began to burn through the shock, Jared walked away from them, needed to get away from them. They blamed him for diminishing a Queen, blamed the inexperienced pleasure slave for daring to perform a service that should have been left to a strong, seasoned male.</p><p>Talon\u2019s hand closed on Jared\u2019s arm, forcing him to stop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jared snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s all wrong.

How would he\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Jared tried, but the resentment kept building. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEven if she wasn\u2019t able to descend to the Gray, she shouldn\u2019t have ended up with just her Birthright Green. She should have at least come away with the Sapphire or the Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your tongue,\u201d Talon snapped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place to chew over what happened or why. It\u2019s done, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it, so we\u2019d better all start accepting it.\u201d</p><p>With his hand still clamped on Jared\u2019s arm, Talon headed for the horses. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got everyone tucked safely in Dena Nehele, why don\u2019t you spend a few months in the mountains with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared said, feeling the guilt that he should have done something different, somethingmore , coil around his heart and squeeze.</p><p>Talon bared his teeth in a feral smile. \u201cBecause, Warlord, after you spend a winter with me, all that shit you spew about pleasure slaves will be knocked clean out of your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something to look forward to,\u201d Jared grumbled as he mounted the bay gelding.</p><p>Lia, Jared noticed with a fresh stab of resentment, was surrounded by Talon\u2019s men\u2014and they didn\u2019t make room for him to ride beside her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move,\u201d Talon said. \u201cJared, take the lead. I\u2019ll watch our backs. Everyone in the village will be waiting for us at the Coaches.\u201d</p><p>The Sanctuary was only a mile from the village, but it was the longest mile Jared had ever ridden.</p><p>The sky got lighter.</p><p>Feeling a prickle between his shoulder blades, Jared urged the gelding into a canter.</p><p>He probed the road ahead of him, looking for a trap. He probed the village and lightly touched the minds clustered together.</p><p>He expanded his probe outward . . .</p> <p>. . . and found a blank spot.</p><p>And another.</p><p>And another.</p><p>And another.</p><p>The kind of blank spot a dark Jewel would notice when a lighter Jewel was wrapped in a psychic shield.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>*Hold steady,* Talon said on a spear thread. *We\u2019re almost there. If they were ready to attack, they would have done it by now.*</p><p>Jared acknowledged the message and kept his eyes on the road. Thank the Darkness they had moved the Coaches into the village instead of leaving them near the landing place. Otherwise, they would likely have been destroyed.</p><p>By the time they cantered up the main street of Ranon\u2019s Wood, a circle of psychic blank spots surrounded the village.</p><p>Jared turned the gelding to one side, letting the others pass.</p><p>Talon reined in next to him.</p><p>\u201cCan we make a run for it?\u201d Jared asked quietly.</p><p>Talon shook his head. \u201cAt a quick guess, I\u2019d say there\u2019s several hundred of them out there, including a handful of Warlord Princes. They\u2019ve cut us off from the Winds, and we haven\u2019t got a chance of breaking through and outrunning them overland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we fight as well as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we fight,\u201d Talon agreed, urging his horse toward the Coaches.</p><p>\u201cAnd we die,\u201d Jared said, moving with him.</p><p>Talon stared straight ahead. \u201cIf the Darkness is kind.\u201d</p><p>Lia moved toward them as soon as they dismounted. Before she could say anything, a Craft-enhanced voice thundered over the land.</p><p>\u201cWarlord! Shalador Warlord! I am Krelis, Master of the Guard for the High Priestess of Hayll! Your village is surrounded by Hayllian warriors, the finest warriors in the Realm. You have two hours, Warlord. If you hand over the Green-Jeweled Queen, I\u2019ll let the rest of you go. If you don\u2019t, there will be nothing left of you or your people but dust.\u201d</p><p>Jared slipped a protective arm around Lia\u2019s shoulders. He felt relieved when Blaed stepped behind her to protect her back and Thera moved a little closer to her other side.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Talon said, turning to face them, \u201cit looks like the bastards have declared war.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Krelis leaned against the stable of the damaged Coach station outside Ranon\u2019s Wood. From there, he could keep an eye on the landing place, the road leading to that privy hole of a village, and the station itself where a few of his men were clearing out the debris in a couple of rooms to turn it into a temporary headquarters.</p><p>One of the Hayllian Warlord Princes approached him, and said, \u201cAll the men are in position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Krelis replied. \u201cPass the word that they\u2019re to do nothing but keep watch and make sure no one tries to slip between them.\u201d</p><p>The Warlord Prince paused. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to give these\u2014people\u2014two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every reason,\u201d Krelis snarled. \u201cI want that Shalador bastard to sweat. If I\u2019d demanded that the bitch Queen be handed over immediately, the Jeweled males left in the village probably would have fought out of instinct. So we give them a little time to think, to worry. Givehim a little time to look at his family and the people he grew up with and weigh the pain that will come to them against protecting a Queen he barely knows. Give the rest of them time to think about their own skins and weigh their children\u2019s lives against the life of one stranger. During the first hour, the villagers will split themselves into two camps. Before the second hour ends, the Shalador Warlord will either bundle her up and deliver her himself, or he\u2019ll yield to the rest of his people and not stand in their way whenthey deliver her to me.\u201d</p><p>The Warlord Prince made a sound of disgust \u201cAnd we let the others crawl back into their lair?\u201d</p><p>Krelis\u2019s lips curled in a sneer. \u201cOnce I have the bitch-Queen, the men can do whatever they please with the rest of them. The females can be passed around for as long as they survive. The children will be sold as slaves. The males can be broken, then hobbled and used for training exercises. That should give everyone a chance to show his skills.\u201d</p><p>A queer gleam filled the Warlord Prince\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, it should.\u201d</p><p>Krelis waved his hand in dismissal.</p><p>He\u2019d give the Shalador bastard time to sweat because it would also givehim time to figure out what to do about the two Warlord Princes in the village\u2014especially the Sapphire-Jeweled one. He hadn\u2019t expected them. Another oversight his pet would have to account for.They might have to be eliminated before the bitch-Queen was handed over.</p><p>Well, that was the Red-Jeweled bastard\u2019s problem.</p><p>Krelis called in a small wooden box. Inside was the brass button he had used to get past the traps spelled into the other ones in order to read the private messages, the brass button that had an extra spell woven into the metal\u2014a spell his pet didn\u2019t know about.</p><p>Krelis triggered the spell that yanked the psychic leash wrapped around his pet.</p><p>Then he made himself as comfortable as possible, and settled down to wait.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Jared, Talon, Blaed, Yarek, Thera, and Lia sat in a circle inside one of the Coaches.</p><p>Or two half circles, Jared thought uneasily. Blaed and Yarek flanked Thera the same way he and Talon flanked Lia.</p><p>He almost wished someone besides Yarek had been chosen to represent the survivors of Ranon\u2019s Wood and Wolf\u2019s Creek. He didn\u2019t want to be separated from his uncle during the last hours he had left.</p><p>But that would depend on Yarek. Jared\u2019s choice was already made.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to surrender,\u201d Lia said softly.</p><p>Thera\u2019s green eyes turned icy. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Do you really think those bastards are going to let the rest of us live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019sHayllian , and that bitch\u2019s Master of the Guard. What did you expect him to say? \u2018Make it easy for us because we\u2019re going to kill you anyway?\u2019 Once they have you, there\u2019s nothing to stop them from unleashing their Jewels and tearing this place apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I surrender, they might spare the children,\u201d Lia insisted.</p><p>Thera gave her a withering look. \u201cHave you ever seen a young girl after a few males get done with her? Especially Hayllian males? Or what they do to a boy? I\u2019d rather slit Cathryn\u2019s throat than let her be handed over to what\u2019s waiting out there. And Corry\u2019s and Eryk\u2019s, too. At least that would be quick and kind.\u201d</p><p>Lia made a distressed sound. \u201cThese people have endured enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese people are going to die,\u201d Thera said harshly.</p><p>\u201cBecause of me.\u201d</p><p>Thera expelled a vile string of obscenities. \u201cYou really turn into an idiot when you don\u2019t get enough sleep.\u201d</p><p>Gray eyes met green.</p><p>Feeling Talon\u2019s attention sharpen, Jared watched the two women who balanced and complemented each other\u2019s strengths so well. They didn\u2019t move, hardly seemed to breathe.</p><p>A minute passed.</p><p>Two minutes.</p><p>Finally, Lia said quietly, \u201cQueen\u2019s gamble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thera said just as quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way now.\u201d</p><p>Yarek cleared his throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s this Queen\u2019s gamble?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lia\u2019s eyes held Thera\u2019s. \u201cSomething my grandmother taught me.\u201d</p><p>Talon\u2019s eyes narrowed as he studied the two of them.</p><p>Since Talon had the most fighting experience, Jared waited for the Warlord Prince to say something, but he wasn\u2019t surprised when Talon remained silent and thoughtful.</p> <p>Yarek cleared his throat again. \u201cMeaning no disrespect for your grandmother, Lady, but I doubt anything\u2019s going to get us through an attack from that many warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will.

Yarek, inform your people. They\u2019ll need some time to accept having to face another battle. But do it quietly.\u201d</p><p>With some effort, Yarek got to his feet. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if they have time or not. They\u2019ll accept it. What choice do they have?\u201d</p><p>Thera looked up at him. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Not sure if he wanted to give reassurance or get some, Jared leaned toward Lia.</p><p>She leaned away from him, avoiding even that much contact.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, Jared told himself as he and the other men left the Coach. He didn\u2019t blame her for not wanting to be near him. Hewouldn\u2019t blame her for not feeling for him even half of what he felt for her. It wouldn\u2019t have come to anything anyway.</p> <p>But, Mother Night, how he wished she\u2019d let him hold her once more.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Leaning back against the bales of straw his men had arranged into a tolerably comfortable seat, Krelis delicately tested the knife\u2019s edge against the ball of his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Krelis growled at the Warlord who kept shaking his head as he stepped into the stable.</p><p>\u201cOne of the villagers came down the road a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with the edge, Krelis sheathed the knife. \u201cI\u2019m expecting one of them. Did you put him in the Coach station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lord Krelis.\u201d The Warlord\u2019s mouth curled in a vicious grin. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not likely you were expecting this one. He came around the curve in the road, saw us, and stopped. I thought he might be trying to spy on us, but he started grinning like a half-wit, unbuttoned his trousers, and watered the road. Then he turned around and headed back to the village. Didn\u2019t even tuck himself in.\u201d</p><p>Krelis leaned forward. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p> <p>The Warlord shrugged. \u201cBig male. Pale skin. Short hair. He wasn\u2019t close enough to see anything else.\u201d</p><p>Krelis snorted. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about that one. The High Priestess already took care of him. I\u2019m surprised he still has brains enough to unbutton his trousers in the first place.\u201d He stood up and stretched. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to worry about that one. But keep an eye out for my pet. He should be here anytime now.\u201d</p><p>Once the Warlord had returned to his position, Krelis slipped his hand into his coat pocket. His fingers curled around the brass button.</p><p>He gave the psychic leash another yank.</p><p>His pet still needed one or two lessons in obedience.</p><p>Teaching him would pass the time\u2014until it was the Shalador Warlord\u2019s turn.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Jared studied the people gathered in the tavern\u2019s small back room.</p><p>Eryk and Corry stood on either side of little Cathryn. Each of them held one of her hands.</p><p>Thayne, looking exhausted and obviously still suffering from the witchfire burns, leaned against the back wall, close to Blaed.</p><p>Brock leaned against the opposite wall, near the door, which was casually blocked by Talon. His face had that pained look of a man who badly needs to answer a call of nature but doesn\u2019t want to miss anything.</p><p>Pale and sweating heavily, Randolf restlessly paced the width of the small room, staying on the far side of the round table and chairs that were the room\u2019s only furniture.</p><p>Thera had said to tell all of them, but they hadn\u2019t been able to find Garth, and Jared decided not to waste time looking for him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Brock muffled a groan.</p><p>Thayne nodded once.</p><p>Randolf swore fiercely. \u201cWe\u2019re slaves. Slaves don\u2019t fight.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched Randolf closely. \u201cYou fought during the ambush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much sense in sitting back when the rest of you were tearing the place apart, was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much sense in sitting back now, either.\u201d</p><p>Randolf slapped his hands down on the table hard enough to make it rock. \u201cYes, there is. Do you know what happens to slaves who fight? What they\u2019ll do to any of the villagers who survive the first strike will be a slap on the wrist compared to what they\u2019ll do to us.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s control snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re not slaves!\u201d he roared. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been slaves since we left Raej.\u201d</p><p>Randolf stared at him.</p><p>Brock tried to suppress a pained laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not slaves,\u201d Jared said, struggling to leash his temper. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Gray Lady\u2019s so dangerous, even if that bitch Dorothea hasn\u2019t realized it. For the past few years, she\u2019s bought slaves at the auction andset them free . They go home, Randolf. Or they make a new home, a new life for themselves in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Randolf groped for a chair and sat down, his eyes never leaving Jared\u2019s face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Lady Lia tell us? Why this game?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You have to be wrong. We\u2019reRinged .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rings don\u2019t work,\u201d Blaed said. \u201cJust enough power was put into them to make us think they were still connected to a controlling ring. But they aren\u2019t. Besides, Lia has no idea how to use one.\u201d</p><p>Randolf rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell us?\u201d</p><p>Jared felt two light psychic touches. Talon\u2019s and Blaed\u2019s signals that they were descending to their full strength\u2014 and ready to rise to the killing edge.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Jared said quietly, \u201conce she brought us all together, Lia sensed something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t find the source. So she continued the pretense of bringing slaves to Dena Nehele, and she made things as difficult as she could for whichever one of us serves the High Priestess of Hayll while trying to get the rest to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us serves that bitch?\u201d Randolf\u2019s hands curled into fists.</p><p>Jared rested his hands on the table. \u201cIf Lia had told you in the beginning that you were free, that you could catch the Winds and go home, would you have gone?\u201d</p><p>Randolf\u2019s head moved slightly before he stopped himself from looking at the children.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Randolf said after a thoughtful silence. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019ve got too much pride as a Warlord and a guard to let a young Queen wander around without an escort.\u201d A dangerous gleam filled his eyes. \u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Garth,\u201d Brock said, wincing as he straightened to his full height and tucked his thumbs into his wide leather belt. \u201cIt\u2019s Garth.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to face Brock at the same moment Randolf exploded out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cI warned you!\u201d Randolf shouted, throwing himself at Jared with enough force to send them both to the floor. \u201cI told you that bastard was tainted! Damn you, why didn\u2019t you listen to me? We might have gotten her home if you\u2019d listened to me!\u201d</p><p>Randolf threw a couple of punches before Blaed and Talon pulled him off Jared.</p><p>By the time Jared got to his feet, Brock had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cHold him,\u201d Jared said as he rushed out of the tavern.</p><p>Spotting Brock walking purposefully down the road in the direction of the landing place, Jared ran to catch up to him. \u201cBrock! Brock!\u201d</p><p>When Brock turned around, Jared stopped abruptly, stunned by the bitterness in the other man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cEven now, when he\u2019s barely half of what he used to be, you choose to believe him, to trust him,\u201d Brock said. \u201cEven now.\u201d</p><p>Regret cut deep into Jared\u2019s bones. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough to be useful,\u201d Brock snapped. \u201cYou trusted the Warlord Prince whelp and the Black Widow enough to tell them we weren\u2019t slaves, but not me. It might have been different if you\u2019d trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have made any difference,\u201d Jared said coldly. \u201cYou\u2019d already chosen whom you serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have,\u201d Brock insisted. His face twisted with conflicting emotions. \u201cDo you know how I came to be a slave? MyQueen sold me to Hayll. The Territory Queen is getting old, and the bitch I served wants to rule more than a small Province. So she traded twenty of her best males for Hayll\u2019s influence in choosing the next Territory Queen. She sold our freedom, ourlives for ambition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a male serves, he puts his life into his Queen\u2019s hands,\u201d Jared said. \u201cIt\u2019s hers to do with as she pleases. That\u2019s the risk we all take, Brock.\u201d Remembering Talon, he added, \u201cHis life, but not his honor. You had that much choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you to talk about honor? You\u2019re a pleasure slave, a nonman pretending to be a Warlord.A Queen killer . Where were you hiding your honor when you butcheredher ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was owned by her. I didn\u2019t serve her.\u201d But the verbal thrust hurt as much as a knife in the gut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re splitting hairs, Jared,\u201d Brock said harshly. \u201cBut if that\u2019s how you want to split it, then as far as I knew, I was owned by the Gray Lady. What\u2019s the difference between you killing the bitch who owned you and me buying some kind of freedom for myself by helping the High Priestess get rid of a rival? All I had to do was lead the marauders to her if she escaped the trap at the Coach station.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brock\u2019s lips curled into a sneer. \u201cHayll didn\u2019t want her killed by a newly purchased slave because it would make all the other witches nervous about going to Raej to buy their pretty toys.I wasn\u2019t going to have a Queen\u2019s blood onmy hands.\u201d</p><p>Jared felt a weight settling in his chest. \u201cWho was Garth before Dorothea did that to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Province Queen\u2019s Master of the Guard. A leader. Men trusted him, listened to him. Even our father always listened to him,\u201d Brock added bitterly.</p> <p>\u201cGarth\u2019s yourbrother ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy older brother. Always stronger. Always better at everything. After the High Priestess broke him back to his Birthright Purple Dusk and sealed him up inside himself, he wasn\u2019t stronger or better anymore, was he? No one was going to listen tohim anymore, were they? But they still didn\u2019t listen to me, either.\u201d Brock looked at Jared with eyes full of hatred. \u201cThe others would have listened to me ifyou hadn\u2019t been there.I would have been the dominant male in the group if it hadn\u2019t been foryou . She would have trusted me.\u201d</p><p>Jared studied Brock. How could the strong man he\u2019d known on the journey become this whining boy? \u201cThe link with Garth,\u201d Jared said slowly. \u201cIt not only hid your true nature, it also helped you act as Garth would have acted, say what he would have said.\u201d</p><p>Brock nodded, his mouth curving in a sly, nasty smile. \u201cI\u2019m the one who thought of that after the Priestess put the compulsion spells around me that would make sure the Gray Lady bought me. Being brothers, it was easy to make a link that would meld our psychic scents so that the bitch-Queen couldn\u2019t separate one from the other. I even made him place the first couple of buttons, since no one paid any attention to the mind-damaged male. But he started fighting me, defying me. After a while, all I could do was keep enough of the link so that I wouldn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d</p><p>Hold it back, Jared told himself.Leash it. Save this rage for the fight ahead . \u201cYou brought them to Ranon\u2019s Wood. You brought these carrion-eaters from Hayll down on my people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf she\u2019d been captured at the ambush like she was supposed to, we wouldn\u2019t have come to your precious village at all. If anyone brought them here, it wasyou .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Jared said too quietly. \u201cGet away from my people. You belong with those Hayllian bastards.\u201d</p><p>Brock pouted. \u201cIf I\u2019d known she was going to give usreal freedom, it would have been different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>The pout twisted back to nastiness. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, Jared. All of you are going to die, and all the words in the Realm aren\u2019t going to change that.\u201d Brock bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cMaybe once the High Priestess is done playing with Lia, they\u2019ll let me have her for a while. I\u2019d like to take a long, hard ride between her thighs.\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his fists and his teeth.</p> <p>Hold it back. Keep it leashed. Striking out now would bring the Hayllians in faster, and Thera and Lia needed as much time as they could get to prepare this Queen\u2019s gamble.</p><p>Looking a little disappointed at getting no reaction from Jared, Brock raised his hand in a mocking salute. Then he flinched and put a hand to his head.</p><p>\u201cHave to answer,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cHave to ... summoned.\u201d He turned and continued down the road to the landing place at a fast walk.</p><p>By the time Jared got back to the tavern, Thayne had taken the children away\u2014but Garth had returned.</p><p>Blaed and Talon held Randolf back while the guard snarled threats and obscenities at the large man standing on one side of the room.</p><p>\u201cDamn you. Jared,\u201d Randolf shouted. \u201cTell them to let me go. Let me get rid of the bastard before he does any more harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already gone.\u201d Jared said fiercely. \u201cIt was Brock, Randolf. All the time, it was Brock. His Queen sold him into slavery.He sold himself to Hayll.\u201d Weary, Jared rubbed his hands over his face. \u201cYou had the wrong man, but you were also right\u2014Hayll\u2019s petis tainted.\u201d</p><p>Looking past Jared, Randolf studied Garth as if seeing him for the first time. \u2018\u201cHe was a guard.\u201d</p> <p>A fierce intelligence filled Garth\u2019s pale blue eyes. A huge fist thumped the large chest. \u201cMmmaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a Master of the Guard.\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Randolf swore, but there was pain, not violence, in the words. \u201cTo do that to a Master . . .\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not waste time,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to help Lia and Thera plan a defense against\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared\u2014\u201d Talon warned.</p><p>Before Jared could turn, Garth\u2019s hand landed on his shoulder hard enough to make his knees buckle.</p><p>\u201cLllisten to Queen,\u201d Garth said, giving Jared a little shake. \u201cQueen sssmart. Confuses mmmales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfusing us is helpful?\u201d Talon asked dryly.</p><p>Garth waved his other hand. Blaed prudently ducked.</p><p>\u201cHayll. All mmmales out there. Confuse mmmales here. Confuse mmmales there.\u201d Garth gave them all a deadly smile. \u201cConfuse Brock always. Sssmart Queen. You lllisten.\u201d</p><p>Giving Jared a friendly whump on the back that tumbled him into Talon and Randolf, Garth left the room.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Talon said after a moment, \u201che\u2019s got a point.</p><p>It\u2019s damn hard to block someone\u2019s moves if you can\u2019t figure out how she thinks.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared replied thoughtfully. Something Brock had said about links and psychic scents and Jewels kept teasing him, but its significance stayed just out of reach. \u201cLet\u2019s find out a little more about this Queen\u2019s gamble our Ladies are planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it confuses us?\u201d Blaed said with a hint of a smile.</p><p>Something. Something. \u201cEspecially if it confuses us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Krelis leaned back against the table, crossed his feet at the ankles, and studied the surly man before him. \u201cYou disappointed me, Brock. You didn\u2019t live up to your side of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Brock replied belligerently. \u201cI did what I agreed to do. Wasn\u2019tmy fault there were problems that evenyou didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201d</p><p>Krelis crossed his arms to keep his hand away from his knife. \u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d</p><p>When Brock took a step toward Krelis, two Opal-Jeweled Hayllian guards grabbed his arms and hauled him back.</p><p>Brock struggled uselessly for a moment.</p><p>Krelis caught a whiff of fear and found himself aroused by it. \u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA broken Black Widow who wasn\u2019t broken,\u201d Brock said, pouting. \u201cA Warlord Prince who\u2019d disguised what he was until we were well into the journey. Garth still having brains enough to figure out what the buttons were for and picking them up after I\u2019d left them for the marauders to find. That damn Red-Jeweled nonman deciding to play Queen\u2019s stud. You can\u2019t blame me for any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Krelis said. \u201cBut the fact is your inability to perform your task greatly inconvenienced the High Priestess\u2014and there are penalties for inconveniencing the High Priestess of Hayll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my part,\u201d Brock insisted, trying to shake off the guards. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the little bitch-Queen now.\u201d</p><p>Krelis looked at the other four guards who had quietly entered the room. At his nod, the guards restraining Brock tightened their hold.</p><p>\u201cBut the inconvenience, Brock.\u201d Krelis shook his head. \u201cSome compensation has to be made for the inconvenience.\u201d Smiling, he withdrew the large white feather from his leather vest and unsheathed his knife. \u201cI have one more small task for you, and then our bargain will be complete.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a psychic web,\u201d Lia said in a voice that had all emotion washed out of it.</p><p>Jared glanced at the other men crowded into the tavern\u2019s back room. Blank faces. Confused eyes. Talon rubbed the back of his neck and frowned at the chalk circle Lia had drawn on the table. Blaed looked at the ceiling, his eyes filled with wry humor.</p><p>Since Garth was the only one nodding as if that statement made sense, Jared wondered if he\u2019d feel less confused if he banged his head against the table a few times.</p><p>Then he looked at Lia, and the trickle of amusement faded.</p><p>The Queen and the Black Widow who sat across from each other were suddenly strangers to him, filled with a wild unknown. There was something dangerous about the way they sat so still, so quiet.</p><p>\u201cJared, since you wear the darkest Jewel, you\u2019re going to be the web\u2019s focal point,\u201d Lia said.</p><p>Great. Wonderful.Mother Night .</p><p>Jared shifted uneasily. \u201cWhat\u2019s it supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will give the weakest of you the protection of the strongest,\u201d Thera said in that voice that made all the men shiver. \u201cThrough the strands of the web, all of you will be connected. A strike against any one of you will be absorbed by all of you. The Red Jewel will feed the web and keep it strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds fine as a defense,\u201d Talon said, \u201cbut Jared won\u2019t be able to hold it long if they start unleashing their own Jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want Lia alive,\u201d Thera said, staring at the circle drawn on the table. \u201cThey won\u2019t risk a full attack until they have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if they do nothing, he still can\u2019t hold it forever,\u201d Talon argued. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not going to get bored and just go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Lia said. \u201cOnce the signal\u2019s given, he only has to hold it for ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Only.</p><p>Jared wanted to laugh, but he was very afraid it would come out sounding hysterical. Didn\u2019t they realize how many Hayllians were surrounding Ranon\u2019s Wood?</p><p>Thera slashed a look in his direction\u2014as if she\u2019d heard the laughter. \u201cYou held Red shields against the marauders for that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t as many of them,\u201d Jared said testily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thera shrugged. \u201cThey were fighting, always draining the shields. The Hayllians won\u2019t be attacking with any strength. Alive, Lia is a valuable hostage. If they\u2019d wanted her destroyed, the village and everyone in it would be gone by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the Hayllians start to advance, everyone wearing the Jewels will provide a token resistance, gradually retreating toward the Coaches,\u201d Lia said. \u201cJared will remain here in the tavern, where he can watch the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d Jared began.</p><p>\u201cYour task is to defend,\u201d Lia said sharply.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Randolf said, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to achieve anything. Gaining a few more minutes won\u2019t change the outcome of the battle.\u201d</p><p>Thera\u2019s eyes were ice with a hint of green. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, Warlord. You just have to obey.\u201d</p><p>After silencing Randolf with a searing look, Talon fixed his gaze on Lia. \u201cWith respect, Lady, I say again\u2014this web you and Lady Thera devised is an admirable protection, but it won\u2019t get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>Lia raised her chin. \u201cYes, it will.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Jared raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>They said nothing.</p><p>Seeing his own hurt mirrored in Blaed\u2019s eyes, Jared pushed aside bruised feelings.</p><p>Blind trust. In the end, it always came down to blind trust because it was the ultimate test of the bond between a Queen and the males who serve her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to start,\u201d Thera said, rising.</p><p>Silent, all the men except Jared, Talon, and Blaed left the room. When Lia rose, the three men formed a triangle around the two women, Talon automatically taking the point while Blaed and Jared each flanked his own Lady.</p><p>\u201cPrince Talon, your presence is required,\u201d Lia said when they stepped outside. She moved out of earshot and waited for the Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince to join her.</p> <p>Jared\u2019s muscles quivered at the formal request. Before he could decide whether or not to insist on being part of that private conversation, Thera dragged him back inside the tavern.</p><p>She gave him a brittle smile that was probably meant to reassure him but, instead, turned his guts to water.</p><p>\u201cI need some of your blood,\u201d Thera said, holding up a small pewter cup. \u201cFor the web.\u201d</p><p>Power sang in the blood. Life sang in the blood.</p><p>And trust, like love, was one of the heart\u2019s songs.</p><p>Jared pushed up his sleeve and offered his wrist.</p><p>She was quick, gentle, and far more careful about healing the nick in his wrist than he would have been.</p><p>Giving him another brittle smile, Thera put the cover on the cup and dashed to the Coach she and Lia were using to prepare this Queen\u2019s gamble.</p> <p>Stepping outside again, Jared eased closer to where Lia and Talon were still standing.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Talon said grimly, \u201ca fast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you what I want from you,\u201d Lia replied. \u201cExactly what I want. Will you do it?\u201d</p><p>Jared eased closer. The fierce unhappiness in Talon\u2019s face made his heart beat strangely, as if it couldn\u2019t decide to pound until it burst or just fade until it stopped.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Talon.\u201d Lia gave Talon\u2019s hand an urgent squeeze.</p><p>Talon looked at their clasped hands. His fingers curled around hers. When he finally spoke, his voice was heavy. \u201cI swear by the Jewels and all that I am that I\u2019ll do exactly as you asked.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, Lia swiftly kissed Talon\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Then she noticed Jared and stepped back, blushing.</p><p>Still watching Lia, Talon\u2019s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. Then his attention shifted to Jared for a moment. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Lady, I have some preparations to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lia murmured.</p><p>As Talon walked past Jared, he muttered, \u201cMay the Darkness have mercy on me,\u201d and kept going until he reached his Warlords.</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d Jared said quietly, taking a couple of steps toward her.</p><p>Lia retreated. \u201cI\u2014I have to help Thera.\u201d</p><p>There were shadows under her eyes from lack of sleep. There were shadowsin her eyes, hiding so many things.</p><p>And there was thatsomething he should understand about Jewels and psychic links that was still teasingly just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cLia, what is the Queen\u2019s gamble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat it\u2019s always been.\u201d Lia licked her lips. \u201cThat the males she\u2019s assigned certain tasks to will perform those tasks exactly as requested. That they won\u2019t allow themselves to become distracted by whatever else is happening\u2014or whatever else theythink is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLia . . .\u201d</p><p>Her hand clamped on his forearm. \u201cJared, you must hold the web. Youmust . Everything depends on it.\u201d</p><p>Jared swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it.\u201d</p><p>What he saw in her eyes took his breath away.</p><p>Lia tried to smile. \u201cI have to help Thera.\u201d</p><p>When she tried to move away, he reached out and gathered her in his arms. \u201cOnce more,\u201d he whispered, lowering his head. \u201cJust once more.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her gently, deeply.</p><p>Confused, he released her and stepped back. \u201cGo help Thera.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched as she hurried away from him. There was a tartness to her psychic scent that shouldn\u2019t have been there. It didn\u2019t fit her. Wasn\u2019t likeher .</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>Putting that puzzle aside, Jared turned at the sound of Talon\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat did she ask of you?\u201d Jared demanded.</p><p>Talon gave him a considering look. \u201cYou know better than that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he knew better than to ask another male about a private request made by a Queen, but that didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to know the answer.</p><p>Talon looked around, as if to make sure there was no one near enough to overhear them. Moving closer, he said quietly, \u201cYou\u2019ve played chess with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this fit her pattern?\u201d</p><p>Fool, Jared thought.You should have thought of this yourself . He closed his eyes and pictured the game board. \u201cIf her stronger pieces aren\u2019t acting as the main defense, they\u2019re supporting minor pieces in an attack. She tends to pair strong pieces. A Warlord Prince with a Black Widow, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow appropriate,\u201d Talon murmured. \u201cWhat about the Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d Jared felt the blood drain out of his face. \u201cMother Night, Talon, what are they planning?\u201d</p><p>Talon shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to guess. Something or someone put a nasty edge on Thera\u2019s temper, and Lia\u2019s always had the kind of courage that scares a man right down to the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey work well together,\u201d Jared said as he stared at the street without really seeing it.</p><p>Talon, too, stared at the street. \u201cYes, I imagine they do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>An interesting way to spend an hour, Krelis thought as he picked up the discarded tunic and carefully cleaned his knife. A useful exercise.</p><p>Sheathing his knife, he studied his work. A crude effort compared to the High Priestess\u2019s, but he hadn\u2019t had the time nor the practice to equal her skills. At least, not yet.</p><p>Krelis smiled at his pet. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to fulfill the rest of our bargain.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>\u201cWarlord! Shalador Warlord!\u201d Krelis\u2019s Craft-enhanced voice thundered over Ranon\u2019s Wood. \u201cCome to the curve in the road, Warlord. There\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a couple of steps away from the Coach and stopped abruptly, surprised by Blaed\u2019s and Talon\u2019s hard, restraining hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Talon growled quietly.</p><p>\u201cWarlord! I want to show you something. No one will harm you.\u201d</p><p>Lia and Thera came out of the Coach. Both pairs of narrowed eyes stared in the direction of the landing place.</p><p>\u201cIs the little pleasure slave afraid to act like a man just once before he dies?\u201d Krelis\u2019s voice taunted.</p><p>Thera twitched a shoulder. \u201cThe web\u2019s ready. It\u2019s keyed to Jared. If anything happens to him, there\u2019s no time to make another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Jared said firmly.</p><p>Thera turned on him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to let a little cock-waving ruin everything we\u2019ve planned\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared cut her off. \u201cHe wants to show me something. I want him to keep his distance until this last game is ready to be played. If I don\u2019t go out, he\u2019ll come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared won\u2019t be going alone,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Before Jared could object, Talon leaned closer and quietly added, \u201cI know a few moves that would have you walking bowlegged for a month. So why don\u2019t you make the Ladies happy and graciously accept the escort?\u201d</p><p>Jared bared his teeth in a feral smile. \u201cTo please the Ladies.\u201d</p><p>Talon returned the smile. \u201cWe live to serve, Warlord.\u201d The unhappiness under the words kept Jared from arguing. If whatever Lia had asked of Talon went wrong, the man would welcome whatever the Hayllians did to him.</p><p>Knowing that, Jared rested a hand on Talon\u2019s shoulder, and said softly, \u201cWe live to serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to threaten me,\u201d Jared growled a few minutes later as he, Talon, Blaed, Randolf, and three of Talon\u2019s men walked to the curve in the road. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a child who needs his hand held.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not a child,\u201d Talon agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re just the only one of us who\u2019s essential to the Ladies\u2019 plan.\u201d</p><p>Unable to argue with that, Jared clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned thin-skinned whenever anyone mentions pleasure slaves,\u201d Talon continued. He grinned. \u201cA winter up in the mountains will give you a tougher hide. It\u2019s colder than Hell up there. Nothing like a cold night to knock some sense into a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said I was going with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jared grunted.</p><p>They came around the curve in the road.</p> <p>Jared took one more step before his legs froze.</p><p>Six Hayllians waited about two hundred yards down the road. One of them was a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord.</p><p>Jared managed one glance at them before his eyes focused on the mutilated thing that was walking unsteadily toward him.</p><p>Talon sucked air through his teeth and let it out in a slow hiss.</p><p>Blaed shuddered.</p> <p>Randolf whispered, \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>How could a man live when that much of him had been cut away? Jared wondered as his stomach twisted.</p><p>Halfway between the two groups of men, Brock raised his arms, his fingerless hands reaching, reaching.</p><p>\u201cWarlord!\u201d Krelis shouted. \u201cTake a good look, Warlord! If you don\u2019t bring the little Queen to the landing place in one hour, that\u2019s what every male in the village will look like before we\u2019re done. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness his uncle Yarek hadn\u2019t come with him, Jared thought. The next hour would be hard enough for the villagers without their knowing what would come at the end of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you like the feather, Warlord?\u201d Krelis taunted. \u201cEven a nonman should have something between his legs, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Talon said. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting time here.\u201d</p><p>Blaed\u2019s throat worked convulsively. \u201cWhat about Brock?\u201d</p><p>Snarling, Randolf raised his right hand. A bolt of power from his Purple Dusk ring struck Brock in the heart.</p><p>Brock jerked once, and then collapsed.</p><p>Randolf wiped the back of his hand over his mouth. \u201cNot even a bastard like Brock deserves to have that done to him.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t protest when Talon\u2019s men hurried him back to the village. He didn\u2019t argue about Talon, Blaed, and Randolf following after them, guarding their backs.</p><p>But he promised himself that, if Lia\u2019s plan failed, his people wouldn\u2019t suffer at the hands of that Hayllian bastard.</p><p>Even if he had to kill them himself.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>Krelis watched the retreating men and smiled. At first, he\u2019d felt disappointed that the Shalador Warlord hadn\u2019t had the balls to come alone. Now he was pleased that there had been other witnesses. Alone, the bastard could have denied what he\u2019d seen. But those other males . . .</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t take long for it to be whispered through the village. Once the males heard what was planned for them, they\u2019d hand over the Queen. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t try to buy a little mercy.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d bring the Shalador bastard back with him. It would cost a few men to drain the Warlord\u2019s power enough to smash through the inner barriers and contain him, but it would be worth the cost.</p><p>He\u2019d like to hand Lord Jared over to Dorothea. She would know just what to do with a male who\u2019d caused her so much inconvenience.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d even let him watch.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>Keeping his own fears and uncertainties locked away, Jared worked to send out a feeling of confidence to the villagers patiently waiting for Thera to add them to the psychic web she\u2019d created within a tangled web.</p><p>No one spoke. No one even whispered to the person behind them. No one dared be the one to break Thera\u2019s fierce concentration.</p><p>She pricked each villager\u2019s finger, placed one drop of blood on a specific thread of the web she\u2019d built, and then, using Craft, froze the blood in position so that the web began to look like a delicate silver necklace dotted with red beads.</p><p>Over and over again, moving swiftly as the minutes slipped away.</p><p>And each time she placed a drop of blood in its chosen place, Jared felt another mind added to the web. If he let his eyes unfocus, he could see it in his mind. But the web he saw with his inner vision didn\u2019t have drops of blood, it had little Jewel stars\u2014or clear beads for the Blood who weren\u2019t strong enough to wear the Jewels. Some he could still recognize by their Jewels\u2014Eryk and Corry, his uncle Yarek, Thayne\u2014but as more and more people were added, their psychic scents began to blur and blend together.</p><p>The Hayllians would sense something odd, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to find the source becauseeveryone would become the source.</p><p>Which was basically the same trick Dorothea had used to hide Brock from Lia.</p><p>As he took a moment to admire Thera\u2019s cunning, he also realized most of the Shalador witches were wearing tunics and trousers and had loosely braided their dark hair.</p><p>His pride in his people swelled at their courage.</p><p>Without being able to separate one psychic scent from another, there was no easy way to tell what Jewel each witch wore, and if the Hayllians didn\u2019t get a good enough look to notice the golden skin, the witches could play \u201chide the Queen\u201d for hours\u2014or at least long enough to prevent the Hayllians from unleashing a full attack before everything was ready.</p><p>He estimated they had a quarter of an hour left when Blaed and Talon stepped up to the web, the last two to be added. Everyone else had dispersed to various points in the village.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Thera said, rolling her shoulders as she stepped back from the web. She took a couple of deep breaths. Then she detached the two bottom tether threads from the wooden frame. Holding the web by the top tether threads, she lifted it from the frame and looked at Jared. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Exchanging a puzzled look with Talon and Blaed, Jared stripped to the waist.</p><p>\u201cTake a breath and hold still,\u201d Thera said. \u201cThis is the safest way to protect it.\u201d</p><p>Still puzzled, Jared watched as she laid the web over his chest and belly. Then he felt the spidersilk threads and beads of blood melt into his skin. He gasped.</p><p>Thera studied his chest for a moment before nodding. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said with a knowing smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not stuck with everyone permanently. Once the power in the web is gone, the spidersilk and blood will pass back through your skin and fall off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get dressed now?\u201d Jared growled. He shivered, but it wasn\u2019t just because it was too cold to be standing around half-naked.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Lia said quietly as she joined them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Thera replied.</p><p>They turned toward the Coach.</p><p>Jared hastily pulled on his shirt. He wanted a minute with Lia while he had the chance.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Blaed said sharply. He pointed at Thera. \u201cYou and Lia aren\u2019t connected to the web.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared and Talon said in unison.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not part of the web. I waited until the end, but I got here when Thera added the first person.\u201d Blaed stared at the two women, his eyes filled with hurt and fury.</p><p>Lia studied the three men. She took a deep breath. \u201cThera and I can\u2019t be part of the web.\u201d She held up a hand to stop their protests. \u201cWe can\u2019t be. But I swear to you, we\u2019re well protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Thera said. \u201cWe have to take care of the last of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat last?\u201d Jared demanded, taking a step toward them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention anything else.\u201d</p><p>Lia\u2019s eyes stopped him from taking another step.</p><p>The three men watched Thera and Lia hurry to the Coach.</p><p>Jared pressed his hand against his chest. He wanted to rub the area over his heart to try to ease the deep, growing ache, but he was afraid he might damage the web.</p><p>Talon nudged Blaed. \u201cLet\u2019s get into position.\u201d He started up the street, then turned back. \u201cJared? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Jared lowered his hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, he stood alone in the street. Everyone else was hidden. The Coach\u2019s door remained closed. A few minutes from now, Krelis would realize they weren\u2019t going to hand Lia over to him, and the battle would begin.</p><p>Too late, Jared thought as he walked to the tavern, where he would remain hidden until the very end. He should have told Lia while he had the chance, should have let her know how much she meant to him. The regret he felt about not being able to talk to Reyna should have taught him not to wait to say what was in his heart. But shame for the way he\u2019d lived for the past nine years had prevented him from saying three important words to Lia.</p><p>And now it was too late.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Krelis slid his knife in and out of its sheath. He liked the rhythm.</p><p>Almost time to teach that Shalador bastard what happens to anyone foolish enough to defy Hayll.</p><p>The knife slipped in and out, faster and faster.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d have the Black Widow bitch\u2019s legs tied apart and let her compare the rhythm of both of his knives.</p><p>She\u2019d scream. Oh, how she\u2019d scream.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d make the little bitch-Queen watch.</p><p>What did it matter that no one, including the Priestess he served, thought he was an honorable man anymore? He had something better than honor now.</p><p>He had power.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>From his position at the tavern window, Jared saw Thera slip out of the Coach and dash for the nearest building.</p><p>What was she doing? he wondered as he watched her dart from building to building, moving up the street. If she had further instructions for Talon, why didn\u2019t she send them on a psychic thread?</p><p>He shifted position to keep her in sight. Why was she heading east? The only things in that direction were the dance ring and the Sanctuary. She couldn\u2019t reach either of those without trying to slip past the Hayllians. Even Thera wouldn\u2019t be that foolish.</p><p>And why had she left Lia alone?</p><p>He looked in the other direction. He could just see the closed door of the Coach Thera and Lia had been using.</p><p>Jared hesitated a moment, then stepped outside. He looked east.</p><p>Thera had vanished.</p><p>He looked at the Coach.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be out here. But surely they had a minute left, didn\u2019t they? A minute to check on Lia, make sure she was all right. A minute to silently tell her what he wouldn\u2019t say out loud now because he didn\u2019t want to distract her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a step toward the Coach.</p><p>\u201cWarlord!\u201d Krelis\u2019s Craft-enhanced voice thundered. \u201cYour time\u2019s up, Warlord!\u201d</p><p>Jared looked longingly at the Coach before retreating into the tavern. He took a deep breath, let it out slowly. Took another. Following Thera\u2019s terse, final instructions, he began to fill the psychic web with his Red strength. Slow and steady. No pulses of power that could overwhelm the non-Jeweled Blood in the web. Slow and steady.</p> <p>Randolf. Blaed. Talon.</p><p>He used them as touchstones because they had been the last three added to the web and he could still recognize them. He used them because feeling Talon strongly through the web let him know the web was fully engaged.</p><p>They were as ready as they could be.</p><p>Any Hayllians coming up from the landing place would have to pass the Coaches, would have to pass by him.</p><p>Jared bared his teeth. \u201cCome on, bastard. Let the battle begin.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>Hearing Lord Krelis\u2019s voice thunder over the village, one of the Hayllian guards who was watching the east end of the village rubbed his hands in anticipation.</p><p>Now Hayll would teach another of these inferior races what it meant to be Blood. Now he\u2019d have a chance to bring himself to Lord Krelis\u2019s\u2014and the High Priestess\u2019s\u2014 notice.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d even have a chance to show one or two of these Shalador bitches what it was like to be mounted by areal man.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at the slope that led down into that dirt circle. His grin faded. He shuddered.</p><p>What had they used that circle for? Some kind of witches\u2019 celebration? Some bestial rite that the males feared?</p> <p>He\u2019d thought of exploring that circle, maybe even dropping his pants and taking a squat to defile it. But when he\u2019d reached the top of the slope, he\u2019d hit a wall of cold air that made him certain that any male who walked through it would end up with shriveled balls and a permanently limp cock.</p><p>So he was here, at the bottom of the slope, waiting for the signal to move forward. The bloodletting would have to wait. The commanders had been very firm about that. Full psychic shields to protect themselves and controlled strikes to wear down the Jeweled Blood and drive them all to the center of the village.</p><p>However, once the little bitch-Queen was caught . . .</p><p>Something passed by him, a few yards to his left, and headed up the slope.</p><p>Immediately, he extended his psychic probe and started searching.</p><p>The answer that came back from that probe was more subtle than a thought:Nothing there .</p><p>Uncertain, he sharpened his probe. If any of the villagers managed to slip past the Hayllians surrounding this privy hole, it wasn\u2019t going to be nearhim .</p><p>For just a second, he thought he felt something, touched something.</p> <p>Something female. Something fiercely violent and powerful.</p><p>A cold fist settled against his lower back.</p><p>Then:Nothing there .</p><p>Shaking his head, he turned back to face the village.</p><p>When the order finally came, he moved forward eagerly.</p><p>That damn circle was making him jump at shadows, was making him feel odd things, hear odd things.</p><p>Because, for just a moment, he could have sworn he heard drums.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth, squeezed his eyes shut, and concentrated on feeding his Red strength to the web.</p><p>Damn you, he thought when he felt Randolf take a hard strike.Tap the strength that\u2019s offered. Use it .</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t use it. He\u2019d realized that after the first couple of minutes. The males who had decided to be the main diversion would sip the strength he was providing to maintain their protective shields, but they were draining their own Jewels to strike at the Hayllians and keep the bastards from closing in too quickly.</p><p>With his inner vision, he could see the web, its spidersilk threads now colored a strong red from his Jewel. He could see the Jewel stars flare with each strike. They were all winking, constantly flaring and dimming as the fighting continued.</p><p>Another strike.</p><p>Another.</p><p>Talon\u2019s Sapphire Jewel star flared wildly for a moment.</p><p>Jared held his breath until it steadied.</p><p>How long could they hold out? What were Thera and Lia waiting for?</p><p>He wanted to be out there, fighting with his friends, his people.</p><p>The Silver Ring kept him chained inside the tavern.</p><p>A cold gust of wind rushed over his skin, the kind of wind that made the changing leaves sound like rattles. The kind that was always a prelude to a violent autumn storm.</p><p>Jared opened his eyes.</p><p>He was inside the tavern. He shouldn\u2019t be able to feel the wind. He was dressed. He certainly shouldn\u2019t be able to feel it on his skin.</p><p>Then he heard the drums.</p><p>The sound singed his blood and froze it at the same time.</p><p>Thesedrums weren\u2019t calling the males to the dance.These drums were calling the witches to war.</p><p>And they answered.</p><p>Through the web, he felt the temper of the fight change, felt it grow colder, more savage. Merciless.</p><p>He looked out the window, trying to focus on the point where the Hayllians at the landing place\u2014and Krelis\u2014 would enter the village.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t see any of those things. As the wind swept over his skin again, as his blood pounded to the rhythm of the drums, he saw the web with its bright beads. He saw a dark circle surrounding it, slowly constricting as the Hayllians advanced.</p><p>He saw another circle appear beyond the dark one. Light, dark. Silver, gold. It was all those things\u2014and it held all the answers if he could just stay quiet enough to hear them.</p><p>He raised his hand. Reached out to touch it.</p><p>A warning shout broke his concentration and the vision disappeared.</p><p>Jared tensed when he saw Randolf retreating up the road. The Warlord didn\u2019t even glance at the Coaches. Jared silently applauded that self-control. If they could draw the Hayllians far enough into the village, Lia still might be able to get away.</p><p>Moments later, several Hayllians appeared. One of them, a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord, wore the badge of a Master of the Guard.</p><p>Krelis looked around, then focused on the tavern, as if he could see, or at least sense, Jared standing inside. He smiled and gestured lazily.</p><p>Three Hayllian guards headed for the tavern.</p><p>The Coach door burst open.</p><p>Lia dodged the Hayllians\u2019 grabbing hands and raced up the street.</p><p>\u201cLia, no!\u201d Jared shouted. Desperate to protect her, he used Craft to blast the tavern door open.</p><p>That startled the Hayllians enough to buy her a couple of seconds.</p><p>\u201cLia!\u201d Jared shouted.</p><p>\u201cGo after her!\u201d Krelis roared.</p><p>Before any of them could move, a bolt of Sapphire power hit Lia in the belly. Her body burst, spraying blood and guts over the street. Her mouth opened in a silent scream as she flew backward.</p><p>Jared reached her first. He forgot the Hayllians. Forgot the web. Forgot his promise. Forgot everything but the woman lying on her back in the middle of the street.</p><p>\u201cLia.\u201d Jared dropped to his knees. One of his hands hovered over her ruined body. The other gently stroked her hair.</p><p>Hearing footsteps, Jared raised his head and bared his teeth.</p><p>Krelis stood a few yards away.</p><p>Jared saw no regret in those hard gold eyes. Disappointment and anger, yes, but not regret.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Lia said weakly.</p><p>Dismissing Krelis, Jared gave her all his attention. \u201cHush, Lia,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t try to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d she gasped. \u201cThe web. Nothing else matters but the web. Everything\u2019s keyed to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Lia.\u201d</p><p>Her hand flailed. Her fingers found his hair. Curled. Tightened. Yanked hard.</p><p>Jared grunted in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHold the web,\u201d Lia said in a voice that had an eerie quality to it.</p><p>Jared lowered his forehead until it touched hers. It didn\u2019t matter now. It was too late now. He wouldn\u2019t tell her that. But now, when they only had a few moments left, he would tell her something else.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lia,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember to say it when it counts,\u201d she replied tartly.</p><p>Stung by her tone of voice, Jared raised his head.</p><p>And watched gray eyes change to frosty green, watched the illusion of Lia\u2019s face disappear.</p><p>He felt something gathering, gathering. Heard a roaring.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The link between Garth and Brock had worked so well because Garth\u2019s Birthright Jewel was the same as Brock\u2019s Jewel of rank.</p><p>Like Lia\u2019s and Thera\u2019s.</p><p>Nowhe understood the tartness in Lia\u2019s psychic scent when he\u2019d kissed her, why she and Thera had stayed so close to each other, why Lia had tried to avoid physical contact as much as possible.</p><p>Thera had linked their psychic scents together to hide the fact that Lia . . .</p><p>The roaring grew louder.</p><p>Power gathered, gathered, gatheredbeneath the Red .</p><p>Everything keyed to him. Keyed to his blood.</p><p>He looked at Krelis and knew the Master of the Guard heard the roaring, too. Felt the power gathering.</p><p>He looked at Thera.</p><p>She bared her teeth in a smile that was pure malice. \u201cCheckmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night!\u201d Jared whimpered. He threw himself on top of Thera, pressed his face against her neck, and closed his eyes.</p><p>The inner part of the web was still a strong red color, but the outer threads had faded, the power had retreated.</p><p>How much time? Jared wondered as he began sending the Red back into the web. He\u2019d forgotten Lia\u2019s warning about ignoring what he thought was happening and letting himself get drawn into the trap she and Thera had laid for the Hayllians, letting himself get distracted from his task.</p><p>Steady. Steady. If he flooded the web with power, he might shatter the minds it was meant to protect. But if he wasn\u2019t in time, his carelessness would cost them the strongest.</p><p>The roaring got louder.</p><p>Almost had them all. Almost.</p><p>Louder.</p><p>Steady. Steady. There! He had Randolf. Blaed.Talon !</p><p>Unleashed in one wild, raw, uncontrolled blast, Lia\u2019s Gray strength hit his inner barriers hard enough to make him scream before it flowed around him and the psychic web keyed to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard men scream.</p><p>He heard sharp cracks, like tree limbs snapping.</p><p>He heard squelchy sounds, like overripe melons being dropped on a hard floor.</p> <p>With his inner vision, he saw the web glowing bright red in the eye of a violent gray storm. He saw the dark circle of Hayllian minds flare and flare and flare until it shattered. He saw that other circle change to solid Gray.</p><p>Gasping, he poured more strength into the web.</p><p>A circle of Gray to contain the storm of power. When the unleashed Gray hit that Gray wall, the backlash would be as bad as the initial strike.</p><p>The thought had barely formed when the backlash hit him. He held on, drawing everything he could out of his Red Jewels.</p><p>It would return to its source. Whatever wasn\u2019t absorbed as it roared through the Hayllians\u2019 minds and crashed against their Jewels would return to its source.</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful! Did Lia know enough to shield herself? She would be as vulnerable to the backlash as the rest of them.</p><p>The ground shook.</p><p>Wind howled through the streets of Ranon\u2019s Wood.</p><p>Lightning tore the sky apart.</p><p>He felt the land embrace the power of a Queen that was being fed into it as what was left of the Gray flooded back to its source.</p><p>And then he felt the silence.</p> <p>Thera punched his shoulder weakly. \u201cGetoff me. I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s head jerked. What had he been thinking of, lying on her like that? He rolled off her but immediately reached for her belly.</p><p>Nothing to do for her. Even a Healer as good as Reyna had been couldn\u2019t have helped her.</p><p>Groaning, Thera sat up. She looked over his shoulder. What color there had been in her face fled.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d she gasped before she got to her hands and knees, crawled a couple of feet away from him, and became violently sick.</p><p>Jared twisted around to see what had frightened her.</p><p>He recognized the badge worn by a Master of the Guard.</p><p>That was all he recognized.</p> <p>Too numb to look away, he stared at the torn, pulped mess.</p><p>It would have been all of them. Without the web protecting everyone connected to it ...</p><p>He shook his head, breaking the trance.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t think of it.Couldn\u2018t think of it.</p><p>Thera\u2019s continued retching brought him back to the immediate.</p><p>He crawled to her, slipping in the trail of intestines.</p><p>Gathering up the hair that had escaped the loose braid, he put one hand on her forehead to support her, closed his eyes, and tried with all sincerity to convince his stomach to stay put.</p><p>Then he frowned. How could she be retching when chunks of her stomach were strewn all over the road?</p><p>Thera finally sat back on her heels. \u201cShit,\u201d she said weakly, \u201cit smells.\u201d</p><p>She fumbled with the torn tunic, trying to widen the tear. \u201cHelp me get it off. It smells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThera . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>Swearing under his breath, Jared ripped the tunic in half.</p><p>Thera immediately swiped at the remaining guts and started tearing at the gauzy material wrapped around her middle.</p><p>Jared stared for a moment. He pushed her hands away and ripped the material. Tossing the gauze aside, he gingerly wiped her belly with a piece of her tunic.</p><p>No shattered bones. No torn flesh.</p><p>Jared leaned back. His hands curled into fists. \u201cYou sneaky little\u2014You tricked us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trickedthem ,\u201d Thera snapped. \u201cYouwere supposed to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to ignore it?\u201d Jared said mildly as anger started to heat his blood.</p><p>She eyed him. Grabbing the tunic, she scrubbed at her belly. \u201cWe figured you were going to be a little upset about this,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Even his teeth felt hot. \u201cUpset? I thought I saw Lia get ripped apart right in front of me, and you figured I\u2019d be alittle upset?\u201d He paused. Thought. Exploded. \u201cYOU IDIOT! Do you realize how lucky you were that whoever unleashed that Jewel didn\u2019t go for your heart or your brain?\u201d He shook her hard enough to make her squeal. \u201cYou could have been killed! Who\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to answer.</p><p>Talon strode down the street, stepping over Hayllian bodies, kicking pieces out of his way.</p><p>Did Talon even see them? Jared wondered as he leaped up to intercept the furious Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Lia, I did as you asked!\u201d Talon roared. \u201cA strike to the belly. Not even a fast, clean kill,but a strike to the belly !\u201d His eyes filled with tears. \u201cDamn you for cutting out my heart, I did as you asked!\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed Talon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt was a trick, Talon. This is Thera, and she\u2019s all right.It was a trick .\u201d</p><p>Talon made a slashing gesture with his hand. \u201cThen what\u2019s all that spewed in the street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPig guts,\u201d Thera muttered, scrubbing harder.</p><p>They stared at her.</p><p>She cringed.</p><p>Maybe it was mean-spirited, but after the scare she\u2019d given him, Jared relished being able to intimidate her.</p><p>\u201cPig guts?\u201d Talon said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cPig guts,\u201d Jared said, nodding slowly. \u201cWhen they butchered the pigs yesterday morning, our little Black Widow toddled away with two large buckets of offal.\u201d He smiled at Thera.</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>Talon\u2019s soft snarl grew to a roar. \u201cI should take you over my knee and wallop some consideration into you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the Hayllians surrounded the village, this was the only way we could win the fight,\u201d Thera said with a bit of her normal fire.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told us,\u201d Jared snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou would have yelled at us, and we didn\u2019t have time for that.\u201d</p><p>He and Talon did more than yell. With their arms locked around each other, Jared wasn\u2019t sure if he was holding Talon back or if Talon was holding him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you blaming just me?\u201d Thera wailed. \u201cI saw the warnings in the tangled web, but I\u2019m not the only one who planned this.\u201d</p><p>That stopped them cold.</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d Jared said softly. Releasing Talon, he turned in a slow circle and finally looked,really looked at what a Gray-Jeweled Queen could do.</p><p>\u201cShe mustn\u2019t see this,\u201d Talon said grimly. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had time to become comfortable with the power she carries inside her now. This could cripple her. Someday she\u2019ll have to unleash the Gray again, and if she won\u2019t because of this, it could cost Dena Nehele dearly.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned back to Thera and saw the exhaustion and how hard she was holding on to some emotional control. \u201cWhere?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe dance ring,\u201d Thera said wearily. \u201cShe\u2019s in the dance ring. We put a cold spell around it when we went for a walk the other day so that no one would want to go into it.\u201d</p><p>Jared ran.</p><p>He saw his uncle Yarek and Thayne and a few other villagers come out of the buildings and look around, dazed.</p><p>He heard Blaed shouting Thera\u2019s name.</p><p>He heard someone running behind him and knew it was Talon.</p><p>Please, he thought as he ran.Sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let her walk out of the dance ring and see this .</p><p>He leaped over a body and ran up the slope. He hit a wall of air cold enough to make his breath hitch, but it vanished as soon as he went through it.</p><p>Reaching the crest, he skidded to a stop.</p><p>Talon joined him, breathing hard.</p><p>Lia sat near the center of the ring, her legs spread wide, her hands clutching her chest.</p><p>\u201cLia,\u201d Jared breathed.</p><p>He rushed down to the dance ring and dropped to his knees between her legs. \u201cLia?\u201d Cautiously, he reached out to touch her but didn\u2019t quite dare. \u201cLia?\u201d</p><p>Her blank eyes stared at him.</p><p>Talon went down on one knee beside her.</p><p>Lia blinked. Blinked again.</p><p>Hesitantly, Jared rested his hand on her thigh. \u201cLia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt knocked me down,\u201d she said, pouting.</p><p>She sounded like a little girl whose best friend had snatched her favorite toy.</p><p>\u201cIt knocked me down,\u201d she said again. She lowered her hands.</p><p>Jared looked at the Gray Jewel smeared with blood. His blood. That\u2019s how she had keyed her Gray power to recognize the psychic web and not destroy everyone connected to it.</p><p>And the Blood shall sing to the Blood\u2014and through the blood. Thank the Darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d she pouted. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t knock me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the backlash, sweetheart,\u201d Talon said gently.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>*Did it damage her?* Jared asked on a spear thread.</p><p>Talon hesitated, then shook his head. *I think she\u2019s just dazed. Even with a Gray shield around her, she must have taken a vicious hit.*</p><p>Humming softly, Lia caressed the Jewel.</p><p>Jared could almost feel her fingers sliding over his skin.</p><p>When she looked up again, her eyes were no longer blank.</p><p>\u201cYour men?\u201d she asked Talon.</p><p>He turned his head toward the village, his attention focused inward. After a moment, he said, \u201cA couple of them were injured, but not seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour people?\u201d she asked Jared.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThera? Did all the Gray shields I made hold around Thera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey held just fine. She was brilliant. She scared the shit out of us. After that little performance, I think Blaed deserves a month of fussing without any objections.\u201d He glanced at Talon. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Talon said dryly.</p><p>Lia hesitated again. Longer this time. \u201cI killed them, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Talon finally replied.</p><p>Lia burst into tears.</p><p>Shifting position, Jared pulled her into his lap and rocked her.</p><p>The sobs ripping through her unnerved him.</p><p>\u201cLet her cry it out,\u201d Talon said, resting a hand on Lia\u2019s head. *I'll go back to the village and bring a couple of horses.* He grimaced. *If any of them survived. I know how to make a brew that will sedate her for several hours. I\u2019ll bring that, too.* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising slowly, Talon left the dance ring. When he reached the top of the slope, he turned back. *You did well. Warlord.*</p><p>Resting his cheek on Lia\u2019s head, Jared rocked her until her tears finally stopped. \u201cSo did you, Lady,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo did you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p> <p>Dena Nehele. From the rogue camp that protected the middle pass through the Tamanara Mountains, Jared looked at the rolling hills, the sweeping forests, the rivers and lakes. He saw the cultivated fields, the pastures dotted with animals, the villages and towns.</p><p>This high up in the mountains, the autumn air already held the taste of winter. The change came more slowly to the land below him.</p><p>To the south, the trees were still holding on to the green of late summer. But as his gaze swung to the north, the green gave way to golds, oranges, and reds.</p><p>A beautiful land. A healthy land. A thriving people.</p><p>Jared looked back at the Coaches. Lia was still inside, still sleeping off exhaustion and the brew Talon had made for her.</p> <p>It was better this way. During the hours it had taken to reach this camp, he\u2019d made his choice and believed it was the right one\u2014for both of them. But he felt grateful he wouldn\u2019t have to be the one to tell her. And he hoped with all that was in him that he wouldn\u2019t look back on this day and regret the decision.</p><p>After they finished the simple meal the camp had provided, the others would make the last leg of the journey. By sunset, they\u2019d be in Grayhaven, the town that took its name from Lia\u2019s family estate.</p><p>His uncle Yarek and the rest of the villagers would be all right. Shalador\u2019s seeds would thrive in Dena Nehele\u2019s soil.</p><p>What would the former slaves do? Most likely, Eryk and Corry would return home. Little Cathryn would remain, probably with Lia\u2019s family. So would Garth\u2014at least until a Black Widow helped untangle the rest of his mind. Randolf and Thayne might choose to return to their own people.</p><p>Blaed would not.</p><p>Like Thera, the young Warlord Prince had made his choice. He might send a message to his family, but he had chosen the land he would now call home\u2014and he had chosen the Queen he would serve.</p> <p>Jared blinked against the stinging in his eyes. Just the wind, he lied to himself.</p><p>But, sweet Darkness, he was going to miss those two.</p><p>They broke away from a group of villagers and joined him, almost on cue.</p><p>It was tempting\u2014and worthy of an \u201colder brother\u201d\u2014to tease Thera about leaning on a man, but it didn\u2019t seem fair to rile her and spoil Blaed\u2019s contentment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask a favor,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Blaed answered instantly.</p><p>Thera said nothing. Her eyes held a hint of anger.</p><p>\u201cMy youngest brother, Davin, now lives in one of the southern villages. I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d locate him and give him the two honey pear trees our mother planted for him.\u201d</p> <p>Blaed nodded cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThe ones meant for Janos . . .\u201d Grief for the boy he remembered jabbed at him. \u201cI\u2019d like you to have them. As a wedding gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even handfasted yet,\u201d Thera grumbled.</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cBut you will.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cThe ones she planted for me ... I want Lia to have them.\u201d</p><p>Tensing, Blaed\u2019s eyes flicked to the Coaches and back to Jared.</p><p>Thera just watched him. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>It was hard enough to tell Thera. He wasn\u2019t sure he would have survived telling Lia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Talon,\u201d he said, his voice suddenly husky.</p><p>\u201cThen what you said meant nothing?\u201d</p><p>This time, when tears stung his eyes, he didn\u2019t lie to himself. \u201cIt means everything.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Thera nodded. She stepped away from Blaed, put her hands on Jared\u2019s shoulders, and kissed his cheek. \u201cWhat should I tell Lia?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Hugging her, Jared pressed his cheek against hers and replied just as quietly, \u201cTell her I\u2019ll be back in the spring.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>Jared stepped off the landing place. The abandoned traveler\u2019s inn looked rougher than it had six months ago when he had brought Lia there to be healed. Yet the call that had been more subtle than a thought had come from there, as it had before.</p><p>He entered the inn. Coming farther into the room, he looked at the table tucked near the stairs, at the bottle of wine and the two glasses, at the beautiful, golden-eyed man who sat waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWill you join me for a drink, Lord Jared?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>Jared smiled. Unbuttoning his heavy winter coat, he approached the table. \u201cThank you. I will.\u201d</p><p>Daemon studied him for so long, Jared lifted a hand self-consciously to his hair. He\u2019d shaved off the beard that had kept his face warm through the cold mountain winter, but he\u2019d let his hair grow long enough to tie back and hadn\u2019t decided to cut it yet. His clothes, by even the kindest stretching of the truth, couldn\u2019t be called anything but sturdy and warm.</p><p>Compared to Daemon\u2019s sleek elegance, he felt like a grubby child.</p><p>And resented it.</p><p>Daemon\u2019s eyes filled with amusement.</p><p>Jared lowered his hand and sighed. Daemon knew, damn him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve shed your slave skin,\u201d Daemon said with quiet approval.</p><p>Jared sat down and poured a glass of wine for himself. It surprised him that the approval meant so much.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t that one of the reasons he had come?</p><p>Daemon toyed, with his wineglass. \u201cI\u2019m glad you responded. I expect I\u2019ll be kept on a short leash for quite some time, so it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d</p><p>Jared tensed. \u201cDorothea can\u2019t link you to what happened.\u201d Mother Night, he hoped not. He didn\u2019t want to think about what Daemon\u2019s life would be like if she did.</p><p>\u201cKrelis did.\u201d Daemon\u2019s mouth curved in a vicious smile. \u201cBut I doubt he mentioned our little discussion.\u201d He took a couple of swallows of wine. \u201cNo, she just wants to be sure I\u2019m held in a Territory closer to Hayll. She has enough problems right now. It seems no one\u2019s eager to be her new Master of the Guard. And the efforts to soften the Territories bordering those already under Hayll\u2019s control have been seriously undermined by the stories that have spread about how a young Queen and a handful of former slaves defended an entire village against Dorothea\u2019s Master of the Guard and five thousand Hayllian warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t that many,\u201d Jared mumbled.</p><p>Daemon shrugged. \u201cWell, you know how stories grow with the telling. Especially with a little help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut the ground out from under Dorothea in any way you can, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cIn every way I can,\u201d Daemon agreed solemnly. \u201cBut there\u2019s only so much I can do. And it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>Jared felt the sadness he\u2019d been fighting all winter well up inside him. \u201cDena Nehele will fall, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot while a Gray-Jeweled Queen rules there. Not while the strongest and the best serve her and remain vigilant against Hayll\u2019s subtle cultural poisoning. But, yes, eventually Dena Nehele will live in Hayll\u2019s shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all our efforts are pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jared, they\u2019re not. Even in the most rotted Territories, there are still overlooked places where the Blood remember what it means to be Blood, what it means to honor the Darkness. Where males remember what it means to serve and witches remember that the bargain isn\u2019t one-sided. Those who remember may lose control of their lands, may have to live careful, hidden lives, but they must survive in order to restore their people when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen what time comes?\u201d Jared asked, sitting forward.</p><p>Daemon hesitated. \u201cWhen a Queen far more powerful than Dorothea can imagine walks the Realm. She\u2019s coming. That much I know. That much I was promised,\u201d he added quietly.</p><p>They drank in silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201d Jared finally asked.</p><p>\u201cTo say good-bye. And to tell you not to be a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jared waited. Hoped. All the talks he and Talon had had during the long winter nights hadn\u2019t eased his doubts because Talon didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to be a pleasure slave. But if there was anyone who could understand how deeply that kind of slavery wounded a man, it was Daemon Sadi.</p><p>\u201cThere are many shades and flavors of love, Jared,\u201d Daemon said quietly. \u201cNot all of them have the richness and the depth to be Gold. You have a chance at something many men only dream of. Don\u2019t let the Gold slip through your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Jared carefully refilled their glasses. \u201cIs it fair to hinder a strong Queen with a Consort who has a degrading past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it fair to deny the woman a man who loves her with everything that\u2019s in him?\u201d Daemon countered.</p><p>\u201cI was a pleasure slave for nine years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine years,\u201d Daemon snarled impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s nine years compared tocenturies ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldyou ask a Queen to accept you as her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Jared sat back, awed and a little frightened by the terrible yearning that filled Daemon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou love someone,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWho?\u201d He bit his tongue, instantly regretting the question.</p><p>Daemon\u2019s smile was gentle and a little self-mocking. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She hasn\u2019t been born yet. But I\u2019ve loved, and served, her all my life. I\u2019ll love no other. And I\u2019ll serve no other willingly.\u201d Reaching across the table, he laid his hand over Jared\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Gold slip away, Jared. Don\u2019t spend the rest of your life regretting that you didn\u2019t take the risk.\u201d</p><p>Daemon drained his glass and rose. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>Jared stood, too. There were so many things he wanted to say, but words weren\u2019t enough. Taking a deep breath, he gripped Daemon\u2019s shoulders, opened his inner barriers, and let his feelings flow through his hands\u2014his gratitude, his friendship, and the sincere hope that Daemon would someday find his Lady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A little embarrassed, he stepped back. \u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Prince Sadi.\u201d</p><p>Daemon cupped Jared\u2019s face in his hands and kissed him softly on the mouth. \u201cAnd you, Lord Jared. And you.\u201d</p><p>Jared remained long after Daemon had gone. He picked up his glass, then set it down untouched.</p> <p>Taking one last look around, Jared left the traveler\u2019s inn.</p><p>It was time to go to Grayhaven.</p><p>It was time to take the risk.</p><p>Chapter Forty-two</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Jared called. He urged the bay gelding closer to the kneeling woman and bit back his impatience. He\u2019d spent the past hour wandering around the Grayhaven estate, following the vague directions he\u2019d been given. Lady Lia, he\u2019d been told, was out gathering a few plants. Just follow the path there and he\u2019d come to her by and by.</p> <p>He\u2019d followed that path and several offshoots. Every person he\u2019d seen along the way had cheerfully pointed him in a different direction.</p><p>Well, the woman who hadn\u2019t answered him seemed intent on the same task so, hopefully, he was getting closer. Maybe she was a servant who had accompanied Lia. A lower servant, he decided, raking his eyes over the shabby clothes and the wide-brimmed straw hat that looked as if it had been run over by a couple of heavy wagons.</p><p>\u201cIf I could have a moment of your time.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire, any servant accompanying a Queen should dress better\u2014</p><p>The woman stood, pulled off her hat, and turned around.</p><p>Jared stared at the flowing gray hair, at the gray eyes, at the Gray Jewel hanging from the gold chain around her neck.</p><p>Dismounting, he said meekly, \u201cI beg your pardon, Lady. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you.\u201d</p> <p>The air around him chilled. The gelding snorted, and backed away as far as it could.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Lord Jared,\u201d Grizelle said coldly.</p><p>Jared swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Warlord whose courage and honor helped a young Queen survive a dangerous journey.\u201d Grizelle\u2019s voice became knife-sharp. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the ass who made my granddaughter cry.\u201d</p><p>Jared hunched his shoulders, but his heart leaped in hope. He kept his eyes focused on the ground between them. \u201cI needed time, Lady. I needed to shed my slave skin.\u201d He glanced up.</p><p>Grizelle studied him from head to toe. \u201cIt seems you succeeded.\u201d</p><p>There was no softening in her expression or her voice.</p><p>Jared felt a shiver start in the soles of his feet and work its way up his body. This was the Gray Lady, who was still the Queen of Dena Nehele and who could banish him from her Territory.</p> <p>And this was the family matriarch who would decide if he could even try for the future he hoped for.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Warlord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Jared took a deep breath. \u201cI came to see Lia.\u201d</p><p>Grizelle narrowed her eyes. \u201cAre you planning to leave again and add a few new bruises to an aching heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He forced himself to meet her eyes. Better to know now before he hoped too much. \u201cI was a pleasure slave, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Grizelle\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cOh?\u201d she said mildly. \u201cI gather that means you know how to keep a bed warm on a cold winter night.\u201d</p><p>Jared opened his mouth. When his tongue started to dry out, he closed it.</p><p>Grizelle tipped her head to one side and eyed him curiously. \u201cIt\u2019s very tempting to ask you to recite your qualifications as a consort, but I\u2019ve noticed that young men can be rather prudish about discussing their sexual skills. They either look like they\u2019re about to faint or they start babbling nonsense. Fortunately, Harland is mature enough to be more forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>Afraid his legs would buckle, Jared locked his knees.</p><p>Fainting sounded like a very good idea right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not this shy with Lia, are you?\u201d Grizelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2014\u201d Jared clamped his teeth together. In another minute, he\u2019d start babbling. He knew it. He raked his hand through his hair, pulling it out of the leather thong. \u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d he muttered, stuffing the thong into his coat pocket. \u201cFacing the Hayllians was easier.\u201d</p><p>Grizelle laughed. \u201cYes, I suppose it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran!\u201d</p><p>Jared spun around at the sound of Lia\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cGran, I\u2019ve got everything . . .\u201d</p><p>Lia came over the top of a slight rise and saw him.</p><p>A wave of joy, filled with her psychic scent, washed over him, quickly followed by uncertainty.</p><p>She was wearing trousers, muddy boots, and the too-large sweater she\u2019d gotten at the traveler\u2019s inn.</p><p>His heart ached because he didn\u2019t see a young Gray-Jeweled Queen who most people now would treat with cautious respect. He saw Lia.</p><p>\u201cI have one question for you, Warlord, and I want an honest answer,\u201d Grizelle said quietly, as Lia started down the rise.</p><p>It took all of his self-discipline to take his eyes off Lia and face the Gray Lady.</p><p>\u201cIf you come back into her life, what Ring will you wear?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise him that a Queen like Grizelle would know about the Invisible Ring.</p><p>He wished he\u2019d been there when Lia had found out that the Ring she\u2019d insisted she\u2019d made up to fool the guards at Raej really existed.</p><p>Lia.</p><p>He turned to watch her walk hesitantly toward them.</p><p>\u201cWarlord? What Ring do you wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gold, Lady,\u201d Jared said softly. Lia was close enough that he could see the hope\u2014and the love\u2014shining in her eyes. \u201cI wear the Gold.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
