People I loved and people I hated.</p><p>But there was only one person I loved to hate.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I heard a whiny female voice ask as I rounded the hall to sophomore P.E.</p><p>I immediately halted, locking eyes on a red-faced Tatum Brandt as she faced off with my douchebag stepbrother, Madoc Caruthers, and his friend Jared Trent. They stood in the hallway next to the lockers with flat expressions, looking bored, while she clutched her backpack straps for security.</p><p>\u201cYou barked at me yesterday,\u201d she continued, pinching her eyebrows together at Jared as Madoc smirked from behind him. \u201cAnd then all of your friends followed along. It\u2019s been forever, Jared. When are you going to stop? Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a long breath and completed my usual awesome combination of eye-roll-head-shake.</p><p>I really hated turning corners. I hated closed doors. I hated not seeing the path ahead.</p> <p>Corner #1: Your dad and I are getting divorced.</p><p>Corner #2: We\u2019re moving. Again.</p><p>Corner #3: I\u2019m getting married. Again.</p><p>Corner #952: I don\u2019t really like you or my husband or his son, so I\u2019m going to take fifteen vacations a year by myself!</p><p>Okay, my mom never really said that, but I\u2019m damn good at interpreting shit. And corners sucked.</p><p>I hung back and stuck my hands into the pockets of my skinny jeans, waiting to see what this girl would do. Would she finally grow some balls, or at least take the little ones these idiots had? I kept hoping she would step up to the challenge, and she always disappointed me.</p> <p>Tatum Brandt was a wimp.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know much about her. Only that everyone called her Tate, except Madoc and Jared; she was a rocker on the outside, but played it safe on the inside; and she was pretty. Like cheerleader pretty.</p><p>Long blond hair? Totally.</p><p>Big blue eyes? Absolutely.</p><p>Long legs, full lips, and big boobs? Even at sixteen.</p><p>She was the perfect package, and if I were my stepbrother, I wouldn\u2019t have any problem sticking my tongue into her mouth. Hell, I might do it anyway.</p><p>I chewed the corner of my lip, thinking about it. Yeah, I could be a lesbian. Maybe. If I wanted.</p><p>No, never mind.</p> <p>The point is . . . why Madoc and Jared tormented her rather than tried to date her was a mystery to me.</p><p>But for some reason I was interested. From the start of freshman year, they had both bullied her. They spread rumors, harassed her, and did everything they could to make her unhappy. They pushed, and she retreated time and again. It was starting to piss me off so much that I was about to go knock their heads together to defend her.</p><p>Except I barely knew her. And Tatum didn\u2019t know me at all. I stayed so far off the radar that sonar couldn\u2019t pick me up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jared answered her question with a question and jutted into her space with a cocky swagger. \u201cBecause you stink, Tatum.\u201d He scrunched up his nose in mock disgust. \u201cYou smell . . . like a dog.\u201d</p><p>Tate straightened immediately, and the tears in her eyes finally spilled over.</p><p>Kick him in the balls, bitch!</p><p>Exhaling a furious breath, I pushed my glasses back up the bridge of my nose. It\u2019s what I did before I braced myself.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even remember what today is, do you?\u201d She folded her trembling lips between her teeth and looked down at the ground.</p><p>And without even seeing her eyes, I knew what was there. Despair. Loss. Loneliness.</p><p>Without looking at him again, she turned around and walked off.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easy to hit him. To toss an insult back at him. And while I despised her weakness, I understood one thing that I hadn\u2019t before. Jared was an ass, but he was an ass who could hurt her.</p><p>She was in love with him.</p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I walked over to the lockers where Jared and Madoc stood staring after Tate.</p><p>Madoc spoke up behind him. \u201cWhat did that mean? What\u2019s today?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged off the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she was talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s April fourteenth,\u201d I piped up over Madoc\u2019s shoulder, causing him to spin around. \u201cThat mean anything to you, Shit-for-Brains?\u201d I directed at Jared.</p><p>Madoc raised a dark blond eyebrow at me, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Jared twisted his head only enough so that I could see the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cApril fourteenth?\u201d he whispered and then blinked long and hard. \u201cShit,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>And Madoc reared back a hair as Jared slammed the palm of his hand into the nearest locker door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Madoc scowled.</p><p>Jared ran his hands down his face and then shook his head. \u201cNothing. Never mind,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to Geometry.\u201d Stuffing his fists into his pockets, he stalked off down the hall, leaving Madoc and me.</p><p>Between my stepbrother and his friend, I respected his friend more. They were both Grade A ass**les, but at least Jared didn\u2019t care what people thought of him. He stalked around like a weird cross between a jock and a goth. Popular and foreboding. Dark but extremely coveted.</p><p>Madoc, on the other hand, cared what everyone thought. Our parents. The principal. And most of the student body. He loved being loved, and he hated his association with me.</p><p>As sophomores they were already starting to wield power that was going to be out of control by the time they reached senior year.</p><p>\u201cWow, your friend is a loser,\u201d I teased, sliding my hands into the back pockets of my jeans.</p><p>Madoc zeroed in on me with his playful half-smile and relaxed eyes. \u201cSo are your frien\u2014\u201d he started, then stopped. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You don\u2019t have any friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need \u2019em,\u201d I shot back. \u201cI travel faster on my own. I\u2019m going places. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re going places. Just stop at the dry cleaners on your way, Fallon. I need my shirts picked up.\u201d He smoothed an arrogant hand over his navy Abercrombie button-down. With his medium-wash boot-cut jeans, black Paracord bracelet, and styled dark blond hair, Madoc dressed to impress. Girls flocked to him because he looked good in clothes, could talk the ears off an elephant, and loved to play. For all intents and purposes, he was a fun guy.</p><p>And he always made me feel small.</p><p>I talked a lot of shit, but truth be told, it was more for my ears than anyone else\u2019s. Madoc was designer. I was Target. He was Godiva. I was Snickers. And as far as he was concerned, he was entitled, and I was the freeloading daughter of the gold-digging whore who had snagged his father.</p><p>Madoc thought I was dirt under his shoe. Screw him.</p><p>I gave his outfit a condescending once-over. \u201cYour shirts\u2014which are super stylish, let me remind you. The g*y community would be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get nice things, too. My dad pays your mom enough for her services, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice things? Like the miniskirts you date?\u201d I challenged. Time to educate the little shit. \u201cMost guys, Madoc, like something different. You know why you want to see me in \u2018nice,\u2019 skimpy things? Because the more I show, the less I\u2019m hiding. I scare you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNada, little sister.\u201d</p><p>Little . . . I was only two months younger than him. He said shit like that to piss me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your little sister.\u201d I took a step forward. \u201cAnd I do have friends. And plenty of guys interested. They like how I look. I don\u2019t subscribe to you and our snotty parents\u2019 stand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m bored,\u201d he cut me off with a sigh. \u201cYour life doesn\u2019t interest me, Fallon. Holiday dinners and once in a while around the house. Those are the only times I want to run in to you.\u201d</p><p>I tipped my chin up, trying not to give anything away. It didn\u2019t hurt. Not his words or his opinion of me. There was no ache in my throat that dropped down into my stomach and twisted the ever-present knots tighter. What he said didn\u2019t matter. I liked who I was. No one told me how to dress, how to behave, what clubs to join . . . I made my own decisions. Madoc was a puppet. A drone.</p><p>I\u2019m free.</p><p>When I said nothing, he started walking backward away from me. \u201cThe parents are out for the night. I\u2019m having a party. Stay out of the way. Maybe hide out in the servants\u2019 quarters where you belong.\u201d</p><p>I watched him go, knowing I wouldn\u2019t listen.</p><p>I would wish that I had.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>MADOC</p><p>2 years later</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cCould she move any slower?\u201d I asked Jared as I sat in the backseat of his girlfriend\u2019s G8 with my hands locked on top of my head.</p><p>Tate twisted around in the driver\u2019s seat, her eyes sharp like she wanted to drive a knife right through my skull. \u201cI\u2019m heading around a sharp turn at nearly fifty miles an hour on an unstable dirt road!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even a real race. It\u2019s practice. I told you that already!\u201d Every muscle in her face was tight as she chewed me out.</p><p>I dropped my head back and let out a sigh. Jared sat in front of me with his elbow on the door and his head in his hand.</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon, a week before Tate\u2019s first real race at our local, makeshift track\u2014the Loop\u2014and we\u2019d been on Route Five for the last three hours. Every time the little twerp downshifted too soon or didn\u2019t hit the gas fast enough, Jared kept quiet\u2014but not me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt his girlfriend\u2019s feelings, but I didn\u2019t care. Why tiptoe around her? I wasn\u2019t trying to get in her pants.</p><p>Not anymore, anyway.</p><p>Tate and Jared had spent most of high school hating each other. Battling with words and antics in the longest-running game of foreplay I\u2019d ever seen. Now they were all up in each other\u2019s shit like Romeo and Juliet. The p**n o version.</p><p>Jared turned his head but not enough to meet my eyes. \u201cGet out,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blurted, my eyes widening. \u201cBut . . . but . . .\u201d I stuttered, catching sight of Tate\u2019s triumphant smile in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing,\u201d Jared barked. \u201cGo get your car. She can race you.\u201d</p><p>The zing of adrenaline shot through me at the prospect of some real excitement. Tate could definitely race a chick who had no idea what she was doing, but she still had a lot to learn and some balls to grow.</p><p>Enter me. I wanted to smile, but I didn\u2019t. Instead, I just rolled my eyes. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll be boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so funny,\u201d she mocked, gripping the steering wheel even tighter. \u201cYou make a great twelve-year-old girl when you whine.\u201d</p><p>I opened the back door. \u201cSpeaking of whining . . . want to make a bet on who\u2019ll be crying by the end of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed a package of travel tissues and threw them at me. \u201cHere. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see you keep a ready stock,\u201d I retorted. \u201cBecause you cry so much, right?\u201d</p><p>She jerked around. \u201cTais-toi! Je te d\u00e9tes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I interrupted her. \u201cWhat was that? I\u2019m hot, and you love me? Jared, did you know she had feelings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d he bellowed, shutting the both of us up. \u201cGoddamn it, you two.\u201d He threw his hands up in the air, looking between us like we were misbehaving children.</p><p>Tate and I were both silent for a moment. Then when she snorted, I couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh, too.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d Jared\u2019s teeth were practically glued together. I could hear the tension in his voice. \u201cOut. Now.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my cell off the seat and did as I was told, only because I knew my best friend had had enough.</p><p>I\u2019d been trying to bait Tate all day by making jokes and distracting Jared. She was finally racing a real opponent, and even though Jared and I had been working with her, we knew things went wrong out there on the track. All the time. But Tate insisted that she could handle it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what Tate wants, Tate gets. Jared was whipped worse than cream when it came to that girl.</p><p>I walked back down the track to the driveway leading in to it. My silver GTO sat along the side of the road, and I dug in my jeans for my keys with one hand while I ran the back of my hand across my forehead with the other.</p><p>It was early June, and everything was already so miserable. The heat wasn\u2019t bad, but the damn humidity made it worse. My mom had wanted me to come to New Orleans for the summer, and I gave her a big, fat hell-to-the-no.</p><p>Yeah, I love sweating my balls off while her new husband tries to teach me shrimping in the Gulf.</p> <p>Nope.</p><p>I loved my mom, but the idea of having the house to myself all summer while my dad stayed at his apartment in Chicago was, no doubt, a much better prospect.</p><p>My hand tingled with a vibration, and I looked down at my phone.</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d I asked my dad as I came up on the side of my car.</p> <p>\u201cMadoc. Glad you answered. Are you home?\u201d He sounded unusually concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was about to head there soon, though. Why?\u201d</p><p>My dad was hardly ever around. He kept an apartment in Chicago. since his big legal cases kept him working long hours. While often absent, he was easy to get along with.</p><p>I liked him. Didn\u2019t love him, though.</p><p>My stepmom had been AWOL for a year. Traveling, visiting friends. I hated her.</p><p>And I had a stepsister . . . somewhere.</p> <p>The only person I loved at home was Addie, our housekeeper. She made sure I ate my vegetables, and she signed my permission slips for school. She was my family.</p><p>\u201cAddie called this morning,\u201d he explained. \u201cFallon showed up today.\u201d My breath lodged in my throat, and I nearly dropped my phone.</p><p>Fallon?</p><p>Putting my palm down on the hood of my car, I put my head down and tried to stop grinding my teeth.</p><p>My stepsister was home. Why? Why now?</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I spat out. \u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddie packed you a bag.\u201d He ignored my question. \u201cI talked to Jared\u2019s mom, and you\u2019re going to stay with them for a few weeks until my schedule frees up. I\u2019ll come home then and get this sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Excuse me? It felt like the phone would crack under my fingers as I clenched it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d I yelled, breathing hard. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I stay at my own house?\u201d</p><p>Since when did she get the run of things? So she was home. Big deal! Send her on her way then. Why did I have to be sent away?</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d my dad answered, his deep tone threatening. \u201cDon\u2019t go home, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>And he hung up.</p><p>I stayed planted where I stood, studying the reflection of the trees on the hood of my car. I had been told to go to Jared\u2019s house, where Addie would bring me clothes, and not to go home until further notice.</p><p>And why?</p><p>I shut my eyes and shook my head. I knew why.</p><p>My stepsister was home, and our parents knew everything. Everything that happened two years ago.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t her home. It never was. It\u2019s been my home for eighteen years. She lived there for a while after our parents got married and then disappeared a couple of years ago.</p><p>I\u2019d woken up one morning, and she was gone. No good-bye, no note, and no communication since then. The parents knew where she was but not me. I wasn\u2019t allowed to know her whereabouts.</p><p>Not that I f**king cared anyway.</p><p>But I damn well wanted to be in my own house for the summer.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two hours later I was sitting in Jared\u2019s living room with his half brother, Jax, biding my time until their mom stopped watching us like a hawk. The more I sat, the more anxious I got to go find some distractions. Jared had a ton of liquor up in his room that I\u2019d brought over from my house, and it was time to start my Saturday night warm-up. Jax was slouched on the couch playing video games, and Jared had left to get tattooed.</p><p>\u201cThis is not how you handle it, Jason,\u201d I heard Katherine Trent whisper-yell from the kitchen.</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. Jason? That was my father\u2019s name.</p><p>She crossed the doorway as she paced, talking on the phone.</p><p>She calls my dad Jason? Not weird, I guess. That\u2019s his name. It just seemed weird. Not many people got away with calling my father by his first name. It was usually \u201cMr. Caruthers\u201d or \u201csir.\u201d</p><p>Getting up, I inched into the dining room, which sat right off the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThis is your son,\u201d I heard her say. \u201cYou need to come home and deal with this.\u201d I stuck my hands in my pockets and leaned back against the wall right by the door leading to the kitchen. She was quiet for a while except for the sounds of dishes clattering. She must\u2019ve been unloading the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cOne week. Tops. I love Madoc, but this is your family, and they need you. You\u2019re not getting off the hook. I already have two teenage boys. You know what they do when I try to impose a curfew? They laugh at me.\u201d I fought between smiling out of amusement and clenching my fists in irritation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want to help, but he needs you!\u201d Her whispers were futile. It was impossible to try to order my father around and be quiet about it.</p><p>I shot a look to Jax and noticed that he\u2019d stopped his video game and was watching me with a quirked eyebrow.</p><p>Shaking his head, he joked, \u201cI haven\u2019t obeyed a curfew in my entire life. She\u2019s cute about it, though. I love that woman.\u201d</p><p>Jax was Jared\u2019s half-brother. They had the same father but different mothers, and Jax had spent most of his life either with their sadistic dad or in foster homes. Late last fall, my father had helped Katherine get Jax out of foster care and into her home. Jared and Jax\u2019s father was in jail, and everyone wanted the brothers together.</p><p>Especially the brothers.</p><p>And now that Jared, who\u2019d been my best friend all through high school, had found his soul mate and love of his life, he wasn\u2019t around as much as he used to be. So Jax and I had grown closer.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I jerked my chin at him. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing a bottle from Jared\u2019s room, and then we\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cI want to see your biggest balls,\u201d I ordered in the deepest voice I could muster. My eyes were narrowed, and I had to press my teeth together to not laugh.</p><p>Tate\u2019s back straightened, and she slowly spun around with her chin down and eyes up. It reminded me of how my mother looked at me when I had pissed in the pool as a kid.</p><p>\u201cWow, I haven\u2019t heard that one before.\u201d She widened her eyes at me. \u201cWell, sir, we have some quite heavy ones, but they all take two fingers and a thumb. Are you that skilled?\u201d She had an expression on her face like we were talking about homework, but I could see the smile playing at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so skilled,\u201d I teased, my tongue suddenly too big for my mouth. \u201cYou\u2019d be jealous of what I could do to that ball.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and approached the counter. Tate had been working at the bowling alley since last fall. It was almost a court-ordered requirement that she get a job. Well, not quite. It probably would\u2019ve been court-ordered if Jared had pressed charges. This five-foot-seven, one-hundred-twenty-pound bit of nothing had taken a crowbar to her boyfriend\u2019s car in one of her famous violent fits. It was pretty nasty and pretty awesome. The video was on YouTube and had practically started a feminist movement. People did their own renditions of it and even put it to music. They titled it Who\u2019s the Boss Now?, since Jared\u2019s car was a Mustang Boss 302.</p><p>It was all a misunderstanding, though, and Tate paid for the damages. She grew up. Jared and I grew up. And we were all friends.</p><p>Of course, they were sleeping together. I got no such perks.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, have you been drinking?\u201d Tate put her palms on the counter and looked at me like a mom.</p><p>\u201cWhat a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>Of course I\u2019ve been drinking. It\u2019s like she didn\u2019t even know me.</p><p>Jerking her head up, she looked over to the lanes behind me, and I was afraid her big blue eyes would actually fall out of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou got Jax drunk, too!\u201d she accused, clearly pissed now.</p><p>I twisted around to see what she was looking at, stumbling when my foot got caught in the legs of the stool next to me. I let a holler rip from my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhooooo!\u201d I shouted, holding up the bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s in the air when I saw what Tate saw.</p><p>A crowd of people was gathered in front of one lane, laughing and watching Jax run and do slip and slides down a bowling path. \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d</p><p>The bottle was torn out of my fingers, and I turned to see Tate stuff it under the counter, pressing her angry lips together and scowling.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the whiskey gone?!\u201d I imitated Captain Jack Sparrow and pounded my fist on the counter.</p><p>Tate stomped down the aisle toward the door leading out to the lanes. \u201cYou\u2019re in deep shit when I get over this counter,\u201d she whisper-yelled at me.</p><p>\u201cYou love me. You know you do!\u201d I laughed and sprinted away through the maze of tables and chairs around the concession stand to where Jax played. A couple of other guys had joined in and flew down the lanes, much to the delight of the Saturday night crowd. At this hour, there weren\u2019t too many families out and about, and the only people not entertained were the single dudes who spent their older years lamenting their beer bellies and how lucky they were to escape marriage. They just watched and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cFallon\u2019s home. Don\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down the whiskey that kept creeping back up and threw my head back. \u201cWoohoo!\u201d I bellowed, before pounding down the light-colored hardwood floor, leaping onto the lane on my belly and sliding down the alleyway.</p><p>My heart pounded, and excitement bubbled in my chest. Holy shit! These lanes were crazy slippery, and I just laughed, not caring that Tate was pissed at me or that Jared\u2019s fist would leave a permanent mark on my face for messing around at his girlfriend\u2019s work. All I cared about was what got me from one moment to the next.</p><p>I can\u2019t go home.</p><p>The crowd cheered and yelled behind me, some of them jumping up and down. The only way I could tell was because I felt the vibrations under me. And when I rolled to a stop, my legs dangling into the next lane, I just lay there, wondering. Not about Fallon. Not even about whether I was too drunk to drive home at this point.</p><p>I wondered out loud, \u201cHow the hell am I going to get up?\u201d</p><p>These lanes were slippery. Duh. Couldn\u2019t stand up, or I\u2019d slip. Shit.</p><p>\u201cMadoc! Get up!\u201d I could hear Tate\u2019s bark from somewhere near me.</p><p>Madoc. Get up. The sun\u2019s up. You have to leave.</p><p>\u201cMadoc. Get. Up!\u201d Tate shouted again.</p><p>I snapped to. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I grunted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tate. You know I love you, right?\u201d I jerked to a sitting position with a hiccup. Then I looked up to see her walking on the median between the lanes.</p><p>Like a boss.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips, a stern set to her eyebrows. \u201cMadoc, I work here.\u201d</p><p>I winced, not liking the disappointment in her voice. I always craved Tate\u2019s respect.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe.\u201d I tried standing up, but I only slipped again, a deep ache settling on the side of my ass. \u201cI already said sorry, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She squatted down and wrapped her arms around one of mine, hauling me up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You never drink unless you\u2019re at a party.\u201d</p><p>I lodged one foot in the gutter and wobbled until Tate pulled me closer to her and I was able to set the other foot on the median.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d I gave a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m a joker, Tate. I\u2019m . . .\u201d I waved my hand in the air. \u201cJust a . . . joke\u2014a joker,\u201d I rushed to add. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She continued to hold me, but I could feel her fingers ease up underneath the hem of my short-sleeved T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, you\u2019re not a joke.\u201d Her eyes were serious again but softer this time.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what I am.</p><p>I held her eyes, wanting to tell her everything. Wanting my friend\u2014someone\u2014to see the real me. Jared and Jax were good friends, but guys didn\u2019t want to hear that shit, and we weren\u2019t that observant. Tate knew something was wrong, and I didn\u2019t know how to tell her. I just wanted her to know that underneath it all, I wasn\u2019t a good guy.</p> <p>\u201cI do stupid things, Tate. That\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m good at it.\u201d I reached up slowly and tucked the few stray hairs from her ponytail behind her ear, lowering my voice to a near whisper. \u201cMy father knows it. She knows it.\u201d I dropped my eyes and then looked back up. \u201cYou know it, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Only studied me, the wheels in her head turning.</p><p>My hand fell to her cheek, and I remembered all the times that she had reminded me of Fallon. I stroked Tate\u2019s cheek with my thumb, wishing she\u2019d yell at me. Wishing she didn\u2019t care about me. How much easier it would be to know that I didn\u2019t have anything real in my life.</p><p>I held her sweet, unknowing face and leaned in closer, smelling her barely-there perfume as I brought my lips closer.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d she asked, her voice confused as she watched me.</p> <p>Tilting my head down, I planted a soft kiss on her forehead and then leaned back slowly.</p><p>Her eyebrows were pinched together in worry as she stared at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Well, sometimes.</p><p>Okay, yes. Most of the time, I guess.</p><p>Just not at night.</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I took a deep breath and smiled. \u201cI hope you know that that didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d I joked. \u201cI mean, I love you. Just not like that. More like a sister.\u201d I burst into laughter and hunched over, barely finishing the sentence as I closed my eyes and held onto my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get the joke,\u201d Tate scolded.</p><p>A high-pitched whistle pierced the air, and Tate and I looked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d Jared\u2019s big and angry daddy voice ripped through the bowling alley, making my ears ache.</p><p>But as I turned around to face him, I accidentally stepped back onto the slippery lane.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d My breath caught as I slid, and I stupidly kept my weight on Tate, which was too much for her. Backward I fell and into my lap she stumbled. We slammed to the floor, hitting the wood hard. I\u2019d probably bruised every damn inch of my ass, but Tate was cool. She landed on me. That was cool for me, too.</p><p>But when I looked over at my best friend standing at the start of the lane, looking at us with murder in his eyes, I pushed Tate off me in disgust.</p><p>\u201cDude, she slipped me whiskey and tried to date-rape me!\u201d I pointed at Tate. \u201cShe keeps it under the counter. Go look!\u201d</p> <p>Tate growled and crawled back up to the median, her messy ponytail hanging by a prayer.</p><p>\u201cJax!\u201d Jared yelled to the lane at my right where Jax was crawling back up the lane. \u201cAnd you.\u201d Jared\u2019s eyes shot bullets at me. \u201cGet in my car now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooh, I think he wants to give you a spanking,\u201d I singsonged to Tate as she stomped down the median to her boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cShut up, doofus,\u201d she spat back.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>FALLON</p><p>\u201cWas that your first kiss?\u201d he asks, pulling his head back to look at me. I keep my gaze down and clutch the kitchen counter behind me. This feels wrong. He\u2019s pressing my back into the countertop, and I can\u2019t move. It hurts.</p><p>Just look at him, I will myself. Look up, you idiot! Tell him to back off. He doesn\u2019t see you. He\u2019s a user. He makes you feel dirty.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He grabs for my face, and I cringe. \u201cLet me show you how to use that tongue.\u201d</p><p>This feels wrong.</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d The soft, feathery voice broke through my dream. \u201cFallon, are you up?\u201d</p><p>I heard a knock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in,\u201d she announced.</p><p>I opened my eyes, blinking away the fog of sleep from my brain. I couldn\u2019t move. My head felt separated from my body, and my arms and legs were molded to the bed, as if a ten-ton weight sat on my back. My brain was active, but my body was still sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cFallon,\u201d a voice sang out to me. \u201cI made you poached eggs. Your favorite.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, curling my toes and clenching my fists to wake them up. \u201cWith toast to dip?\u201d I called from underneath my pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhite toast, because multigrain is for pussies,\u201d Addie deadpanned, and I remembered I\u2019d told her those very same words about four years ago when my mom married Jason Caruthers and we came to live here.</p><p>I kicked the covers off my legs and sat up, laughing. \u201cI missed you, girlfriend. You\u2019re one of the only people in the world I don\u2019t want to cut.\u201d</p><p>Addie, the housekeeper and someone who\u2019d acted more like a mother to me than my own, was also one of the only people that I didn\u2019t have hang-ups about.</p><p>She walked into the room, carefully maneuvering a tray full of all the things I hadn\u2019t eaten in years: poached eggs, croissants, freshly squeezed orange juice, a fruit salad with strawberries, blueberries and yogurt. And real butter!</p><p>Okay\u2014so I hadn\u2019t tasted it yet. But if I knew Addie, it was real.</p><p>As she set the tray over my legs, I tucked my hair behind my ears and grabbed my glasses off the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were too cool for hipster glasses,\u201d she reminded me.</p><p>I dipped a wedge of toast in egg yolk. \u201cTurns out I had a lot of opinions back then. Shit changes, Addie.\u201d I smirked at her happily as I took a bite, salivating more as the warm saltiness of the yolk and butter hit my tongue. \u201cBut apparently not your cooking! Damn, girl. I missed this.\u201d</p><p>Addie is far from a girl in looks but more so than anyone I know in personality. She\u2019s not only a valuable housekeeper, but she proved to be the lady of the manor that Mr. Caruthers needed. She took care of things the way my mother didn\u2019t. Of course, Addie and Mr. Caruthers weren\u2019t sleeping together. She was a good twenty years older than him. But . . . she took care of everything. The house, the grounds, his social calendar outside of work. She anticipated his needs, and she was the only person he\u2019d never fire. Seriously. She could call him a f**k-up, and he\u2019d just roll his eyes. She made herself invaluable, and because of it, she called the shots in this house.</p><p>She also took care of Madoc. That\u2019s why I needed her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I missed you,\u201d she replied, picking up my clothes from the floor.</p><p>I cut a piece of egg and put it on my toast. \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a woman now. I can clean up after myself.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been paying my own bills, but for all intents and purposes, I\u2019d been taking care of myself completely for two years. My mother had deposited me at boarding school, and my dad didn\u2019t micromanage. When I got sick, I dragged my ass to the doctor. When I needed clothes, I shopped. When it was laundry day, I studied next to the washing machines. No one told me which movies to see, how often to eat vegetables, or when to get my hair trimmed. I took care of it.</p><p>\u201cYou are a woman. A very beautiful one at that.\u201d She smiled, and I felt a warm hum in my chest. \u201cA few more tattoos, but you took the piercings out, I see. I liked the ones through your septum and lip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the school I went to didn\u2019t. You gotta know when to fold \u2019em and know when to hold \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I was going through a phase the last time Addie had seen me, but I\u2019d definitely loaded up on multiple forms of self-expression. I had had a piercing through my septum\u2014a small ring\u2014and another through the side of my lip and a stud in my tongue. I hadn\u2019t kept any of them, though. St. Joseph\u2019s, my boarding school, didn\u2019t allow \u201cunorthodox\u201d piercings, and they limited you to two in each ear. I also had five in my left ear\u2014my industrial was one piercing, but it took two holes\u2014and I had six in my right ear, counting my tragus, two in my lobe, and three going up the inside ridge of my ear. The school had ordered me to take those out, too.</p><p>But when Mom didn\u2019t answer her phone to deal with their complaints, I finally told them to \u201cfuck off.\u201d When they called my dad, he gave them a hefty donation . . . and then told them to f**k off.</p><p>\u201cYou and Madoc have both grown up so . . .\u201d She trailed off, and I stopped chewing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she finished, looking away from me.</p><p>If someone had tried to take my heart right then, they would have needed both hands to hold it. I swallowed the heavy lump of food in my mouth, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>I knew why.</p><p>She knew why.</p><p>Madoc and I hadn\u2019t been alone in this house after all. Everyone knew what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she assured me, sitting on the edge of the bed. \u201cLike I told you last night. He\u2019s not here, and he won\u2019t be back until your visit is over.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cYou think I have a problem with Madoc, Addie?\u201d I snickered. \u201cMadoc and I are fine. I\u2019m fine. We took our idiotic rivalry too far, but we were kids. I want to move on.\u201d I kept my tone light, and my shoulders relaxed. Nothing in my body language was going to give me away.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jason thinks it\u2019s unsafe. He says you\u2019re welcome to stay for as long as you like, though. Madoc won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>This was why I needed Addie. I could talk her into getting Madoc home. I just couldn\u2019t be too obvious about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be here for a week or so.\u201d I took a sip of my juice and set it back down. \u201cI\u2019m going to Northwestern in the fall, but I\u2019ll be staying with my dad in the city for the rest of the summer until school starts. Just wanted to visit before I start the next phase.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me the way moms on TV looked at their daughters. The kind of look that makes you feel like you\u2019ve got a thing or two to learn, because honey, you\u2019re just a kid, and I\u2019m smarter.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to face him.\u201d She nodded, her blue eyes locked with mine. \u201cTo resolve things.\u201d</p><p>Resolve things? No. Face him? Yes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool.\u201d I pushed the tray down the bed and climbed off. \u201cI\u2019m going for a run. Do they still keep that trail trimmed around the quarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know.\u201d</p><p>I walked across the newly decorated room to the walk-in closet where I\u2019d thrown my duffel bag yesterday when I got here.</p><p>\u201cFallon? Do you usually sleep in your underwear and a T-shirt too short to cover your ass?\u201d Addie asked with a laugh in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>I heard nothing for a few seconds as I bent over to get my bag. \u201cGood thing Madoc\u2019s not here after all then,\u201d she mumbled in an amused tone and left me alone.</p><p>I got dressed, looking around my bedroom in the light of day. My old room with new d\u00e9cor.</p><p>When I\u2019d gotten in yesterday, Addie had walked me up to my room, but the interior was very different than the way I\u2019d left it. My skating posters were gone, my furniture had been replaced, and my red walls were now a cream color.</p><p>Cream? Yeah, gag.</p><p>I\u2019d had a whole wall lined with bumper stickers. It now featured some impersonal mass-produced photographs of the Eiffel Tower and French cobblestone streets.</p><p>My bedding was a light pink, and my dressers and bed were now white.</p><p>My graphing table with my drawings, my shelves with my Lego robots, and my DVDs and CDs were gone. I can\u2019t say I thought about any of that shit over the last two years, but I felt like I wanted to cry as soon as I entered the room yesterday. Maybe it was that I\u2019d assumed they\u2019d still be here, or maybe I was thrown off that my entire life could be thrown away so easily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour mom redecorated shortly after you left,\u201d Addie had explained.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>I allowed myself about two seconds to lament all of the hours I\u2019d spent skating on boards that were now in a trash dump and building with precious Legos that were now rotting in the dirt somewhere.</p><p>And then I swallowed the ache in my throat and moved on. Screw it.</p> <p>My room now was mature and even a little sexy. I still liked boys\u2019 clothes and wild forms of expression, but my mom didn\u2019t suck at decorating. There were no floral motifs anywhere, and the room was designed for a grown-up. The soft pink tones of the bedding and draperies, the innocence of the romantic furniture, and the black-and-white photographs in vivid frames made me feel like a woman.</p><p>I kind of liked it.</p><p>And I still kind of wanted to kill her for throwing away all of my stuff, too.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The best part about my mom marrying Jason Caruthers was that his house sat in the Seven Hills Valley, a huge gated community\u2014if you considered it a \u201ccommunity\u201d when your nearest neighbor was a half mile down the road in either direction.</p> <p>Rich shits liked their country houses, their space, and their trophy wives. Even if they used none of them. When I thought of my stepfather, Richard Gere in Pretty Woman always came to mind. You know the dude who reserves the penthouse suite but can\u2019t stand heights, so why the f**k did he reserve the penthouse suite?</p><p>Anyway, that was Jason Caruthers. He bought houses he didn\u2019t live in, cars he didn\u2019t use, and he married women he didn\u2019t live with. Why?</p><p>I asked myself that all the time. Maybe he was bored. Maybe he was looking for something that he never seemed to find.</p><p>Or maybe he was just a rich shit.</p><p>To be fair, my mom was the same. Patricia Fallon married my father, Ciaran Pierce, eighteen years ago. Two days later, I was born. Four years later, they divorced, and my mother took me\u2014her meal ticket\u2014on all of her gold-digging adventures. She married an entrepreneur who lost his business and a police captain whose work turned out not to be glamorous enough for my mother.</p><p>But through him, she met her present husband and in him my mother found exactly what she was looking for: money and prestige.</p> <p>Sure, my father had it, too. In certain circles. I had never truly wanted for anything. But my father lived outside of the law\u2014far outside of the law\u2014and to protect his family, he kept us hidden and quiet. Not really the glamorous life my mother was looking for.</p><p>But despite her selfish decisions, I liked where she ended up. I liked it here. I always had.</p><p>The estates all sat tucked away beyond large driveways and dense little neighborhoods of trees. I had loved running\u2014or even walking\u2014along the quiet, secluded roads, but what I anticipated more now was the way the community connected into the Mines of Spain recreational area that featured narrow woodsy trails and deep quarries. The sandstone all around, the greenery, and the perfect blue sky overhead made this the ideal place to get lost.</p><p>Sweat poured down my neck as I pounded the shit out of the dirt under my feet. Tool\u2019s \u201cSchism\u201d played through my earbuds while I zoned out on the trail, and I had to remind myself to keep my eyes up. My father hated that I ran alone. He hated that I ran in quiet, unpopulated areas. I could hear his voice in my head: Keep your head up and protection on you!</p><p>He had ordered a crap-load of running shorts with gun holsters attached to the back, but I refused to wear them. If he wanted me to attract less attention, that was the wrong way to go about it.</p><p>If you run in your underwear, someone will get the wrong idea, he\u2019d said. And then I have to hurt people. You know I like to do that as little as possible.</p><p>I didn\u2019t run in my underwear. But some spandex running shorts and a sports bra? Fuck it, it was hot.</p><p>So we had compromised. He had a bracelet designed that featured a small pocket knife and some pepper spray. It looked like some sick, twisted charm bracelet, but it made him feel better to know I wore it whenever I went out running.</p> <p>Scanning the trail ahead of me\u2014because I listen to my daddy\u2014I noticed a young woman, about my age, standing between the trail and the pond, looking out over the water. I saw her lips were turned down, and she sniffled. That\u2019s when I noticed the shake to her chin. Slowing to a walk, I took a quick inventory. She was dressed like me, running shorts and sports bra, and from what I could see, she wasn\u2019t hurt. There were no other runners or hikers. She just stood there, eyes narrowed, watching the soft ripple on the water.</p><p>\u201cNice tunes,\u201d I yelled over the noise from the iPod strapped to her arm.</p><p>She jerked her head toward me and immediately wiped the corner of her eye. \u201cWhat?\u201d She pulled out her ear buds.</p><p>\u201cI said \u2018nice tunes,\u2019\u201d I repeated, hearing Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cParadise City\u201d spitting out of her ear buds.</p><p>She choked out a laugh, her flushed face brightening a little. \u201cI love the oldies.\u201d She reached out her hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Tate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d I reached out and shook her hand.</p><p>She nodded and looked away, trying to covertly wipe away the rest of the tears.</p><p>Tate. Wait . . . blond hair, long legs, big boobs . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Tatum Brandt,\u201d I remembered. \u201cShelburne High?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She draped the cord to her ear buds around her neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think I remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I left at the end of sophomore year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, where\u2019d you go?\u201d She looked me straight in the eye as we spoke.</p><p>\u201cBoarding school out east.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cBoarding school? How was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatholic. Very Catholic.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and smiled as if she couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d told her. Or maybe she thought it was ludicrous. Didn\u2019t people ship their unwanted kids off in her world? No? Weird.</p><p>The wind blew through the trail, causing the leaves to rustle, and the breeze was a welcome comfort to my hot and wet skin.</p><p>\u201cSo are you just back for the summer before college or for good?\u201d she asked, sitting down on the ground and looking up at me. I took that as an invitation and sat down, too.</p><p>\u201cJust a week or so. I\u2019m heading to Chicago for school. You?\u201d</p><p>She looked down, losing her smile. \u201cI was supposed to go to Columbia. Not now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Columbia was a great school. I would\u2019ve applied, but my father didn\u2019t want me so close to Boston. The farther away from him the safer, he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is having some . . . issues.\u201d I could see her damp lashes as she leaned back on her hands and continued to study the pond in front of us. \u201cFor a long time, apparently. I think it\u2019s best to stick close to home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard to give up Columbia,\u201d I offered.</p><p>She stuck her bottom lip out and shook her head. \u201cNope. I didn\u2019t think twice about it, actually. When someone you love needs you, you suck it up. I\u2019m just upset that he didn\u2019t tell me. He\u2019s had two heart attacks, and I only found out through hospital bills I wasn\u2019t supposed to see.\u201d</p><p>She acted like it wasn\u2019t even a choice. Like it was so easy. My dad is sick. I stay. I was jealous of her resolve.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She smiled and sat up, dusting off her hands. \u201cI bet you\u2019re glad you stopped to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Where do you think you\u2019ll go to school now?\u201d I looked over at her and saw that she had a little tattoo on the back of her neck. Down at the curve where it met her shoulder. It wasn\u2019t that big, but I could make out flames bursting out of a black lantern.</p><p>\u201cWell, I got into Northwestern,\u201d she offered. \u201cIt\u2019s a good option for my degree, and it\u2019s only about an hour from here. The more I think about it, the more excited I get.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows, surprised. \u201cWell, well . . . you like old-school GNR, you\u2019re going to Northwestern, you\u2019ve got some nice ink\u201d\u2014she motioned to the Out of Order tattoo I had written behind my ear at my hairline\u2014\u201cand you jog. Tell me you\u2019re into science, and I may have found my hetero soul mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m majoring in Mechanical Engineering,\u201d I singsonged, hoping that was close enough.</p><p>She put her fist out to bump me and smiled. \u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>Her smiles were a lot more frequent than the last time I\u2019d seen her. She must\u2019ve either gotten Thing 1 and Thing 2 to leave her alone, or she\u2019d put them in their place.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she started, standing up and brushing off her butt. \u201cMy friend is having a party tomorrow night. You should come. He has no problem with pretty girls crashing. You may have to forfeit your underwear at the door, but I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, too. \u201cHe sounds like a hell-raiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tries.\u201d She shrugged, but I could see the proud little smile underneath the gesture. She grabbed my phone out of my hand and punched in some numbers. \u201cOkay, I just called myself. Now you have my number, so text if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019ll shoot you the address and time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose party is it?\u201d I asked, taking my phone back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at Madoc Caruthers\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>I closed my mouth and swallowed at the mention of his name.</p><p>She continued. \u201cHe requires that you wear a bikini, but if you kick him in the balls, he\u2019ll shut up.\u201d She hooded her eyes in an apology. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my best friends. It just takes some time getting used to him,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Best friends? Huh?</p><p>My breathing turned shallow. Madoc was supposed to be having a party tomorrow night?</p><p>She backed away, getting ready to leave. \u201cSee you tomorrow, I hope!\u201d</p><p>And then she was gone, while I stood there, shifting my gaze left to right, searching for I-don\u2019t-know-what. Madoc was friends with Tatum Brandt?</p><p>How the hell did that happen?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cI like that metal in your mouth. I heard a tongue piercing can be all kinds of fun for things other than kissing.\u201d He grips my hair, breathing into my mouth. \u201cSo are you really a bad girl or just playing at one? Show me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what woke me up first. The nausea rolling like thunder through my stomach or the high that was flooding my nerves with excitement.</p><p>Nausea and excitement. Sickness and thrill. Why did I feel both at the same time?</p><p>I knew the queasiness was from the dream.</p><p>But the excitement? The thrill?</p><p>And that\u2019s when I noticed what had woken me up. The flow of air in the room had changed. It was now filtering out into the hall. My heart beat faster, and my belly tingled with butterflies. I tensed my muscles in response, because the elation flowing through them was too much.</p><p>My bedroom door was open!</p><p>I snapped my eyes open and bolted upright in bed, my heart lodging in my throat as I tried to take a breath.</p><p>A dark figure, much bigger than I remembered, stood in the doorway. I almost screamed, but I clamped my mouth shut and swallowed.</p><p>I knew who it was, and I definitely wasn\u2019t scared of him.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I fumed. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>MADOC</p><p>I leaned against the door frame, bringing the bottle of beer to my lips.</p><p>She was right. I should get out. Bad f**king idea to stay, dude.</p><p>But for some reason, I just had to see for myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t why I didn\u2019t believe it. My dad had told me, and Addie confirmed it, but I just couldn\u2019t swallow the fact that Fallon Pierce was back in town after so long.</p><p>I\u2019d nursed a nasty hangover this morning, thanks to her, and then driven home after I knew everyone would be in bed. There had been no plan to come to her room, and I had no plan to enter, but I was too damn curious. What was she like now? How had she changed? And there were some answers I needed, whether I liked it or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached over and grabbed her black-rimmed glasses off the nightstand. The moon was under cover tonight, so I couldn\u2019t see shit. Only her form.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re really back.\u201d I pushed off the door frame and sauntered toward the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here. Addie said you were staying with friends.\u201d</p><p>What the f**k?</p> <p>They were right. She was afraid of me. But why? What the hell had I ever done to her?</p><p>I squeezed the green bottle in my hand and tried to make her out in the darkness. She wore a dark blue T-shirt with some white swirly writing I couldn\u2019t read, and her hair was all over the place. She used to have piercings, but I couldn\u2019t see anything right now.</p><p>\u201cThis is my father\u2019s house.\u201d I spoke low and straightened my back. \u201cAnd someday all this shit will be mine, Fallon. That bed you sleep in, along with everything else under this roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, Madoc. You don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I brushed her off. \u201cBeen there. Done that. Got the T-shirt. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she ordered, her tone hard.</p><p>I took another sip of my beer. \u201cThe thing is, Fallon . . . I told you before to lock the door if you wanted me to stay out. Funny thing is . . .\u201d I leaned in. \u201cYou. Never. Did.\u201d</p><p>In one swift movement she whipped off her covers and stood up on the bed. Charging to the end, she slapped me across the face before I even knew what was happening.</p><p>I almost laughed. Hell, yeah.</p><p>My body stayed in place, but my head had twisted to the side with the blow, and I closed my eyes out of reflex. The sting started as a few little needles under the surface but exploded and spread like electricity. I kept my eyes shut for a few seconds longer than necessary, savoring the rush.</p><p>With the bed elevating her, she stood about six inches higher than me, and I turned my head back to her slowly, welcoming whatever she had.</p> <p>She scowled down at me. \u201cI was sixteen years old and too stupid to keep you off me,\u201d she spat. \u201cLittle did I know that they have toothbrushes bigger than you. And I\u2019ve definitely had better than you in the past two years, so count on the door being locked from now on.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I wore smiles but didn\u2019t feel them. Sometimes I felt them and didn\u2019t wear them. I didn\u2019t want her to know how much I craved this. I bit my bottom lip.</p><p>She spun around, heading back up the bed, and I reached out and pulled her ankle out from underneath her. She crashed down onto the mattress, landing on her belly, and I quickly came down onto her back, whispering in her ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d even touch you now? You know what I used to call you? Pussy-on-the-Premises. You were convenient when I needed to blow a load, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>She whipped her head around to look at me but couldn\u2019t twist far enough with my weight on her back.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think I ever thought it was more than that, either, Madoc. I was bored, and it was cute to see you brag about your skill. I\u2019ve never laughed so hard.\u201d I could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cBut I know better now,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I asked. \u201cSpreading yourself around like your mother? You were right, Fallon. You sure are going places.\u201d I pushed off the bed and watched her flip over and sit up. It was then I noticed what she was wearing. A T-shirt and bikini underwear.</p><p>Shit. I blinked long and hard.</p> <p>My dick jolted against my basketball shorts, and I clenched a fist, forcing control. \u201cBut,\u201d I continued, \u201cdon\u2019t overestimate yourself, baby. You can\u2019t get me kicked out of my own house. I live here. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rose and fell hard, and the anger in her eyes brought back everything I lived for two years ago. Her facial piercings were gone, and I wished she still had them, but her hair was beautiful chaos. The way it always looked at night. She still wore her sexy glasses, and I couldn\u2019t help thinking about those strong legs.</p><p>I\u2019d been there.</p><p>And her temper? Yeah, the Irish in her was no lie.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath and turned around to see Hannah standing in the doorway in her bikini.</p><p>\u201cThe Jacuzzi\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, hands on her hips.</p><p>I looked at Fallon, still sitting on the bed and her eyes going round at seeing my date.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d I told her in a relaxed voice. \u201cEat the food. Use the pool. And then get a f**king life of your own when you leave.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>FALLON</p><p>I knew exactly how I felt about Madoc. And I knew why I felt that way. I hated him. I hated what he did to me. But why in the hell did he hate me? I scrubbed my face, going through my morning rituals, while I thought about him. Madoc had been rude last night. Volatile. He clearly despised me. That wasn\u2019t part of the plan.</p><p>We had left things unfinished, but what was his problem? He got what he wanted, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>Why was he so angry?</p><p>I dried my face and threw on my glasses, heading downstairs as I replayed his words from last night.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d even touch you now? You know what I used to call you? Pussy-on-the-Premises. You were convenient when I needed to blow a load.\u201d</p><p>He was never that cruel. Not even before we started\u2014</p><p>A loud scream echoed through the long corridor heading to the stairs, and I stopped.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, put me down!\u201d Addie\u2019s voice rang from downstairs somewhere. I crossed my arms over my chest, realizing I was still in my tank top with no bra, and Madoc was still in the house. But I quickly dropped them again.</p><p>He\u2019s still here. Good. This was where he needed to be, and now I wouldn\u2019t have to work Addie to get him back home.</p><p>I tipped my chin down, straightened my shoulders, and headed downstairs. Entering the kitchen, I saw Madoc standing behind Addie and reaching over her shoulder to dip his spoon into the batter she was mixing. His easy smile that always reached his eyes stopped me short, and I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>Stop smiling, I mentally ordered him. I narrowed my eyes even more so that my eyebrows were probably touching.</p><p>He flipped the spoon upside down and stuffed the chocolate-looking goo into his mouth as Addie tried to snatch it back. He twisted away, and she tried to swat him on the head, but they were both laughing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t double-dip, you little brat! I taught you better than that.\u201d She shook her big wooden spoon at him, flinging drops of batter onto her white shirt despite the apron she wore.</p><p>Madoc winked at her and walked to the refrigerator, silver spoon still hanging out of his mouth\u2014go figure\u2014and grabbed a Gatorade.</p><p>My gaze lingered on the huge tattoo across his back, stretching from shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>And my heart missed a beat. Was that my name? But I blinked and shook off the ridiculous idea. No. The tattoo said \u201cFallen.\u201d They had messed up the \u201ce\u201d by inking it to look like flames.</p><p>It was a good-looking tattoo, though, and I had to stop myself from dwelling on how it made him hotter. Tattoos made everyone hotter.</p><p>My mother\u2014when I spoke to her\u2014was known to comment on how I\u2019m going to look at eighty with tattoos.</p><p>I\u2019m going to look awesome.</p><p>His jeans hung low without a belt, and he didn\u2019t have a shirt on as if he just woke up and forgot to finish getting dressed. But who was I to talk? I was standing there in my sleep shorts and tank top, looking a hell of a lot more indecent. My hair was everywhere, spread around my face and down my back in knots and tangles.</p><p>He was fresh and bright, and I was wilted.</p><p>\u201cFallon!\u201d Addie exclaimed, and I blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d She wasn\u2019t fooling anyone with the nervous edge to her voice.</p><p>Madoc faced away from me, but I noticed his arm freeze for two ticks as he took a swig of the Gatorade. He recovered quickly, though.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I drawled out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sleep with the commotion going on down here.\u201d</p><p>Madoc twisted his head to face me and eyed me over his shoulder with an arched brow. He looked annoyed.</p><p>His gaze slowly dropped, taking in my appearance or maybe just trying to make me uncomfortable, but my cheeks immediately warmed anyway. He scaled down my chest, over my stomach until he reached my bare toes, and then came right back up to meet my eyes, disgust clear in his blue depths.</p><p>The same flare to his nostrils as last night was there, but his gaze was flat. I clenched my teeth to force myself to breathe more slowly. I couldn\u2019t get upset with the way he looked down on me. I\u2019d trained myself to not get upset.</p><p>Madoc was always calm, after all. So calm all the damn time growing up. He didn\u2019t shout or show his anger until he\u2019d had enough. And you never knew exactly when that was going to be. That was the scary part about him.</p><p>\u201cFallon, Madoc surprised me this morning,\u201d Addie jumped in to explain. \u201cBut he\u2019s heading back out after breakfast, right?\u201d she asked Madoc, prompting him with raised eyebrows.</p><p>He looked to her and back at me, mischief and pleasure evident in his expression.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah,\u201d he said, brushing off Addie\u2019s concern as if he\u2019d just told her he didn\u2019t want any dessert. \u201cFallon and I talked last night. We\u2019re cool.\u201d He looked over at me, his eyes squinting up in a smile. \u201cI have a hell of a summer planned, and this is a big house. Right, Fallon? We\u2019ll play nice or stay out of each other\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he spoke and looked to Addie with the same carefree, innocent, wide-eyed bullshit I\u2019ve seen him use a million times.</p><p>This is why Madoc was going to be a great lawyer like his dad. Working people wasn\u2019t just about the words you spoke. It was about body language, tone, and timing. Keep your voice natural, your body relaxed, and distract them with a change of subject as soon as possible.</p><p>Here it comes in three, two, one . . .</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he nudged Addie. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He came up to stand behind her at the counter and reached around and placed his arm across her chest, hugging her close but with his eyes dead set on me. \u201cJust finish my chocolate pancakes. I\u2019m f**king starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc!\u201d she whisper-yelled, scolding him but failing to hide her smile.</p><p>And that was it. He\u2019d won.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cYeah, Madoc\u2019s right, Addie. I have no problem with it. I told you that yesterday.\u201d I saw Madoc raise his eyebrows. I bet he thought I was going to fight him on this. \u201cAnd anyway, I\u2019m gone in a week. I only came to eat the food and use the pool.\u201d</p><p>I let the sarcasm drip slowly from my tone and kept my eyes locked to his. I\u2019d missed playing with him more than I wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, leaning on his elbows over the wide granite island.</p><p>\u201cChicago. I\u2019m starting Northwestern in the fall. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotre Dame,\u201d he sighed, thinning his lips with a hint of resignation to his voice.</p><p>No, not resignation exactly. Acceptance. As if he\u2019d lost a battle.</p><p>Notre Dame was the family school. Madoc\u2019s father, aunts and uncles, and grandfather had all gone there. Madoc didn\u2019t dislike the school, but I couldn\u2019t tell if he actually liked it, either. It was hard to tell if he had any dreams of his own aside from what his father had planned for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d Addie dumped the spoon into the bowl and brushed her hands on her apron. \u201cI completely forgot to give you your graduation presents.\u201d She walked across the kitchen and grabbed two \u201csomethings\u201d out of a cabinet.</p><p>\u201cFallon, I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d be here, but I\u2019d gotten you one anyway to ship to you. Here.\u201d She handed both Madoc and me what looked like lanterns. They were black plastic on the bottom with a glass capsule on the top half. The bottom featured five rows of the alphabet.</p><p>\u201cA cryptex!\u201d I smiled at her while Madoc looked at his like it was an alien baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d He pinched his eyebrows together. \u201cYou know I just wanted to see you in a bikini,\u201d he told Addie.</p><p>\u201cOh, put a cork in it.\u201d She waved her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d His eyebrows were still pinched together while he studied the puzzle case.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Puzzle Pod Cryptex,\u201d Addie explained. \u201cYou have to solve the riddle that I have taped to the bottom, and dial the five-letter answer to open the pod. Then you can retrieve the present inside.</p> <p>Madoc read his out loud. \u201c\u2018At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?\u2019\u201d His eyes shot up to pin Addie. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He threw back his arm, raising the cryptex high above his head, when Addie reached out and grabbed him.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d she yelled, while he mock-scowled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not breaking it open! Use your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I suck at stuff like this.\u201d But then he started dialing letters, guessing at the answer.</p><p>I read mine to myself. \u201cWhat gets wetter the more it dries?\u201d</p> <p>Please. I snickered and dialed in \u201ctowel.\u201d The cryptex opened, and I pulled out a gift card to a skate shop I used to frequent in town.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Addie,\u201d I chirped, not wanting to tell her that I no longer skated.</p><p>I looked over at Madoc, who was still working his puzzle with an eyebrow arched. He was struggling, and the more he struggled the dumber he was going to feel. Walking over, I took the cryptex out of his hands, my breath catching for only a moment when my fingers brushed his.</p><p>I looked at the puzzle and spoke quietly as I dialed. \u201c\u2018At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without being stolen.\u2019\u201d It clicked, and I met his soft eyes staring down at me, not the cryptex. \u201cStars,\u201d I said, almost in a whisper.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t breathing. The stern set to his eyes as he loomed over me reminded me of so many times I\u2019d looked up at him, wanting things I was afraid to ask for.</p><p>But we were different now. I wanted only his pain, and judging from the girl he\u2019d come home with last night, Madoc was still the same. A user.</p> <p>I hooded my eyes, trying to appear bored, as I shoved the now-open cryptex back at him.</p><p>He took a deep breath and smiled, the intense concentration now gone. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then he turned to Addie. \u201cSee? We\u2019re getting along fine.\u201d</p><p>And he left through the sliding-glass doors leading to the vast patio and pool area with his gift card to the go-kart track.</p><p>I swallowed, trying to calm the windstorm in my stomach. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d I asked Addie. \u201cYou\u2019re letting him stay, after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were okay with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I rushed to add. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . I just don\u2019t want you to get in trouble with the boss.\u201d</p><p>She gave a half-smile and started pouring batter onto the griddle. \u201cDo you know that Madoc started playing the piano again?\u201d Her eyes stayed glued to her task.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I responded, wondering about the change in subject. \u201cHis father must be thrilled.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc had taken music lessons since he was five, specifically the piano. Jason Caruthers wanted his son proficient, but when Madoc turned fifteen\u2014around the time my mom and I moved in\u2014he realized that Daddy really just wanted him to perform. Something else for Mr. Caruthers to brag about and show off.</p><p>So Madoc had quit. He refused lessons and threatened to trash the piano if it wasn\u2019t moved out of sight. It was taken down to the basement where it sat with my half-pipe.</p><p>But I had always wondered . . .</p><p>Madoc did love to play. It was a release for him, or it seemed to be. He usually only practiced at required lessons, but he ran willingly to the piano when he was upset or really happy.</p><p>After he quit, he started doing stupid shit without that release anymore: hanging around that asswipe Jared Trent, bullying Tatum Brandt, breaking into the school to steal car parts, which no one knew about but me.</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt his father knows,\u201d Addie continued. \u201cMadoc still won\u2019t perform or take lessons. It\u2019s more of an in-the-dead-of-the-night thing when the whole house is asleep and no one can see or hear him.\u201d She stopped and looked up at me. \u201cBut I hear him. The light tinkling of the keys trails upstairs from the basement. It\u2019s very faint. Almost as if it\u2019s a ghost that can\u2019t decide whether to stay or go.\u201d</p><p>I thought of Madoc playing alone downstairs in the dead of night. What kind of songs did he play? Why did he do it?</p><p>And then I remembered the Madoc from last night. The one who\u2019d insinuated that I was a freeloading slut.</p><p>And the rapid beat of my heart slowed to a dull thud.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he start playing again?\u201d I asked, looking out to the patio where he talked on his phone.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe day you left.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>MADOC</p><p>Now I understood why Jared drowned himself in constant partying over Tate. Distractions were useful. If you had too much on your mind, then you could push your thoughts away with noise, liquor, and girls and keep moving forward at lightning speed. When my friend slowed down long enough to think, that\u2019s when he got into trouble. But eventually things worked out for them. He pushed her, and she started pushing back. He kept pushing, and she finally knocked him on his ass.</p><p>Fallon and I were a lot like them. Only I didn\u2019t love her, and she didn\u2019t love me. I was infatuated with her once\u2014and loved that she let me take my pubescent urges out on her\u2014but we weren\u2019t in love.</p><p>We were two people in a f**ked-up family taking our cues from f**ked-up parents.</p><p>And neither one of us knew how to do anything differently.</p><p>She stomped up to her room after pancakes, and I got ready for my party that was starting mid-afternoon but going \u2019til the next morning if I had anything to say about it.</p><p>I hoped that she\u2019d show up, and at the same time I wanted her far away from me.</p><p>Fallon affected my body in weird ways.</p><p>But only because she\u2019s different, I told myself.</p><p>The last time I saw her she was sleeping on the leather couch in the theater room wearing only my T-shirt. She had twisted her lips up as she rubbed her nose in her sleep, and I remember thinking how much I couldn\u2019t stand her during the day but how much I wanted her when she put her forked tongue away at night.</p><p>Everyone at school thought she was a freak. They definitely thought she was a lesbian. And none of the guys thought she was hot.</p><p>Pretty? Sure. Even with the beanies that covered her head and the glasses that hid her eyes.</p><p>But not hot. Her piercings were scary to them, and her clothes were an embarrassment to any guy calling her his girlfriend.</p><p>Only I knew the truth. I\u2019d seen her without the clothes\u2014accidentally of course\u2014and I knew what she covered up.</p><p>But that was two years ago. She wasn\u2019t sexy to me anymore.</p><p>Now she was lethal. Despite her pale Irish ancestry, her skin was golden with the most beautiful sprinkle of freckles across her nose and under her eyes. Her hair had been colored. Whereas before it was a dull, light brown, now it was about three different shades of brown with some modest chunks of blond blended in.</p><p>Her green eyes stood out more than I remembered, and it took clenching every muscle in my body this morning to look like I wasn\u2019t checking her out. Seeing her walk into the kitchen in her pj\u2019s, looking like she\u2019d been blissfully f**ked all night long, made me hot.</p><p>But what-the-fuck-ever. That ship between us sailed long ago, and there was no way she\u2019d redeem the damage she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cNo one drives.\u201d Addie pointed a finger at me as I set up my laptop and hauled my speakers outside onto the patio in preparation for the party.</p><p>I gave a halfhearted salute and shooed her away. \u201cGo watch your reruns of The L Word.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes before walking up the stairs to her bedroom on the third floor.</p><p>We weren\u2019t that pretentious that we kept the servants so far away from us. It was just that Addie was our only live-in, and the third floor was like an apartment in itself, complete with a kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a living area. It wasn\u2019t always like that, but my father had it converted for Addie when he realized he wouldn\u2019t let her go in his lifetime.</p><p>Fallon had taken off on her sport bike late this morning and had come back around one. Other than that, I hadn\u2019t seen her. And by three thirty, my house was slammed with just about everyone from my graduating class. Jax arrived early on, helping me set up and put out the food I had had delivered. I saw Jared\u2019s car parked on the side of the house, which meant Tate and he were in their room\u2014the one I gave them so they could have \u201calone time\u201d without her dad on their case.</p><p>Screw him. They\u2019re in love, and I loved them like family, so mi casa es su casa.</p><p>\u201cCome on, dude. Hurry up,\u201d Jax pressed, carrying the tap for the keg while I grabbed the cups. Everyone filtered in and out of the house and in and out of the pool, enjoying the balmy afternoon.</p><p>\u201cJamison,\u201d I called out to Ben, who was in the pool hitting on Kendra Stevens. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, man. I\u2019ve already been there,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Madoc. You wish,\u201d she shot back, flying her hand across the water, trying to splash me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you were good, baby.\u201d I shrugged, following Jax to where the keg sat. \u201cFor a fat chick, you didn\u2019t sweat much.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes bugged out and Kendra screamed, \u201cMadoc!\u201d She kicked her skinny legs on the raft, spilling her drink.</p><p>I turned back to Jax, who was silently laughing so hard his face was turning red.</p><p>Pulling the seal off the keg and plugging in the nozzle, Jax poured about five bags of ice into the bucket around the keg, while I began pumping and pouring out the first few cups of foam.</p><p>\u201cHey, Madoc.\u201d Hannah and her friend Lexi came up to my side. \u201cJax.\u201d They nodded to him while he did no more than nod back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, ladies?\u201d I asked, taking a gulp of beer.</p><p>\u201cAre you having a good summer, Madoc?\u201d Hannah asked as if we hadn\u2019t just seen each other last night.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good so far,\u201d she answered and put her hands on her hips, making her chest more prominent. \u201cHow\u2019s your summer, Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better,\u201d he mumbled, still loading ice.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s going to get a lot better.\u201d She trailed a hand down his back, and I saw him stiffen. Her meaning was clear. \u201cSee you around,\u201d she taunted, and she and Lexi walked off.</p><p>I laughed again under my breath and took another gulp.</p><p>Jax was getting a lot of attention at school, and with Jared off the market and me leaving for college, I was pretty confident Jax could handle the workload. It really depended on his mood, though. Sometimes he went all predator with a seek-and-destroy mentality. Other times he acted like he\u2019d rather pull out his toenails than talk to certain girls.</p><p>\u201cResistance is futile, Jax.\u201d I slapped him on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t let them scare you. Just enjoy the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break.\u201d He stood up straight, throwing the empty bag aside. \u201cI\u2019ve been ha**ng s*x longer than you. I just don\u2019t like women like that.\u201d He stared off into the crowd across the pool. \u201cThey see me as a toy.\u201d</p><p>I handed him a beer. \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>His jaw twitched, and his voice was quiet. \u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Jax wasn\u2019t scared of women by any means, and while I knew he\u2019d had a hard life, I often wondered if I really knew what the hell \u201ca hard life\u201d was like. I\u2019d caught on after more than a few clues that Jared and Jax\u2019s dad\u2014who was currently in jail\u2014had abused them physically. Jax more so, because he grew up with the man, whereas Jared had only spent one summer with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared\u2019s dark moods tended to be more noticeable and more volatile than his brother\u2019s. Jax had them, too, but we rarely saw them. He\u2019d disappear for long hours, stay out half the night and still be up for school early the next day. The brothers both had a lot of anger, but they had different ways of dealing with it.</p><p>When you stepped on Jared\u2019s toes, you\u2019d get punched in the gut. If you stepped on Jax\u2019s toes, he\u2019d hack into the county database and issue a warrant for your arrest.</p><p>If you hit Jared, he\u2019d pound you into the dirt.</p><p>No one hit Jax. He carried a knife.</p> <p>\u201cNow her on the other hand,\u201d Jax piped up, gesturing with the beer in his hand. \u201cShe looks like a librarian in a p**n o bookstore. Who the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>I followed his gaze across the pool to the patio doors where Fallon had just appeared.</p><p>Jesus Christ. What the hell?</p><p>Fallon didn\u2019t show skin, she didn\u2019t wear makeup, and she didn\u2019t tame her hair.</p><p>So why the hell was she doing it now?</p> <p>Tate walked up to her, taking her hands and smiling. Leading her over to one of the tables, she looked like she was introducing to her to Jared.</p><p>But Jared knew Fallon.</p><p>How did Tate?</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>FALLON</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m in the twilight zone,\u201d I blurted out when Tate introduced me to her boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019re dating him?\u201d I asked her.</p> <p>First the girl is friends with my stepbrother, and now she\u2019s sleeping with the other half of the Dipshit Duo.</p><p>I mean, I get it. Kind of.</p><p>Madoc has a winning personality, and he\u2019s hot. But Jared is just hot. At least Madoc has more going for him. Was she on a mission from God to reform ass**les?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tate snipped as she sat down at the table across from Jared, \u201cshe obviously hasn\u2019t slept with you if she\u2019s not a fan. That makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>Jared slouched in the chair looking every bit like he owned the place. Dressed in knee-length black swim shorts, he ran his index finger across his lips as he studied me.</p><p>Not bothering to hide my feelings, I crossed my arms over my chest and tried not to snarl. \u201cThe last time I saw you two together, you were making her cry,\u201d I pointed out, looking at Jared and waiting.</p><p>I heard Tate snort to my right, and Jared\u2019s smile peeked out of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy personality has improved, Fallon. I\u2019m not sure yours has, though. Care to start over?\u201d He held out his hand, and I hesitated long enough to make everyone feel awkward.</p> <p>But I took it.</p><p>What the hell? If the girl was happy\u2014and she looked happy\u2014then it was none of my business.</p><p>And they did make a good-looking couple. He still looked the same, only bigger, and she was dressed as cute as hell in red bikini bottoms and a short-sleeved black rash guard.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d Jared nodded behind me, and I felt pressure hitting my back. Not that someone was touching me.</p><p>\u201cTate,\u201d Madoc said behind me, \u201chow do you know Fallon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met jogging yesterday. I invited her to the party. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Tate smiled at me and continued. \u201cShe never texted, though, so I didn\u2019t know for sure if she was coming. How do you guys know her? From school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon lives in my house,\u201d Madoc taunted me.</p><p>\u201cOur parents are married,\u201d I explained and turned around to face Madoc. \u201cBut we\u2019re not close. Never have been.\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s eyes narrowed as if he was trying to figure something out.</p><p>\u201cI can see your bra, Fallon.\u201d He sighed and looked away, appearing bored.</p><p>I knew he could see my bra. I knew everyone could see it. It\u2019s what I wanted. I had no plans to go swimming, so I wore a black bra with elaborate straps stretching from the front of my torso to my back and down over my shoulders from my upper chest. It wasn\u2019t meant to be hidden, so I wore it with a loose, deep V-neck tank top that showed it off. Paired with my black shorts and flip-flops, I only accessorized with my earrings and glasses. I\u2019d already gotten some appreciative looks, and I knew that that would piss off Madoc.</p><p>Whether or not he still wanted me, I knew he wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to have me.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d My lips twisted in a spiteful smile. \u201cTate, tell him it looks hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do her,\u201d she backed me up, and I heard Jared laugh behind me.</p><p>Madoc kept his eyes locked on mine in what I knew was a challenge. He wanted to play, but he also didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>I leaned in to whisper to him, folding my arms across my chest. \u201cYou remember what happened the last time I showed up to one of your parties uninvited? You still think about it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The slow rise and fall of his chest quickened as he kept his mouth glued shut for once and pierced me with hard eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Madoc!\u201d I shifted to my right and walked backward toward the pool. \u201cIt\u2019s a party. Don\u2019t be a pooper.\u201d</p><p>And I turned around giving him my back, not wanting to admit how much I wanted to see his face right now. With my heart in my throat, I threw my tank top over my head and let my shorts fall to the ground. I took a moment to breathe as the chatter around me ceased and partygoers stopped what they were doing to look at me in my underwear.</p><p>I was more covered than some of the other girls here. My bra was definitely made for sexiness, but it covered my br**sts, and my hipster underwear was black lace. Yeah, I was more covered, yet I was the indecent one, because I wore lingerie.</p><p>My hands shook. What am I doing?</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to make a spectacle of myself. I wore the outfit to get his attention, not everyone else\u2019s. But it was a necessary step if I wanted him to react the same way he did two years ago when I showed up to his party. I wanted him angry and out of his mind. I wanted to trap him.</p><p>\u201cTate.\u201d I looked behind me, avoiding Madoc\u2019s eyes. \u201cGet your ass in the pool. Let\u2019s talk Northwestern.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up, and then she blinked as if unsure how to respond. \u201cUm, okay.\u201d And she pushed out of her chair, heading for me as I dove in.</p><p>Tate and I didn\u2019t really swim. We just caroused and laughed, while once in a while someone would cannonball into the pool or some idiot would let their boyfriend throw them in. I refused to search for Madoc, but I knew he was around. I caught sight of his ridiculously preppy gray-and-black plaid board shorts and immediately averted my eyes.</p><p>Okay, so they weren\u2019t that ridiculous. Madoc made things work that others couldn\u2019t. I remembered how much I hated his attire two years ago. Safe. Conformist. From the Gap.</p><p>But I found out that they were part of a fa\u00e7ade that he adopted. When the clothes came off, so did Madoc\u2019s mask. At night when he\u2019d hang out in just jeans and nothing else, it was like I was seeing an entirely different guy.</p><p>Strong. Powerful. Mine.</p><p>Apparently others had seen his good side, too, if he could count Tatum Brandt as a friend. As far as I could tell, she was ambitious and levelheaded.</p><p>And although her boyfriend and Madoc\u2019s best friend could go piss up a tree as far as I was concerned, I had to admit that he seemed to have grown up. He had some nice ink, a gorgeous tree tattooed on his back, covering almost the entire area. My tattoos were smaller, but I had more. We might even have a thing or two in common now.</p><p>As much as I wanted to know Jared and Tate\u2019s story, I was more and more satisfied as the night wore on that he deserved her. He didn\u2019t say one wrong word to her, or talk to any other girls, and always touched her when they were close. An arm over her shoulder, a hand at her back, a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>And these people were Madoc\u2019s best friends. They were people that didn\u2019t make me cringe or despise being around them.</p><p>After I\u2019d toweled off, I put my clothes back on and poured myself a beer from the keg, while Jared and Tate joined Madoc and some blonde over at the fire pit.</p><p>The sun had set and while it wasn\u2019t chilly, there was a nice breeze coming through the trees. The party was still loud and still busy, but people were spreading out. Some went into the house to watch movies or play video games, while others filtered out onto the grounds. I was sure there were several bedrooms already occupied, as well.</p><p>\u201cSo how does Madoc have a sister?\u201d A deep, velvety voice came up to my side.</p><p>I tipped my head up from the tap and did a double-take, my mouth falling open.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>The guy\u2014a young one, too\u2014was entirely too beautiful for words. Who the hell . . .</p><p>He had a smooth face, but a strong, angular jaw and high cheekbones. His eyebrows were straight and at a slant, making his striking blue eyes stand out even more against his tanned skin. Or maybe that was his natural skin tone. He wore his dark brown hair long, but it was pulled back into a ponytail.</p><p>He had no tattoos, and he didn\u2019t need them, either. With his height and toned build, why cover any of that up? Looking like that shouldn\u2019t be legal. Hell, looking at him like I was probably wasn\u2019t legal yet, either. I hardened my eyes, hoping my glasses obscured my gawking.</p><p>\u201cMadoc doesn\u2019t have a sister.\u201d I pursed my lips. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaxon Trent,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not trying to hit on you. I think I\u2019d have to get in line, what with you showing the whole world how you look in lingerie.\u201d He smiled with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cI like your spunk. Just wanted to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrent? As in Jared Trent?\u201d I took a sip of my beer and peered up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>He looked so proud saying it I didn\u2019t have the heart to be sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cI like your piercings.\u201d He motioned to my ears. \u201cAre you the one that inspired Madoc\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc\u2019s what?\u201d We started walking toward the fire pit, my flip-flops sloshing through puddles on the now drenched pool deck.</p><p>\u201cPiercing,\u201d he answered, leaning in to whisper. \u201cRumor is that he has one somewhere, but we can\u2019t see it. Tate thinks it\u2019s a Prince Albert. I\u2019m going with a Jacob\u2019s Ladder. Madoc\u2019s either all in or all out.\u201d</p><p>Madoc with a piercing? And that ass**le gave me so much shit about mine. I let out a bitter laugh. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s driving us all nuts,\u201d he joked as we sat down in the circle surrounding the fire.</p><p>The pit, along with the Jacuzzi, helped make the outdoor area usable all year long, even during the bitter-cold Midwest winters. It was a large copper bowl stretching about four feet in diameter, and it burned real wood. Not only did it create substantial flames, but it also generated a lot of heat.</p><p>Since the evening wasn\u2019t nearly cold enough, there was only a small amount of wood burning. The soft glow kept the area dim except for our eyes that were brightened by the dance of the flames across our faces.</p><p>Jared sat on the ground, leaning against a rock, with Tate between his legs and her back pulled up to his chest. Madoc was in a similar position; however, he sat on a chair across the fire from me with a girl on the ground between his legs.</p><p>Figures.</p><p>He had his hand around her neck, but not in a threatening way. His fingers lightly caressed her while his thumb moved in circles. She stared into the flames, closing her eyes every so often, clearly enjoying the attention.</p><p>I watched his fingers, mesmerized by how she was putty in his hands. He was soft and slow, gentle and attentive. Possessive. Pressure built low in my belly, and I clenched my thighs, feeling the long-forgotten burn.</p><p>And then I looked up. My chest heaved.</p><p>His eyes were on me. Pinning me with the absence of everything they usually held. The amusement was gone. The mischief had disappeared. The game was silent.</p><p>The mask was off.</p><p>In This Moment\u2019s \u201cWhore\u201d poured out of the speakers, and I stared into his hard eyes that were hot and urgent on my skin. My tongue moved around my closed mouth, trying to quench the dryness in my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He touched her with his hands but held me with his eyes, and every time he stroked her jaw or ran his finger across her cheek, I could feel the tingle on my skin.</p><p>I closed my eyes, then opened them and blinked hard to break the contact.</p><p>\u201cSo do you still skate?\u201d</p><p>I blinked again, registering thunder in the distance. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I asked, looking over at Jax. Just breathe, Fallon.</p> <p>\u201cThe skateboard tattoo on the inside of your wrist.\u201d He gestured. \u201cIs that your half-pipe with the severe incline in the basement?\u201d</p><p>My half-pipe? He\u2019d seen it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still there?\u201d I asked, incredulous. I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, next to the piano.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my eyes immediately.</p> <p>That was strange. With all of my other belongings tossed out with the trash, why would they keep a huge half-pipe that took up space? A lot of space. I was about to ask Jax if there were any skateboards around it, hoping against hope that maybe Madoc or one of his friends salvaged those to use for themselves, but he had started up a conversation with some guy across the fire pit.</p><p>Tate brushed my arm, and I looked to my right. \u201cSo what\u2019s with you and Madoc?\u201d She looked like she was trying to keep her voice low, but Jared\u2019s eyes flashed to mine when he heard her question. \u201cSeems like there\u2019s bad blood between you two,\u201d she added.</p><p>I quickly glanced at Jared again, wondering if Madoc ever told him about us, but he wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>\u201cWe just never hit it off.\u201d I shrugged to Tate, keeping my voice light. \u201cWith the way these two behaved around you the last time I was in town,\u201d I joked, gesturing to Jared and Madoc, \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and twisted her head to the side, looking up at her boyfriend. \u201cYeah, I guess I do.\u201d And then she fixed me with a stern expression. \u201cBut I also know there\u2019s two sides to every story. You two should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can barely stand to be in the same room together.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc was still across the fire, eyes shifting between Tate and me, and there was no mistaking it. He was pissed. Maybe he wondered what we were talking about, or maybe he just didn\u2019t want me here.</p><p>Hell, I knew he didn\u2019t want me here\u2014which was why I was here.</p><p>Clipped voices to my left caught my attention, and I dragged my gaze away from Madoc.</p><p>\u201cI would think that if you don\u2019t have the balls to get on the track yourself, then you can shut up.\u201d The guy next to Madoc was barking at Jax, who still sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd race who?\u201d Jax sneered. \u201cYou? Yeah, that\u2019ll get me off. I\u2019ll race when it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you want from me, Jax, but I\u2019m sick of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what I want?\u201d Jax interrupted, keeping his voice cocky. \u201cI want your girlfriend to wipe off her poseur pink lip gloss and get in my car. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>I darted my eyes to all of the snorts going off around the fire. Madoc laughed silently, shaking his head, while Jared\u2019s body shook as he buried his laughter in Tate\u2019s neck.</p> <p>Tate saw my confused look and explained. \u201cThat\u2019s Liam,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s K.C.\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d She pointed to the beautiful dark-haired girl sitting next to Liam, who stared at her lap, stunned. \u201cHe cheated on her last year, but they got back together. Jax hasn\u2019t said anything, but I think he . . .\u201d</p><p>Wants her. I finished her thought in my head. Well, if he wants her, then why wasn\u2019t he going after her? Clearly, her winner of a boyfriend had nothing on him.</p><p>Liam\u2019s jaw turned hard as his gaze trailed between Jax and his shocked girlfriend, who looked like she wanted to crawl inside of her shell. \u201cIs something going on between you two?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She pursed her lips and swallowed, averting everyone\u2019s eyes. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Everyone watched as Jax and Liam went at it, and Jared, Tate, and Madoc all either smiled, laughed, or stiffened as Jax cracked jokes or suffered an insult. I realized how much of a unit they all were, and how they all stuck together. Madoc had a smile of pride in his eyes when he looked at Jax like a brother, and he had such an ease with Tate. He had a family in them.</p><p>Well, aside from Liam and K.C., anyway. She stayed quiet, clearly embarrassed, but her quick glances at Jax didn\u2019t escape my notice, either. She looked breakable. Kind of like I was once.</p><p>But breaking was beautiful. It hurt, and it was an uphill climb back to sanity, but you came back stronger, fiercer, and more solid than you were before.</p><p>I waved my hands in front of me and shook my head at Liam, finally having enough of the idiocy. \u201cWhoa,\u201d I interrupted whatever asinine comment he was making. \u201cSo you cheated on your girlfriend last year.\u201d I stopped and waved at K.C. \u201cHi, K.C. I\u2019m Fallon, by the way.\u201d And then I shot my attention back over to Liam. \u201cAnd you\u2019re worried about her cheating on you? I\u2019d say you got a better girl than you deserve.\u201d Snorts sounded around the fire, and K.C. shifted in her seat, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>With her eyebrows narrowed, she stood up and hesitated as if she wasn\u2019t sure what move to make without instructions. My eyes dropped to her thumbnail that she kept dragging across the wrist of her other hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading home.\u201d She grabbed her T-shirt and pulled it over her bikini top. \u201cSee you all later.\u201d</p><p>She walked down the stone steps to the pool deck, and I saw Jax\u2019s fists tighten when Liam got up and approached him.</p><p>He leaned down, hovering over Jax, whose forearms rested on his knees, and he did nothing more than c**k his head, welcoming whatever Liam was bringing.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone, Liam.\u201d K.C.\u2019s deep command surprised me, and I peered around her boyfriend to see a fire in her eyes that wasn\u2019t there before.</p><p>Liam ignored her and threatened Jax under his breath. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly until I start trying,\u201d Jax shot back.</p><p>And we all did a piss-poor job hiding our smiles as Liam marched off the patio, following K.C.</p><p>One thing I knew right then and there. I might hate Madoc, but I loved his friends.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>MADOC</p><p>I was going to throttle her.</p><p>Not the girl at my feet whose neck I imagined was Fallon\u2019s as I tried not to strangle it but Fallon herself.</p><p>The chick walked around my party as if this was her house, and she had friends here. She and Tate were acting like they were besties already, and Jax was smiling and chatting her up. Next thing I knew Jared was going to be talking shop about her motorbike or some shit.</p><p>What was her game? Why come home willingly after so long when she practically ran from here two years ago? She was only going to be here a week. What was she doing?</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>Taylor, the girl sitting between my legs, had turned around and was questioning me. She looked over at Fallon and then back at me, and I realized that I\u2019d been staring.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>I flashed a smile, trying to appear cocky. \u201cSomeone who likes to watch, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Fallon had been staring, too. We\u2019d been locked in for who knew how long, and I was hoping no one had noticed.</p><p>I did a quick sideways glance around the fire. Jared was whispering in Tate\u2019s ear, while she nuzzled into him, and everyone else was deep in conversation.</p><p>\u201cGet lost, honey.\u201d My date, Taylor, snickered in Fallon\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the middle of a party, honey.\u201d Fallon mimicked Taylor\u2019s fake sweetness. \u201cGet a room.\u201d</p><p>Taylor made a move to get up, but I put my hands on her shoulders, gently pushing her back down.</p><p>Taylor wasn\u2019t a wallflower. She acted catty, but she had the guts to back it up, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d The rumble of a laugh began in my throat, but my tone rang true. \u201cFallon likes to cause trouble. Don\u2019t let her draw you in.\u201d</p><p>Fallon\u2019s green eyes burned across the fire, and I waited for a reaction I thought for sure would come. She always spat something back.</p><p>\u201cYou should watch who you invite to your parties, Madoc.\u201d Taylor leaned her back into the seat of the chair, relaxing again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite her,\u201d I replied. \u201cI feel sorry for her, though. She doesn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d</p><p>Taylor laughed. \u201cYeah, her clothes will only get her enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc, what the hell\u2014\u201d Tate started but got cut off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tate.\u201d Fallon sat up straight and pushed her glasses to the top of her head. The audience around the fire pit had grown as quiet as a graveyard.</p><p>Fallon continued. \u201cWe learned in school that bullies abuse others because they feel bad about themselves. They\u2019re hurting.\u201d She brought up her knees and locked her arms around them, her tone light and taunting. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be mad. We should pity them. Madoc has never had to make a real decision in his entire life, which means he\u2019s never had anything real. This house, the cars, the money. It\u2019s all an illusion. It\u2019s like parading a victory when you missed the war.\u201d She took a breath and whispered slowly. \u201cMadoc has no idea who he is.\u201d</p><p>Something gripped my heart, and it felt like it was spreading across my chest and down my arms. I let the fake amusement in my eyes seep out toward her, but I didn\u2019t feel the humor.</p><p>Fallon had always been so stubborn. Always. She spouted off and said shit that she didn\u2019t think about all in an effort to look tough.</p><p>But now it was different. More calculated. She\u2019d thought about me. Assessed me. And anticipated my reactions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Fallon.\u201d I looked down at the beer in my hand, swirling the brown liquid in the cup. Letting out a condescending sigh, I took out my phone, gesturing. \u201cBut I also know that if I call my parents right now, they\u2019ll both answer. My mom would fly here on a moment\u2019s notice if I needed her, and my dad isn\u2019t hiding from wiretaps or indictments. I also have friends I wouldn\u2019t trade for any of this shit.\u201d I waved my hand, referring to the estate. \u201cAnd I do have something else going for me.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as big as my face would allow and popped up, draining my beer. I didn\u2019t make eye contact with anyone, knowing they were all watching anyway.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it.</p><p>Tossing my cup to the side, I ran down the stone steps to the lower-level deck and circled the pool to where the music was playing near the patio doors to the house. \u201cI can sing.\u201d The sky flashed with lightning as I got ready.</p><p>Clicking to one of my workout playlists, I opened an Offspring song\u2014perfect for this occasion\u2014and grabbed a water bottle to use as a microphone.</p><p>The lyrics started before the music, and I was ready. With a couple of small changes, of course. Offspring\u2019s \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Get a Job?\u201d gave me only a second to catch my breath, because the lyrics started before the music.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s got a wife!\u201d I belted, standing up on the edge of the Jacuzzi. \u201cMan, he hates that bitch!\u201d Everyone spun around to face me.</p><p>I gripped the water bottle and when the drums started, I bobbed my head in rhythm to the beat, letting the crowd feed off my attitude.</p><p>My attitude. It\u2019s what I fed off of as well. It\u2019s what made people like me.</p><p>I continued the song, smiling as the crowd started singing and laughing, too. Beers sloshed as people held up their cups, dancing and hollering their approval.</p><p>A hand wrapped around my wrist, yanking me off the ledge.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep my amusement in check. Everyone was dancing and belting out the lyrics, clearly drunker than I was.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWait.\u201d I held up a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me tips on how to treat a woman? Wait while I take notes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s your family, dickhead.

How many times had he tormented Tate\u2014and now he was pulling the reins on me?</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the time I wanted to help you, and you told me to keep my mouth shut?\u201d I bared my teeth. \u201cTime to take your own advice.\u201d</p><p>Whatever.

He had door duty, checking people\u2019s keys on the way in and sobriety on the way out.</p><p>I turned around, not liking the way he\u2019d asked that. \u201cMy stepsister,\u201d I clarified. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking for her. Why?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his thumb to the front door. \u201cShe just took your car.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. Son of a bitch!</p><p>\u201cYou gave her my keys?\u201d I yelled, pounding down the stairs.</p> <p>He straightened his back, pushing himself against the wall from the stool where he sat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your sister,\u201d he said as if that was explanation enough.</p><p>I held out my hand. \u201cGive me Jared\u2019s keys,\u201d I barked.</p><p>\u201cHe and Tate keep theirs in their room. They weren\u2019t going anywhere tonight, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me Jax\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s mouth dropped open, and he fumbled as he dug through the bowl of keys.</p><p>Leave it alone.</p><p>Go to bed.</p> <p>Or better yet, go get Taylor and go to bed.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered if the angels talked to get me to behave or to entice the devil to come out to play.</p><p>I grabbed the keys out of Sam\u2019s hand and bolted out the door.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>FALLON</p><p>I\u2019d snatched Madoc\u2019s keys and run out of the house, but it wasn\u2019t until I got on the road that I realized I didn\u2019t have any f**king clue where I was going. This town had no friends for me, no family, and there was really nowhere I could run to regroup.</p><p>At least at St. Joseph\u2019s I\u2019d found solace in the chapel. I didn\u2019t go to pray, and I barely participated in the masses even though they were required for students. But I liked the chapel. It was beautiful and quiet. Pray or not, it was a good place to think.</p><p>To plan.</p><p>No such luck right now, though. It was too dark for the quarry, and pretty soon it was going to be too wet for any outdoor space. As it was almost midnight, it was also too late for any public indoor escape, as well.</p><p>Thunder cracked nearby, echoing across the black sky, and I applied the brakes when rain started to splatter the windshield. I\u2019d noticed the lightning and thunder at the party, which was why I\u2019d borrowed Madoc\u2019s car. Didn\u2019t want to get pummeled with rain on my bike.</p><p>When the prince found out, it was going to take them a week to unbunch the panties up his ass. Guys didn\u2019t like their cars messed with.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t like being messed with, so I guessed we were even. I punched the stick shift into fifth gear and hit the gas.</p><p>Slow down and get it together, Fallon.</p><p>I already had what I needed on my mom and Mr. Caruthers. I just needed Madoc.</p><p>But I hadn\u2019t known it was going to be this hard. Seeing him. Knowing that what he said was true. I tried to act like I was stronger. I mean, after everything that had happened, I should be, right?</p><p>Tears burned my eyes, threatening to spill, but I forced down the golf ball\u2013sized ache in my throat.</p><p>As I traveled down the deserted highway, I zoned in on the sound of the spray being kicked up by my tires and the headlights reflected off the black road. Up ahead the lights from the town glowed bright, and I spotted a familiar sign off to the side.</p><p>IROQUOIS MENDOZA PARK.</p><p>Tons of afternoons and weekends spent there flashed through my mind.</p><p>It was where I used to hang out with the few friends I did have when I attended high school here. I shook my head and almost laughed. The park had an awesome skating area.</p><p>Nostalgia pulled me into a left turn, and I drove into the park, coming to a stop right in front of one of the many bowls. Overhead lighting was usually available when events were going on in the park, but tonight everything was eerily dark. I left the car running and the headlights on to illuminate the area.</p><p>Stepping out of the car, I blinked against the light but steady fall of rain. My feet squeaked in my wet flip-flops as I walked to the edge of the deserted bowl and peered down into the smooth, shallow depth. Slipping my shoes off my feet and shivering in my now damp clothes, I sat and then slid down into the bowl, feeling the velvety cement on my toes.</p><p>A shiver ran through my body again, but I wasn\u2019t cold. The night was warm, and although the rain made the air chillier, it was a comfortable temperature. I took a step, breathing hard, feeling too damn closed in by the steep walls around me. They never used to scare me. I used to charge down the vert, relishing how my heart pumped faster as I raced at top speed toward the next incline.</p><p>This was where I used to breathe easier. But now . . .</p><p>I spun around, the low growl of an engine digging through the thick air. The peel of tires pierced the calm as a black Mustang screeched to a halt next to Madoc\u2019s GTO.</p><p>Straightening my shoulders, I tipped my chin up and prepared to face what I knew was coming.</p><p>Madoc jumped out of the car, not even caring to close the door behind him. \u201cYou stole my car?!\u201d he shouted, peering down into the bowl.</p><p>With the headlights behind him, the area was well lit, and I tried to breathe against the flutter in my chest.</p><p>He was here. We were alone. We were angry.</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>This is what I wanted. It\u2019s what I\u2019d planned.</p><p>But I turned my back on him, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019d told myself time and again that I didn\u2019t care what he thought of me. I didn\u2019t want his heart, after all. It wasn\u2019t part of the equation. He didn\u2019t need to love me or respect me for this to work. I would get what I wanted without worrying about whatever was in his head. It. Did. Not. Matter.</p><p>So why couldn\u2019t I just draw him in like I\u2019d planned? Why did I want to spit back?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. I borrowed it, princess,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>He jumped down into the bowl, his flip-flops slapping against the wet cement as he drew closer to me. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my shit, Fallon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you got to come into my room last night and touch me? You don\u2019t get to have everything, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>He stopped a few feet from me, and I felt the walls of the bowl close in as he stared. I expected more yelling and insults, but he just stood there, looking like everything that could destroy me without even speaking a word. Looking like everything that nearly did destroy me.</p><p>He was still dressed in only his board shorts and flip-flops. No shirt. I guess he would\u2019ve left the house in a hurry if he was coming after me. He\u2019d changed so much in the years I\u2019d been gone. Now his shoulders and arms were works of art. Madoc had always liked to work out, and it paid off. He was built like a quarterback, and he was tall. I wished I didn\u2019t feel the invisible cord pulling me to him, wanting to touch him again, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t. We always want what\u2019s bad for us.</p><p>Madoc was hot. He knew it. And he knew everyone else knew it.</p><p>But what was underneath the blond hair, boyish blue eyes, and smooth, toned body was bad. He was bad.</p><p>And someday his looks would fade, and whoever he ended up with would just have someone bad. I had to remind myself of that. There was nothing in him that I should want.</p><p>The light rain blew around his face, and he blinked away the water dripping down his cheeks. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he sneered, looking like he was about to turn away. \u201cI\u2019m so over your bullshit, Fallon. I wish I knew what the hell you wanted from me.\u201d His voice got stronger. \u201cYou act like everything\u2019s fine around Addie and then you show up to my party dressed to impress down to your underwear around all of my friends, and then you bring up my party two years ago.\u201d He got in my face. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d His bellow reared up from deep inside of him.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I shouted, my eyes burning with anger. \u201cI want nothing from you. Nothing ever again!\u201d</p><p>He reared back just a little as if I\u2019d surprised him.</p><p>\u201cAgain? Is that what this is about?\u201d he asked. \u201cUs f**king two years ago?\u201d</p><p>Fucking. I averted my eyes.</p><p>I\u2019d rather shove a drumstick up my nose than let him see how much that hurt. I wiped the water off my forehead and smoothed my hair over the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d He narrowed his eyes, speaking up before I got a chance. \u201cYou can go to hell, Fallon. I was sixteen, too. I was a virgin, same as you. You were all over me, too, and you know it. I didn\u2019t force you! You didn\u2019t have to go and complain to our parents. Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>Huh?</p><p>By that point he was breathing hard. \u201cThey treated me like I was pressuring you or some shit!\u201d he shouted, throwing his hand out into the air. \u201cYou told them that I was forcing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc, I . . .\u201d</p><p>What the f**k was he talking about? My breath, my hands, my knees\u2014everything was shaking.</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Fallon,\u201d he cut me off, getting angrier. \u201cAll you had to do was say something. I would\u2019ve left you alone, but I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>He trailed off, looking at the ground, looking too disgusted to speak with his pursed lips.</p><p>The air in my lungs was gone. What the hell?</p><p>Everything he was saying was like a slap, and I\u2019d been knocked on my ass. What the hell was he talking about?</p><p>I inched closer. \u201cThey told you I complained?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up, and I saw the muscles twitching in his jaw. \u201cYour mother told me that you hated what I was doing to you. That you had to get away from me, and that\u2019s why you disappeared overnight.\u201d Every word bled from his mouth. His cut was deep.</p><p>Goddamn it. I closed my eyes and shook my head. This was not happening!</p><p>If they had lied and told Madoc that I complained, then that meant he thought I wanted to leave. He thought that I went to our parents asking to be sent away.</p><p>I sucked the water off my bottom lip and opened my eyes, meeting Madoc\u2019s scowl.</p><p>Madoc had never wanted me gone. He thought that I ran from him.</p><p>That was unexpected.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t have to change things. If our parents lied to both of us, then I was still putting them under the knife. Maybe Madoc wasn\u2019t as malicious as I had originally thought, but he still wasn\u2019t innocent. He still treated me like a whore, and he never came for me. Never called, wrote, or looked for me. Everything I went through, I went through alone.</p><p>They were all still enemies.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d I brushed past him, climbing back up the incline.</p><p>But before I reached the car, Madoc grabbed the inside of my elbow and whipped me back around. \u201cNo, no. You don\u2019t get to leave until I get an explanation.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, feeling the heat of his skin through my wet shirt.</p><p>\u201cAn explanation?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s genetic, Madoc. Penis size is inherited. Not much you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>I spun back around, heading to the GTO and my jaw aching with a smile I struggled to hold back.</p><p>Opening the car door, I jerked backward as it was slammed shut again by a force behind me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit!</p><p>My heart pounded, and my veins rushed with liquid heat.</p><p>Before I could turn around, Madoc crowded my back, pressing my chest into the car door.</p><p>Air rushed in and out of my lungs, and I felt warm all the way up to my head.</p><p>\u201cTell me you hated it,\u201d he challenged, lips brushing hot on my ear. \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me. His mouth is wet and all over me. I can smell cigarettes everywhere now. From where his mouth and hands were. His fingers glide down my butt and squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go upstairs?\u201d he asks. \u201cI want to see how bad you really are.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. No. \u201cI want to go back outside to the party.\u201d</p><p>Why did I let him kiss me?</p><p>I dart to his left, but he shoves his body into mine, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cBut you got me all turned on. Come on, let\u2019s go have some fun.\u201d He reaches up and runs a thumb over my nipple.</p><p>My eyes widen, and my fists clench, about to hit him.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her.\u201d I hear Madoc\u2019s voice from behind the guy looming over me.</p><p>\u201cGet your own, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my sister.\u201d His voice is sharp. \u201cGet away from her or get out of my house, Nate.\u201d</p><p>Nate backs off of me. \u201cFine. Didn\u2019t know she was your sister, man. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He leaves, but I still feel ashamed.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he barks, grabbing my hand. \u201cI knew you\u2019d show up here, trying to be the center of attention as usual. Looking for a good time just like your mother, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was doing, ass**le.\u201d I try to pull my hand away as he hauls me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? You have friends here? Yeah, didn\u2019t think so.\u201d We stop at my door. He lets go. \u201cGo back to your room, Fallon. Play with your Legos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me, Madoc. And I\u2019m not a slut.\u201d I put my hands on my hips. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to keep calling me one, then I may as well get it over with. Your friend Jared\u2019s outside, right? He\u2019s hot. Maybe he\u2019ll be my first.\u201d</p><p>I walk around Madoc and go for the stairs again. He grabs me and pulls me through my bedroom door.</p> <p>\u201cMadoc, let go of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from my friends!\u201d He lets go but bears down on me, crowding my space. He\u2019s so angry, but I\u2019m not scared.</p><p>\u201cOh, like I\u2019d really beg to be a part of your crowd.\u201d I sneer. \u201cA bunch of Kens and Barbies that get their reliable world news from Facebook.\u201d</p><p>He advances. I\u2019m backed up to my bumper sticker wall.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019re so superior,\u201d he snarls, \u201cbut who was it macking on one of my friends downstairs? For someone that doesn\u2019t care about those people, you seemed pretty ready to open your legs for one of them!\u201d</p><p>I get back in his face. \u201cI do what I want, when I want. No one makes decisions for me, Madoc. Not you. Not our parents. Not my friends. I\u2019m in control. I\u2019m free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree?\u201d he laughs bitterly. \u201cAre you serious? Just because you have shit pierced to your face and a few tattoos? You didn\u2019t get those tattoos because you wanted them. You got them to prove that you could. It\u2019s you trying to prove something, Fallon! You\u2019re. Not. Free!\u201d</p><p>I slap him hard with both of my hands, but he catches me before I can hit him a third time. He holds my wrists, and we stare at each other. Something passes through his eyes, and before I know it, his lips are on mine.</p><p>We both grab at each other. He pulls me hard against him, and his mouth is all over mine. This isn\u2019t like when Nate kissed me downstairs. Madoc feels real. Like nothing is planned. Everything is coming from his gut.</p><p>This feels right.</p><p>He pulls away, breathing hard, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d His eyebrows are pinched together in fear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Fallon. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>I inch back up to him, unable to meet his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I beg. Slowly, I reach out with my shaking hand and take him around his neck, bringing him in.</p><p>He jerks when my lips meet his, but after a few seconds, his arms circle my waist.</p><p>\u201cI like fighting with you,\u201d he chokes out, laying me on the bed and coming down on top. \u201cThis is going to change everything.\u201d</p><p>I pull his T-shirt over his head. \u201cThis changes nothing,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Fallon.\u201d He pushed into me, his lips in my hair. \u201cTell me how much you hated my hands on you . . . my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>I splayed my palms against the door, remembering how my hands had been on every inch of him.</p><p>Madoc became my world two years ago. I\u2019d wait for him at night, my heart pumping a mile a minute, knowing that he was coming. Knowing that he was going to touch me. I loved all of it. I never wanted the sun to come up.</p><p>I pushed back against his long body, the wet heat between my legs nearly making me groan.</p><p>I could barely catch my breath as I twisted my face to the side. \u201cYou want to hear how much I wanted it?\u201d My throat tightened on the words.</p><p>He laid his palms over my hands against the door and pressed into me harder from behind.</p><p>His lips were on my neck. \u201cFuck the past,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI want to hear that you missed it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>MADOC</p><p>I dove down, sucking her neck into my mouth before she got a chance to answer.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d she groaned, and her knees gave way.</p><p>I wrapped an arm around her waist, my lips still devouring her neck, and slammed her into the car.</p><p>Damn her.</p><p>Shit wasn\u2019t supposed to go down like this.</p><p>I threaded my fingers under her hair while I sucked on her neck, then captured her lobe, and kissed her jawline before she twisted her head toward me and I took her mouth in mine. The sweet warmth was more than I could take. My dick jerked, and when Fallon pushed her beautiful ass into me, I almost groaned.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Fallon,\u201d I gasped out, yanking the drenched tank top over her head and throwing it to the ground.</p><p>She dropped her head back against my shoulder, her chest rising and falling fast with her panting. Her desperate eyes pleaded with me before they squeezed shut. Her body was aching. Just like mine.</p><p>I wrapped one hand lightly around the front of her neck and ran a possessive hand across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI want to be inside of you.\u201d I nudged her neck, tipping her chin up to meet my eyes. \u201cBut you better not lie again.\u201d</p><p>Her face was wet, and she blinked away the rain on her eyelashes, looking so desperate that I wanted to tear her apart. All night long. I settled for kissing her, swirling the tip of my tongue against hers and pulling it into my mouth.</p><p>Jesus, she tasted good.</p><p>I reached down and dove into her shorts, cupping her in my hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>I rubbed the wet heat between my middle finger and thumb, ready to f**king explode.</p><p>She squirmed, running her back up and down my chest as she moaned. I rubbed her cl*t with my two fingers and pressed my c**k into her ass.</p><p>Her rain-covered body glistened with the glow from the headlights, and I could feel the pulse between her legs against my fingertips. She was needy and ready.</p><p>Unclasping her bra, I yanked it off her shoulders and unbuttoned her shorts from behind. Pulling those and her panties down her legs, I backed up to look at her.</p><p>She stood on unsteady legs and leaned against the car door, her fingers still splayed across the window.</p><p>Water droplets cascaded down her long, slender back and over her rounded ass to her thighs.</p><p>\u201cSit on the car, baby.\u201d I kept my voice calm even though my body was screaming. I could barely breathe.</p><p>I briefly thought that maybe we should get out of the rain, but it was still hot out, and who was I kidding? She was so beautiful like this.</p><p>Her arms fell to her sides, and she turned around, keeping her chin down and eyes on me. Walking to her right, she sat down on the hood, her feet dangling just above the ground.</p><p>I walked over as well, standing opposite her but keeping my distance.</p><p>Her br**sts were bigger than I remembered, and I wanted to slow down. It\u2019d been too long since I\u2019d touched her, and I wanted to rediscover everything.</p><p>But there was no time. My dick was like a steel rod right now.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d I said in a husky voice, a smile tugging at my lips.</p><p>Her breath caught, and I watched her br**sts rise and fall with excitement. Or nervousness. Her jaw hardened as she met my challenge. Leaning back on her hands, she opened her legs wide, exposing what I wanted.</p><p>Damn this girl.</p><p>My eyes drifted down her flushed and wet body as I untied my shorts, letting them fall to the ground.</p><p>Her eyes went wide as soon as she noticed the glint of silver at my tip.</p><p>Standing between her legs, I gently pushed her back onto the hood slowly, keeping time with AWOLNATION\u2019s \u201cSail\u201d streaming from the car stereo. Then, holding her at the hips, I sunk my lips into her warm, wet stomach, feasting on her soft skin, and then moved up to her nipple, sucking hard.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she moaned and gasped, but I ignored her squirms.</p><p>Moving over, I took the other one in my mouth, sucking and biting, drawing her hard nipple out with my teeth, and damn, I loved how sweet she tasted.</p><p>Two years ago I didn\u2019t know shit. Sure, screwing around with Fallon had taught me a little, but I had still been immature and unsure of myself.</p><p>Now, I knew more, and I knew what I wanted. I wasn\u2019t afraid of taking it and taking chances.</p><p>Moving fast, I upped the pace and kissed down the length of her stomach, every inch bringing me closer to what I really wanted.</p><p>In one rushed movement, I snatched her cl*t between my lips and sucked it like a peach.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d She squirmed, throwing her head back, the hood bending under her movements. I couldn\u2019t see her eyes. Her face was pinched up in pleasure.</p><p>I swirled my tongue around, flicking her a few times hard.</p><p>I hate her, I told myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t trust her.</p><p>She is going to screw me over again.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t care about giving her pleasure.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care that she was enjoying this. I simply wanted her to come in my mouth, so she knew who owned her.</p><p>But the more she grasped at my hair and went wild under me, the more I realized I wanted to hear her call my name. I realized I wanted her to love it.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cMadoc, now!\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw her looking down at me. She ran her hand down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>And that was what I was waiting for. Even though I didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>Standing up, I clenched my teeth, looking down at that beautiful body. That beautiful girl that hated me, and I hated her, but\u2014goddamn it\u2014I loved how we hated, because it was raw and real. It didn\u2019t make any sense, but yeah\u2014it was real.</p><p>Yanking her down to the edge of the car, I held her eyes as I drove inside of her.</p><p>\u201cAhhh. . . .\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut and bared her teeth.</p><p>\u201cShit, Fallon.\u201d I stopped, shut my eyes, and savored the feeling.</p><p>Warm and tight around me, the heat of her spread across my thighs and up my chest. The rain did little to cool me down.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how many guys she\u2019d been with after me, and I didn\u2019t want to know, but I figured my piercing might take a minute to adjust to. Hovering over her, my dick inside of her, I just watched her, waiting for her eyes to open.</p><p>When they did, she looked at me and snaked her hand around my neck, bringing us both halfway in for a kiss. As I massaged her tongue with mine and nibbled on her wet lips, I started to move inside of her slowly at first, feeling every inch of her heat and savoring every little whimper she let loose in my mouth.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, I cupped her breast with one hand and steadied myself with the other hand on the hood of the car. Every muscle in my back was tense, and my shoulders were on fire. The air rushed in and out of my lungs, and I couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. I pounded into her, the volcano between my legs hot and urgent and feeling so damn good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her br**sts bounced back and forth as I moved in and out of her harder and harder.</p><p>Her nails dug into my chest. \u201cMore, Madoc. It feels so good.\u201d</p><p>I stood up straight, pulled her back down to the edge of the hood, and hooked the back of her knees over my arms. \u201cTell me you missed this.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and swallowed. \u201cYes.\u201d She nodded, her whisper coming out shaky. \u201cI missed it.\u201d</p><p>Me, too.</p><p>I entered her again and pounded into her like there was no tomorrow.</p><p>Her back arched, her tits went wild, and she moaned long and loud. \u201cYes . . . oh, my God!\u201d</p><p>She tightened around my dick, her stomach shaking with shallow breaths, and her eyes squeezed shut as she came all over me.</p><p>The fire in my c**k spread through my thighs and burned to the tip. I pulled out, gasping and stroking until I came all over her stomach.</p><p>My throat was dry, and my heart was trying to punch a hole through my chest. I dropped my head down between her br**sts and closed my eyes, feeling her chest rise and fall under me.</p><p>No coherent thoughts formed in my head. Just words.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I had no clue what I was supposed to do now, and her silence told me she was just as baffled as I was. I was about to get off of her when she started running her fingers through my drenched hair.</p><p>Frozen, I just lay there and let her.</p><p>And then I winced, realizing I hadn\u2019t used a condom.</p><p>Shit. Really, dude? You have them in your glove compartment. Why hadn\u2019t I even thought about it? I had always used them, except with Fallon once or twice when we were younger.</p><p>\u201cI never said those things to our parents.\u201d She spoke up, breaking me out of my thoughts.</p><p>Our parents? She was bringing them up now?</p><p>\u201cNever said what?\u201d I kept my chin to her chest but looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cThey lied to you.\u201d She stroked my hair and looked up to the sky. \u201cI never complained about what we were doing, Madoc. They just found out and shipped me off.\u201d</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes, pushing myself up and placing both hands on either side of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you never wanted to leave me?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>FALLON</p><p>What was I doing?</p><p>What the hell was I doing?</p><p>So the parents lied to him. Told him I wanted to leave. That hurt him. Good! That worked for me. Madoc deserved that and more, and while he wasn\u2019t on my hit list to the extreme the parents were, he was still on it.</p><p>But in my post-orgasmic bliss, I wanted to protect his heart. I wanted to keep the memory safe. I wanted to believe that he never used me.</p><p>But he did. He used me good and forgot about me.</p><p>Sleeping with him now was part of my plan. This was all going according to plan, I told myself. It happened sooner than I thought it would and with a lot more wanton behavior on my part, but it had been so long since I\u2019d had sex. It was harder to resist him than I\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Madoc and I were crazy at sixteen. Way too young to be doing what we were doing, but we were learning together.</p><p>Now he was a man, and we both had a lot more confidence. Madoc was good. Very good. I felt guilty that I wanted more of him.</p><p>And his piercing? Holy hell.</p><p>I looked away and sat up, pushing him off me. \u201cNo, Madoc. I didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p><p>He backed up, but I could feel his eyes on me. I knelt down and retrieved my soaked clothes and then turned away, using my tank top to clean off my stomach.</p><p>\u201cHow did they find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I said softly. \u201cWe were too young. What we were doing was wrong. They knew it. Sending me away was for the best.\u201d</p><p>I tried wiggling back into my underwear and shorts, but they were so cold from the rain that still poured down on us. A shiver shot down my arms.</p><p>\u201cBut they lied to me.\u201d He stood there, naked. \u201cAll these years I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe survived, Madoc,\u201d I interrupted, and avoided his eyes as I put on my bra. \u201cI moved on, and so did you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I thought for sure it would have taken me a zillion years to pass out that night, but I fell asleep within seconds. I didn\u2019t even remember lying in bed, trying to get myself to relax. After dealing with Madoc, Addie, the party, and then the \u201crain,\u201d I\u2019d closed my eyes and woken up in pretty much the same position I fell asleep in.</p><p>But as soon as I opened my eyes, I was bombarded with thought after thought, worry after worry, all charging like a storm of elephants through my head.</p><p>I sucked in a breath. Shit. I slept with Madoc!</p><p>That\u2019s okay. It was part of the plan.</p><p>But you liked it. No, I loved it.</p><p>That\u2019s okay. You haven\u2019t had sex in two years. You were horny.</p><p>You told Madoc that the parents lied?</p><p>Okay, so I didn\u2019t want him to believe that I would have said anything like that. I shouldn\u2019t have cared. A minor hiccup that upset nothing in the overall plan. Relax.</p><p>But he\u2019ll confront his dad! His dad will come home. . . .</p><p>So? I want Mr. Caruthers home. My plan would come to fruition in a few days anyway.</p><p>Everything was on schedule.</p><p>I inhaled a cool breath and exhaled a shaky one.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t I happy?</p><p>The first year I\u2019d spent away I was too confused\u2014too numb\u2014to make sense out of everything that had happened, much less get my ducks in a row. But for the past year all I\u2019d fantasized about was seeking my revenge and seeing them hurt. Each one of them. Seeing their worlds turned upside down like mine had been.</p><p>But now my mind just kept traveling back to last night.</p><p>How Madoc\u2019s lips had felt on my neck. How he looked at every inch of my body like he was seeing me for the first time. How much his hot eyes and possessive hands had made me feel like he wanted me.</p><p>He might be a spoiled brat and a self-absorbed ass**le, but he\u2019d blown my mind.</p><p>I needed to remember that just because someone was good in bed didn\u2019t mean anything beyond that.</p><p>This was a game to Madoc\u2014but it was a war to me.</p><p>I rolled over and sat up, swinging my legs off the edge of the bed, but then I immediately dropped my head and blew out a breath.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>My insides felt stretched, and the muscles below my belly were sore. I was sore everywhere.</p><p>Standing up, I tiptoed on wobbly legs across my room and cracked the door open. I heard a vacuum cleaner\u2019s vroom somewhere in the house and knew Addie was awake. Slipping out my door, I sprinted across the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s bedroom had a bathroom. Not mine. I didn\u2019t rate high enough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d a loud voice hollered. \u201cAwesome for me.\u201d</p><p>I twisted to my left and saw Madoc closing his bedroom door and running straight for me.</p><p>A knot lodged in my throat. What the\u2014</p><p>He charged at me like a linebacker, swooped me up by the waist, and threw me over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMadoc! Put me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh . . .\u201d He pushed us through the bathroom door, kicked it shut and planted my ass on the bathroom counter.</p><p>\u201cMadoc\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I was cut off. He snatched up my lips, wrapping his strong arms around me and nearly suffocating me with how much pressure he was putting on my mouth. Every time he took a breath, I did the same, because he came back in for more within a heartbeat. His lips moved over mine, fast and urgent, needy and ready. Both of his hands pushed up under my T-shirt, kneading my br**sts, and I couldn\u2019t help myself. My hands slid down his black pajama pants, grabbing his perfectly smooth ass and pulling him in between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to apologize for my lack of coolness right now,\u201d he gasped out, trying to yank my shirt over my head, but I kept pulling it back down. \u201cI\u2019m hornier than a motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is it a morning thing?\u201d I crossed my arms over my chest to keep my shirt down.</p><p>\u201cMorning?\u201d He started jabbing me in the stomach, tickling me to get my arms to release the shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve been up all f**king night torturing myself. I should never have told you to lock your door last night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d walked me to my room last night, ordering me to lock my door. Apparently, he didn\u2019t always know everyone who partied at his house, and he wasn\u2019t sure who all of the people were passed out around the place. I had only seen three bodies when I\u2019d walked through the house, but there could\u2019ve been more.</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to protect me from ra**sts,\u201d I pointed out, biting my lip to keep myself from giggling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, slick move that was.\u201d He smiled down at me, jabbing me continually in the stomach. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get at you, either.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my face with both hands and slid his tongue into my mouth, devouring me again. Little needles sprang up over my skin, and I shivered, heat pooling between my legs like a furnace. I grabbed his face too, kissing him back.</p><p>He took that opportunity to pull the T-shirt over my head in one fell swoop like a magician that pulls out a tablecloth from underneath a fully set table.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, no,\u201d I commanded pathetically, folding my arms over my chest. \u201cI\u2019m sore from last night.\u201d</p><p>He pinched his eyebrows together and arched a lip. \u201cSore? From me? That. Is. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>Idiot. I shouldn\u2019t have told him that. Now he was feeling like the man.</p><p>\u201cWell, then . . .\u201d He sighed and pulled me down off the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. For now.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. I blinked slow and hard. I\u2019m in control. I\u2019m in control. I\u2019m in control.</p><p>Everything was moving in the wrong direction. He made me smile. He made me forget. We had to slow down.</p><p>We have to stop.</p><p>He tipped my chin up and his mouth came down on mine. I let him kiss me, not making any effort to return it, but I still couldn\u2019t help breathing in his rich, clean scent. Damn, I loved the way he smelled.</p><p>He leaned back, smirking down at me. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back, Fallon.\u201d And then he walked out like he had everything he wanted in the palm of his hand.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>I kicked the door shut behind him and whisper-yelled a bunch of words that I\u2019d only ever heard my father\u2019s dockworkers spew. I didn\u2019t emerge from the bathroom for another half hour as I tried to get my head on straight again.</p><p>Things in Madoc\u2019s life were too easy. He made it too simple to fall back into the fun. His relaxed smile, his carelessness about everything, and the way he was just . . . him!</p><p>There were problems in this world. Problems in families. Problems in my family and his. Our history was a problem. Why did he always appear as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world?</p><p>We\u2019d had hot, angry sex last night after we\u2019d insulted and upset each other. Apparently he didn\u2019t care what had led us there, only that he got his reward.</p><p>Shit. I scratched my head and closed my eyes as I stood in front of my floor-length mirror. I needed some alone time.</p><p>Time to think.</p><p>A nice walk. A good run, maybe.</p><p>But Madoc was like a whirlwind of activity. I\u2019d almost forgotten.</p><p>After I dressed in some short white shorts and a Hurley T-shirt, he\u2019d told me to march my ass back into my room and change. After flipping him off and pouring myself some cereal he\u2019d explained that we were going to the lake with his friends, and I needed to get in a swimsuit. When I told him to go screw himself, that he didn\u2019t make decisions for me, he walked around the counter where I stood eating and stuck his hand down the back of my shorts, continuing to smile and talk to Addie with her none the wiser.</p><p>With my heart missing every other beat and sweat breaking across my forehead, I\u2019d relented, realizing he wouldn\u2019t stop harassing me until I said yes.</p><p>Anyway, Tate was going to be there, so I looked at that as a plus. We\u2019d also be in public, so I could count on him not to try anything.</p><p>Or so I thought.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked as he pulled up to a small, brick one-story house. It sat in a rundown neighborhood with overgrown lawns and ugly chain-link fencing. Although the house itself appeared to be in decent shape\u2014the porch was tidy, and the windows were clean\u2014the brick was dulled with age and the screen door was shoddy.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He ignored my question and climbed out of his GTO.</p><p>Following him, I slammed the door and walked a step behind him up the cement slab walkway.</p><p>\u201cMadoc. Madoc!\u201d</p> <p>I jerked my head and stared wide-eyed as a boy, about seven, came running toward Madoc and slammed into his body. Madoc caught him in a hug.</p><p>A tightness gripped my chest, and I sucked in a breath.</p><p>Blond hair, blue eyes, and long legs. The boy looked just like him.</p><p>No. I shook my head. That\u2019s ridiculous. Madoc would\u2019ve had to be like ten years old when this kid was born.</p><p>\u201cMy mom said if I wasn\u2019t good I couldn\u2019t go with you, but I was good,\u201d the kid shouted, smiling.</p> <p>Madoc leaned back and eyed him with disgust. \u201cGood?\u201d he repeated. \u201cOh man, don\u2019t say that. Being good is like what?\u201d</p><p>Both Madoc and the kid simultaneously stuck their fingers in their mouths and mock gagged. A smile tugged the corners of my mouth, and I had to cover it with my hand.</p><p>Nope. Madoc wasn\u2019t good with kids. I refused to believe it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He patted the kid on the back and turned to face me. \u201cFallon, this is my spawn.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head and looked at him disbelievingly, still trying to get the picture of them both sticking their fingers down their throats out of my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, not my real spawn.\u201d He knew where my mind was going. \u201cBut he has potential, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>I put my hands on my h*ps and kept a pleasant tone for the kid\u2019s sake. \u201cMadoc, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, but a woman came out through the screen door carrying a small backpack.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d she greeted. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked young, definitely under thirty, and she had a nice head of long brown hair pulled back in a neat ponytail. She wore scrubs, so I guessed she was a nurse . . . and probably a single parent from the look of things.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a change of clothes for after he swims.\u201d She handed Madoc the backpack. \u201cThere\u2019s sunscreen, a snack, and some water, too. You\u2019ll have him home by dinner?\u201d</p><p>Madoc nodded. \u201cWe may stop at a bar, but definitely after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d She smiled and shook her head at him as if she were used to his cracks. \u201cHe\u2019s so excited,\u201d she continued. \u201cCall if you have any problems.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc bent down and put an arm around the kid.</p><p>\u201cOhhhhh, Mooooooom,\u201d they both whined as if her concerns were silly.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and held out her hand to me.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Grace. And you are?\u201d Good mom. Making sure your kid is safe.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Fallon. Madoc\u2019s . . . um . . . stepsister,\u201d I stuttered, hoping she didn\u2019t hear Madoc\u2019s snort.</p><p>Technically, I wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. You all have fun.\u201d She waved and walked back up the steps.</p><p>Madoc spun around, and I couldn\u2019t get over how he and the kid not only got along, but how much they looked alike. Both were dressed in long, black cargo shorts with T-shirts. But while Madoc wore black leather flip-flops, the kid wore sneakers.</p><p>\u201cFallon, this is Lucas.\u201d He introduced me finally. \u201cHe\u2019s my little brother. As in the program. I\u2019m his big brother.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled. Okay, good. I was glad he\u2019d explained. Because that was weird there for a while.</p><p>\u201cWow, they trust you with kids?\u201d I asked, kind of serious, kind of not.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He placed his hand on his chest, appearing hurt. \u201cI\u2019m awesome with kids. I\u2019ll be a great dad someday. Tell her, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up at me and didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cHe taught me how to tell when a woman is wearing a thong.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, putting my hand over my mouth.</p><p>Madoc pulled the kid in by the neck as we walked to the car. \u201cI told you, women are the enemy. They don\u2019t understand skills like that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>MADOC</p><p>\u201cWill Jared and Tate be there?\u201d Lucas piped up from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. Don\u2019t kick the leather,\u201d I teased, reaching behind me to stop his feet from digging into my seat. \u201cAnd yes, they\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>We sat there, bobbing our heads to the music, and I couldn\u2019t help but peek at Fallon next to me. What was she thinking? She seemed to get a kick out of Lucas but seemed really surprised to meet him.</p><p>Was it so unusual that I would spend time with a kid that didn\u2019t have a dad? Fallon always condemned me for being pretentious, self-absorbed, and whatever other words struck her on a particular day, but now I gathered that she really did believe it.</p><p>She sat there, staring out the window and completely weirded out by the situation.</p><p>Or maybe it was facing what we\u2019d done last night in the light of day. She used to have a thing about the dark. Being alone in her room, no light, it was as if what we were doing wasn\u2019t real to her.</p><p>While she always fully participated, things changed in the daylight. She\u2019d act like nothing happened. She\u2019d go back to not making eye contact. She\u2019d barely even say my name. I caught on to how she worked pretty quickly and rolled with it.</p><p>Hey, I was sixteen and had a hell of a sex life. I wasn\u2019t going to complain that she wouldn\u2019t let me touch her any other time. I was simply happy that I got what I got at that age.</p><p>But now, touching her, listening to her panting . . . everything we did last night in the rain was even better than I remembered. I used to pace my room, waiting for Addie to close up the house at night so I knew that it was safe to go to Fallon\u2019s room. I was happy and alive when I was with her. I hadn\u2019t felt that for a long time.</p><p>When Fallon left, I crumbled. Like Jared when Tate left for France for a year; I didn\u2019t lose control like he did, but I acted out.</p><p>Her mom had told me that she and my dad found out what was happening, because Fallon ratted us out. Patricia said that Fallon felt uncomfortable and pressured by me. All the confidence I\u2019d built was ripped apart.</p><p>I didn\u2019t handle it well.</p><p>She and I might have lived in the same house, but we had never seen each other as stepsiblings. We had never even spent much time together, so I never felt like what we were doing was wrong. I loved all of it and wanted more of it. But over the past two years my hatred toward her grew.</p><p>Every girl paled in comparison, and the only time I\u2019d felt right was when I had been with Fallon. And then last night, she tells me that she never lied to the parents. Never told them anything. I was overjoyed and pissed off at the same time. My heart pumped fire again, knowing she wanted me, but I\u2019d spent the whole night thinking about all the time we lost\u2014what they took from us\u2014and I wanted shit to hit the fan.</p><p>And it would. Soon.</p><p>If I confronted my dad now, he\u2019d come home and Fallon would be out. So if I couldn\u2019t convince her to stay longer, then I only had a few more days with her until she left for Chicago. I\u2019d deal with my dad after that.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We parked in the lot right next to Jared\u2019s car. Grabbing Lucas\u2019s backpack, I handed that and some towels from the trunk to Fallon while I retrieved the cooler and picnic blanket.</p><p>\u201cTate, stop!\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head up out of the trunk, hearing Jared\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cTate!\u201d He stomped after his pissed-off girlfriend.</p><p>Great.</p><p>I\u2019d started to think my best friends looked for reasons to fight. Seriously. It always ended in makeup sex, after all.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone. I mean it, Jared!\u201d she yelled over her shoulder, and I stood shocked and pretty damn amused when she took off her black flip-flop and threw it at him.</p><p>He threw up his hands, deflecting it from his head and scowling at her, his lips tight.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you,\u201d he barked. \u201cBut you\u2019re overreacting as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d She halted in the middle of the parking lot, ripped off the other shoe, and whipped it at him, damn near flinging her whole body into the movement.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Fallon whispered.</p><p>I sighed, running my hand through my hair. \u201cForeplay.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the trunk shut and started walking for the beach, leaving my friends to it.</p><p>\u201cShould we help?\u201d Fallon stumbled over some rocks, looking behind her to the lot where we could still hear Jared and Tate\u2019s muffled shouting.</p><p>\u201cNot if you want to be in the sandwich. They\u2019ll be making out in ten minutes,\u201d I promised. And that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to be doing with her right now.</p><p>I loved Lucas, but I wished I\u2019d known that Fallon was coming back. I\u2019d have preferred to have her alone right now. To fight. To torment. To whatever.</p><p>Hell, I\u2019d pick a damn fight if it meant getting her na**d again.</p><p>At least until I got her out of my system.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t change the plans for the day at this point, so I set the cooler down and laid out a blanket on the small beach. Kicking off my shoes, I followed Lucas with my eyes as he ran into the water.</p><p>\u201cWait, aren\u2019t you going to make him wear a life jacket?\u201d Fallon asked as she stopped to pull off her shirt.</p><p>I smiled, knowing exactly where she was coming from. There was always a pang of fear, watching him go and do things that could hurt him. Lakes were dangerous, and I had tried making him wear a life jacket the first time we came out here last summer. Yep, I tried the first time, and I never tried again. He fought me on it, and I soon found out that he knew what he was doing.</p><p>I pulled off my shirt. \u201cHis father was in the Coast Guard when they lived in Washington, and he made sure that Lucas knew how to swim. After he died, his mother brought them both back here to be near family, but he doesn\u2019t really have a lot of men in his life or chances to keep practicing. He loves it. I try to bring him as much as possible during the warmer months.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and she looked lost in thought as she stared out at the water.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I nudged, walking past her.</p><p>Trudging through the chilly water, I walked forward as it covered my feet, then my calves and my thighs, and then my stomach. Kicking my feet up, I shot up and dove back down headfirst into the cool depths.</p><p>I f**king hated the lake. It\u2019s dirty and muddy. And cold! You\u2019re swimming around not being able to see what\u2019s happening underneath you.</p><p>Freaks. Me. Out.</p><p>But it\u2019s one of the only things to do in this boring-as-hell town, and I\u2019ve been here too many times with too many drinks and too many girls around. There was a time when that was fun. Hanging out, getting drunk\u2014when you had nothing better to do.</p><p>But now I was only here for Lucas, and for some reason I had wanted Fallon along today. We were probably going to get in a fight in front of the poor kid. And with Jared and Tate doing their thing by\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014fighting again, there would be no buffer zone if Fallon brought out her claws.</p><p>I should\u2019ve left her at home, I guess.</p><p>I popped my head up out of the water and looked to the beach, seeing her in her bathing suit.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>Holy hell. Son of a bitch.</p><p>My dick jerked and instantly hardened\u2014seriously?\u2014even in the cold water.</p><p>Her white bikini was just that. A bikini. In every possible definition of the word, it was evil and temptation in its worst form.</p><p>The bottom piece covered all the important parts, but the top part had strings that tied in the front instead of the back. All you had to do was pull. Not reach around. Not fumble as you try to find the correct string blindly. Nope. You just had to pull and everything would come spilling out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let her hair down out of her ponytail, and all of a sudden my hands felt too empty.</p><p>A splash of water hit me in the back, and I winced.</p><p>\u201cYou little . . . \u201d But I caught myself and just splashed Lucas in return.</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you could use some cooling off.\u201d He laughed, throwing his arm back and swimming away.</p> <p>Cooling off? Did he even know what he was talking about? TV. That\u2019s where kids got this shit.</p><p>Fallon still stood on the beach, hands on her h*ps and pacing the water\u2019s edge, dipping her toes in every once in a while. She looked half ready to either throw herself into the water or turn around and run for the parking lot.</p><p>I jerked my chin up, shouting, \u201cStop giving the kid a lesson in female anatomy and get in the water already.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flashed to mine for a second, but I could feel the heat of her anger even in the chilly water. After teetering for another minute\u2014just to piss me off\u2014she stepped into the lake and waded out until she could dive in.</p><p>About an hour passed as we played and swam in the water. Lucas had fun, even if it took Fallon time to get over herself. At first she stayed back, floating on a raft, treading water, and keeping her distance. But when I got the raft and Lucas tipped her off of it, she\u2019d finally loosened up.</p> <p>They raced each other. She didn\u2019t let him win.</p><p>He and I dunked each other. She started smiling more.</p><p>Jared and Tate came back with two smiles they sucked at hiding.</p><p>And Fallon stayed as far away from me as she could get.</p><p>Which was fine. There was nothing I wanted from her right now anyway.</p><p>Oh, who was I kidding? I was ready to bang my head against a buoy for bringing Lucas out here when all I kept thinking about was ripping those fragile white strings loose.</p> <p>\u201cLucas!\u201d I growled. \u201cGo sit on the blanket with Jared and Tate. Hydrate and eat your snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he whined.</p><p>And I smiled, seeing him swim off as I headed over to Fallon. She sat in the purple recliner raft with her arms resting on the inflated sides. One of her feet dangled off the edge, dipping into the smooth surface of the water.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I squinted up at her, resting my hand on the raft for support. \u201cWhy are you home, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth curled, looking like there was a secret trying to escape. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been so dumbstruck by the fact that she was home that I hadn\u2019t really thought about why until last night. Her mother was abroad. Italy or Spain or something. Spending my father\u2019s money on Gucci and gigolos. And Fallon had no friends here that she kept in touch with that I knew of. She barely had a relationship with my father, who wasn\u2019t at home, either, so the question begged to be asked. \u201cThen why are you at the home of your estranged mother\u2019s husband where you don\u2019t want to be?\u201d</p><p>Her tease of a smile curled more. \u201cAnd where I\u2019m not wanted?\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head back into the water, closing my eyes as images of last night raced through my brain. \u201cOh, you\u2019re wanted,\u201d I taunted.</p> <p>She snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you made it sound when you came into my room the other night.\u201d</p><p>I snapped my mouth closed.</p><p>Yeah, that shut me up. I was kind of a dick the other night.</p><p>Okay, a huge dick.</p><p>I slicked back my hair and bounded up onto the end of the raft, peering over at her as she steadied herself from the jolt.</p><p>\u201cWell, in all fairness, I did think you had lied about me. I had a right to be pissed, Fallon. You never called or came home again. What was I supposed to think?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Just sat there, hiding behind her sunglasses. Her eyes had always looked dark and lost to me, like she was searching for something but wouldn\u2019t know it if she found it.</p><p>I repeated my question. \u201cSo why are you home?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled a heavy breath and finally looked at me straight. \u201cClosure,\u201d she said. \u201cI left without really saying good-bye to this place. I needed that before I started my new life in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Closure. Is that what I needed, too?</p><p>\u201cThey found you in the theater room, didn\u2019t they?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She gave a half-hearted smile. \u201cWearing your T-shirt, and you\u2019d left your jeans on the floor,\u201d she finished, raising her eyes at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYou were asleep,\u201d I explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were still waiting for more.</p><p>\u201cI covered you up?\u201d I offered, drowning like a rat.</p><p>I\u2019d figured out that much. After our first time together, we\u2019d found ourselves going at it every couple of days and then very quickly it became every single night for about a week. Fallon never wanted to leave her room when we were together. On her turf, in the dark, and we didn\u2019t talk about it outside of those boundaries. Those were the nonverbal rules I\u2019d ascertained after our first couple times together.</p><p>But I had my ways. I was finally able to coerce her out of her bedroom and downstairs to the theater room. We\u2019d watched a movie but ended up all over each other like I knew we would. She\u2019d put on my T-shirt and then fallen asleep.</p><p>Looking back now, we were stupid to think we wouldn\u2019t get caught. If they hadn\u2019t found her, then Addie or someone would\u2019ve noticed sooner or later that we were always tired. Since we were spending half our nights together, we got very little sleep.</p><p>Fallon\u2019s low voice seemed almost sad and too forgiving. \u201cIt\u2019s over. In the past, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>Eyes hooded, I looked over at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not over, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was a fluke. We were angry.\u201d</p><p>Darting out my hand before she could move, I grabbed her ankle and pulled her down into the water with me.</p><p>\u201cMadoc!\u201d she yelped before submerging completely in the water. She flailed her arms and shot back up through the water\u2019s surface, sputtering. \u201cSuch an ass**le,\u201d she coughed.</p><p>I pulled the raft in front of us, shielding us from view of the beach.</p><p>\u201cA fluke, huh?\u201d I leaned into her, whispering.</p><p>She held onto the raft, and flecks of gold danced on her face and in her hair from the sun on the water. I waited for her to look at me. Or move away. Or just breathe.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She stared at my chest, waiting. For what, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Reaching out, I ran the back of my hand across her stomach and then grabbed her waist, pulling her in closer to me.</p><p>But she pushed away, sucking in a sudden breath.</p><p>\u201cYour . . . little brother is over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he weren\u2019t?\u201d I cocked my head to the side and breathed into her.</p><p>She finally looked up, her eyes turning to steel. I leaned over and whispered in her ear. \u201cLock your door tonight, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>And I swam off toward the shore, diving deep into the chilly water not warmed by the sun.</p><p>No reason to give a seven-year-old a lesson on the male anatomy, either.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>FALLON</p><p>Enough was enough. I couldn\u2019t let him continue to affect me so much. True, Madoc had grown up. No buts about it. He was smart, fun, and more good-looking than ever. He seemed to care about his friends, and someday, he might even make a good husband and father.</p><p>I just wasn\u2019t the right girl for him, and he certainly wasn\u2019t for me. He\u2019d had me once and forgotten me. Now, I wanted to leave this house of my own free will with my head held high. I wouldn\u2019t be a rat in a cage, dressed to my mother\u2019s approval or a toy for Madoc to play with when he felt like it. I would never want to be like her and end up with her life. Jason Caruthers cheated on his wife\u2014constantly. Although my mother also cheated. I\u2019d found that out\u2014not that I had doubted it anyway\u2014through my preparations.</p><p>Their marriage was empty and superficial, and Madoc had grown up with an innate entitlement. He knew he could do what he wanted, when he wanted, and if a girl didn\u2019t like it, another one would come along to replace her.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be one of the numbers.</p><p>I trudged out of the water, shivering as the air hit my wet skin. Tate leaned back on her hands, legs bent and her bikini slightly more modest than mine. I would\u2019ve worn a one-piece if I\u2019d known a kid was going to be here. Jared lay on his back next to her with a hand on her thigh and his eyes closed. Lucas was eating an apple and peanut butter sandwich crackers.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up now?\u201d Madoc asked Jared and Tate as he grabbed a towel and threw it at me. I reached up just in time to stop it from hitting me in the face.</p><p>Jared sighed as in \u201cHere we go.\u201d \u201cI asked her to move in with me,\u201d he admitted, and my eyebrows shot up.</p><p>Madoc snorted. \u201cAnd she threw shoes at you? Sounds like a marriage to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Chicago,\u201d Tate clarified with a sharp, scolding tone. \u201cHe asked me to move in with him in Chicago. I told him that I want to be around for my dad more, so I\u2019m going to Northwestern instead of Columbia. He then tells me that he didn\u2019t want to go to New York anyway and wanted to stay in the area to be close to Jax.\u201d</p><p>Madoc busied himself taking out waters from the cooler. \u201cSo that\u2019s good. It\u2019s a win-win. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is,\u201d I chimed in for Tate and turned toward Madoc, \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t communicating with her. He already had his own plans that he wasn\u2019t involving her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did she,\u201d he argued back.</p><p>\u201cBut he sounds like he never wanted to go to New York.\u201d My voice got louder, and I could feel Tate\u2019s and Jared\u2019s eyes on me. \u201cNow she feels like she pressured him or was making him do something he didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Madoc rolled his eyes. \u201cCover your ears, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Lucas obeyed, and Madoc looked around the circle, meeting everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Tate, but you\u2019ve been living in f**king rainbow-sprinkle-cupcake land if you actually thought that Jared Trent was going to move to New York City. People don\u2019t drive there. How\u2019s he supposed to stretch his legs? Do you even know how much it would cost to park a car there?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes were still closed, but his chest shook with silent laughter that he was smart enough to keep to himself.</p><p>Tate\u2019s jaw hung open, and not in a wow-that-really-made-sense kind of way. It was more of a what-an-asshole-I\u2019m-going-to-dropkick-him kind of way. I couldn\u2019t tell for sure, but Madoc probably felt the heat of her fire behind her sunglasses.</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that his car is more important than her?\u201d I yelled at Madoc.</p><p>He blew out a sigh and walked behind me, standing at my back and covering my mouth with his hand.</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice as he spoke to Jared and Tate. \u201cSo you\u2019ll both be in Chicago. I\u2019ll only be an hour and a half away at Notre Dame. Win-win.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Around four o\u2019clock, Jared and Tate left to go break the news to her father about her change in college plans, and Madoc and I took Lucas home in time for dinner.</p><p>Madoc drove the twists and turns of the quiet roads leading to our\u2014his\u2014house, and neither of us broke the silence. The tension was thicker than wet clay, and I didn\u2019t know what was on his mind. He was usually such a chatterbox. Now, he looked almost stoic as he zoned out on the road and sped over the black highway. Trees loomed on both sides, making me feel like we were in a cave.</p><p>\u201cFallon,\u201d he started, and I looked to him. \u201cWe\u2019re not sixteeen anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, not sure what that meant.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He yanked down on the stick shift, sending us into sixth gear. Between looking out the window and the front windshield and not meeting my eyes, he looked uncomfortable as hell. \u201cI think we can get along better if we grow up. You can stay the summer if you want.\u201d</p><p>What? Was he serious? When the punch line didn\u2019t come, I just averted my gaze out the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He doesn\u2019t want me to stay, I thought to myself. Or maybe he did.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pussy-on-the-Premises, right?\u201d I felt the flutters in my stomach dull as I realized why he probably wanted me to stay.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. Why else would he want me around? We may have cleared up some miscommunication, but he still saw me as damaged goods. Not good enough, just like my mother said.</p> <p>And I didn\u2019t much like him, either. Even if he really did want me to stay, would I want to suffer his company all summer?</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted pu**y, I could get it, Fallon.\u201d He blew me off. \u201cBut what can I say? I kind of like having you around, I guess. And I know you like me, too. As much as you try to hide it, I still turn you on. So stop acting like you don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>I ground my teeth together as he pushed the button on the remote on his visor, opening the gate to his community.</p><p>Was he serious? Did he not realize that just because two people have fun in the bedroom doesn\u2019t mean anything? People go to bars, know each other for an hour, and go home together! One has nothing to do with the other.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I really don\u2019t like?\u201d I huffed, climbing out of his GTO as he parked in front of the house. \u201cI hate your car! It sits too low, they\u2019re too many blind spots, and it looks like a Chevy Cavalier which would\u2019ve cost you half the money as this waste of metal!\u201d</p> <p>I ran into the house, hearing his laugh behind me. \u201cYou seemed to love it last night when you were screaming my name!\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Who was I kidding? I\u2019d have better success trying to jam a tree branch up my ass than convince myself I didn\u2019t want him. But who cares, right? Yeah, I want him. Sure. Who wouldn\u2019t? I could enjoy this. Just one more time. I just have to be the one in control, that\u2019s all.</p><p>Jumping in the shower, washing, and jumping back out took me less than two minutes. My hands were shaking a bit, and I was blinking a lot\u2014something I do when I\u2019m trying not to think. I dressed in black lace panties and a pale pink vintage satin bra. Actually, it was only a bra in the sense that it covered my br**sts, but there was no support. It was loose like a slip that had been cut off right under the boob area.</p><p>Madoc was going to love it. Not only was it sexy, but it was user-friendly lingerie. He didn\u2019t need to remove it to get his hands where he wanted them.</p><p>Letting my hair out of the ponytail, I fluffed it, leaving it a little tangled\u2014Madoc seemed to like it that way\u2014and applied a little mascara and color to my lips. Before heading to the door, I snatched my black-framed glasses off the bedside table. The hall was dark as I jogged the few feet across the hall to Madoc\u2019s room. Slipping inside, I heard the water in his shower running, and smiled as I headed to his bed.</p> <p>Good. I wanted to be here before he got out. For once, I wanted to surprise him.</p><p>I sat on the end, clenching my teeth to keep my smile from escaping. Heat raced through my veins, and my toes curled into the beige carpet as I put both of my palms down on the bed next to my hips.</p><p>How should I do this? I bent my legs a number of different ways, tried a slew of different poses, but everything felt unnatural. Legs spread, not spread. Leaning back on my hands, lying down on my side. It was all stupid. Madoc was going to laugh.</p><p>Okay, maybe not, but still . . .</p><p>Everything tonight was my way, I reminded myself. I didn\u2019t want to let him dominate me.</p><p>I decided to leave my feet flat on the ground, legs together, with my hands folded in my lap.</p><p>The water shut off, and I tried to force my heartbeat into a calmer pace.</p><p>Madoc walked out, black towel around his waist, and immediately locked eyes with me.</p> <p>His eyes went round, and his mouth snapped shut. He looked intense and a little angry.</p><p>I was afraid for a moment, afraid I\u2019d overstepped my bounds by coming in here after him even though he\u2019d invaded my space numerous times, but then I looked down. The bulge under his towel was growing. I fisted my fingers and tried not to feel pride, but it was impossible.</p><p>My confidence boosted me up like a pair of six-inch heels.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d I taunted, leaning back on my hands. \u201cI changed the game.\u201d</p><p>He inched closer to me, his steps like a beast of prey. \u201cNot mad, really. Just surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve had other girls in this bed, haven\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy not me?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t really thought about it until the moment I asked the question, but it was true. Madoc had slept with other girls in this bed, in this room. Probably.</p><p>But never me.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d His voice, sultry and sexy, played with me.</p><p>But I faltered.</p><p>Did I want that?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t love girls in this bed,\u201d I assumed. \u201cYou f**ked them.\u201d</p><p>They were in, and then they were out, only to be replaced with another one.</p><p>I could talk myself up one hill only to find that I was still at the foot of mountain.</p><p>I did not want to be used, forgotten, and nameless.</p><p>He was right. What the hell am I doing? I looked everywhere but at his eyes, not sure where the answers were or even what the hell my questions were anymore.</p><p>Madoc and I could screw tonight. I could walk out of here instead of being kicked out . . . but what would Madoc have really lost?</p><p>Nothing. Having sex with him and then taking it away didn\u2019t hurt him at all.</p><p>I blinked long and hard, finally seeing how stupid I\u2019d been. So I stood up, tears stinging my eyes, and I swallowed the lump in my throat. \u201cNo, I guess I don\u2019t want that after all,\u201d I whispered and walked past him out the door.</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d I heard him call, confusion lacing his voice</p><p>But I was gone.</p><p>Running across the darkened hallway, I dove in my own room, slammed my door shut, and locked it. I collapsed against the door, breathing hard, and closing my eyes so the tears wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t cried in years. I was always able to stop it, to swallow it.</p><p>You can do this, I told myself. Just do it. Before you do anything else stupid.</p><p>My phone sat on my bedside table, and I opened my last text.</p><p>Will post when you\u2019re ready.</p><p>That text was three days ago when I arrived. My weak fingers tapped out my response.</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d Madoc knocked on the door, and I stopped typing.</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone,\u201d I ordered, talking to the closed door.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Excuse me? I raised my voice to respond to him. \u201cYou told me to lock the door to keep you out, dickhead. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came up with that line when I was sixteen and had toothpicks for arms!\u201d His muffled voice got louder. \u201cI have muscles now,\u201d he continued, \u201cand this door is going to be firewood in five seconds if you don\u2019t open up!\u201d</p><p>I raced over and yanked the door open. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d He pushed past me into the room, turning around to face me. \u201cWe had a fun day. And I had an even better night planned, beginning with the Jacuzzi.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did.</p><p>I slammed the door shut behind him, shaking my head and letting out a bitter laugh. \u201cI told you to leave me alone. Why can\u2019t you just do that?\u201d My tone stayed flat, but the muscles in my arms and legs were rigid as I walked past him.</p><p>He hooked my elbow, bringing us face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cYou come into my room, dressed like that.\u201d He gestured up and down my body. \u201cAnd then you run out, expecting me to not wonder what the hell is going through your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? You don\u2019t care. Not about anyone but yourself, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my arm away and walked over to the side of the bed, putting a safer distance between us.</p><p>His eyebrows were pinched together in confusion, like he didn\u2019t understand what I was getting at. Why would he? I\u2019d done a complete about-face from earlier, letting him seduce me, and then I\u2019d changed the game and tried to seduce him to prove that I could. Crashed and burned at that\u2014and now I was pushing him away. He was confused, and he should be. I sure was. I had thought I knew exactly what I wanted to have happen when I came back here.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is this coming from? Is this about the other-girls-in-my-bed question?\u201d he asked, inching toward me.</p><p>A small, quiet sigh escaped me, and with it, my plan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you about other guys, but I don\u2019t.\u201d His expression was angry. \u201cYou want to know why? Because I would care. Do you really want to know how many girls I\u2019ve had in my bed? How many girls I\u2019ve slept with?\u201d</p><p>He would care?</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to know. We\u2019re not in a relationship,\u201d I bit back.</p><p>Madoc stood immobile, his face hardening a bit and his chin lifting a little, but other than that his body was like stone. I didn\u2019t know if he was angry, hurt, confused, or annoyed. But I knew he was thinking. I watched his large frame, his black pajama pants hanging low on his hips, walk across my bedroom, take my wide gray cushioned chair, and carry it to sit in front of my floor-length mirror.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he commanded, and I curled my toes, staying planted where I was.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t budge, he softened his voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He planted himself in the chair and looked at me through the mirror, waiting.</p><p>He leaned back, slouching, with his legs about a foot apart. His chest glowed smooth in the barely lit room, and I had to lick my lips, because I was so thirsty all of a sudden.</p><p>This is ridiculous! I planted my hands on my hips, trying to look away but always reverting back to his gaze.</p><p>Okay, screw it.</p><p>I dropped my hands and walked over slowly, trying to look bored. Madoc took my wrist and led me around the front of the chair, yanking me down into his lap.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I argued, trying to stand up again, but his hands held my waist.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>I huffed, but I stopped, if only to see where this was going.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I snarled, inching my ass up his body, because straddling his thigh was . . . yeah.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He tipped his chin up. \u201cLook in the mirror. What do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes!\u201d he barked, and all of the hairs on my body shot up.</p><p>Shit. Yeah, you could never tell when Madoc was going to go from easy to scary, but it was always sudden.</p><p>Reaching around, he twisted my chin toward the mirror, and I sucked in a breath. \u201cWhat do you see?!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou and me!\u201d I blurted out. \u201cMadoc and Fallon!\u201d</p><p>My heart was racing.</p><p>I looked at him through the mirror. I sat on one side of his lap, so he could see from the other side, and we stared at each other, my chest rising and falling more urgently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I see,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cThose names mean nothing to me. They\u2019re simple and empty. When I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t see the daughter of a gold-digging bitch and an Irish drug lord or the son of a crooked lawyer and a vegan Barbie.\u201d</p><p>I almost wanted to laugh. Madoc had an ironic way of looking at the world.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t smiling. He was scowling. He was dead serious, and I knew from experience that his genuine moments were few and far between.</p><p>He reached up, threading one hand into my hair while the other hand rested on the chair.</p><p>\u201cI see everything I want for as long as I can have it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI see a woman that wears the cutest little scowl like she\u2019s two years old and was just told she couldn\u2019t have candy. I see a guy that went and got an apadravya piercing, because he wanted to live in her world for even a little while.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Don\u2019t do this to me, Madoc.</p><p>\u201cI see a beautiful woman with a knockout body and the guy she drives insane with wanting her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand moved to my neck, stroking up and down.</p><p>\u201cI see a thousand nights of kitchen counters, showers, pools, and couches where he\u2019s going to f**k her until she screams.\u201d He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cI see her eyes and how they look when she comes.\u201d</p><p>My ni**les hardened, and I had to start sucking in air. Opening my eyes, I could see his blue ones, shining like crystals, watching me.</p><p>\u201cI see the guy that went so crazy when she left that he tore all of the shit off his walls, thinking she hated him.\u201d</p> <p>My face cracked, and my eyes watered; the lump in my throat had grown too big for me to swallow around.</p><p>\u201cMadoc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he cut me off, trailing his hand over my stomach and into my lacy top, \u201cthe body he sucked rain off of last night and he wants in his mouth right now, because, baby, you are torturing him.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, kissing my upper arm in soft, sensual kisses, trailing over to my back. He flipped my hair over my shoulder, digging his lips into my spine and going up as I dropped my head back onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMadoc . . .\u201d I gasped, tingles spreading down my back.</p> <p>His lips . . . oh, my God, his lips.</p><p>His hands were both under my slip-bra, kneading and squeezing as I started rolling my h*ps into him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, look at you.\u201d His breathless voice made my sex clench.</p><p>I opened my eyes, seeing what he saw.</p><p>A young woman in lingerie, sitting on a man\u2019s lap backward with his hands up her shirt. Our eyes met, and the heat made me want to tear him apart with my teeth. I wanted him.</p><p>Fuck, I wanted him.</p> <p>Snuggling my head into his, I kept my eyes on him in the mirror as I reached down and slipped my hand inside my panties. His eyes became as sharp as needles as he watched me. I spread my legs and gently ran my fingers up and down my heat, watching him watching me.</p><p>He leaned back, continuing to stroke my back with one hand while he just took me in.</p><p>Having his eyes on me, having him so interested, was doing things to my body I didn\u2019t expect. Madoc always used to be in a hurry, and then last night was pedal to the metal.</p><p>But now he looked like he owned the room. He looked like I was his and he wasn\u2019t rushing to have me before the sun came up.</p><p>Standing up, I slid my hands down the sides of my panties and slipped them off, letting them slide down my legs. His hands fisted where they hung off the armrests, and I saw him harden through his pants. His body needed me, and the pulse on my cl*t throbbed. One time. Two times. Three.</p><p>Damn. Everything about Madoc was intense and made me feel good.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d I wanted to tell him that I didn\u2019t hate him. That I thought about him. That I was sorry. But the words won\u2019t come. \u201cMadoc, I . . .\u201d I let out a breath. \u201cI want you here.\u201d</p><p>And I sat down in his lap backward, facing the mirror. \u201cI want you like this.\u201d</p> <p>A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, and then I gasped as he put a hand on the front of my neck and pulled me back to him.</p><p>Our lips came together, moving over each other. Then I reached around and slid my fingers into his soft, short hair, kissing him as if it was the only thing I ever needed to survive. His hand slid down my stomach, and I spread both of my legs to rest on the outside of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I whispered, pleading. \u201cI\u2019m burning already.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand and led it between my thighs, sucking in a breath when his fingers slid inside of me.</p><p>Oh, God, yes.</p><p>His fingers moved, my wetness easing him in and out, but the fire in my belly had me so hungry I started rubbing into his hand.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you say my name.\u201d His head fell back, and his chest rose more quickly. He looked like he was enjoying this although I wasn\u2019t touching him. He just liked touching me that much?</p><p>My h*ps rocked into his hand, and for the first time in two years, I wanted things. I wanted this. I wanted him. I wanted it all again.</p><p>But I knew I couldn\u2019t have it. I knew this was it for us.</p><p>This was the last time he\u2019d make love to me. The last time I\u2019d kiss him.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d want me.</p><p>And I wanted to bury my face in my hands and scream that I didn\u2019t have to do this. I didn\u2019t have to walk away, but there was just too much between us to get past.</p><p>Instead I stood up and turned around, straddling his lap and facing him.</p><p>Running my fingers down the side of his face, I kept my voice quiet for fear I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back the tears. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d My throat ached so hard I could barely whisper. \u201cI want to kiss you when you come.\u201d</p><p>I leaned up on my knees, giving him room to push his pants down. Before he kicked them off, I reached into his pocket for the condom.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that was in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a confident son of a bitch,\u201d I whispered huskily, not sounding sarcastic in the least.</p><p>I shoved the condom into his hand before wrapping my hungry arms around his neck and kissing him hard. His lips worked mine, and we didn\u2019t lose the connection when he worked behind my back to get the condom on. Rocking my hips, I rubbed against his thick hardness, feeling the burn get heavier and heavier as the pulse in my cl*t pounded harder and harder.</p><p>\u201cNow, Fallon,\u201d he breathed out, letting his head fall back on the chair. I hesitated, hearing my name. He used to call me \u201cbaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay my name again.\u201d I sat down on his cock, and we both closed our eyes with the sensation.</p><p>I was filled.</p><p>\u201cFallon,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s kissing you right now?\u201d I trailed soft kisses along his jaw, slowly sucking and biting until he moaned.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cNot Jesus.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFallon.\u201d And he put his head up and looked straight at me as I slowly moved up and down his length.</p><p>Up so slowly, watching his eyes as he watched my body move on him.</p><p>And back down, taking him in, amazed how his lids would close with the sensation. I\u2019d never done this before. I was never on top, and he felt so good like this.</p><p>I mean, he always felt good, but the angle of him in the chair got him so deep.</p><p>I could feel him rubbing the walls of my womb. That piercing made me want to slow down and speed up, but it also made me never want to stop.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s riding you?\u201d I held his face, my thumbs on his cheeks and fingers at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d It seeped out of his mouth like a bullet in slow motion. My breath caught in my throat as he wrapped his arms around my waist and shot up, guiding my legs around his body. Air rushed in and out of my lips as he just stood there, his mouth touching mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to win this game, Fallon. Though I like how you play.\u201d</p><p>He slammed me up against the mirror, sinking his mouth into mine before letting my legs fall. God, his kiss stole my breath, but I didn\u2019t care that I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>As soon as my feet touched the ground, he spun me around and cupped both of my br**sts, burying his mouth in my neck.</p><p>I watched him in the mirror, and I no longer gave a damn about owning him or dominating him.</p><p>Although I wanted to control this, it was clear I wasn\u2019t in control now. Until he said, \u201cWhy do you drive me so crazy, Fallon?\u201d His breath was ragged, and his hands and lips moved rough and fast. \u201cWhy does it have to be you?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when I realized he wasn\u2019t trying to dominate me. He was desperate.</p><p>I was in control.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I whispered, turning my head and melting my lips into his.</p><p>Breaking away, I widened my legs and leaned forward into the mirror. \u201cPlease, I need you.\u201d I could feel the heat of him on the inside of my leg.</p><p>Madoc positioned himself and slid into me. I bit my lip at the sweet pain of his depth.</p><p>\u201cSo good.\u201d It was barely a whisper as I felt the rest of my insides fall apart around his thick length inside of me.</p><p>And then he closed his eyes and laid his head back, his voice shaky. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin me, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>No more than you ruined me.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>FALLON</p><p>I try to pull my hand free from her grasp. \u201cMom, no! Please!\u201d</p><p>My chest is about to explode. I want to scream and hurt her. Tears spill down my face in a constant stream.</p><p>\u201cYou will do this, Fallon,\u201d she shouts, yanking me further. \u201cStop whining, and do what you\u2019re told!\u201d</p><p>My feet stumble across the ground as she pulls me closer to the door that I don\u2019t want to enter.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this! Please, I\u2019m begging you. Please!\u201d</p><p>She stops and faces me. \u201cWhat do you think is going to happen, Fallon? You think he\u2019s going to marry you? He\u2019s not even going to stay with you. If you don\u2019t do this, your life will be over. Everything I\u2019ve worked so hard for will be over.\u201d</p><p>Part of me knows it is hopeless. I put my hands on my stomach, feeling the nausea roll.</p><p>Six weeks. It had been six weeks since I\u2019d seen him and eight weeks since I\u2019d gotten pregnant. Or so the doctor had said.</p><p>Did Madoc miss me? Was he thinking about me? I wish I could go back and be nicer to him. When he\u2019d tried to kiss me in the gym after school, I shouldn\u2019t have pulled away. I miss him, and I hate that I miss him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to love him.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>The clinic\u2019s shadow looms over us as I wipe at my tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want it so much?\u201d she snarls.</p><p>My heart still beats fast, but I keep my temper in check. \u201cBecause it\u2019s mine. It\u2019s Madoc\u2019s and mine. I need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already moved on to someone else.\u201d She takes out her phone and shows me the screen. My stomach hollows out at the sight, and I cringe at the pain of trying to hold back the tears.</p><p>He\u2019d posted photos on Facebook of a party at his house. He had his arm around another girl.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think he loved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>She sticks her phone back in her Prada bag and fists her manicured hand at her side. \u201cDid he ever tell his friends about you? Did you ever go on a date with him, Fallon? It wasn\u2019t love for him! He used you, Fallon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d I advance in her space, the agony painful in my tense muscles. \u201cHe loves me. I know he does.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been so mean to him for so long, but I know he wants me. He never looked at other girls around me. And I can\u2019t stand being without him.</p><p>She throws a hand in the air. \u201cWell, congratulations and welcome to the Land of Every Female Is an Idiot!\u201d she shouts. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been here at least once. \u2018He smiled at me. He really loves me. He opened the door for me. He really loves me.\u2019\u201d She looks straight at me. \u201cLet me tell you what I\u2019ve learned about women and men. Women overanalyze everything, and men think only about themselves. Madoc never went public with you. He doesn\u2019t want you!\u201d</p><p>I blinked awake, the vibrations from my phone rousing me. The room was dark, and I glanced over at the clock to see that it was only midnight. The dream was still fresh, and I noticed sweat around my hairline. I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hands and pushed the images away.</p><p>Leaning over the side of the bed, I grabbed my cell off the floor. I remembered it had gotten knocked down with Madoc earlier.</p><p>Madoc.</p><p>I twisted my head to the side to see he was asleep next to me. He looked so peaceful, and I lay back down to look at him.</p><p>He rested on his stomach, and the sheet was pulled down to his waist. His hair had been wet after his shower, and after all of our activity, it had dried in a mess. It stuck up in twenty different directions and made him look younger. Or maybe just more carefree than he already was. His arms hugged the pillow under his head, and I envied his slow, even breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tattoo on his back had thrown me for a loop whenever I\u2019d caught sight of it during the past two days. I would always immediately think it was my name. I wondered what the word \u201cFallen\u201d meant, but I also knew I would never ask.</p><p>My phone buzzed in my hand, and I took a deep breath, opening up the message.</p><p>My father had called twice and texted. My mother had also called and left messages. I deleted those without even listening. I knew it would be a rant about why I\u2019d come here or more bullshit I didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>Opening my father\u2019s text, I saw the two messages.</p> <p>Fallon?</p><p>Do you want me to release this?</p><p>Looking over at Madoc, I knew my plan had changed. I typed out my response.</p><p>No. Send it to Caruthers instead.</p><p>You sure? he shot back.</p> <p>No, I wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to do this anymore, but it was the only way I\u2019d feel any closure. Madoc and I didn\u2019t have a future. It wasn\u2019t love, and I wasn\u2019t going to deceive myself for even a minute longer.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Opening a new text, I sent one to Madoc\u2019s father.</p><p>Check your e-mail. I\u2019ll meet you in your office. You have two hours.</p><p>Guys like him slept with their phones, but I knew he was probably still awake screwing his mistress.</p><p>He texted back within minutes. On my way.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cKatherine Trent.\u201d</p><p>I dumped a folder onto Jason Caruthers\u2019s desk and plopped myself down in the seat across from him.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, looking hesitant, and opened the folder. His lips tightened as he sifted through the documents, receipts, and photographs. \u201cWhy have you done this?\u201d he asked, closing the folder with a cool calmness like he already had me handled.</p><p>I looked at Jason, looking so much like his son will in thirty years, and I hated them all over again. With his short-cropped blond hair styled better than most guys twenty years younger than him and a crisp black suit, Mr. Caruthers was still a good-looking man. No wonder my mom jumped on him even before she was divorced from her last husband. He was rich, handsome, and influential. The perfect package to a gold digger.</p><p>Although I couldn\u2019t say he was ever cruel to me, his presence intimidated me. Just like Madoc. In my skinny jeans and Green Day T-shirt, I didn\u2019t have the armor to withstand him.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d I bit back.</p> <p>\u201cMoney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your money.\u201d My words were clipped, and I wanted to burn shit when I was around this guy. \u201cI\u2019d take my father\u2019s dirty cash before I\u2019d take anything from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d he asked, getting up and going to the bar to pour himself a drink of something brown.</p><p>I sat up straight and looked out the window behind his desk, knowing he could hear me. \u201cGetting up while someone is speaking is rude.\u201d</p><p>I felt him still and waited only a moment before he was back in front of me, sitting down at his desk.</p><p>\u201cI was going to leak what you saw in the e-mail. Paying off judges\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne judge\u2014\u201d he chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAnd the affair that you\u2019ve had going on for quite some time with Ms. Trent,\u201d I continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve been carrying on with her through two marriages.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it when I\u2019d found out. As I dug into his affairs, it wasn\u2019t a surprise that he\u2019d been sleeping with other women. Hell, both he and my mother started to wander fairly quickly after their marriage. Madoc and I both knew. Even though he and I didn\u2019t talk much back then, I knew he saw that their marriage was a sham, just like I did. We knew the four of us were never any kind of family. Which was why we never felt solidarity.</p><p>Until the week things changed and we started sleeping together.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leak the story?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Good f**king question.</p><p>I kept my arms resting on the chair and maintained eye contact. Caruthers could sense weakness easily. It was part of his job.</p><p>\u201cBecause as it turns out, I\u2019m not a bad person,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt would hurt people that don\u2019t really deserve it, and I\u2019m not willing to do that. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He looked honestly relieved, and f**k him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p><p>He folded his hands on his table. \u201cWhere is my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsleep.\u201d I smirked. \u201cIn my bed.\u201d</p><p>Men like Jason Caruthers rarely shout, but I knew he was angry. He had that whole close-your-eyes-and-breathe-out-slowly thing going on.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want from me, Fallon?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI want you to divorce my mother.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, but I continued. \u201cMake sure she\u2019s taken care of, of course. I don\u2019t love her, but I don\u2019t want her on the streets, either. She gets a house and some payoff cash.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been trying to divorce her, Fallon? Your mother is fighting the inevitable. She doesn\u2019t want a divorce, and the attention of a long, messy legal battle would be right up her alley. Believe me, I can divorce her and not lose much doing it, either. But not without a media circus.\u201d</p><p>Poor guy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of my concern. I don\u2019t care how you go about it or how it hurts you. If you want quick and easy, then I suggest you open your wallet wider.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together, and I could tell he was thinking. I wasn\u2019t worried. A lawyer like him can\u2019t beat his wife in court? Please. He cared about his reputation and nothing more. He was right. My mother would do anything to get attention, and she\u2019d drag him through the mud. But she had a price.</p><p>Everyone does.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d He raised his eyebrows, clearly not liking the terms so far.</p><p>\u201cOne of my father\u2019s associates, Ted O\u2019Rourke, is up for parole in September. See that it gets approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d He shook his head at me again. \u201cI defend the bad guys. I have no pull with the parole board.\u201d</p><p>Who was he kidding?</p><p>I leaned in, placing my hand on his desk. \u201cEnough with the helpless act. Don\u2019t make me ask twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it.\u201d He cocked his head at me. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I gave a closemouthed smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Your mother and Ted O\u2019Rourke. Nothing for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Standing up, I tucked a few strands of hair behind my ear and dropped my arms to my side. Putting my hands in my pockets would also be a sign of weakness.</p><p>\u201cThis was never about me, Jason, but you made it about me, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you freaked when you caught Madoc and me together. You knew who my father was and what my mother was like by then, and you assumed the worst about me. You didn\u2019t want your only son playing in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cFallon, you were only kids. It was too much, too fast. I always liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d I shot back. \u201cThe guilt, the sadness, the abandonment by adults that were supposed to stand by me at the very least, and everything that happened afterward was stuff I should never have gone through. Especially alone.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes in confusion. \u201cWhat stuff afterward?\u201d</p><p>I lost my scowl. Didn\u2019t he know?</p><p>Of course. Why would I have thought my mother would have told him?</p><p>I shook my head, ignoring his question. Who cared? It\u2019s not like he would have protected me anyway.</p><p>\u201cThose are the pictures I have of Katherine Trent. I kept nothing digital.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re just letting me have them now? That\u2019s not how blackmail works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t blackmail,\u201d I sneered. \u201cI\u2019m not like you. But I know a lot of bad people, and that\u2019s why I know that you\u2019ll do what I\u2019m asking. If you keep your word, I\u2019ll say nothing.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew who my father was and the kind of people I knew through him. I would never have used them to hurt anyone, but he didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>He looked up and asked, \u201cHow do I know to trust you? I don\u2019t want Katherine\u2019s name dragged through the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you,\u201d I pointed out and turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d he called, and I turned back to face him. \u201cI\u2019ve known for a long time where my talents lie. And my faults.\u201d He stood, sticking his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019ve neglected my wives, my son, and I never took much interest in anything outside of the courtroom.\u201d His sigh was weary. \u201cBut no matter what you think, I do love my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it so bad?\u201d His eyes narrowed, studying me. \u201cBeing separated from him? I mean after all this time, can\u2019t you see that it was for the best? Did it really hurt so much?\u201d</p><p>Hurt. My jaw tightened, and my eyes burned. Did he ever love anything enough to be hurt?</p><p>My voice was almost a whisper. \u201cI thought it did. At first. It hurt when I was ripped away from him without a good-bye. It hurt that I couldn\u2019t see or talk to him. It hurt when my mother didn\u2019t call me or invite me home for holidays. And it hurt when I snuck back here after a few months and found Madoc with someone else.\u201d I straightened my shoulders and looked him dead in the eyes. \u201cBut what really hurt was being forced by my mother into that clinic, into that room, and being all alone while that machine stole his baby out of my body.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and I knew without a doubt that he hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>I nodded, my voice raspy. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the part that really sucked.\u201d</p><p>I turned, walked out, and tried not think about the heartbroken look on Jason Caruthers\u2019s face before he buried it in his hands.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>MADOC</p><p>\u201cMadoc!\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, blinking away the sleep, and shot up in bed when I saw Addie staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cAddie. What the hell?\u201d I adjusted the sheets to make sure I was covered.</p><p>This was f**king awkward.</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t know what was going on, anyway. I was na**d in Fallon\u2019s bed for Christ\u2019s sake, but still. Addie hadn\u2019t seen me na**d since, well . . . last New Year\u2019s when I got drunk and jumped in the freezing-ass pool on a dare from Tate.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fallon?\u201d I asked, looking around.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but Fallon is gone, and your father is downstairs. He wants to talk to you now.\u201d She nodded and gave me the crazy eyes which meant that I needed to get my ass up.</p><p>Shit. I threw off the covers, and I heard a tsk behind me as I\u2019m sure Addie didn\u2019t appreciate me stalking across the room buck naked.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Fallon go?\u201d I shouted as I crossed the hallway into my room.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. She was gone when I got up.\u201d</p><p>No. No. No. I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head as I threw on some boxer briefs, a pair of jeans, and a T-shirt. Grabbing my socks and keys, I had no intention of dealing with my father for long.</p><p>I was going to find her and drag her back by her hair if I had to. What the f**k?</p><p>Running downstairs, I grabbed my shoes where I had dumped them near the stairs and walked into my father\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fallon?\u201d I demanded, plopping down in the chair opposite his desk and putting my socks and shoes on.</p><p>My father was sitting on the edge of his desk with a drink in his hand, and I did a double-take. Now I was actually a little worried. My father was controlled and responsible. If he was drinking in the morning, then . . . I don\u2019t even know. I\u2019ve never seen him drink in the morning. I just knew it was odd, and my father lives by his routine.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. She left of her own accord, Madoc. And you\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019ve got to talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed bitterly and finished tying my shoes. \u201cSay what you have to say, and make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a relationship with Fallon. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d</p><p>His bluntness threw me for a loop. I guess he knew we\u2019d started up again. Did I want a relationship with her?</p><p>I stood up, ready to leave. \u201cYou\u2019ve had two failed marriages. You don\u2019t get to give me advice about this kind of stuff.\u201d</p> <p>He reached behind him and snatched a folder off his desk, shoving it into my chest. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>I sighed but opened the folder anyway.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>My heartbeat echoed in my ears as I sifted through picture after picture of my father and Jared\u2019s mom, Katherine. Photos of them entering his apartment together, hugging and kissing in front of his window, him helping her out of cars . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with Jared\u2019s mom?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and headed around his desk to sit down. \u201cOff and on for eighteen years now. There\u2019s nothing you can tell me about wanting something you can\u2019t have that I don\u2019t understand, Madoc. Katherine and I have had a lot of history, a lot of struggles, and bad timing. But we love each other, and I\u2019m going to marry her as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I gasped and laughed at the same time. \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. Hey, I\u2019m having an affair with your best friend\u2019s mom. Hey, we\u2019re getting married. And he talked about it as if he were commenting on the weather. That\u2019s my f**king father for you. He does what he wants, and you roll with it, or you don\u2019t. He was just like . . .</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d My gut knotted up. \u201cEighteen years? You\u2019re not Jared\u2019s dad, are you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me like I was insane. \u201cOf course not. She\u2019d just had Jared when we met.\u201d Rubbing his hands over his face, he changed the subject. \u201cI got this envelope from Fallon. Along with this and one of my business dealings, because for all intents and purposes, she\u2019s blackmailing me, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>The file folder crumpled in my fist. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He consoled me with his flat voice. \u201cThis is all so much more complicated than you realize, but I want you to know that although Fallon came back here with ulterior motives, I don\u2019t think she wanted to hurt you. She could\u2019ve gone to the media with what she has on me. It would\u2019ve hurt this family.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the pictures, my breath getting shallower, faster, and my face warming with anger.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very angry,\u201d he continued softly as if thinking out loud. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t go to the media, Madoc. She didn\u2019t want to cause you any pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to protect me,\u201d I bit out, sitting down in the chair again.</p><p>If she came back to blackmail my dad, then everything else was a lie, too.</p><p>\u201cSo what does she have on you?\u201d I asked. \u201cBesides this?\u201d I held up the folder.</p><p>He hooded his eyes and spoke hesitantly. \u201cIt was a payoff I negotiated. It was illegal and I could lose my license, to say the least. But it wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly, and I would do it again.\u201d He looked straight at me. \u201cNonetheless, Fallon\u2019s not asking for much. And I didn\u2019t tell you any of this to hurt you. I told you so you could move forward. I didn\u2019t force Fallon to leave. She texted me last night.\u201d</p><p>He tossed me his phone, so I could see his messages. Sure enough, the first text was from Fallon.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not right for you.\u201d His voice was like a distant echo as I stared at the words on his screen. \u201cHer father, for starters . . .\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>And then I lost him. My stomach sank, I dropped the phone on the floor, and then laid my elbows on my knees, burying my face in my hands.</p><p>I remembered this feeling. It\u2019s what I felt years ago when they\u2019d told me she was gone all of a sudden. When I saw her empty bed where we lost our virginity together. And when I couldn\u2019t sleep, and I\u2019d storm into the basement to play the piano.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want this again. I\u2019d never wanted to feel that again. I inhaled a deep breath until my lungs ached so badly I thought they would burst.</p><p>\u201cStop talking,\u201d I cut him off from whatever he was talking about. \u201cJust stop talking. Eighteen years?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat means that you were seeing Katherine Trent when you were married to my mother.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to his desk, and then back up to me. He said nothing, but I saw the guilt in his eyes.</p><p>For Christ\u2019s sake. What the hell was the matter with him?</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d he spoke low. \u201cI\u2019m sending you to Notre Dame early,\u201d he told me in a resigned voice.</p><p>What?</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen the confused scowl on my face, because he explained. \u201cThings are going to get sticky here. With the divorce, Patricia will have no choice but to come home. You\u2019ll stay at the house in South Bend until the dorms open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no!\u201d I shook my head, standing back up.</p><p>As usual, my father stayed calm, not moving. \u201cFine, then go see your mother in New Orleans for the rest of the summer. You will not stay here. I want you to get perspective, and you need space.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand through my hair. What the hell was happening? I didn\u2019t want to go to Indiana for the rest of the summer. I barely knew anyone, other than some faculty my father had introduced me to here and there on our trips to sporting and alumni events.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going. No f**king way!</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t going to New Orleans, either. My friends were here.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d He shook his head at me like he could read my thoughts and was telling me no. \u201cYou will go, you will find a job or some volunteer work to pass your time, because right now I\u2019m trying to protect you from yourself. I will pull my support, the tuition, your car, until you see the light. Distance is what you need right now. Do it, or you\u2019re going to force my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>In the span of a few short hours, I\u2019d gone from disgustingly happy and excited about life to looking for a fight.</p><p>Fallon hadn\u2019t even taken anything she\u2019d brought with her except the clothes on her back.</p><p>It was all a lie, but then what did I expect? We screwed. It\u2019s not like we talked about shit or had a date or had anything in common. There were other women to give me what she did.</p><p>But everything felt wrong again. Just like before. The clouds hung too low, the house was too empty, and I wasn\u2019t hungry. Not for food, not for a good time, not for anything except a fight.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care why I was mad. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even sure why I was mad. I just knew I had to take it out on someone.</p><p>I jumped in my car and sped over to Jared\u2019s house, knowing I wouldn\u2019t get pulled over. Cops never pulled me over. A perk of being my father\u2019s son. My sweaty palms strangled the steering wheel as I jacked up Linkin Park\u2019s \u201cNumb\u201d and hauled ass. My tires screeched to a halt in front of his house, and I jumped out of the car, not caring that Tate and her dad were under the hood of his car with him.</p><p>\u201cYour mom is messing around with my dad?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>All three of them spun around to face me.</p><p>\u201cDude, what?\u201d Jared looked confused, wiping his hands on a shop cloth.</p><p>I stalked across the lawn, sticking my keys in my pocket while Jared met me halfway. \u201cYour slut of a mother has been sleeping with my dad for years,\u201d I snarled. \u201cHe\u2019s been giving her money, and they\u2019re like getting married and shit!\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes flared, and he knew I was looking for a fight. Mr. Brandt and Tate looked at me with wide eyes and open mouths.</p><p>Tate looked down, talking more to herself. \u201cI guess it makes sense. She\u2019s been seeing someone and keeping it hush-hush.\u201d She let out a nervous laugh. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>I sneered at her. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s awesome,\u201d I shot back sarcastically. \u201cMy mother crying when my dad didn\u2019t come home at night. Me trying to figure out why my dad worked so much instead of making it to my soccer games.\u201d I raised my hands and got in Jared\u2019s face. \u201cWhen what to my wondering eyes should appear but another gold-digging whore ready to make her career.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t wait another second. His punch slammed me square in the jaw, and I laughed as I stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I urged him forward, the heat in his eyes full of fire.</p><p>He rushed me, and we fell to the ground, scrambling over each other. He hovered over me, his fist missing my jaw. I growled and threw him over, swinging my fist into his face and bringing in my other fist across his jaw.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I heard Tate yell. \u201cJax! Do something!\u201d</p><p>Jax? Oh yeah. He lived here.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I heard him ask.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hands wrapped around my neck, and he locked his arms as straight as steel bars, holding me as far away from him as he could.</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d I coughed.</p><p>He barely unclenched his teeth. \u201cFucking dickhead.\u201d</p><p>Freezing water splashed my back, splashing around my arms and hitting Jared in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d I barked.</p><p>The stream of water hit me in the face, and Jared released my neck to shield his head from the cold attack while I rolled off of him. We wiped the water out of our eyes and sat up, glaring at the hose-man until we noticed it was Mr. Brandt. And he looked pissed. His khaki shorts were splattered with water, and he had grease stains on his White Sox T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYour parents are seeing each other.\u201d He spoke low, a hundred- pound weight in every word. \u201cWorst case scenario they break up. Best-case scenario, you\u2019re stepbrothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I blurted without the good sense to shut up.</p><p>He threw down the hose and yelled, \u201cSo what are you fighting about?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, my mouth gone dry.</p><p>Yeah, I forgot about that part. Jared and Jax were already my brothers as far as I was concerned, but having our families connected like that might be pretty cool.</p><p>Unless the marriage didn\u2019t work out. Which with my father\u2019s history was damn well possible.</p><p>But on the other hand, his marriages probably failed because of his affair with Jared\u2019s mom. Now that they could be together, it might be forever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Standing up, I couldn\u2019t look at any of them, but I knew they were all looking at me. Why the hell did I attack my best friend? I had called his mother a slut, for crying out loud.</p><p>All of Jared\u2019s shit while Tate was in France came back. He\u2019d missed her. He\u2019d loved her, even though he hadn\u2019t known it then. And he had been withering away without her. He fought. He drank. He screwed.</p><p>And none of it made him feel any better.</p><p>So why was I screwing up my life for a chick I didn\u2019t even love? Who didn\u2019t even deserve my attention?</p><p>I could understand Jared losing control of himself for Tate. She was a good girl, and she fought for him. And when that didn\u2019t work, she fought against him. She never stopped showing him that she was there.</p><p>But Fallon wasn\u2019t Tate. She wasn\u2019t even in the same league.</p><p>All of this was so stupid. I had no reason to go off the rails just because she popped back into town and f**ked with me again.</p><p>Holding out my hand, I was relieved when Jared took it. I helped him up, hoping he took that as an apology. Jared and I didn\u2019t need to get all girly. He knew I f**ked up, and he knew that I knew it.</p><p>\u201cOh, look.\u201d I smirked. \u201cFixing your car again? That\u2019s a Ford for you.\u201d</p><p>And I walked to my GTO, hearing Tate\u2019s snort behind me.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>FALLON</p><p>My father\u2019s house had been fairly empty when I arrived two weeks ago. That was exactly what I\u2019d been looking for. While some people craved distraction and noise, I craved quiet country roads and no one talking to me. The seventy-five-hundred-square-foot brick estate sat in a private cul-de-sac and was another example of a rich shit spending his money on something he rarely used. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, my dad wasn\u2019t really a rich shit. Well, kind of. But I still loved him.</p><p>The house went for three million dollars, and when I questioned him about why he got a house when he could have gotten an apartment in the city, he gave me a geography lesson on why America is so well positioned from the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cBefore the invention of rockets and nuclear weapons that could fly long distances,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cit was very hard for any nation to attack this country. We\u2019re strategically positioned between two oceans with friendly allies to the north and south. And let\u2019s face it\u201d\u2014he lowered his voice to a whisper\u2014\u201ceven if they weren\u2019t friendly, we\u2019re not really scared of Canada or Mexico anyway. Everywhere else, you have possible enemies surrounding you. Europe is a war strategist\u2019s nightmare. Enemies can invade at any time, or threaten your buffer states. To attack America, one would have to sail over an ocean or fly a long distance. That\u2019s why the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. They wouldn\u2019t have had the fuel to get to the mainland. So . . .\u201d He set the Shirley Temple he\u2019d made down in front of me. \u201cI pay to put a nice big buffer of land around my family and me, so I can see my enemies coming before they\u2019re at my door.\u201d</p><p>By that point I knew what my father did for a living, and while I knew it was wrong, I never hated him for it. I hated that he made me stay with my mother so much, and I hated that there were long periods when I didn\u2019t see him, but he trusted me and always spoke to me like an adult. He always used big words and never held my hand crossing streets. He taught me things and expected the best from me.</p> <p>To my thinking, when someone gave out their compliments and good opinions rarely, they meant more. My father was the only person on the planet whose respect and regard I cared about protecting.</p><p>\u201cSo did you get what you want?\u201d He strolled into the kitchen as I sat at the granite-top island working on my laptop.</p><p>No \u201chi\u201d or \u201chow are you,\u201d but I was used to it. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a month, and he\u2019d just arrived in town today.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d I replied, not looking up from my work as he went to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d He plucked a frosted glass out of the freezer and went to the Guinness tap.</p> <p>\u201cStill AWOL. But she\u2019ll show up soon enough to contest the divorce, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know why he was asking me about this. I had sent him an e-mail, letting him know everything was on schedule. He\u2019d never been totally on board with my plan for a little revenge against those who had betrayed me, but he\u2019d let me make my own choices and done what he could to help.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get caught in the cross fire,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>I wiggled my fingers against the keys, forgetting what I had been writing. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d he pressed, and I let out a silent breath, aggravated that he was asking so many questions.</p><p>I knew what he wanted to know, though.</p> <p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d I explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him hit with this, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He surprised me, and I looked up, meeting his eyes. \u201cHe was just a kid, too, I guess,\u201d he offered.</p><p>I had returned to Shelburne Falls with the intention of releasing the media package once I\u2019d proved that I had moved past Madoc, that he no longer had my heart or my head. Nothing went according to plan, though. Instead of humiliating Madoc, his father, and my mother, I\u2019d taken the path of least resistance.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Madoc hurt, because he didn\u2019t deserve it. I had been hurt at sixteen when I\u2019d stolen one of my dad\u2019s cars and driven back to Shelburne Falls only to find Madoc with someone else. But as adult as our actions were back then, we were only kids. I couldn\u2019t hate Madoc for making mistakes any more than I could blame our unborn child for being created.</p><p>Madoc never loved me, but I knew he never wanted to hurt me, either.</p><p>So I changed the plan. I got what I wanted, but I did it quietly without any embarrassment to him or his dad.</p><p>I lowered my hands to my lap and picked at my cuticles. Nervous habit. I knew my dad didn\u2019t like it. He and Mr. Caruthers were alike in many ways.</p><p>I lightened my voice. \u201cTed should make parole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFallon.\u201d He shook his head in aggravation. \u201cI told you not to involve yourself with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your uncle. Which means he\u2019s my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen someone you love needs you,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cyou suck it up.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Tate\u2019s words coming out of my mouth. I wished I\u2019d gotten to know her more.</p><p>I returned my gaze to the computer and started typing again, signaling that the conversation was over. He stood there for several seconds, taking sips of his beer every so often and watching me. I refused to look at him or let him see my shaking fingers. There were things I would never tell my father, no matter how much I loved him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019d lost five pounds in the past two weeks or that I\u2019d had dreams every night that made me never want to wake up.</p><p>I clenched my teeth and blinked away the burn in my eyes, typing nonsense just so I could look like I had my shit together in front of my dad.</p><p>\u201cNothing that happens on the surface of the sea can alter the calm of its depths,\u201d my father would say, quoting Andrew Harvey.</p><p>But the depths weren\u2019t calm. A black hole had opened up in the center of my stomach from seeing Madoc again and it was sucking me in little by little. The sky got blacker every day, and my heart beat slower and slower.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin me, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>I punched the keys harder. I had no idea what I was writing for the summer course I\u2019d picked up to keep busy.</p><p>My father walked toward the doorway but stopped to look at me before leaving. \u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the ache. At least I tried to. But I tipped my chin up anyway and looked at him head-on. \u201cI never expected to feel better. I just wanted them to feel worse.\u201d</p><p>He stood there in silence for a moment and then walked out.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A week later, I came out of the shower to see that I had missed calls from my mother and Tate.</p><p>I clenched the phone in my hand, wanting to talk to one of them but knowing I shouldn\u2019t and knowing I should talk to the other but not wanting to. Neither had left messages, but Tate had texted after the call.</p><p>Need a roommate at NW?</p><p>My eyes narrowed, but I smiled a little despite myself. Without hesitation I called her back.</p><p>\u201cHey, there you are,\u201d she answered, laughter in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about a roommate?\u201d I lay back on my bed, my wet hair splayed across the sheets.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she started, \u201cmy dad finally accepted that I really want to go to Northwestern\u2014and I do. I just didn\u2019t tell him that I\u2019d changed my plans because of him. Anyway, he won\u2019t let me live with Jared. He\u2019s insisting on the full college experience and wants me in the dorms the first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listen to your daddy. That\u2019s cute,\u201d I teased, although I envied her having such an involved parent.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cPeople don\u2019t deliberately piss off my father. Especially Jared.\u201d</p><p>My face fell immediately at the mention of her boyfriend. Madoc aside, I had threatened Jason Caruthers with exposing Jared\u2019s mom. I wondered if he knew. It didn\u2019t sound like Tate did. I didn\u2019t think she would have forgiven me easily for that\u2014and I was surprised to feel a sudden pang of guilt at having betrayed her friendship.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she continued, mischief in her voice. \u201cAre you in the dorms this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I happen to have a double I\u2019m using as a single.\u201d</p><p>It was perfect actually. Tate and I got along, and for some reason, I was looking forward to school starting now.</p><p>\u201cA single? You don\u2019t want to be in a single. It\u2019s soooo lonely,\u201d she drawled out with exaggeration.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>But I was still unsure. Tate meant Jared. And Jared meant Madoc. I couldn\u2019t be around him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t want to be around me.</p><p>\u201cTate, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019d love to have you as a roomie\u2014but to be honest, Madoc and I don\u2019t get along. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best situation for us to run into each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d She sounded confused. \u201cMadoc would only be around Jared\u2019s apartment if he ever came to Chicago for visits, which I\u2019m not sure is going to happen. Madoc\u2019s off the radar these days.\u201d</p><p>I sat up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got sent to Notre Dame early. His dad has a house there, I guess, so Madoc went there until school starts and the dorms open up next month.\u201d She hesitated, and another wave of guilt racked me.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>And he was probably sent away from home because of me.</p><p>She continued. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best. With Madoc\u2019s dad and Jared\u2019s mom getting together, Madoc was pretty pissed. He and Jared got in a fight, and no one has talked to him in weeks. We\u2019re all just giving him some space.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>What about Lucas? Has Madoc come home to spend time with his little brother at all?</p><p>My face fell, and I felt like shit all over again. This was my fault. Maybe I should have felt like it was poetic justice for Madoc to be sent away like I was, but I didn\u2019t want him alone. And I hated that he\u2019d had to leave his little brother.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she prompted. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>What did I think? I wanted to say yes, but I knew I should be distancing myself from anyone Madoc-related.</p><p>I sighed, trying to hide the nervousness in my voice. \u201cI say we\u2019re going to have a kick-ass year, roomie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d she screamed and then jacked up her God-awful metal music in the background.</p><p>I pulled the phone away from my ear and winced.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>MADOC</p><p>My hands dug deep into her bottom, squeezing the firm flesh as I buried my face in her neck. I didn\u2019t look at her. If I didn\u2019t, I could almost imagine that . . .</p><p>\u201cMr. Caruthers, stop. Not here.\u201d She squirmed against my body and giggled as she tried pushing me away.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to call me that,\u201d I whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she conceded. \u201cMadoc, then. Let\u2019s go to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is more fun.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2014or Brenna?\u2014had her legs wrapped around my waist, and I had her pinned to the wall next to my bedroom in my father\u2019s South Bend house. She came once a week, cleaned and did laundry, and I didn\u2019t wait long before making my move. I wasn\u2019t sure how old she was, but she was at least twenty-four or twenty-five, and pretty as hell.</p><p>Blond hair, blue eyes, and always wearing good-girl clothes like capris and fitted polos. Definitely far from where I had strayed before.</p><p>\u201cWe need condoms,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>I let out a sigh as I let her down and pulled her behind me into my room.</p><p>Other than Brenna, my life here was more boring than a tractor pull. Classes hadn\u2019t started yet, I hadn\u2019t made any friends since students weren\u2019t on campus yet, and the town was dead without the college crowd. Yep, like it or not, this girl was the highlight of my week. Her tits were bigger than my head, and when she left I was smiling again.</p><p>At least for a little while.</p><p>Unbuttoning my jeans, I watched as she stripped out of her clothes and dug a condom out of the nightstand. Sauntering over to me in her white lace bra and panties, she reached into my black boxer briefs and rubbed my hard-on.</p><p>She looked at me, licking her lips and grinning. My breath shook, and I looked away. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I couldn\u2019t look at her. I never could. I didn\u2019t even remember her name half the time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t want her to be real.</p><p>Gripping her hair at the back of her head, I pulled her in for a kiss. Our teeth rubbed together, and I heard her moan. From the hard kiss or pleasure, I didn\u2019t know, and I really didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI want it now,\u201d she panted, rubbing me harder.</p><p>My jaw steeled, and I broke the kiss, grabbing her by the elbow and hauling her over to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t order me. You don\u2019t own me. You got that?\u201d I bit out.</p><p>A flash of excitement crossed her eyes like lightning. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my fingers underneath the hem of my briefs and yanked them down my legs, kicking them to the side. Gripping the back of her neck, I brought her down with me as I lay down. \u201cGo down.\u201d</p><p>Cool oxygen poured into my lungs, and my heart pumped faster.</p><p>Quick-quick.</p> <p>Quick-quick.</p><p>Quick-quick.</p><p>Her mouth descended between my legs, and I squeezed my eyes shut, reveling in the pleasure of how eager she was. She licked and sucked, taking all of me in as her hair warmed my thighs.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you. I want to kiss you when you come.\u201d</p><p>I tried to shut that voice out of my mind, instead putting my hands on Brenna\u2019s head and pushing her down further on my cock.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, baby,\u201d I grunted, urging her on. \u201cThat feels good.\u201d</p> <p>Her head bobbed up and down as she sucked harder, and I arched my h*ps up into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s kissing you right now? Who\u2019s riding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Harder,\u201d I ordered, but despite my best intentions the blond hair I gripped turned a light brown and smoky green eyes stared up me. \u201cGod, that\u2019s good, baby.\u201d</p><p>And whether I liked it or not, I retreated into my head where Fallon lived and let the fantasy take over. I didn\u2019t want to think about that bitch. I didn\u2019t want to want her, but I did.</p><p>Fallon was here, with her mouth on me right now, and I hated her. I f**king hated her, and I was going to f**k her with that hate until I came.</p><p>The nerves in my legs burned, leading in to my groin and everything pooled between my legs. I punched my h*ps up into her, going deeper and harder, while her tongue rubbed against my underside.</p><p>She took her mouth off me and then licked me up and down, before wrapping her hand around the shaft, stroking as she sucked the head.</p><p>\u2018\u201cMadoc, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I jerked, arching my back and pulling my head off the bed.</p><p>I came in her mouth, gripping her hair at her neck and sucking air through my teeth. She worked me until I was done, and I collapsed back on the bed, letting her go.</p><p>My body always felt more relaxed.</p><p>Afterward.</p><p>But my head was in even more knots.</p><p>Fallon. It always returned to Fallon. I couldn\u2019t get off anymore unless I thought of her.</p><p>I wanted to look down and see ears full of piercings and the random little tattoos she had all over her body. I wanted to see the sexy green eyes in black eyeliner looking up and killing me with everything inside of her that she tried to hide.</p><p>Why? Why did I want her so much when she kept leaving?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Fallon?\u201d I heard a voice tap into my head from somewhere.</p><p>I blinked and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon. You said that name while I was . . .\u201d She trailed off.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no one. You probably misheard.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch! Shit. Seriously, dude?</p><p>Brenna sat up. \u201cYou yelled it when you were coming. Are you into guys? Fallon is a guy\u2019s name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She looked at me out of the corner of her eye, teasing me with a grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a f**king guy,\u201d I growled and then looked straight at her. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister, actually.\u201d</p><p>She laughed it off until she noticed that I wasn\u2019t laughing. Then she shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay.\u201d She scooted off the bed, looking like she wanted to run. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird.\u201d</p><p>She dressed quietly and quickly, saying nothing before she walked out. The rumble in my chest broke loose, and I laughed miserably as I slid back under the covers.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I jerked up in bed. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I asked, because I had no idea why my ass was stinging.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and peered up at my mother at the end of the bed. She grabbed the sheet and yanked it off of me. Thank God I had my basketball shorts on.</p><p>Her pink lips were pressed tight in disapproval, and her hands sat on her hips.</p><p>\u201cDid you just slap me on the ass?\u201d I pissed and moaned, falling back onto the bed and throwing my arm over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d she barked again.</p><p>Normally, I enjoyed seeing my mom. She was a lot of fun, and she was a pretty decent parent actually. She and my father each remarried fairly quickly, and I hated that she had moved away. Her new husband lived in New Orleans. But asking a kid to leave his home and everything he\u2019d known was too much. I stayed with my father and his new wife.</p><p>Bright idea, that was.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI was sleeping. Why are you even here?\u201d My exasperated tone told her everything.</p><p>I just wanted to be left alone.</p><p>\u201cYour father called and told me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I lied, keeping my bored expression focused on the ceiling. Headlights from a car outside flashed across the ceiling in the dimly lit room, and I knew that I\u2019d slept all day.</p><p>I heard my mother\u2019s heels clunk, clunk, clunk across the wooden floor. \u201cGet up!\u201d she urged again, and the next thing I knew she was swatting me with a magazine.</p><p>I brought up my arms and legs to shield me. \u201cDamn, woman!\u201d</p><p>She fired the magazine across the room, tucked her long blond hair behind her ear and stomped toward my closet.</p><p>\u201cAnd I fired Brittany,\u201d she bit out over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Brittany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe housekeeper you\u2019re bedding. Now get up and shower.\u201d She threw clean jeans and a T-shirt at me and walked out of the room.</p><p>I shook my head at nothing, amazed with the women in my life.</p><p>Complete ballbusters.</p><p>I flipped over, burying my face in my pillow.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d She thundered from somewhere downstairs, and I punched my pillow in aggravation.</p><p>But I got up. If I didn\u2019t, she\u2019d be in with a bucket of cold water next.</p><p>After I\u2019d showered and dressed, she took me to a quiet Italian place that was big on candles and Frank Sinatra. I ordered one of their pizzas, and my mother nibbled some pasta with olive oil.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Dad call you?\u201d I asked, sitting back in the chair with my hands locked behind my head.</p><p>\u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t seen any transactions on his credit card other than to the gas station. You\u2019ve probably consumed nothing except Doritos and Fanta for weeks now. And he knew you\u2019d rather see me than him, so . . .\u201d</p><p>That was about right. I didn\u2019t like to eat alone, so I snacked, and I was too pissed off right now to be sociable. Gas station food it was, then.</p><p>And I damn well didn\u2019t want to see anyone, but my mom was preferable to my dad.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you . . .\u201d\u2014I lowered my voice\u2014\u201cthat he\u2019s getting married?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to upset my mom in case she didn\u2019t know, so I tried to keep my tone gentle. I\u2019d also heard that his current wife was suing for our house\u2014my house\u2014and it made me sick.</p><p>\u201cYes, he told me.\u201d She nodded, taking a sip of her white wine. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy for him, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d I sneered. \u201cHow can you be happy? He cheated on you with her. It\u2019s been going on for years.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped for a split second, and she placed her hands in the lap of her white pencil skirt. I took in a breath but immediately felt like dropping the argument. I was a dick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy, Madoc.\u201d She straightened her shoulders and looked at me. \u201cIt still hurts that he could do that to me, but I have a wonderful husband, a healthy and smart son, and a life that I love. Why am I going to waste my time being mad at your dad when I wouldn\u2019t change anything in my life?\u201d She offered a small but genuine smile. \u201cAnd believe it or not, your father loves Katherine. She and I will never go on shopping trips,\u201d she joked, \u201cbut he loves her, which is okay with me. It\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>Did she think I wasn\u2019t doing that? I may not be firing on all cylinders at the moment, and I may be missing my friends like crazy, but my father was right. Distance and perspective. I was working on it.</p><p>She picked up her fork, digging into her meal again. \u201cHe also told me what happened with Fallon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about her.\u201d I picked up a piece of pizza and stuffed a bite into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou deleted your Facebook and Twitter accounts,\u201d she scolded, \u201cand you\u2019re holed up in an empty house. Why don\u2019t you just come and spend the last six weeks of summer with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fine,\u201d I burst out, my mouth full. \u201cI am. I\u2019m getting an early start here, making friends, and I\u2019m planning to take a look at the soccer team at Notre Dame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc\u2014\u201d she tried, but I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I maintained, my voice even. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>And I continued to tell her that every day when she regularly texted me to check in, every time she called, and every time she made Addie come and check on me.</p><p>For the rest of the summer, I was fine.</p><p>OCTOBER</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>FALLON</p><p>My alarm went off, and Sublime\u2019s \u201cWhat I Got\u201d played on my radio. I pulled my comforter back up, having kicked it off during the night. The morning chill was getting worse every day, and I couldn\u2019t believe that it was already October. Tate and I had moved into the dorm a little over a month ago, and time had flown by as we settled in and started our heavy class loads.</p><p>Neither of us had a job, but school kept us rocking around the clock. When I wasn\u2019t in my room or at class, I was in the library. When Tate wasn\u2019t in our room or the library, she was at Jared\u2019s apartment in the city.</p><p>At first she tried only staying there on the weekends\u2014respecting her father\u2019s wishes and all\u2014but now it had become more frequent. They couldn\u2019t stay away from each other. Most weekends they traveled back to Shelburne Falls to visit her dad and for them both to race at the Loop\u2014whatever that was. I never went, though. No way.</p><p>While it was lonely around the dorm when she went home\u2014I still hadn\u2019t really made any friends\u2014I couldn\u2019t begrudge them the time they spent together. They were in love. Plus, over the past couple of months, I\u2019d grown to like Jared a lot. He put on a macho act, but that was all it was. An act.</p><p>Tate and I studied together and went out once in a while. Since Jared attended the University of Chicago, he didn\u2019t hang around our campus much. They often invited me along on their dates, but I had no interest in being a third wheel.</p><p>The heavy wooden dorm room door clicked open.</p><p>\u201cFallon, are you awake?\u201d I heard Tate call.</p><p>I sat up, leaning back on my elbows. \u201cYes?\u201d I replied as more of a question, blinking against the morning light. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, I turned my alarm clock to see it was only six in the morning. Tate threw her backpack on her bed and started yanking stuff out of drawers. She was still in the same clothes from last night. Usually when she spent the night at Jared\u2019s, she came home freshly showered and dressed, ready for class. Right now, she looked rushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat classes do you have today?\u201d she asked, not looking at me as she darted around our room.</p><p>I swallowed the dryness from my mouth. \u201cUm . . . Calc III and Sex and Scandal in Early Modern England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she teased in a deep voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe last one is a gen. ed.,\u201d I explained, embarrassed. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like skipping?\u201d She stuffed clothes into her backpack and then turned to look at me. \u201cJax showed up at Jared\u2019s dorm this morning. No one\u2019s heard from Madoc. He\u2019s not returning calls, texts, IMs . . .\u201d She trailed off, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to him at all lately?\u201d I looked away, not wanting her to see the worry I was sure was on my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jared and I let it go at first, because we thought Madoc needed his space, and we\u2019ve all been so busy. But if Jax is worried, then it\u2019s definitely past time to check it out.\u201d She stopped, finally taking a breath.</p> <p>She came over, tapping my leg and smiling. \u201cSo let\u2019s go on a road trip!\u201d she said before darting over to our sink area to retrieve her toiletries.</p><p>Go to Notre Dame? My heart started talking a mile a minute with its thud-thud-pound-crash rhythm.</p><p>I shook my head and lay back down, my voice quiet. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so, Tate. You guys have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you going to do all weekend?\u201d She popped her head around the corner. \u201cYou should come with us, Fallon. You\u2019re his family.\u201d</p><p>She talked to me like a mom, pointing out that I should care about Madoc when she thought I didn\u2019t. The truth was I did care about him even though I shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>And I did not need the reminder that our parents were still married to each other. My mother had been fighting the divorce, and to make matters worse, she was trying to take Madoc\u2019s house. Caruthers\u2019s affair came out in the media, and during a moment of weakness, I actually felt bad for the guy. I e-mailed him the photos, hotel receipts, and contact information that would give him the proof he needed that my mother had not been a loyal wife, either. Strangely, he didn\u2019t use any of it.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t want my help, or maybe the proof of my mother\u2019s infidelity would only bring more attention he didn\u2019t want. I couldn\u2019t help but have a tiny bit more respect for him for not dragging her name through the dirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really his family, Tate. It was never like that with us.\u201d I ran the tongue ring I\u2019d put back in between my teeth, thinking. \u201cAnd he\u2019s fine, you know? If he were dead, the credit card transactions would\u2019ve stopped. In which case his father would be on top of it. He\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She walked back around the corner, her eyebrows narrowed in resolve, and tossed her toiletries on her bed.</p><p>Heading over to me, she hovered. \u201cHe could be drunk twenty-four/seven or on drugs.\u201d Her tone was calm but threatening. \u201cHe could be depressed or suicidal. Now get your ass packed. I don\u2019t want to talk about this again. We leave in one hour.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Tate and I drove in her G8, while Jax and Jared led the way in the Boss to Indiana on I-90. The drive was short\u2014only about an hour and a half\u2014but with the way these people drove it only took a little over an hour. With barely any time on the road, I didn\u2019t have nearly enough highway to get my hands to stop shaking or my mouth to stop going dry.</p><p>What the hell am I doing? I almost buried my face in my hands.</p><p>Madoc wouldn\u2019t want me there. Knowing him, he was probably knee-deep in sorority princesses and keg parties. He was going to insult me, create a scene, or worse\u2014I\u2019d see him broken and losing control. Did I really have that kind of power over him, though?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>I blew out a breath and pulled the tip of my cap over my eyes, leaning back in the seat.</p><p>It was foolish to even think Madoc would be upset about me leaving him without a good-bye. It\u2019s not like we had a relationship. No, if he was off the reservation, it was because his plans for the summer had been ruined. And yes\u2014he was going to blame me for that. As he should.</p><p>I threw my baseball cap into the backseat and fluffed my hair.</p><p>To hell with it.</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t be in this car, but it was too late now. I could act like I was hiding and embarrassed or look like I belonged there. He got bamboozled. Well, so did I.</p><p>Taking out my brush, I teased my hair to make it messier and touched up my makeup in the mirror. My black eye shadow still looked good, but I needed more mascara and some clear lip gloss.</p><p>Addie once gave me great advice about makeup. It\u2019s not supposed to make you pretty. It\u2019s supposed to make you prettier. Translation: less is more. I added to my eyes to make them pop, because they were my best feature. But I usually left the rest alone.</p><p>My blue nail polish was chipped, and my jeans were holey. But from the waist up in my short-sleeved black T-shirt, I looked okay.</p><p>\u201cWe got his address from Addie,\u201d Tate said as we pulled up in front of a two-story house near campus. \u201cI guess he decided against the dorms and moved in with some friends.\u201d</p><p>I peered through Tate\u2019s window as she parked across the street. This wasn\u2019t Madoc\u2019s father\u2019s house. I\u2019d been there once. This house, although large, was still smaller and the white paint was fresh, whereas the Caruthers\u2019s house was made of brick. This must have been a rental for college students.</p><p>Jared and Jax climbed out of the car, and I followed Tate, gripping the door and debating about just staying with the car.</p><p>Damn! Damn! Damn! I started bobbing on my toes, and I slammed the door with too much force.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we say? \u2018Surprise\u2019?\u201d Tate asked Jared, grabbing his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say. I\u2019m gonna break his nose.\u201d Jared stuck his other hand in his hoodie, steam damn near coming from his nose. \u201cThis is ridiculous making us all worry like this,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Jared walked up the steps and pounded on the forest green wooden door, alternating between his fist and the knocker. Jax and Tate flanked him, and I stayed back. Way back.</p><p>With my hands in my pockets.</p><p>Eyes averted.</p><p>And my guilt tucked firmly up my ass.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>I spun around to see a young woman, about my age, coming up the walkway behind us.</p><p>She was dressed in a short, cute jean skirt and a Fighting Irish T-shirt. Her face sparkled in the sun with gold and navy glitter from the huge \u201cN\u201d and \u201cD\u201d painted on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tate spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see Madoc. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>She broke out in a bright, white smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s already at the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game?\u201d Jax asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t dislodge the bowling ball from my throat. Who was this girl?</p><p>\u201cYeah, the soccer game,\u201d she offered, walking past us up the steps. \u201cThe team\u2019s been gone since early this morning. I came back for chairs for the after-party. Best get them now. Everyone will be too drunk later,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>She hauled up three collapsible lawn chairs from the porch and hooked the handles over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMadoc\u2019s on a soccer team?\u201d</p><p>I almost laughed at Jared\u2019s question. He sounded like he wanted to vomit.</p><p>The girl stopped and cocked her head to the side, looking at him like she wasn\u2019t sure what to say. After all, if we were his friends, we would\u2019ve known that he played soccer, right?</p><p>\u201cCall Madoc, would you?\u201d Jax approached her, using a smooth voice as he shrugged. \u201cOur phones are dead.\u201d</p><p>She pinched her eyebrows together, knowing that he was lying. \u201cUm, okay.\u201d</p><p>Taking her cell from the back of her skirt pocket, she dialed and tilted her head to get the phone between her blond hair and her ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d she greeted, and my heart felt like someone had dug away the bottom and was letting the blood seep out.</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cGet Madoc, will you?\u201d she asked, and I blinked. \u201cHe has friends at the house that want to talk to him for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the hell was wrong with me. That wasn\u2019t his girlfriend. But why the hell did I care if he had a girlfriend? I just hadn\u2019t thought about it. I hadn\u2019t even entertained the idea that he\u2019d moved on. Of course he would. I guess I thought I\u2019d never have to see or hear of it.</p><p>I watched, seeing her smile as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, tell his girlfriend to unwrap herself from him then,\u201d she ordered, and my eyes flared. \u201cHis friends here seem . . . intense.\u201d She smirked at Jared, obviously teasing him, but my chest had gone and plummeted all over again.</p><p>What the f**k?</p><p>Jax came up to the girl and took the phone she offered. \u201cMadoc, it\u2019s Jax,\u201d he said in a serious tone. \u201cI\u2019m at your house. Tate and I want confirmation you\u2019re not drunk, high, or suicidal. Jared\u2019s here, but he could care less. We\u2019ll meet you after your game, or I\u2019ll give Tate a crowbar and set her to work on your car.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and tossed the phone back to the girl with the abnormally raised eyebrows.</p><p>I spun around and headed down the walkway, taking a right on the sidewalk.</p><p>To hell with this.</p><p>What a stupid idea. Why did I come here?</p><p>\u201cFallon, wait!\u201d Tate called behind me, but I dug into the pavement harder, quickening my steps.</p><p>She grabbed my arm and tried to turn me around, but I kept going.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cBack to Chicago! He\u2019s fine. Screwing around as usual.\u201d</p><p>The late-morning breeze rustled the leaves overhead and blew my hair into my face as I walked.</p><p>Damn him. I couldn\u2019t believe this. I actually came thinking he was hurt or in trouble.</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d Tate jogged right in front of me and blocked my way. \u201cI\u2019m confused. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine!\u201d I pointed out, holding out my palm in the air. \u201cObviously! You were stupid to worry. I told you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s on a soccer team. No. He\u2019s on the Notre Dame soccer team. And he has a girlfriend! Who has her pretty little preppy self wrapped around him right at this moment.</p><p>I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>I veered around Tate and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she growled in a deep voice. \u201cHow are you going to get back home?\u201d</p><p>My steps slowed, and I looked around the neighborhood, searching my brain.</p><p>Yeah, I forgot that part. I wasn\u2019t walking back to Chicago.</p><p>\u201cFallon, what\u2019s with you and Madoc?\u201d Tate came around to face me again, her arms crossed over her chest. \u201cIs there something going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I tried to laugh it off, but it came out like a croak.</p><p>Smooth, Fallon.</p><p>\u201cThere is, isn\u2019t there?\u201d She smiled knowingly. \u201cThat\u2019s what all that commotion was about when you took off with his car that night. And you\u2019re the reason he split so early in the summer.\u201d</p><p>I averted my eyes, checking out the super-interesting cracks in the sidewalk. Tate was a friend now. A good friend. And I couldn\u2019t lie to her.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk about it, either.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d she blurted out, obviously taking my silence as a confirmation. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and pursed her lips. \u201cSo is it hot?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, avoiding the question.</p><p>The voice in my dreams crept back into my head. \u201cSit on the car. . . . Spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Tate must\u2019ve seen the longing in my eyes, because she burst out, \u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d I jumped in, \u201cit\u2019s not true love, Tate.\u201d</p><p>For him, anyway.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>MADOC</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d I waved Jared and Jax in to take the punch they wanted to hand out.</p><p>I\u2019d just walked out of the locker room after showering and dressing post-game to find them waiting with Tate. I clutched the backpack I had slung over my shoulder and waited. In all honesty, I\u2019d expected them sooner, like a month ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tate walked up to me slowly, and I leaned down to pick her up in a hug.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>Her fist swung out and pounded me right in the arm, making me stumble backward.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Tate.\u201d I winced, hearing Jax laughing in the background.</p> <p>At least she avoided my nose this time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk,\u201d she scolded. \u201cHere we\u2019re thinking you\u2019re in bad shape, and you\u2019re just fine! Playing soccer and partying. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Still wincing, I rubbed my arm and dropped my backpack. \u201cNothing. I know I\u2019ve been out of touch, but you shouldn\u2019t have worried. You\u2019re just mad because you missed my hot ass, huh?\u201d</p><p>She huffed, and I laughed a little. They cared. Enough to show up at my school and ambush me outside my soccer game. As pissed off as they looked, it made me happy that they\u2019d come.</p><p>In truth, I\u2019d known they would. And for some reason, I just couldn\u2019t reach out myself. I didn\u2019t want to hear about how much fun they were having at home this summer. I didn\u2019t want to take the chance of hearing any gossip or news about my father\u2019s divorce.</p> <p>I missed my friends, and I knew I\u2019d miss them more if I stayed in contact.</p><p>That\u2019s how it had to be. Until now.</p><p>Jared stepped forward, and Tate placed a casual hand around his waist, bunching up his gray T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, we shouldn\u2019t have worried, ass**le,\u201d he growled in a low voice. \u201cFallon was right.\u201d</p><p>I straightened, my neck heating up. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t said her name out loud in months. I\u2019d thought about her, though, even though I didn\u2019t want to.</p> <p>\u201cShe came with us today.\u201d Tate looked too happy to deliver that blow but then tightened her lips. \u201cBut she split when it was obvious that you were fine.\u201d</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>\u201cWhy is she with you?\u201d I shook my head, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cBecause Tate and Fallon are roommates,\u201d Jared chimed in, losing patience. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blurted. \u201cShe lives with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tate let out a bitter laugh. \u201cYou two don\u2019t keep in touch much, do you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded sarcastically, bending down to pick up my bag. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s living with one of my best friends and hanging out with the other two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s been a better friend than you lately,\u201d Jared gritted out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we had to chase you down like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we better get a good time out of this tonight,\u201d Jax chimed in, shoving his hands into the front pocket of his hoodie.</p><p>I barely heard them, the anger pouring in and out of my lungs faster by the second.</p><p>I looked at Tate. \u201cWhere is Fallon?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said she was going to walk around until we were ready to leave.\u201d She took out her phone and began texting. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d stay the night, but I have a race in Shelburne Falls tomorrow night, so we weren\u2019t staying the whole weekend. But . . .\u201d She looked up. \u201cYou seem happy as a clam without us here, so I guess we\u2019ll head back tonight.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving. I\u2019ve been a jerk, and I can\u2019t explain right now, but . . .\u201d I nodded. \u201cI want you guys here.\u201d</p><p>Tate sighed, looking at her phone. \u201cShe\u2019s at the Grotto.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a huge-ass breath and tossed Jared my dad\u2019s house key. \u201cYou remember where my dad\u2019s house is at, right?\u201d He\u2019d tagged along one weekend when Tate was in France two years ago.</p><p>\u201cYou all go there,\u201d I said, walking toward my car. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Fallon.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Grotto was a landmark at Notre Dame and a reproduction of a French shrine where the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint Bernadette in the 1800s. For believers and nonbelievers, it was a beautiful spot on campus where people went to pray, meditate, think, or just be quiet for a while.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t claim to be churchgoing guy, but even I lit candles there before games and tests.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>It\u2019s also where my father proposed to my mother more than twenty years ago. And look how that turned out.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what I would say to Fallon, and I wasn\u2019t even sure what I wanted from this. Did I want her to leave? No. Should I want her to leave? Yes.</p><p>She deserved every f**king cold shoulder in the world. What nerve she had showing up here. Blackmailing my father; nearly throwing Jared\u2019s mom under the bus; and jerking me up, down, and all around for her own pleasure.</p><p>Sure, I\u2019d spun out for a few weeks after getting to South Bend, but then I\u2019d zoned in on soccer and my friends. I was fine.</p><p>And yeah, I\u2019d gone AWOL on my best friends. And sure, I\u2019d barely laughed since being here, but I was still handsome like nobody\u2019s business.</p><p>That worked for me.</p><p>Walking through the clean-cut lawns, veering down sidewalks under the canopy of nearly bare trees, I spotted the Grotto tucked back into a rock wall.</p><p>And Fallon was there.</p><p>Not sitting and sulking like I thought she\u2019d be. Or wanted her to be.</p><p>No, she was standing in front of the shrine, hands in her back pockets, staring at the sea of candles flickering in the light wind. The Virgin Mary sat perched in her cove above to the right, and I shook my head, smiling at the irony.</p><p>People came here to pray. A few individuals were kneeling before the fence separating them from the shrine right now.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t yell at her here. Damn.</p><p>Sitting down on the bench behind her, I threw my arms over the back and waited for her to turn around.</p><p>Her light brown hair blew across her shoulders, and her small hands cupped her ass in her jeans pockets. I closed my damn mouth and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she started, turning her face to the side, \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate for you to stare at my ass here.\u201d</p><p>The couple praying looked over at her and then to me and back down to their hands.</p><p>Yeah, pray for us.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the only nice thing about you, little sister.\u201d</p><p>The couple\u2019s gasp made me want to laugh, and they got up, the woman glaring at me as they walked off. I tightened my jaw, not wanting to admit that this was the first time I\u2019d genuinely laughed in a while.</p><p>Fallon\u2019s back straightened, and she turned around slowly, her patient eyes marking me, but I nudged my way in before she got started.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you think?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat I was slowly circling the drain of despair without you?\u201d</p><p>She hooded her eyes, embarrassment warming her cheeks. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come. Tate was sure you were snorting coke off a hooker\u2019s ass on a daily basis. She bullied me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d be the expert. I laughed to myself, but then I tensed up.</p><p>She talked about Tate like they were friends. Like they had a whole relationship, and I wasn\u2019t aware of it.</p><p>Hell, I wasn\u2019t. I dropped the ball, and Fallon picked up what I had let go.</p><p>Fallon watched me, and I realized she wasn\u2019t wearing her glasses. She usually wore them in public and only took them off in the bedroom. They were just reading glasses, so she didn\u2019t need them all of the time, but it was like a fashion statement or something.</p><p>Now, they were gone. Her eyes were unshielded, and she was beautiful. Always beautiful. Just different now.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be off the rails?\u201d I challenged as she approached me. \u201cI\u2019m very happy. Great team, interesting classes, a good girl to spend my nights with . . .\u201d</p><p>That was sort of the truth. I loved playing for the team. My classes sucked, though. I was bored as hell, not sure what I was doing half the time, and I didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want one. Friends with benefits was the arrangement Ashtyn and I had. She was a freshman, same as me, and played tennis for the school.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you have it good, Madoc. I\u2019m glad.\u201d She nodded. \u201cReally, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not.\u201d She came to sit down beside me, still keeping a distance. \u201cI do want to see you happy.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her mouth and the glint of silver I saw from her tongue. She\u2019d put her tongue ring back in.</p><p>The muscles on the inside of my leg twitched because I wanted to touch her. I wanted to feel her tongue. I wanted to feel the ball on it dragging across my skin.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I looked away before responding. \u201cWell, I am. Things are easy here. No bullshit, no drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she replied instantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry they worried.\u201d</p><p>Signal the end of the conversation. The mood was dead, and I was angrier than a motherfucker. I was pissed off and elated at the same time.</p><p>There was shit we weren\u2019t saying, and fights we weren\u2019t having. She thought she could nip this in the bud with a tidy little bow and walk away, but I wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Who the f**k was Fallon, anyway?</p><p>I wanted to come at her. Again and again until she came undone. I wanted her screaming and crying. I wanted to chip away this tough little act until she was red with anger and sobbing miserably.</p><p>I wanted her broken.</p><p>And then I wanted her shivering and grabbing for me in need.</p><p>I stood up and stretched my arms out behind me.</p><p>\u201cSo I offered everyone my dad\u2019s house for the night. There are some bars to hit with the team, and I want to spend some time with Jared, Tate, and Jax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun,\u201d she cut me off.</p><p>My stomach knotted. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we brought two cars. I\u2019ll take Tate\u2019s back tonight. I was just waiting to see what everyone else was doing before I headed out.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my jaw, trying to figure out how to keep her here without looking like I wanted her here.</p><p>\u201cSo stubborn,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Her eyes shot up to mine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, what did I mean?</p><p>I dug my keys out of my pocket and spoke without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Fallon.\u201d My tone was curt.</p><p>Walking past her, I picked my cell out of my other pocket and dialed Jax.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cPull the plug on Tate\u2019s throttle body,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to tell everyone where you disappear to on your long nights out.\u201d My threat wasn\u2019t empty. I probably should\u2019ve told Jared when I\u2019d found out last spring.</p><p>\u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have told you,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>I sneered. Although he couldn\u2019t see it, he could hear it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You showed me. And now I have those nightmares to contend with. I think I need to talk to someone about it,\u201d I hinted. \u201cI think I need talk to a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d he hissed. \u201cDamn! It\u2019s not like Tate\u2019s not going to figure out how to fix it in two seconds anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just make sure she doesn\u2019t look under the hood then.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>FALLON</p><p>At St. Joe\u2019s, I read Dante\u2019s Inferno. He stated that the seventh circle of hell was reserved for the violent. The inner ring of the circle housed the violent against God, the middle ring housed the suicides, and the outer ring was for the violent against people and property.</p><p>That was my ring.</p><p>Because I not only wanted to have a little tantrum with a baseball bat and this stupid karaoke machine, but I was going to f**k someone up as well.</p><p>After discovering that Tate\u2019s car was out of commission until we could get to an open auto body shop tomorrow, I\u2019d resigned myself to having to stay in South Bend for the night.</p><p>And to make matters worse, Tate and Jax seemed to be on a mission to make sure I followed them all out to a bar.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t want me along. He\u2019d joked that I\u2019d fit in better at one of the community college parties. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So . . . I flipped him off, went upstairs to my room, and shredded the shit out of the back of my DC skating T-shirt and applied a hell of a lot more makeup than I\u2019d wanted.</p><p>To hell with him. He didn\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in.</p><p>Baby, I always fit in.</p><p>My jeans were tight, my T-shirt showed off my back with the twenty or so slits running across it, and my hair and makeup broadcasted that I was damn well looking for a good time.</p> <p>Tate thought I looked good, too. She had me do the same thing to her T-shirt, and then Jared hauled her upstairs to change. They didn\u2019t come back for half an hour, and Tate was still wearing the same shirt.</p><p>\u201cHey, you go to school here?\u201d a guy shouted in my ear while I waited at the bar. I cringed and looked over at him, doing a double-take.</p><p>His espresso-colored hair was a little longer around the ears and fell on his forehead, and his blue eyes popped underneath his dark eyebrows. He was cute. Really cute.</p><p>He was dressed pretty casually\u2014dark-wash jeans and some kind of beer T-shirt\u2014but he wasn\u2019t hard on the eyes. And he definitely was dressed better than Madoc, who looked like an Abercrombie ad. This guy wasn\u2019t as built\u2014he was lean, but toned\u2014but he had a wide eye-catching smile.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shouted back over the music. \u201cI go to Northwestern. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a senior here. What brings you to Notre Dame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisiting,\u201d I answered, handing the bartender a few bucks and taking my Coke. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBud,\u201d he ordered to the bartender and then looked at me. \u201cEnvironmental Engineering.\u201d</p><p>Cute, engineer, and orders no-frills beer. Definitely my type. Not that I drank Budweiser or any alcohol very much. I could\u2019ve if I\u2019d wanted to. They weren\u2019t carding at the bar, since IDs were checked at the door and Madoc had worked his magic to get us in, but I still opted to stay sober.</p><p>\u201cVery cool.\u201d I fist-bumped him and smiled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m heading back to my friends. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking like he wanted to say something, but stayed at the bar to wait for his drink.</p> <p>Heading through the dense cluster of people waiting to place their orders, I made my way back to the two tables we had put together near the wall of windows and sat back down.</p><p>I noticed the extra body at our table right away. A girl was sitting next to Madoc, and my eyes narrowed at his hand on her leg.</p><p>Her long dark hair hung in big curls down over her br**sts, and she had tanned, toned arms that looked great in a loose green tank top that showed off the black lace bra underneath. She was definitely dressed in a slutty-sexy way, yet it was completely expensive and stylish.</p><p>Whereas I just probably looked slutty.</p><p>She was drinking Amstel Light. Of course.</p><p>Madoc glanced at me for a split second but then turned his attention to Jared, who sat at my side. \u201cSo how are you liking ROTC?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Jared spoke up. \u201cI have to go to two separate campuses for all of my classes, but it\u2019s keeping me out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Tate, leaning into him on his other side, patted his leg. \u201cYep. Say it, baby. \u2018Tate, your dad was right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jared jabbed her in the ribs, and she started giggling, pushing him away. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to be apart? Like a lot.\u201d Madoc\u2019s tone was far from friendly, and his expression was stern. \u201cAnd his sexy ass is going to be in the jungle or on a ship for six months out of the year away from you. You okay with that?\u201d he spoke to Tate.</p><p>What the hell? Why was he raining on their parade? I had never been a fan of Jared\u2019s, but he\u2019d damn well earned my trust over the past couple of months. He and Tate were doing great.</p><p>Tate sobered, evening out her smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll miss him, but I trust him.\u201d And then she smirked at Jared. \u201cYou won\u2019t touch any of those guys, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless he gets really horny,\u201d Jax joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a vibrator, Tate,\u201d Madoc offered. \u201cOr I could just come over. You know, to check on you when he\u2019s away.\u201d</p><p>A splinter of jealousy dug into my heart, but then I saw Jared flip him off out of the corner of my eye. I guess it was pretty regular practice for Madoc to joke like that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Tate mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll take the vibrator, I think.\u201d</p><p>I set my drink down and looked behind me to the side at the newest idiot entertaining the crowd with bad disco karaoke.</p><p>Oh, wait. All disco was bad. Why was it that everyone who sings either goes for disco or country?</p><p>I should get up there and . . . nope. Never mind. I blinked away that idiot thought and turned back to the table.</p><p>And found Madoc staring at me. He still had his hand on the girl\u2019s leg, but he\u2019d stopped rubbing. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was drunk or not. Usually he didn\u2019t sport such serious expressions, but he hadn\u2019t been up to the bar more than once.</p><p>The girl to his right had been chatting with Jax, but I wasn\u2019t even sure if Madoc had introduced her. I hadn\u2019t gotten a name, but that must have been the girl he was talking about spending his nights with.</p><p>Within seconds, though, she turned back to Madoc and whispered something in his ear.</p><p>I slouched a little lower in my seat, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, Madoc. How\u2019s it going?\u201d A chair appeared at my other side, and I looked up to see the guy from the bar sitting down next to me.</p><p>He gave a half-smile, holding eye contact for a little longer than me.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s voice was slow and deep. \u201cAidan,\u201d he greeted. Only it didn\u2019t sound like a greeting. More like a threat.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything you can about this pretty girl.\u201d Aidan spoke to Madoc but motioned to me.</p><p>Really?</p><p>I rolled my eyes and straightened up. \u201cMadoc doesn\u2019t know me. Not really.\u201d I offered my hand to Aidan.</p><p>\u201cAidan, Fallon. Fallon, Aidan.\u201d Madoc introduced us, ignoring my insult.</p><p>He shook my hand, and I smiled back, still not interested but not wanting Madoc to see that, either.</p><p>\u201cGlad to officially meet you,\u201d Aidan said, his blue eyes piercing.</p><p>\u201cHer mother likes young guys,\u201d Madoc chimed in again. \u201cAnd her father kills people for a living.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and exhaled a hot breath through my nose.</p><p>What a dick.</p><p>My lips twisted up at Madoc\u2019s exaggerated information.</p><p>Okay, not really exaggerated. My mother liked young guys, but my father didn\u2019t set out to kill anyone. If you crossed him, you knew what to expect.</p><p>But still . . .</p><p>Aidan breathed out a laugh. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>He obviously thought Madoc was joking.</p><p>\u201cFallon\u2019s also pretty easy,\u201d Madoc said in a husky voice. I glared at him, fire burning my eyes, while Aidan cleared his throat.</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill him!</p><p>\u201cEasy on the eyes, that is,\u201d he specified.</p><p>I stood up, grabbing one of the unemptied shot glasses on the table. \u201cOh, Madoc. You didn\u2019t tell him the best part. I can sing.\u201d</p><p>And I downed the shot, not realizing it was tequila until it hit my throat. Slamming the glass down on the table, I spun around and dived into the dance crowd, waiting until I was out of sight before I coughed out the burn from the noxious shit I just drank.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sing?\u201d the burly rocker dude who ran the karaoke show asked as I stepped up to the side of the stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Do you have Ashlee Simpson\u2019s \u2018La La\u2019?\u201d I swallowed the taste of the liquor over and over again but couldn\u2019t get rid of it on my tongue. One nice thing though was that I already felt it coursing through my limbs and giving me delicious chills all over my body.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The guy nodded without looking at me as he worked the machine. \u201cStep on up.\u201d</p><p>Doing as he said, I lifted my chin, took the mic with one hand, and stuck the other in the back pocket of my jeans. Whistles erupted around the room, and I turned to the table where my friends and enemy sat, seeing Jared and Tate turned around in their seats, smiling. Jax watched me, too, even though he had a waitress desperately trying to get his attention by bending down at his side to talk to him. I could see her cle**age from here.</p><p>Aidan had stayed at the table but stood up for a better view, and Madoc . . . well, Madoc was the red-hot blood in my veins. His f**king mouth was plastered on the girl next to him, eyes closed, and I may as well not even have existed.</p><p>I ground my teeth together and tensed the muscles in my legs, staying pissed. I saw Tate look between Madoc and me and then stand up as the music started.</p><p>\u201cHere you go!\u201d rocker dude shouted.</p><p>I bounced the heel of my right foot up and down, finding rhythm with the fast-paced pop tune. Closing my eyes, I smiled, relishing in the thrill of getting lost. Bending my knees, I shimmied my body lower and back on up, bobbing my head in time to the music.</p><p>\u201cYou can dress me up in diamonds,\u201d I sang, unable to contain the delicious fire racing through my body. Letting the lyrics pour out of me, I didn\u2019t even need to look at the monitors. Too many times growing up I\u2019d belted out the words to this song.</p><p>My voice low and chin tipped down as I sang the words, playing the crowd with my eyes, I looked over and smiled in surprise, seeing Tate jumping up on the stage with another microphone.</p><p>She pumped her fist in the air as we both shouted, \u201cYa make me wanna la la!\u201d</p><p>The whole crowd of guys and girls went wild, jumping up and down and singing with us as I laughed and sang at the same time.</p><p>I completely lost sight of our table once the crowd got going, which was probably a good thing. I wasn\u2019t so angry anymore, and I was thankful Tate got up there with me. It felt good to have someone on my side.</p><p>And even though I couldn\u2019t see Madoc, I hoped he was watching. If his eyes were on me, then his lips weren\u2019t on her.</p><p>\u201cI see everything I want for as long as I can have it.\u201d</p><p>He seemed so different now compared to the man who had spoken those words to me in June.</p><p>His cold demeanor was distant and silent, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I came up here to prove something or to draw him out.</p><p>\u201cLa la la, la la la,\u201d Tate and I kept singing, ending the song.</p><p>I bowed my head and then threw it back, swinging all of my hair out of my face. Tate hooked an arm around my neck and whispered, \u201cHe didn\u2019t take his eyes off of you the whole time.\u201d</p><p>My heart started pounding harder, and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was that or the crowd\u2019s cheers that were vibrating through my arms and legs.</p><p>I knew she was talking about Madoc, but I acted dumb anyway. \u201cAidan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She smirked at me knowingly. \u201cNo, you idiot. You know who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>I refused to look over at the table, so I led the way off stage and wiped my fingers across my damp forehead.</p><p>Aidan emerged from the crowd on the dance floor and placed a hand on my hip. I stiffened as he leaned in to speak in my ear. \u201cThat was great! You\u2019re a good singer.\u201d</p><p>I offered a small smile and looked up when the surrounding speakers began playing regular music. The DJ announced a break, and couples wrapped their arms around each other and started dancing to the slow song.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d Aidan shouted in my ear.</p><p>I looked around for Tate, who seemed to have disappeared, and I couldn\u2019t see anything through the crowd. I decided this was a good way out, though. Not that there was anything wrong with Aidan, but I was done for the night.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I shouted back. \u201cOne before I head out.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and led me into the middle of the mix, turning around to wrap his hands around my waist. He pulled me in, and I held his shoulders as we swayed to Green Day\u2019s \u201c21 Guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Madoc?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the team together.\u201d His thumb was rubbing strokes on my back. \u201cAlthough, he\u2019s on the fast track. He\u2019ll probably be captain next year,\u201d he said, not looking particularly pleased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Captain by sophomore year?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that good?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d never seen Madoc play soccer.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s just that connected,\u201d he shot back. \u201cMadoc doesn\u2019t have to earn a whole lot on his own.\u201d</p><p>My hard eyes fell, and I was a little pissed.</p> <p>I could say Madoc was an entitled little prince with the hard path of life freshly paved for him, but for some reason, I felt the need to defend him.</p><p>I\u2019d been there when he\u2019d quit piano and started studying cars instead. He worked hard, read a lot, and tinkered for hours to learn his way around a garage. Madoc put in the muscle when he cared and pushed things away when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>His name may have gotten him on the team, but he wouldn\u2019t play if he didn\u2019t want to. And he wouldn\u2019t play if he didn\u2019t know he was an asset.</p><p>Aidan\u2019s fingers were slipping in and out of the rips in my shirt, caressing my skin as he pressed himself into me more closely.</p><p>\u201cI should probably get go\u2014\u201d I started to tell him good-bye but suddenly felt like I was backed up against a wall.</p> <p>Aidan looked directly behind me.</p><p>\u201cTake a hike, Aidan.\u201d I blinked, hearing Madoc\u2019s voice as he came around to the side.</p><p>Turning around, I looked up at him and noticed his blue eyes shooting bullets at Aidan.</p><p>Oh, no. This was a zero to sixty moment with Madoc, but we had skipped the zero part.</p><p>Aidan took his hands off my waist. \u201cHey, man\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Madoc inched into our space. \u201cTouch her again, and I\u2019ll chop off your hand.\u201d He said it so matter-of-factly.</p> <p>My breathing turned shallow, but my temper rose.</p><p>No, no, no . . .</p><p>Aidan rolled his eyes and backed off, probably figuring it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. Madoc looked ready to draw blood.</p><p>I bared my teeth, shaking my damn head that felt like my brain was expanding and pressing against my skull. I was ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d I clenched my teeth.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up,\u201d he ordered, breathless. \u201cJust shut up, and dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Huh? Dance with him?</p><p>No hauling me out of here, screaming at me for one reason or another? No barking in my face and ordering me home?</p> <p>I stood there trying to figure out what the hell was going on and barely noticed him pulling me in. Madoc\u2019s strong hands gripped my waist, holding me tight but barely touching me otherwise. His chest was right in front of my eyes, and I slowly looked up at him.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>When he stared down at me, everything was still except for our feet that moved to the music. It was like he was searching my eyes for something.</p><p>Everything about him, the shade of his eyes, the muscles I felt under his shirt, the way I already knew how his body moved when it loved, everything about him drew me in.</p><p>I sucked in a breath, wishing he\u2019d stop touching me and wishing I could pull away. In another minute I would. In another minute I\u2019d be satisfied with the warmth I hadn\u2019t felt in months or the heartbeat I could feel again.</p><p>In one more minute I would let him go.</p><p>I closed my eyes. Just. One. More. Minute.</p><p>I dug my fingers into his shoulders when his possessive hands threaded into the open back of my shirt and claimed my skin.</p><p>Not like Aidan\u2019s light strokes. Madoc splayed his whole hand, touching me with everything he had.</p><p>I let my forehead fall into his chest, inhaling his cologne. Butterflies swarmed in my stomach, and I smiled as the flutter descended lower. It felt so good.</p><p>Looking at him, I tried to keep the shakiness out of my voice. \u201cYou have someone here with you, Madoc,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cWhy are you dancing with me?\u201d</p><p>He brought one hand up, holding the side of my face with a firm hand and kneading his fingers into the back of my neck. \u201cYou ask too many f**king questions,\u201d he spat out, an angry tone to his voice.</p><p>And jerking my body into his, he slammed his mouth down on mine.</p><p>Madoc? I didn\u2019t say his name out loud. I think I may have groaned it, but otherwise I instantly stilled.</p><p>And then I was his.</p><p>A shudder ran through me, and I felt the dampness between my legs immediately. His heat on my lips made me hungry.</p><p>He sucked in a breath and whispered, \u201cBecause I like the way you taste, okay?\u201d</p><p>His mouth took mine once more, covering it with heat and command like he knew exactly how my body worked and what it needed.</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>I pushed into him, kissing him back as his arm wrapped around my waist and pulled me up into his mouth.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>I threaded my fingers across the back of his neck and moved my tongue into his mouth, massaging and tasting him. It was just us. Just this.</p><p>His lips moved across mine, going in deep, his tongue working mine, flicking out again and again to rub over my ring. He devoured me. He drew my bottom lip between his teeth, and a moan escaped me as I squeezed my eyes against the sweet pain.</p><p>Not that it hurt at all. Just kissing him, touching him, inhaling him was too much. It was like an overload on my body, and the pleasure made me want to cry out. His fingers dug into my back, and I could feel his erection through his jeans.</p><p>God, what are we doing? We were on a crowded dance floor. He had a girl with him! Jared, Tate, and Jax were probably either trying not to watch or had left already. Opening my eyes for a second, I noticed that no one was watching us though. The couples around us were focused on themselves.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I barely spoke, my voice almost like a cry.</p><p>He pulled his face away, cupping my cheeks and keeping us nose to nose. We were both panting.</p><p>\u201cI want to be inside you,\u201d he groaned, and I thought back to our night at the skate park in the rain. \u201cBut . . .\u201d He straightened up and dropped his hands, \u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d</p><p>His voice was flat, void of any of the heat that was there just a minute ago.</p><p>And he walked away.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>MADOC</p><p>I almost abandoned my whole plan the minute I held her in my arms, the second I touched her lips, the instant she moaned my name.</p><p>But there was no way in hell I was going to watch her walk again. No, not this time. I\u2019d be the one to leave.</p><p>And the corner of my mouth turned up as I made my way through the crowd. She was as stiff as an ice cube when I took her from Aidan, and then she\u2019d melted like liquid in my arms. Now she was a puddle all over the dance floor.</p><p>I am the man.</p><p>Who cares that she looked like sex standing up on that stage? Or that I\u2019d been a little jealous when Aidan started dancing with her? Or ready to kill him when I caught sight of his hand inside the back of her shirt?</p><p>Fuck him, and f**k her.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Ashtyn screamed at me as I came back to the table. I saw her rear her hand back, and I ducked out of the way just before her hand would\u2019ve landed across my cheek.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I held up my hands, laughing. \u201cCalm down. It was just a joke.\u201d</p><p>I guessed she\u2019d seen the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass**le!\u201d she shouted and stomped out of the bar.</p><p>People around us chuckled, including Jax, while Jared shook his head and Tate scowled.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d I begged sarcastically. \u201cYou missed me, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Tate rolled her eyes and stood up, straightening her shirt. \u201cI thought I did.\u201d Looking around, she sighed. \u201cYou boys play nice. I\u2019m going to go dig Fallon out of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how Tate saw her head to the back of the bar through the clusters of people, but she was up and gone in no time, pushing through dancers, in search of her friend. Taking a seat, I downed the rest of my beer and lurched forward when Jax slapped me on the back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going after either one of them?\u201d he asked, locking his fingers behind his head and leaning on the back legs of the chair.</p><p>\u201cTate and Fallon?\u201d I peered over at him. \u201cI think they can take care of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant Fallon or Ashtyn. Isn\u2019t Ashtyn your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Girlfriend. The word made me want to dunk my head in mud and not come up for air until I was dead.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I looked back to the dance floor. \u201cWhen do I have girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>I locked eyes with Jared across the table, and he didn\u2019t speak. He said enough with his eyes, though.</p><p>He knew something was going on, and he knew I was off the rails. But like a good friend, he didn\u2019t feel the need to state the obvious.</p><p>Just knowing he was there, and that he got it, helped.</p><p>I caught sight of Tate\u2019s red T-shirt coming out of the crowd, and I sat up straight when I noticed that she was alone.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she sighed, putting her hands on her hips, \u201cI guess we can head out. I\u2019m done for the night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled down at Jared, a look going on between them that said they weren\u2019t done for the night. But I was confused.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fallon?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Tate busied herself, slinging her purse across her chest, barely meeting my eyes. \u201cOh, Fallon? Yeah, she\u2019s . . . I guess . . . heading out to another bar with that guy that was sitting here before. What was his name? Aidan?\u201d</p><p>Anger radiated out of my pores, and my eyebrows pinched together painfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d What the f**k?</p><p>Tate finally looked my way and fixed her lips into a thin line, looking like it was no big deal. \u201cYeah.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI went to grab her from the bathroom, and she was chatting with him in the hall. They headed out the back way.\u201d</p><p>I pushed out of my seat, glaring at Tate.</p><p>She left with him? Hell, no.</p><p>Without so much as a good-bye, I headed out of the bar and through the door. Coming out to the sidewalk, I stopped and twisted my head to the left and right.</p><p>Where the hell was she?</p><p>Oxygen flooded in and out of my lungs in heavy breaths.</p><p>To the left was nothing but darkness. To the right was the strip of college bars where he would\u2019ve taken her.</p><p>I turned left first. Aidan wasn\u2019t a creeper. I had no reason to suspect that he\u2019d lure her somewhere quiet and try anything, but it felt like the better option to make sure before I searched the populated and somewhat safer public bars.</p><p>I pounded the pavement, the town getting quieter the farther I walked.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>I was going to find her, punch him, and then fix Tate\u2019s car, so Fallon could get the hell out of town. Tonight.</p><p>I messed with her on the dance floor, kissed her almost beyond my own control, and then thought she\u2019d stay invisible and quiet?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I just let her leave this afternoon like she wanted?</p><p>In the three or so months since I\u2019d last seen her, I\u2019d been doing fine. Sure I wasn\u2019t happy, but like before, I got over the separation and moved on with my life. However dull it was.</p><p>Now, she had me chasing her down and in knots.</p><p>I was Madoc Caruthers. I don\u2019t get mad, and I don\u2019t chase women that don\u2019t want to be chased.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t let her go with him. That wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>The sharp glow from the streetlights illuminated the whole area, and so far I\u2019d seen no one resembling Fallon. A few couples here and there. Some drunk students stumbling around together.</p><p>Stopping at a corner I looked left again and let out a breath, finally spotting her. Her legs moved briskly, and she disappeared under the shadow of trees, shielding the moon\u2019s light. But I knew it was her. That damned ripped shirt.</p><p>Digging in my heels, I walked as fire and anger urged my legs forward. I wanted to run. To race up behind her, throw her over my shoulder, and take her home.</p><p>My voice was deep and bitter as I shouted. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She spun around, stopping and scowling at me. \u201cYou followed me?\u201d she accused.</p><p>I ignored the question. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>Her lips twisted up, enough to know she was done with me for the night and was not cooperating.</p><p>But then . . . she turned her lips up in a sinister smile and looked me up and down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor someone that hates me,\u201d she started as she looked at me with heat in her eyes, \u201cyou are awfully concerned about my comings and goings.\u201d She dragged a delicate hand down her neck, over her breast, continuing down to rest on the inside of her turned-out thigh.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>My eyes had a mind of their own. They just followed.</p><p>She smirked as if she\u2019d just won, and I blinked, trying to drag my gaze away from where her hand rested. Turning back around, she walked even faster as she continued down the sidewalk toward wherever she was going.</p> <p>That\u2019s when it occurred to me that she was alone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aidan?\u201d I shouted, but she ignored me, steering into the dim park.</p><p>Running after her this time, I tore off my light blue button-down and threw it across her arm.</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Fallon, it\u2019s cold and dark. Take the shirt.\u201d I shook it at her, but took it away when she continued to ignore me.</p><p>I stuck my tongue between my teeth to keep from grinding them. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk through a park alone,\u201d I barked. \u201cWhere\u2019s Aidan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I know where Aidan is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d I trailed off, blinking long and hard.</p><p>Fuckin\u2019 Tate.</p><p>Realizing I\u2019d been set up, and even more aggravated that Tate allowed Fallon to walk through town by herself in the dark, I exhaled deeply through my nose.</p><p>Of course, Tate probably assumed I\u2019d run after Fallon, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, looks like I got played. I was under the impression you left a bar with a complete stranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that would be so like me, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d The resentment in her comeback was thick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you looked comfortable with him on the dance floor.\u201d I struggled to maintain pace and still look cool. She was almost speed-walking.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like you with the brunette?\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cAm I complaining, Madoc? Nope, because I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I brushed off the sting of her words with a casual smile. \u201cI moved on. It wasn\u2019t hard. Just like you did in Chicago, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I swerved in her path and cut her off, staring down at her as she tightened every muscle in her face. \u201cWith as easily as you open your legs for me,\u201d I continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re having a great time in college.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared, and she slammed her hands into my chest, but I barely stumbled. \u201cUgh!\u201d she growled. Her green jewels fired in anger, and her hair fanned around her face in a wild storm.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I challenged, breaking into a laugh. \u201cYou know I like it when you fight me. It gets you hot, and I get laid.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers balled up, and I saw her hand coming before she probably even knew what she was doing. Her tight fist landed right across my jaw, hitting the corner of my mouth, and I didn\u2019t even try to stop it. I loved Fallon\u2019s fight. I always did.</p> <p>The sharp ache in my face spread across my chin, and I pursed my lips, sucking and swallowing the blood from the cut on the inside of my mouth.</p><p>Her fists didn\u2019t stop, though. Landing with two hard thuds right on my chest, I grabbed her wrists, trying to still her.</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d she screamed, but the flutters in my stomach turned to amusement that I couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>I burst out laughing, and she went wild.</p><p>Her arms flailed, and she tried pulling away and kicking at me, until finally I let her body crash into mine, dragging us to the ground. She landed on top of me, but I quickly rolled us over, straddling her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cry out, thank goodness, only wiggled and shot me with bullets from her eyes. God help me if a police officer stumbled this way, though. This \u201cbanter\u201d was something most people wouldn\u2019t understand. I wasn\u2019t going to hurt her. I just wanted her attention.</p><p>Pinning her arms to the ground at the sides of her head, I leaned in, whispering in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say wrong?\u201d I teased, feeling the fast rise and fall of her br**sts against my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not having fun at college, or you\u2019re mad that I called it? Don\u2019t be ashamed for spreading yourself around, Fallon. It\u2019s genetic. You\u2019re your mother\u2019s daughter, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d She reared up, trying to throw me off, but I pressed down.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I challenged, seeing the tears I wanted in her eyes. \u201cCome on. Admit it!\u201d</p><p>Her face, hot with fierce defiance, looked about ready to explode.</p><p>And then she screamed, \u201cI\u2019ve never been with anyone but you, ass**le!\u201d</p><p>And I stopped. Everything stopped.</p><p>The air left me. My face fell. I didn\u2019t care that my heart pounded like a baseball bat across my chest.</p><p>What the hell did she just say?</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, studying her. She sucked in air through her teeth, glaring at me like she wanted to tear me apart.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she growled. \u201cNow get off me before I scream.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cIn the two years that we were apart, there was no one else?\u201d I questioned, still hovering over her.</p><p>\u201cThere will be.\u201d Her threatening whisper sounded scarier than her shouts. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you a distant memory.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her challenge, and whether I understood it or not, my dick started to swell, as well. Maybe it was the position we were in, the heat of battle, or the need to break her down, but I wanted to touch her hard.</p><p>I saw the silver glint of her tongue ring through her teeth, and I instinctively ran my tongue across the back of my bottom teeth, remembering the feel of that in my mouth on the dance floor.</p><p>Her breathing was slowing, and she licked her lips, not wavering under my gaze.</p><p>I kept my voice low and soft, trying to reach her. \u201cYou act like you have no heart, like you just swallow your conscience with all of the pain you cause. But I see through it, Fallon. The truth is, you want me like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d She closed her mouth and swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted me. You know why? Because I don\u2019t try to kill your demons. I run with them.\u201d</p><p>Her chest started rising and falling faster again, and her eyes faltered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never stopped wanting you,\u201d I added before crashing my mouth down on hers.</p><p>She moaned into my throat, and I was like a man at a feast. I couldn\u2019t kiss her fast enough. The more my lips moved over hers, the deeper the hunger in my stomach.</p><p>More, more, more. My whole body was on fire.</p><p>How did she always do this to me?</p><p>I straightened out my legs, flattening my body against hers, and moved my hands off her wrists and to the ground. I was about ready to do f**king cartwheels when she didn\u2019t hit me but instead took my face in her hands to deepen the kiss.</p><p>Her hot, slick mouth connected with mine, and I kept my lips open over hers to play with her tongue. Every time the tongue ring brushed over a part of my mouth, my dick jerked with the rush of blood.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Fallon. Your f**king tongue,\u201d I gasped before diving in for more. The ball in her mouth turned me on to the point where I\u2019d probably be okay just kissing her for the rest of the damn night.</p><p>But . . . hearing that she\u2019d only ever been with me made me feel a ton of different things I couldn\u2019t analyze right now.</p><p>All I knew was that I wanted to be her first with everything now. I wasn\u2019t worrying about her comparing me to other guys. I was only worried about living up to her fantasies.</p><p>Which, strangely, was a taller order. I wanted to give her everything.</p><p>Moving to lie on the ground at her side, I didn\u2019t break the kiss as I ran my hand down her body and slipped it inside her jeans.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I pulled back, opening my eyes and looking down at her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing underwear. Just her jeans.</p><p>My hand reached lower, finding what I wanted between her legs, and a smile tugged at my lips. My fingers found her center, and I could already feel the wetness at her opening. She arched her head back and panted.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much you turn me on?\u201d My question sounded more like an accusation. \u201cSo wet and perfect.\u201d</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Sliding two fingers inside of her, I nearly f**king lost it. The heat. The wetness around my fingers. \u201cI want inside this,\u201d I told her, pumping my fingers faster.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, please,\u201d she pleaded, and I dipped down to trail my tongue along the ridge of her ear. She shuddered and leaned her head into me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I want to give you another first.\u201d</p><p>Pushing myself up on one knee to hover over her again, I took my hand out of her jeans and reached up, pushing the hem of her shirt up below her br**sts. Taking the skin of her stomach in my mouth, I teased it with little kisses, trailing a line down to the top of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, you can\u2019t.\u201d She took my head in her hands, lifting her head up. \u201cSomeone will see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>I unbuttoned and unzipped her low-rise jeans and had barely yanked them down to her knees before I dove down to taste her.</p><p>It was the beginning of October and already cold as hell, but I was burning up.</p><p>Her body was so hot, and I looked up at her as my tongue swirled her clit. I breathed out a laugh, seeing her peek out of her hands.</p><p>She was embarrassed, and I was f**king ecstatic. I might be the only one that\u2019d been inside of her, but that didn\u2019t mean that no one else hadn\u2019t done this to her. Now I knew no one else had.</p><p>My dick, my mouth, my tongue. She was mine.</p><p>I pressed my tongue down on her swollen nub and moved in circles, and soon her hands were off her flushed face and grabbing at my hair.</p><p>Her legs started shifting, the left and then the right, and I realized that she was trying to kick her jeans all of the way off.</p><p>That a girl.</p><p>I shot up and grabbed the hem at her ankles and yanked on the jeans, tossing them I-didn\u2019t-know-where.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d I groaned under my breath, looking down at her, T-shirt pulled up and na**d all the rest of the way down.</p><p>I dropped back down between her legs, and she fisted my hair as I licked her length long and gentle and then swirled my tongue around her clit.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d she panted, grinding herself into my tongue. \u201cThat\u2019s so good. Make me come. Please.\u201d</p><p>My whole damn body was tense, and I was on fire from the waist down. My dick rubbed against my jeans, and I could feel the sweat trail down the middle of my back under my T-shirt.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take much more of this.</p><p>Not the wanting her, but the needing her. It was like a fire in my belly having her again, and I pushed the notion away that she didn\u2019t need me, too. She could admit it or hide it, but it rolled off of her like lightning.</p><p>Putting my whole mouth on her, I ate her out, causing her to moan more. I sucked and nibbled her, licked and plunged inside of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Madoc.\u201d She threw her head back, her fast breaths going a mile a minute as her body shook. I gripped her hips, and she damn-near pulled out my hair as she came.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t nurse her back down to Earth as she shuddered.</p><p>Leaning back and sitting on my heels, I dug a condom out of my wallet. Before she\u2019d even opened her eyes, I\u2019d torn open the package, rolled on the rubber, and crowned her entrance. I wanted inside of her before her orgasm finished. Leaning over her and panting just as hard as she was, I reached behind my head and grabbed my black T-shirt, pulling it off and flinging it to the side. I supported myself with one hand on the ground and one hand on my cock, hard and ready for her. She pushed off the ground, wrapping her arms around my neck and kissing me hard.</p><p>I rubbed the tip of my c**k over her clit, and she quivered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d I gritted through my teeth. \u201cI need you now.\u201d</p><p>As soon she fell back to the ground, she spread her legs wider, and I worked the tip inside of her. Grabbing her hip to steady her, I plunged inside completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh!\u201d she moaned, and I closed my eyes, letting out a low grunt.</p><p>I wrapped my arm under her knee and grabbed her thigh with my hand, pulling her down on me as far as she could go.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d Her whisper was wanton. She was lost, craving more and more. She grabbed my ass inside the back of my jeans, and I winced as her nails dug in. I loved that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I breathed, moving in and out of her in a quick rhythm. \u201cTouch me, Fallon.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers grappled with my ass and then trailed up my back and brought my head down to meet her lips. She was wild. Her tongue licked my neck, sucked on my ear, and dove into my mouth with full force.</p><p>\u201cGo faster, Madoc,\u201d she whispered in my ear. \u201cCome hard.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, I continued to support myself with one hand on the ground and one hand on her tit, pounding into her as she squeezed my h*ps tight with each thrust.</p><p>Her hair fanned out across the cold grass, and I watched, mesmerized, as her body pushed back and forth on the ground as I entered her each time.</p><p>I was consumed with Fallon, and while I knew I\u2019d survive without her, I didn\u2019t want to. I wanted her in my bed, in my lap, at my dinner table, and on my arm every goddamn day from now on.</p> <p>This was my girl, and I finally understood why Jared needed Tate so much. Why he hurt her when he thought he couldn\u2019t love her.</p><p>He just wanted her.</p><p>Fallon looked up at me, folding her bottom lip between her teeth, and I saw her eyes tense. She tightened around my cock, and I knew she was about to come.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d I urged, keeping my eyes on her.</p><p>With every thrust, a whimpered breath came out of her, her emerald eyes pleading with me. I bit down, steeling my jaw.</p><p>She finally squeezed her eyes shut and cried out, and I let it go, too. Her muscles clenched around me, spasming, and I slammed into her twice more before spilling and collapsing.</p> <p>I lay there with my head on her shoulder, our ragged breaths the only sound in the otherwise silent park.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want to look around to see if we\u2019d been caught. She\u2019d been loud, and I felt my skin warm as my heartbeat picked up.</p><p>She twisted her head toward me, and I leaned up, inches from her mouth. Her lips parted, and her eyes begged as she just stared at me, both pain and pleasure in her eyes.</p><p>Taking the invitation, I kissed her, wrapping my arms around the top of her head on the ground and enveloping her with my body.</p><p>The full force of her lips pushed back against mine, deepening the kiss.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d she quivered against my mouth. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I urged, taking her mouth again.</p> <p>There were things we needed to say. But not tonight.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>That night I crashed on the couch in my father\u2019s house, not wanting to push Fallon too far, too fast. Our midnight romp in the park was enough to scare her off, and I was pissed that I felt the need to walk on eggshells around her.</p><p>I had never cared about any other girl like this, and I didn\u2019t know if that was just me, or if it was Fallon. She and I started so young; maybe she\u2019d ruined me for other women. I didn\u2019t know. And I wasn\u2019t in the mood to think about whether or not I loved her.</p><p>I settled on the fact that I was simply not done with her.</p><p>So, I backed off, not insisting that we share a bed, and opted to let her get some rest.</p><p>Tate and Jared were already home by the time Fallon and I walked in. I didn\u2019t see them, but I could definitely make out certain little noises coming from their room that told me they weren\u2019t asleep.</p><p>I planted a long kiss on Fallon\u2019s lips before saying good night.</p><p>But the next morning, it was Jared shaking me awake.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re heading out soon,\u201d he alerted me.</p><p>I brought the heel of my hands up to rub my eyes. \u201cIs everyone up?\u201d I asked, sitting up. He threw two duffel bags into the foyer next to the door. \u201cYeah, but Fallon\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p><p>I threw my legs over the edge of the couch with my elbows on my knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blurted out, looking at him like he better be lying.</p><p>\u201cI guess she woke Jax up early to fix the car.\u201d He gave me a knowing look. \u201cObviously, that didn\u2019t take long, since he only had to plug back in the throttle body, so she\u2019s already been gone an hour.\u201d He stopped and stared, chewing on his gum and waiting for me to say something.</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-believable!\u201d I shouted, picking up a vase from the coffee table and hurling it across the room where it shattered against the wall.</p><p>I slammed myself back against the brown leather couch, running my hands over my face in exasperation.</p><p>What the f**k?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I heard Jax come around the corner and ask. I laid my head back, closing my eyes and locking my hands on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jared answered. \u201cLet me handle this.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear Jax leave, but when I dropped my hands and opened my eyes he was gone. Jared walked around the coffee table and sat down in the brown leather chair that matched the sofa.</p><p>\u201cShe went back to Shelburne Falls for the rest of the weekend. Her mom texted saying she needed her there or something,\u201d Jax said. The anger inside of me created a fog in my head too thick to think.</p><p>Jared dug in his hoodie and seemed to be removing one of his keys. \u201cWe\u2019re heading back now,\u201d he said as he worked. \u201cWe\u2019ll visit the parents, and Tate\u2019s got a race tonight. You should come.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not even looking at him.</p><p>Was he nuts?</p><p>He held a key out to me. \u201cTo Tate\u2019s house,\u201d he explained. \u201cFallon is staying there tonight. Mr. Brandt is leaving town on business early this evening, and I\u2019ll keep Tate in our room at your house. You go sort this out.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>What the hell did Fallon ever really do for me anyway? This was the last straw. If she couldn\u2019t open up and act f**king normal, then she wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>Jared stood up and threw the key on my T-shirt-clad chest. \u201cJust go,\u201d he ordered. \u201cSort this shit out. I want my friend back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I maintained. \u201cI\u2019m not chasing after her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the whole school about my teddy bear to get Tate back.\u201d He scowled down at me. \u201cChase. Harder.\u201d</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Fallon knew I wanted her. She had to know that I cared about her. But I didn\u2019t trust her. She was playing me, and I didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>When she was ready to talk, she\u2019d find me.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>FALLON</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I look up from the hospital bed where I\u2019d just been asleep. He stands over me in his cream-colored cable sweater and brown leather jacket, smelling of coffee and Ralph Lauren.</p><p>His eyes, pained and exhausted, scan over my body. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done to yourself.\u201d</p><p>My face scrunches up, and my eyes start to tear. \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A sob catches in my throat, and I look for him to hold me.</p><p>I need him. He\u2019s all I have.</p><p>The emptiness. The loneliness. I\u2019m all alone now. I have no one. My mom is gone. She won\u2019t call me. The baby is gone. My hands instinctively go to my stomach, and I only feel a dull throb in the pit instead of love.</p><p>My eyes burn, and I look away, starting to cry in the quiet and darkened room.</p><p>This isn\u2019t my life. It\u2019s not how it was supposed to be. I wasn\u2019t supposed to love him. I wasn\u2019t supposed to break.</p><p>But after the abortion, everything sunk into the mud, and I couldn\u2019t walk anymore. I couldn\u2019t eat. The pain in my chest only grew, and I was constantly exhausted from the worry and heartache. Where was he? Was he trying to reach me? Did he think about me?</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized until I was torn from him how much I loved him.</p><p>My mom said it was infatuation. A crush. That I\u2019d get over it. But every day the frustration and sorrow deepened. I was failing in school. I had no friends.</p><p>I finally snuck back to Shelburne Falls only to find Madoc had definitely moved on like my mom said. He wasn\u2019t dwelling on me one bit. The only thing on his mind was the girl with her head between his legs. Backing away \u0327 I had run out of the house and jumped back in my father\u2019s car that I had stolen. Now, here I was, three days later with lacerations on my arms and a sharp ache in my chest.</p><p>I suck in a breath and stiffen as my father rips the blanket and sheet off of me, sending them flying to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what are you doing?\u201d I cry, noticing his fierce green eyes.</p><p>He yanks me from the bed, squeezing my upper arm so hard that the skin stings.</p><p>\u201cOw, Daddy!\u201d I wail, limping across the floor as he drags me into the bathroom. My arm feels stretched, like any minute he\u2019ll yank it from the socket.</p><p>What is he doing?</p><p>I watch as he plugs up the bathroom sink and begins filling it with water. The fingers of his other hand dig into the flesh of my arm, and I begin hyperventilating.</p><p>He pulls my arm hard, yanking me closer as he yells. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Tears spill over, and I sob, \u201cYour daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer.\u201d And he grabs the back of my neck and forces my face into the filled sink.</p><p>No!</p><p>I gasp and suck in unwanted water as my head is forced under. I slam both hands on each side of the sink to push back against his hand, but he\u2019s too strong. I shake my head, my slippery hands sliding out from under me as I struggle against him.</p><p>The water is in my nose, and I squeeze my eyes shut against the burn.</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m yanked up out of the water.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, stop it!\u201d I cough and sputter, water dripping from my ratty tendrils and chin.</p><p>His voice thunders around me. \u201cYou want to die, Fallon?\u201d He jerks my head in his anger. \u201cThat\u2019s why you did this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d I rush out before he slams my head back into the water, cutting off my air supply. I barely have time to think or prepare myself. My mind turns black as I wail into the shallow depth.</p><p>My father won\u2019t kill me, I tell myself. But I\u2019m hurting. The insides of my forearms sting, and I think my cuts are bleeding again.</p><p>He yanks me back up, and I reach behind myself and grab at his hand at the back of my head as I sob.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he bellows again.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter!\u201d My body shakes with fear. \u201cDaddy, stop it! I\u2019m your daughter!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m crying and shivering, the front of my nightgown dripping water down my legs.</p><p>He growls close to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re not my daughter. My daughter doesn\u2019t give up. There were no skid marks on the street, Fallon. You crashed into the tree on purpose!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head against his grasp. No. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t hit it on purpose.</p><p>My mouth fills with thick saliva, and my eyes squeeze shut, remembering leaving Madoc\u2019s house and hiding out at my father\u2019s place near Chicago. I\u2019d taken one of his cars and . . . no, I didn\u2019t try to hit the tree.</p><p>My body shook, and my throat filled with pain.</p><p>I\u2019d just let go of the wheel.</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>I steal air as fast as I can and whimper as I cry. What the hell has happened to me?</p><p>I stumble as my father throws my back into the wall next to the sink. Before I even have a chance to straighten myself, his hand comes across my face with a loud slap, and I wince at the sting traveling down my neck.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I rage against the blur in my eyes.</p><p>He grabs me by the shoulders and pins me against the wall again and I cry out.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d he challenges.</p><p>My fists slam against his chest, and I heave my whole body into the push. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>He steps back to steady himself but comes up again and grabs my head between his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that it gutted me when your mother took you away?\u201d he asks, his eyes heartbroken. \u201cI punched every wall in the goddamn house, Fallon. But I swallowed it down. Because that\u2019s what we do. We swallow every brick of shit this world feeds us until the wall inside of us is so strong that nothing breaks it.\u201d He lowers his labored voice, sounding stronger. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did. I let her take you, because I knew that cunt would make you strong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I clench my teeth, trying to stop my tears as I look at him. I love my father, but I can\u2019t love him for letting my mother take me away. I guess in his head he thought it was a way of hiding me from his enemies. Did living with my mother make me strong? Of course not. Look at me, blubbering and ruined. I\u2019m not strong.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to give up. You don\u2019t get to quit!\u201d he yells. \u201cThere will be other loves and other babies,\u201d he growls, shaking my head between his hands and leveling me with his hard stare. \u201cNow. Swallow. The. Pain!\u201d he rages all around me. \u201cSwallow it!\u201d</p><p>His roar shatters my insides, and I stop crying, staring at him wide-eyed.</p><p>He holds my head tightly, forcing me to keep my eyes on him, and I focus, looking for something to grab on to. Anything. I concentrate on the tiniest point I can find, the center of his black pupils.</p> <p>I don\u2019t blink. I don\u2019t budge.</p><p>The center of his eye is so dark, and I try to imagine that it feels like cruising through space at warp speed. In my world there is no one but him. The gold surrounding the black flickers, and I wonder why I didn\u2019t inherit that in my green eyes. The white in his irises looks like lightning, and the ring of emerald, before you get to the white of the eyeballs, seems to ripple like water.</p><p>Before I know it our breathing is syncing up, and he\u2019s setting the rhythm I follow.</p><p>Inhale, exhale.</p><p>Inhale, exhale.</p> <p>Inhale, exhale.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s face flashes in my mind, and I tighten my jaw. Memories of my aborted pregnancy crash into his image, and my teeth rub together. My mother\u2019s voice enters my ears, and I suck my tongue dry, taking all of it, all of them, and swallowing the hard lump to the back of my throat, down my pipe, and I feel it all leave my brain.</p><p>It\u2019s still inside me. Heavy.</p><p>But it\u2019s quiet now, buried in my stomach.</p><p>My father releases my head and runs a thumb across my cheek as he holds my chin.</p><p>\u201cNow who are you?\u201d he implores.</p> <p>\u201cFallon Pierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where were you born?\u201d</p><p>My voice is calm. \u201cBoston, Massachusetts.\u201d</p><p>He takes a step back, giving me room. \u201cAnd what do you want to do with your life?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I finally look at him, whispering. \u201cI want to build things.\u201d</p><p>He reaches to my side and picks a towel off the shelf, handing it me. I hold it to my chest, not really feeling the cold anymore. Not really feeling anything.</p><p>He leans in and kisses my forehead and then meets my eyes. \u201c\u2018Nothing that happens on the surface of the sea can alter the calm of its depths.\u2019\u201d He quotes Andrew Harvey. \u201cNo one can take away who you are, Fallon. Don\u2019t give anyone that power.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t cried since that day that\u2019s suddenly on my mind. I\u2019d come close, but two whole years and not one tear. My father kept me home for exactly one week to heal the injuries from the shards of glass from the windshield that had cut me up, but then he sent me back to boarding school to get on with my life.</p> <p>And I had. That\u2019s something everyone needs to learn on their own. Life goes on, smiles will come again, and time heals some wounds and soothes the ones it can\u2019t.</p><p>I brought up my grades, made a few friends, and laughed a lot.</p><p>I simply couldn\u2019t forgive, though. Betrayal cuts deep, and that\u2019s what brought me back to town last June.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t expect Madoc to still affect me.</p><p>He wanted me. I knew it. I felt it. But why? What did I really ever do to deserve him?</p><p>He\u2019d been faithful to me when we were sixteen. Of that, I was pretty certain. I couldn\u2019t hate him anymore for looking for a good time when he\u2019d thought I\u2019d willingly left him.</p><p>There are so many things I should tell him. Things that he had a right to know. And then I felt that I\u2019d told him too much.</p><p>Madoc was better off without me. Our relationship started off in the wrong place to begin with. We had nowhere left to grow. He didn\u2019t know me or what interested me. We talked about nothing.</p><p>Once he\u2019d had his fill of the sex, he would leave. Not to mention the baby. If he ever found out about the baby, he\u2019d jump ship. No doubt. Madoc wasn\u2019t ready for anything that heavy. I wondered if he\u2019d ever be.</p><p>I turned up \u201cFar from Home\u201d by Five Finger Death Punch and swallowed the guilt all the way back to Shelburne Falls as I drove home at my mother\u2019s request. She\u2019d texted this morning to let me know I had stuff at the house. If I didn\u2019t come to collect what I\u2019d left last summer, it was going in the trash.</p><p>I shook my head and ran a hand over my weary eyes.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Punching the gate code in, I inched Tate\u2019s G8 forward as the black iron bars creaked open.</p><p>It was Saturday, late morning, and the October sky was lightly sprinkled with clouds. It was chilly out, but I hadn\u2019t brought a jacket, opting for my black-and-gray-striped long-sleeved T-shirt and some jeans. My hair still hung loose from last night, but it\u2019d been fluffed after my shower this morning. For some reason, though, I\u2019d wanted Madoc\u2019s smell to stay in my hair along with the tiny bits of grass I kept finding. My long bangs fanned around my cheekbones, and I picked my glasses off the passenger seat as I parked in front of the Caruthers\u2019s house behind my mother\u2019s BMW.</p><p>My glasses had been intended for reading years ago, but I took to wearing them almost all of the time. It felt safe somehow.</p><p>Walking into the house, I traipsed through the foyer and down the hall next to the stairs leading to the back of the house where I was sure to find Addie in the kitchen.</p><p>The quiet house seemed so different now. Almost hollow as if it weren\u2019t filled with memories, stories, and a family. The bitter chill of the marble floors shot through my sneakers and up my calves, and the high ceilings didn\u2019t magically hold in warmth anymore.</p><p>Looking out the glass patio doors, I saw Addie sweeping up around the pool that already had the cover rolled over it for the coming winter. When I looked farther out, though, I noticed that the Jacuzzi was covered as well. When I lived here, that continued to be used throughout the cold months as well as the lawn furniture and barbecue area. Madoc\u2019s dad loved grilled food, and he and Madoc would venture out to throw steaks on the barbecue in the dead of January.</p><p>Now the entire patio seemed barren. Dead leaves blew this way and that, and it didn\u2019t look like Addie was making any progress. It didn\u2019t even look like she was trying to.</p><p>This house had problems, but it also had a history of laughter and memories. Now everything just looked dead.</p><p>I opened the sliding glass door and walked out across the stone tiles.</p><p>\u201cAddie?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at me, and her low, quiet voice wasn\u2019t welcoming like last time. \u201cFallon.\u201d</p><p>I took off my glasses and stuck them in my back pocket. \u201cAddie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She folded her lips between her teeth. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to tell her what I was sorry about. Nothing escaped her notice in this house, and I knew she knew that the divorce mess was my fault. That Madoc being sent away was my fault.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI never meant for this to happen.\u201d</p><p>And that was the truth. I\u2019d wanted to be the one to leave Madoc, and I\u2019d wanted Jason and my mother to feel a pinch, but I didn\u2019t know my mother would fight the divorce so hard or that Madoc would be caught in the middle.</p><p>Truth is, I hadn\u2019t thought of Addie at all.</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, and her scowl stayed trained on her sweeping. \u201cThat bitch thinks she\u2019s going to take this house,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to take the house, sell off everything in it, and let it sit.\u201d</p><p>I stepped closer. \u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I guess.\u201d Her bitter tone cut me off. \u201cJason is choosing to spend most of his time in the city or at Katherine\u2019s house, and Madoc hasn\u2019t been home in months.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, shame burning my face.</p><p>I did this.</p><p>My eyes were starting to sting, so I closed them and swallowed. I\u2019ll fix it. I have to. I should never have come back. Madoc was fine. They were all fine before me.</p><p>This house, once alive with laughter and parties, was empty now, and Addie\u2019s family that she\u2019d loved and taken care of was separated and broken. She\u2019d been almost entirely alone these past three months. Because of me.</p><p>I backed away, knowing she wouldn\u2019t want to hear another apology. Turning around, I started back for the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cYou still have things in your room,\u201d Addie called out, and I turned back around. \u201cAnd you have some boxes in the basement.\u201d</p><p>What? I didn\u2019t have anything in the basement.</p><p>\u201cBoxes?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cBoxes,\u201d she repeated, still not looking at me.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Boxes?</p><p>I headed into the house, but rather than go upstairs to pack up the clothes I\u2019d left months ago, I went straight for the basement door off to the side of the kitchen.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense for me to have anything down there. My mother threw away everything from my room, and I hadn\u2019t come to live here with much to start with.</p><p>I walked down the brightly lit stairs, my feet almost silent on the carpeted staircase.</p><p>For a huge-ass house like this, it featured an equally huge basement with four rooms. One was decorated as an extra bedroom, and another was Mr. Caruthers\u2019s liquor storage. There was also a room dedicated to tubs of holiday decorations, and then the large open area that held a gaming center with standing video games, a pool table, air hockey, foosball, a gigantic flat screen, and just about every other entertainment a teenage boy like Madoc could enjoy with his friends. The room also held a refrigerator full of refreshments and couches for relaxing.</p><p>But the only part I ever enjoyed about coming down here was when Mr. Caruthers decided that I needed my own outlet for activity in the basement.</p><p>My half-pipe.</p><p>He thought it was a way for Madoc and me to bond, and since I wasn\u2019t making friends, it served to put me side by side with Madoc\u2019s. While they played, so could I.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>I simply stayed out of there when Madoc entertained, and I worked on my skills at other times. It wasn\u2019t him so much but his friends. I found Jared moody and everyone else dumb.</p><p>Looking around the large area, I noticed everything was spotlessly clean. The beige carpets looked new, and the wood smelled of furniture polish. Light poured in from the set of patio doors leading outside to the sunken backyard off the side of the house. The tan walls still burst with Notre Dame paraphernalia: flags, pennants, framed photos, and souvenirs.</p><p>An entire wall was splashed with family photos, mostly of Madoc growing up. Madoc opening Christmas presents when he was eight or nine. Madoc hanging from the goal post on a soccer field at ten or eleven. Madoc and Jared under the hood of his GTO as Madoc throws a goofy gang symbol with his hands.</p><p>And then one of him and me. Right in the middle of the wall, over the piano. We were out by the pool, and Addie had wanted a picture of us. We must\u2019ve been about fourteen or fifteen. We had our backs to each other, leaning against each other with our arms crossed over our chests. I remember Addie kept trying to get Madoc\u2019s brotherly arm around my shoulder, but this was the only way we\u2019d pose.</p><p>Studying the picture closely, I noticed that I was half-scowling at the camera. There was, however, a hint of a smile. I tried to look bored despite the butterflies in my stomach, I remembered. My body had started having a reaction to Madoc, and I\u2019d hated it.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s expression was . . .</p><p>His head was turned toward the camera but down. He had a tiny smile on his lips that looked like it was bursting to get out.</p><p>Such a little devil.</p><p>I turned around and ran my hand over the old piano that Addie said Madoc still played. Though not anymore, since he was away at school. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The lid was down, and there was sheet music scattered on the top. The music rack had Dvor?\u00e1k on it, though. Madoc had always been partial to the Eastern European and Russian composers. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I heard him play, though. It was funny. He was such an exhibitionist when it didn\u2019t matter and not one when it did.</p><p>And that\u2019s when my foot brushed something. Peering down underneath the piano, I noticed the white cardboard boxes.</p><p>Kneeling down, I dragged one out only to notice that there were about ten more underneath.</p><p>Flipping the lid off, I froze so still that only my heartbeat moved my body.</p> <p>Oh, my God.</p><p>My stuff?</p><p>I stared down into a box full of my Legos. All of the robots and cars with remotes and wires were thrown in here, scattered with loose pieces around the box.</p><p>I licked my dry lips and dug in, taking out a Turbo Quad I made when I was twelve and a Tracker that I\u2019d just started on before I left.</p><p>This was my stuff from my room!</p> <p>I was frantic, smiling like an idiot, ready to laugh out loud. I dove under the piano, pulling out two more boxes.</p><p>Tossing off the lids, I gasped in surprise at all of my mock engineering blueprints and another box of Legos. I shuffled through the papers, memories flooding me of the times I\u2019d sit in my room with my sketchpad and design futuristic skyscrapers and ships.</p><p>My fingers started tingling and a shaky laugh broke out, causing me to giggle like I hadn\u2019t in a very long time.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe this! This was my stuff!</p><p>I scurried back under the piano, slamming my head into the edge in the process.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I groaned, rubbing the top of my forehead and pulling another box out much slower this time.</p> <p>I went through all of the boxes, finding everything I\u2019d missed and things I didn\u2019t even remember that I\u2019d had. Skateboards, posters, jewelry, books . . . nearly everything from my bedroom except the clothes.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the floor, I stared at all of the stuff around me, feeling strangely disconnected from the girl I used to be yet so glad to have found her again. All of these things represented a time when I\u2019d stopped listening to others and started listening to myself. When I\u2019d stopped trying to be what she wanted and just started to be.</p><p>These boxes were Fallon Pierce, and they weren\u2019t lost. I closed my eyes, clutching my sea otter stuffed animal I\u2019d gotten from my dad at SeaWorld when I was seven.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open, and I saw Addie at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>She had her arms folded across her chest and let out a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d I questioned. \u201cHe did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost it a little when you left.\u201d She pushed off the wall and walked toward me. \u201cStealing his dad\u2019s liquor, partying, girls . . . he bounced off the walls for a few months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She studied me and then gave a defeated half-smile before continuing. \u201cJason sure had his work cut out for him. Madoc and his friend Jared wreaked havoc like nobody\u2019s business the summer after sophomore year. One night he went into your room and saw that your mom had cleaned everything out to redecorate. Only she hadn\u2019t packed anything. She\u2019d thrown it out.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I knew that. But somehow the pain in my chest wasn\u2019t spreading. If she threw it out, then . . . I looked down, closing my eyes against the burn again.</p><p>No. Please no.</p><p>\u201cMadoc went outside and dug everything back out of the trash.\u201d Addie\u2019s soft voice spilled around me and my chest started to shake. \u201cHe boxed it up and saved it for you.\u201d</p><p>My chin started trembling, and I shook my head. No, no, no . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes Madoc a good kid, Fallon. He picks up the pieces.\u201d</p><p>I crumbled.</p><p>The tears spilled over my lids, and I gasped as my body shook. I couldn\u2019t open my eyes. The pain was too great.</p><p>I doubled over, clutching the sea otter, and put my head down, sobbing.</p><p>Up came the sadness and despair, and I wanted to take back everything I\u2019d said to him. Every time I doubted him. Everything I didn\u2019t tell him.</p><p>Madoc, who saw me.</p><p>Madoc, who remembered me.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Six hours later I was sitting in Tate\u2019s bedroom, my leg slung over the side of her cushioned chair near her French doors, and staring out at the tree outside. All of the fall colors swayed in the breeze, and the soft glow of the day\u2019s last light slowly disappeared from the branches, inch by inch.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t talked much since getting there, and she\u2019d been good about not asking questions. I knew she was worried, because she avoided the topic of Madoc so well that he was like a planet sitting in the middle of the room. I wondered if he\u2019d been angry to find me gone this morning.</p><p>I rubbed my hand over my eyes. I couldn\u2019t shake him.</p><p>And what\u2019s more? I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cTate?\u201d I called.</p><p>She peeked her head around the door of her closet, pulling out a black hoodie.</p><p>\u201cIf you . . . betrayed Jared,\u201d I stammered. \u201cLike not cheated, but lost his trust somehow. How would you go about getting him back?\u201d</p><p>Her lips flattened into a line as she thought about it. \u201cWith Jared? I\u2019d show up naked.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>I snorted and shook my head, which was about as much of a laugh as I could summon right now.</p><p>\u201cOr just show up,\u201d she continued. \u201cOr talk to him, or touch him. Hell, I could just look at him.\u201d She shrugged, smirking, and threw on her hoodie.</p><p>I doubted I had that kind of power over Madoc. Whereas Jared seemed more animalistic, Madoc was a mind-fuck.</p><p>She sat down on the edge of her bed, slipping on her black Chucks. \u201cSorry,\u201d she offered. \u201cI know I\u2019m not much help, but Jared has just as much power over me as I do him. We\u2019ve been through enough. There isn\u2019t much we wouldn\u2019t forgive each other for.\u201d</p><p>Half of what she said was true for Madoc and me as well, but I hadn\u2019t earned his forgiveness. What the hell was I supposed to do?</p><p>\u201cFor Madoc, though?\u201d She smiled, knowing exactly what I\u2019d been getting at. \u201cHe appreciates mischief. Maybe some sexy texting would be in order.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cSexting? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you asked.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I guess I did. And she was probably right. It sounded like something Madoc would get off on.</p><p>But phone sex? Yeah, that\u2019s not going to happen. Totally not my thing.</p><p>I looked up, realizing Tate was still staring at me. When I didn\u2019t say anything, she lifted her eyebrows and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well . . . my dad\u2019s gone to the airport, just to remind you, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tate. I\u2019m not having phone sex tonight. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>She held up her hands to fend me off. \u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to the door, giving her the hint to take a hike. \u201cHave fun and good luck at your race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a half-smile. \u201cNo, I need to think right now. Don\u2019t worry about me. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She gave in and stood up. \u201cJax is having a party next door after the race, so come over if you want.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I grabbed my Kindle off my lap and pretended to start reading as she left. My fingers tapped on my thigh as if I were playing a piano, and I knew I probably wasn\u2019t going to get any reading done tonight.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to read. I wanted to do something. There was a tiny snowball in my stomach that was turning and turning, building to something bigger the longer I sat.</p><p>Sexting.</p><p>Madoc deserved more than that.</p><p>Okay, he deserved that and more.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d just seemed empty. I needed to say more, tell him more, but I didn\u2019t know how to start. How do you tell someone that you stayed away, never giving them closure, had a secret abortion and then in a post-traumatic stress blackout tried to hurt yourself, and then were responsible for them losing their home? What do you say?</p><p>What will stop him from running away from a train wreck like me?</p><p>Digging my phone out from between the cushion and the chair, I squeezed the shake out of my fingers as I typed.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>I hit Send and immediately shut my eyes, letting out a pathetic sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d? Seriously, Fallon?</p><p>Well, at least I said something, I guess. Even if it was moronic. Consider it a warm-up.</p><p>Five minutes passed and then ten. Nothing. Maybe he was in the shower. Maybe he left his phone in another room. Maybe he was already in bed. With someone. Ashtyn, maybe.</p><p>My stomach hollowed.</p><p>An hour passed. Still nothing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t read a single line of my book. The sky was black now. No noise from next door. Everyone must still have been at the race. Or did Tate say they were getting something to eat first?</p><p>I threw my Kindle down and got out of the chair, pacing the room.</p><p>Another twenty minutes passed.</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and snatched my phone.</p><p>Great. I was texting him again after not getting a response. I was like those creepy, overbearing girls that scare the shit out of men.</p><p>Please, Madoc. Say something . . .</p><p>I leaned back against Tate\u2019s wall, bobbing my foot up and down and keeping my phone in my hand. Twenty minutes later and still nothing. I buried my face in my hands and took some deep breaths.</p><p>Swallow it down.</p><p>Inhale, exhale.</p><p>Inhale, exhale.</p><p>And then I dropped my hands, tired tears rimming my eyes.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk to me.</p><p>He\u2019d given up.</p><p>I typed in one last message before bed.</p><p>I\u2019m a shit.</p><p>My chin shook, but I calmly set the phone down on Tate\u2019s nightstand and switched off her lamp.</p><p>Crawling under the covers, I looked out her French doors and saw the moon\u2019s light casting a glow on the maple outside. I knew that tree was the inspiration for Jared\u2019s tattoo, but Tate would never really talk about their story. She said it was long and hard, but it was theirs.</p><p>I agreed. There were things I don\u2019t think I\u2019d share with anyone that wasn\u2019t Madoc.</p><p>My phone chimed, and my heart skipped a beat as I shot up in bed and grabbed it off the nightstand.</p><p>I let out a relieved laugh, wiping a tear off my cheek.</p><p>I\u2019m listening.</p><p>Every part of my body tingled, and I almost felt giddy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just typed the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>I miss u.</p><p>Why? he shot back.</p><p>My mouth was suddenly as dry as a desert.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to make this easy, I guess.</p><p>My fingers just went. Jumbled or poetic, it didn\u2019t matter. Just tell him the truth.</p><p>I miss hating you, I typed. It felt better than loving anyone ever had.</p><p>That was the truth. My mother, my dad, any friends I\u2019d had, no one made me feel alive like him.</p><p>After a couple of minutes he hadn\u2019t texted back. Maybe he didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d meant. Or maybe he was just trying to think of what to say.</p><p>I\u2019m f**ked-up, I told him.</p><p>Keep going, Fallon.</p><p>I remembered all of the things he\u2019d said to me in front of the mirror that night, so I told him what was in my heart.</p><p>I miss your eyes looking down at me, I said. I miss your lips in the morning.</p><p>I\u2019m listening, he finally texted back, urging me on.</p><p>I bit my bottom lip to stifle my smile. Maybe Tate was right about sexting after all.</p><p>I miss your hunger. I miss the way you touch me. It\u2019s real, and I want you here.</p><p>He only took about ten seconds to respond. What would I do to you if I was there right now?</p><p>The rush of blood through my heart warmed my body instantly. God, I wanted him here!</p><p>Nothing, I responded. It\u2019s what I would be doing to you . . .</p><p>I curled my legs in and set the phone in my lap, covering my very happy and embarrassed face with my hands. I was sure I was ten shades of red right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My phone chimed again, and I nearly dropped it twice trying to pick it up.</p><p>What the f**k?! Don\u2019t stop! Madoc texted, and I couldn\u2019t contain my laughter.</p><p>This felt good, and Madoc liked it. I can do this.</p><p>I wish you were na**d in my bed right now, I taunted. I wish my head was under the sheets, tasting you, my tongue all around you.</p> <p>What would you be wearing? he asked.</p><p>Madoc liked me in my pajamas. He\u2019d said so once. I\u2019d borrowed a fitted baseball T-shirt and short sleep shorts from Tate. Not really lingerie, but Madoc wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his hands off me either way.</p><p>You can see it if you want. I\u2019m only an hour and fifty-eight minutes away.</p><p>His response came back within seconds.</p><p>I\u2019ll be there in fifty-eight minutes.</p> <p>I burst out laughing in the empty room. Of course, he\u2019d risk his life speeding for any opportunity to get laid.</p><p>I shook my head, my face stretched with a smile. I\u2019ll try not to touch myself until you get here, I texted.</p><p>Goddamn it, Fallon!</p><p>I crashed back onto the bed, laughter and happiness shooting out of every pore.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>MADOC</p> <p>I rubbed my hand over my mouth, blaring Trapt\u2019s \u201cHeadstrong\u201d the entire way home. I\u2019d gone round and round today, wondering if I should come back for the race. Wondering if Tate would\u2019ve dragged Fallon along. Wondering, hoping, and then giving up.</p><p>For some reason, Fallon didn\u2019t want to stick around to see if we were going to be something, and I only had so much pride to spare. Maybe Jared was right and I needed to chase harder.</p><p>But I needed something\u2014anything\u2014from her to show me it was worth it. When she first texted, I didn\u2019t respond. I sat in my house, watching a pay-per-view fight with some of my teammates and waited.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t know what to say, then I\u2019d let her figure it the hell out. When she started opening up more, I was in. She missed me, she wanted me there, and Jared was right. I couldn\u2019t let her go again. If she tried pushing me away or running, I was going to push her until she told me what her deal was. Relationship or not, I needed to know what the f**k was going on with her.</p><p>And then when she started flirting, I was already grabbing my car keys.</p><p>An hour and five minutes later, I was pulling up in front of Tate\u2019s house, the street already packed with cars from the party going on at Jared and Jax\u2019s house next door.</p><p>Parking across the street, I climbed out of the car only to notice Fallon running out of Tate\u2019s front door.</p><p>Jesus.</p> <p>She wore short, little pajama shorts and a tight white-and-gray baseball tee, the thin strap of her little handbag hanging across her chest. She had sneakers on with no socks, showing me all of her beautiful legs from the ankles to the tops of her thighs.</p><p>Fuck lingerie.</p><p>In good-girl PJs with her hair hanging in beautiful waves, Fallon was the only thing I could see or think about.</p><p>My arms hummed to hold her, and when I saw her running down the porch steps and across the street, I had just enough time to reach out and catch her as she jumped into my arms. Wrapping her arms and legs around me, she crushed her mouth to mine, and I groaned as we fell back against my car.</p><p>\u201cDamn, baby,\u201d I gasped out in between kisses. Her mouth on mine went hard, fast, and deep. Her tongue rubbed against mine and darted out to flick my top lip, and then dived back in again. My arms were wrapped around her waist, and she was practically crawling on me, trying to get closer with each kiss.</p><p>There was no kindling for this fire. A blaze was already painfully strong in my jeans, and my dark blue T-shirt burned my neck where she grasped and pulled it.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t care. My fingers dug into her back, eating up all of this. Her moans vibrating in my mouth, the way she clung to me . . .</p><p>I spun us around, so that her back was against my car door, and started to give it back. Her hands ran into my hair and down the sides of my face and then dived lower.</p><p>I pulled my face back, gasping with our noses pressed together. Her hands went into my shirt, and I broke out in chills when her fingertips dragged along my stomach.</p><p>Her lips bit at the air, trying to catch mine. She then pushed herself up, wrapped her arms back around my neck, and began raining soft, light kisses around my mouth, on my cheek, and down my neck.</p><p>My dick pressed against my jeans, and I f**king wished we were somewhere private, so I could get inside of her right now, right here.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d Her whisper sounded like she was in pain.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I ordered, going in for her lips again.</p><p>But she pulled away. \u201cNo, I need to say this.\u201d She held my face and looked into my eyes. That\u2019s when I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing her glasses.</p><p>Her beautiful green gaze searched my eyes with a little fear, and her face was flushed pink. God, she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, I love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>My fists tightened around her shirt, and I almost dropped her there.</p><p>What?</p><p>My heart seemed to thud deeper and deeper into my chest, descending into my stomach. Sweat broke out across my forehead, and my legs were nearly gone.</p><p>She stared at me, looking scared but definitely awake and alert. She knew what she was saying, and I ran the words over and over in my head.</p><p>Madoc, I love you. I\u2019m in love with you.</p><p>I lowered my chin, narrowing my eyes. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you forever. There\u2019s so much I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>My arms tightened around her, and the biggest f**king smile I ever felt broke out across my face.</p><p>\u201cNothing else matters,\u201d I told her, sweeping up her lips for another kiss so hard we couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys?\u201d</p><p>I heard a shout come across the street, from the party I would assume. Without breaking the kiss, I stuck my middle finger out behind me toward Jared\u2019s house.</p><p>I heard a laugh. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to watch you two have sex and all, I really don\u2019t want to have to clean up another round of Teens Gone Wild on the Internet!\u201d</p><p>Jax.</p><p>Fallon buried her mouth in my neck, hugging me and laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Yeah, long story. Jax rocked it with computers, and he was definitely right. We needed to get off the street.</p><p>\u201cJared and Tate.\u201d I leaned in, kissing her and completely f**king turned on right now. \u201cI\u2019ll explain another time. Let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head but continued to come in for quick kisses, stroking my chest and neck. \u201cTake me home. To your bed. Lock me up in your room and feed me until the only thing I know how to do is moan your name.\u201d</p><p>I pushed her back into the car and drowned in her lips again, slamming my hand into the door in frustration. Jesus Christ, I wanted her so bad right now.</p><p>Several hoots and calls erupted behind me, and I knew we had an audience now. I heard Jax laughing and yelling at us while others simply screamed, \u201cWhoo!\u201d</p><p>Idiots.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered into her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The entire drive to the house was f**king torture. Fallon wouldn\u2019t stop touching me, nibbling on my ear, running her hands up and down my thighs . . . I was harder than a steel pipe and ready to pull over and screw her on the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she breathed in my ear. \u201cIs it too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d I slammed into sixth gear after we got through the Seven Hills gate. \u201cI like this new you. But you\u2019re killing me right now.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled a hot breath in my ear, and I closed my eyes, tightening my jaw. I wasn\u2019t going to last long.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, get me to bed,\u201d she begged.</p><p>I groaned, speeding into our driveway and breaking to a screeching halt in front of the house. Fallon was out the door before I was, and I rounded the car, grabbing her hand and dragging her toward the house.</p><p>Unlocking the door, I pulled her through, and we ran through the foyer and up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d I heard Addie\u2019s voice come from around the corner. \u201cFallon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Addie!\u201d we both yelled, not even stopping as we charged up the stairs, two at a time.</p><p>I picked up a whimpered \u201cOh, dear\u201d as we reached the second floor and had to laugh. Poor Addie.</p><p>Fallon reached my bedroom before me and swung the door open so hard it shook the wall when it hit. I slowed to a walk, crossing the threshold with my eyes glued to hers as she spun around to watch me. She backed up into the room, one timid, light step at a time as if in slow motion, kicking off her shoes and tossing her bag to the floor.</p><p>Without taking my gaze off her, I closed and locked the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cI want to make a deal,\u201d I challenged, stalking slowly toward her.</p><p>Her fiery gaze heated me. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, whipping her shirt over her head and letting it fall to the ground.</p><p>My eye caught the Valknut tattoo on the side of her torso. It wasn\u2019t big, but I\u2019d never gotten the opportunity to study it. I\u2019d have to remember to ask her what it meant.</p><p>\u201cIf you,\u201d I threatened, \u201cso much as leave my bed without my permission in the next twelve hours, you have to get my name tattooed . . .\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She arched a defiant eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOn your ass,\u201d I finished.</p><p>A smirk played at the corners of her mouth, and I continued to advance on her slowly, drinking in her smooth skin and white lace bra.</p><p>\u201cDeal?\u201d I reached at the back of my neck and pulled my T-shirt over my head.</p><p>Skimming her fingers inside her shorts, she slid them down over her ass and let them fall to the ground. \u201cI won\u2019t leave without a good-bye. I won\u2019t leave at all, Madoc,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d I pressed, my voice more demanding.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Coming up to stand in front of her, I tensed when her fingers grazed my stomach. She undid my belt, whipping it out of the loops. I toed off my shoes and then reached behind her to unclasp her bra. Peeling it from her body, I let my mouth fall open a little at the sight of her full br**sts and ni**les, dark and hard.</p><p>But when she started to unbutton my pants, I grabbed her hand. \u201cNot yet,\u201d I whispered, snatching her bottom lip between my teeth. She tasted like vanilla and warmth and home. I couldn\u2019t imagine ever being hungry for anything else but her.</p><p>She whimpered as I dragged my teeth over her lip, but I let go and slipped my hands inside her panties, pushing them down her legs.</p><p>I felt like a kid on the Fourth of July. Fireworks were popping everywhere.</p><p>With her na**d and me still in my jeans, I left her standing there and went to sit down in the cushioned chair in the corner.</p><p>Her eyes went wide, shifting left to right. \u201cUm, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on the bed.\u201d</p><p>She stood there staring at me for about ten seconds before finally dropping to the navy blue comforter and scooting backward to the middle. Pulling her knees up, she hugged them and teased me with playful eyes. Trying so hard to look innocent.</p><p>The hair on the back of my neck spiked. Her hair spilling around her, the curves of her waist, the muscle tone in her thighs . . . Fallon hid a lot under her boyish clothes, and I was the luckiest guy in the world to have been the only one to see her like this.</p><p>She lifted the corner of her mouth, challenging me. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, my elbows on my knees. \u201cWhen was the last time you were on a board?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She blinked and asked with a shaky laugh, \u201cYou\u2019re asking me that now?\u201d</p><p>She was right. I was killing the mood like a bucket of ice.</p><p>But I waited anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, looking unsure. \u201cI guess it\u2019s been two years. The last time I lived here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, more like she didn\u2019t want to tell me than she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stood up, taking a few steps toward her. \u201cDid you lose interest in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d I stopped and crossed my arms over my chest.</p><p>Fallon loved skateboarding. She\u2019d put in her earbuds and go off to Iroquois Mendoza Park for hours, alone or with friends, and just get lost.</p><p>Licking her lips, she said with a small voice, \u201cI guess at first, I didn\u2019t want to enjoy anything. I didn\u2019t want to smile.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like guilt. But why would she feel guilty?</p><p>\u201cWere you angry with me?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor not coming after you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her voice still small. \u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not now?\u201d</p><p>At the time, I\u2019d thought she\u2019d wanted to leave. I never thought about going after her, because I thought I was the one she ran from.</p><p>Her eyes met mine. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t blame you for anything. We were so young.\u201d She looked away and added as an afterthought. \u201cToo young.\u201d</p><p>I guess she was right. At times, I knew what we were doing was dangerous, but I was consumed with her. I didn\u2019t care. And whereas she slowed down and took her time growing up, I charged ahead. I didn\u2019t sleep with as many girls as I bragged about even though the opportunity was there, but I definitely couldn\u2019t say I\u2019d saved myself for her, either.</p><p>I moved closer, stepping up to the end of the bed. \u201cWhy did you never try to come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>FALLON</p><p>So Madoc wanted to talk.</p><p>This was new.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get off the bed without his permission, and I was totally na**d and vulnerable while he conducted his Q&amp;A.</p><p>I sighed, knowing I owed him this much. And more. \u201cA few months after I left I snuck back,\u201d I added. \u201cYou were having a party, and you had someone with you.\u201d</p><p>As much as I\u2019d gotten past hating him for that, the feeling of betrayal could never be forgotten. He had been sitting on the edge of the hot tub with his legs in the water while some girl blew him. He had been leaning back on one hand with his other in her hair, and his head had fallen back. He didn\u2019t see me looking through the patio doors.</p><p>His dad and Addie were home but undoubtedly asleep. I thought I\u2019d worked it well, arriving in so late. He\u2019d be in bed. I\u2019d sneak in. We\u2019d talk.</p><p>My timing couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Or more right.</p> <p>I ran out of the house, away from someone I was too young to love.</p><p>Madoc averted his pained eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have saved yourself for me. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI saved myself for me. Part of it was that I didn\u2019t want anyone else but you, but the truth was I just didn\u2019t want anyone. Even you. I was in over my head. I needed to grow up.\u201d</p><p>His body was so still. He\u2019d stopped advancing, and I wanted him to know that none of this mattered anymore. I\u2019d lived with it and had plenty of time to get over everything. He was still adjusting.</p><p>I lay back on the bed, watching his eyes come back to me as I rolled onto my stomach and looked over my shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck the past. Remember?\u201d I told him, keeping my eyes and tone serious. My pose might be to redirect his attention back on me, but I wanted him to know that while I understood his concerns, we were done talking.</p><p>His eyes softened, and he walked around the bed, leaning down over me on his hands.</p><p>He was so close, and I faltered when I felt a streak shoot from my chest down between my legs.</p><p>Please touch me, Madoc.</p><p>I gave him a sly smile and hooded my eyes, trying to be sexy. Kicking up my legs, I crossed my ankles and swung my feet back and forth.</p><p>He turned his head, running his eyes the whole length of my body in a way that made me feel as if a warm blanket covered every inch his gaze touched. Reaching out, he grazed the skin of my back with his fingertips, and I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d he asked, and I popped my eyes open again.</p><p>\u201cMadoc! For Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>I hated questions, and now was not the time!</p><p>He arched a scolding eyebrow at me. \u201cTemper, Fallon,\u201d he warned.</p><p>I clenched my teeth, seething.</p><p>But then I was shocked out of my anger when he grabbed me by my thigh and hauled me to the edge of the bed, flipping me over onto my back.</p><p>\u201cMadoc!\u201d</p><p>Parting my legs, he hooked me under my knees and yanked me to meet him at the edge.</p><p>My heart pumped like a ten-pound weight pressed against my chest, and a sweat broke out over my neck.</p><p>What the hell? Why was he handling me?</p><p>\u201cSchool,\u201d he urged like a warning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s . . . good,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI\u2019m studying Mechanical Engineering. You?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t laugh, because I was mad, but this should\u2019ve been funny, I guess.</p><p>He ran his fingers between my legs, massaging my entrance. \u201cPre-Law,\u201d he responded in a light, nonchalant tone. \u201cSurprise, surprise.\u201d He sounded like he was having a business conversation.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I breathed out, trying really hard to figure out what the hell my mind should be on right now. His questions or the sensation of his prodding fingers. \u201cPre-Law? How\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI like it, actually.\u201d His eyes weren\u2019t on mine. He was watching everything his hand was doing. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be good at it. So what does the Valknut tattoo mean?\u201d</p><p>He slipped a finger in, and my belly exploded with fireworks.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . what?\u201d I gasped.</p><p>What was the question?</p><p>His finger\u2014or fingers, I thought it was one, but I felt so full\u2014had to be buried down to the knuckle, because he was so deep when he started massaging my insides with small circles.</p><p>Holy shit. My eyes rolled to the back of my head.</p><p>\u201cThe Valknut symbol, Fallon,\u201d he reminded me.</p><p>I barely unclenched my teeth. \u201cCan I tell you another time?\u201d</p><p>Please, please, please, pretty please?!</p><p>His sly little smile peeked out as he watched his fingers moving inside me. Triumphant bastard.</p><p>\u201cOne more question.\u201d He raised his gaze to mine. \u201cDo you trust me, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>I stilled, knowing right away what my answer was. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I trust.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up with my legs still hooked on his arms, I looked up at him and whispered, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make you trust me.\u201d</p><p>He was going to wake up in the morning with me still here.</p><p>He pulled me up to stand on the bed, and I wrapped him up in my arms, hugging him to me. His smooth jaw rubbed against my chest as his head lowered, trailing kisses over my collarbone and down my br**sts.</p><p>I ran my fingers through his short blond hair and leaned into his mouth. Chills spread everywhere, and I shivered.</p><p>He took a nipple between his teeth and then covered it with his entire mouth, sucking hard. \u201cDamn,\u201d I sighed, completely helpless.</p><p>I let my head fall back as I moaned. His hot mouth sucked and released, bit and let go, over and over again until I felt like there was a spark of electricity shooting from my heart straight to the heat between my legs.</p><p>Then, he turned his attention on the other one: kissing, nibbling, and damn near eating me alive.</p><p>Sucking in my bottom lip, I dug my nails into his shoulders while he feasted. The torture was so good, but it was building so much that I wanted to throw him down, climb on top, and ride him.</p><p>I jerked, my eyes popping open when I felt his fingers back between my legs.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re wet,\u201d he groaned into my neck.</p><p>Yeah, I could feel it.</p><p>I pushed against his chest and dropped to the bed, scooting back to the headboard in a slow crawl.</p><p>\u201cStop toying, Madoc,\u201d I challenged through hooded eyes. \u201cTime to put up or shut up. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>He broke out in a bright smile, stilling my heart. Laughing and watching me, he stalked around the bed unfastening his jeans.</p><p>\u201cMy little rival. You think I can\u2019t rise to the occasion in this game?\u201d he shot back.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hide the smile at the corner of my mouth. Leaning back on my hands, I bent my legs up, locking my knees together with my ankles apart.</p><p>I lifted my eyebrows with a look that said prove it.</p><p>But my face fell when he smiled again, this time more sinister.</p><p>Oh shit!</p><p>A yelp caught in my throat as he darted out his hands, grabbed my ankles, yanked me down, and then paused only a moment to gloat at my wide-eyed expression before flipping me over to my stomach.</p><p>Fast, shallow breaths poured in and out of me, and my insides clenched and throbbed with the friction of the blankets on my stomach.</p><p>I choked on air. \u201cMad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d he growled low in my ear, and that\u2019s when I realized I was trapped by a wall behind me.</p><p>He still had his jeans on. I could feel them rubbing against my ass.</p><p>His hand dipped back between my legs, and I closed my eyes as he smoothed them up and around the entrance, across my cl*t in circles but never entering me. I propped myself up on my elbows and started moving into his fingers.</p><p>The bed dipped, so I knew he must\u2019ve brought a knee up to lean over me. A hot, wet tickle ran up my back, and I shivered at the feel of his tongue licking me.</p><p>A hard nibble descended on my side, and I clenched the blankets under me.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d But he didn\u2019t stop. Coming down again and again, he sucked on the skin of my back, taking it between his teeth each time. It felt like glass splintering. One kiss and the tingles spread out in an even radius all over my body.</p><p>\u201cYou want to challenge me again?\u201d He pressed himself into my ass, and I could feel his hardness trying to get free.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, damn it!\u201d I tried to sound angry, but it came out as a whimper-cry-beg instead. \u201cI\u2019m about to hump the damn bed! Please!\u201d</p><p>Looking over my shoulder, I soaked in his sexy-as-hell smooth, tanned chest and six-pack that I wanted to lick. \u201cI need you,\u201d I mouthed.</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen the pleading in my eyes, because he reached over to his nightstand and plucked out a condom. Ripping it open with his teeth, he pulled his pants and boxer briefs down and kicked them off his feet. I held his eyes as he rolled it on. I held his eyes when he knelt on the bed and lowered himself on me.</p><p>But I lost him when he arched one of my legs up, my inner thigh lying flat on the bed, and nestled himself between my legs.</p><p>As he positioned both of his arms on the bed next to each of my shoulders, he leaned down over me, his hand under my chin, and tipped my head up to meet his lips.</p><p>Oh. He covered my entire mouth with his, and slipped inside of me, slick and fast.</p><p>I whimpered into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he groaned against my lips.</p><p>I reached behind me and clutched the back of his neck, closing my eyes and absorbing every back-and-forth movement of his body as it thrust into mine.</p><p>Grinding my teeth together, I sucked in air as he drove deeper and faster, his body sliding up and down my back.</p><p>His long, muscled forearms at my sides flexed and tensed, and each time he entered me, I started moaning at the pleasure of what he could do to me that I couldn\u2019t do to myself. I think people called it the G-spot, and he was really good at finding it. I started squirming against the bed, pushing up against him to increase the speed. The faster he went, the more I felt it.</p><p>His hot breath hissed in my ear. \u201cNo patience tonight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I moaned, not lessening my speed one bit. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you. This position is just . . .\u201d</p><p>My belly started to swirl with butterflies like I was free-falling, and my insides tightened and released. I dropped my head to the bed and arched my ass up to meet him and held it there as he slammed into me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I moaned, feeling the burn, and I went wild, seeking him faster and harder.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until he stopped.</p><p>What?</p><p>WHAT?</p><p>My eyes burned with fear and anger, and the pulse between my legs raced.</p> <p>Before I even had a chance to turn around, though, he grabbed my hips, yanked me up on all fours and entered me again.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I cried out, steeling my arms and widening my legs as he slammed into me just as hard and fast as before.</p><p>\u201cThis position is even better,\u201d he remarked, holding onto my hips.</p><p>His f**king cocky tone.</p><p>And then I was gone. I tightened around his cock, throbbing and bursting as the orgasm scorched my insides, making my heart jump into my throat.</p> <p>My forehead fell back to the bed, but Madoc didn\u2019t stop and didn\u2019t relent in his pace, even after my orgasm had passed.</p><p>And that was mind-blowing, too.</p><p>Continuing to feel him after I came was so good. He squeezed my hips, moving faster and faster.

Or maybe his hair was stuck to my sweaty face.</p> <p>Whatever.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>FALLON</p><p>I often wonder if the past looks better to people because they hate the present so much or if it looks better because it was better. Expressions like \u201cthe good ole days\u201d implied that life used to be of a higher quality than it is now, but I think everything looks better in retrospect. After all, it\u2019s not like we get the chance to go back and relive it knowing what we know now and test that theory.</p><p>Except for me.</p><p>I did get to come back home. To a place I hated. A life I didn\u2019t want. And to a boy I despised.</p><p>And even given all of that, I\u2019d still missed Madoc. I never stopped wanting him and loving him.</p><p>I had still been obsessed with hurting him even though in the pit of my stomach the ache of needing him still burned. I thought for sure I would come home to a revelation, like: Why did I ever think I loved him, or What the hell was I thinking?</p> <p>But no. In this case I didn\u2019t remember our time together fondly because I wanted to. I remembered it fondly because it was that good.</p><p>I remembered the truth. Not some watered-down, sugarcoated version my mind whipped up after time dulled the pain.</p><p>It really was that good.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I warned in a playful voice.</p><p>He breathed a laugh in my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm everywhere,\u201d he said, spooning me. \u201cAnd still wet.\u201d</p><p>His arm was draped over my waist with his hand rubbing between my legs.</p><p>We\u2019d fallen asleep last night after a much sweeter and calmer round of lovemaking, and I was exhausted. After barely getting sleep the night before, the long drive back to Shelburne Falls, discovering the boxes in the basement, and then coming back here last night, I needed rest and food.</p><p>But I still smiled, because I knew why he\u2019d woken up early.</p><p>He was probably on high alert even though he didn\u2019t realize it. His subconscious probably thought I was going to skip out when he was asleep.</p><p>\u201cI was dreaming about you.\u201d I yawned and then nestled my nose into the pillow. It had the scent of his cologne all over it, and I just wanted to pull the sheet over my head and crawl into his smell.</p><p>His fingers began to work their magic, stroking and circling around me, and I felt the throb of my arousal.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the dream,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Mmmmm . . . I had a better idea. Yeah, my head felt like a balloon, and I could barely open my eyes, but who cared?</p><p>Reaching over, I took one of the condoms Madoc dumped on the nightstand last night after the first time. I should\u2019ve known then that he had plans in the middle of the night.</p><p>Turning over, I pushed him onto his back and climbed on top, straddling him.</p><p>Licking my lips, I ran a finger across his cheek. \u201cI think I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. You remembered.\u201d I covered my mouth with my hands, accidentally letting the sheet fall to my waist as I sat up in bed. Pulling it back up, I eyed the box of Krispy Kremes like it was the living end. My stomach growled immediately.</p><p>He plopped down, lay on his side, and opened the box that sat between us. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAddie still gets them every Sunday. She gets our regular assortment. Lemon-filled for you, chocolate-glazed for me, and just plain glazed for my dad.\u201d</p><p>And nothing for my mom, I remembered. She would never eat doughnuts.</p><p>He picked up his favorite and took a bite. The flaky icing on his lips moved as he chewed, and for some reason, my heart nearly exploded.</p><p>Diving in, I snatched up his unsuspecting lips, and had to hold back my laugh when he jerked in surprise. Licking off the icing, I couldn\u2019t believe how hungry I was. Madoc made me promise not to leave bed without permission for twelve hours, and now I thought he\u2019d have to drag me away.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t food I wanted now.</p><p>I hovered over his mouth. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>He inched back, peering at me with suspicion. \u201cI thought you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. But we can love people we don\u2019t like. You know?\u201d I dug in the box for my lemon-filled. \u201cLike our parents, our siblings . . . but with you, I like you, too. I like being with you and talking to you.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and stuffed a huge bite into his mouth. \u201cYou just think I\u2019m cool, because I have all of the seasons of Vampire Diaries on DVD.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God!</p><p>I burst out laughing, covering my full mouth with my hand as I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou do not!\u201d I blurted out, disbelieving. \u201cYou don\u2019t still watch it, do you?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at me and snatched another doughnut from the box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cYou just had to watch it every Thursday, and then I got hooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d I swallowed the rest of my bite. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched it in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you should.\u201d He nodded. \u201cDamon and Elena? Yeah. Then there was Alaric. That kind of sucked. And then the Originals came into town. They\u2019re pretty awesome. They have their own show now.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing again, and he cut his eyes to me, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he implored.</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>We sat there, eating and chatting for the next hour, and then Madoc reluctantly let me out of bed after I\u2019d begged to use the bathroom.</p><p>I wanted to go for a run, but I\u2019d had sex four times in the last nine hours. I was sweaty, sticky, and sore. I needed a hot shower badly.</p><p>I also needed some think time to figure out what I should do about my mom and how I was going to tell Madoc the rest. The baby, my mother trying to take his house . . . We were both feeling so good now, and I didn\u2019t want to ruin the high. I just had to tell him and get it over with, though. He\u2019d be so angry with my mom, and perhaps a little angry with me for keeping it from him, but I trusted that he\u2019d stand by me.</p><p>I opened his body wash, smelling its wonderful contents that sent the hormones buzzing wildly throughout my body.</p><p>As if on cue\u2014I think he had a sense about when my body needed him\u2014he opened the glass shower door and stepped in.</p><p>His eyes were dark\u2014almost angry\u2014as he scaled down my body.</p><p>\u201cHell, Fallon,\u201d he said in a low growl. Pulling me into him, he dipped his head to wet his hair, smoothing it back.</p><p>His mouth came down on mine, and I forgot all of my worries in the warmth of the shower and safety of his arms.</p><p>\u201cWant to watch a movie?\u201d I asked as he tossed me a towel. We\u2019d finally emerged from the shower an hour later, and I thought going down to the in-house theater would be a good opportunity to talk to him. Alone, away from Addie\u2019s loving ears.</p><p>He\u2019d wrapped a towel around his waist and had another one on his head as he dried his hair. \u201cWell, I was thinking it might be fun to see if Lucas is around today. I need to see him.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. He was right. It was my fault Madoc had left early last summer and was taken away from Lucas. We needed to see him right away.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I was hoping you might stay here a couple of extra days,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m on Fall Break, so I don\u2019t have to be back until next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment weighted me to the same spot. \u201cNorthwestern doesn\u2019t have Fall Break.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, leaning on the bathroom counter looking hot as hell with his hair spiked up everywhere. \u201cI know. I looked it up this morning. But if you can spare a couple of days, it might be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d love nothing more than to stay here and spend extra time with him, but my classes weren\u2019t for the faint of heart. Miss one day and you miss a lot. I\u2019d already missed Friday.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s trying to take the house. I want to go talk to Jax and see if he can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would he be able to help?\u201d I walked toward him, and he swung his towel off of his neck and around my towel-clad body, pulling me in closer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good with computers,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe can find things on the Internet others can\u2019t. I just want to see if we can find anything on her.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to. My father\u2019s man had already been all over it, and other than frequenting male prostitutes, my mother\u2019s life consisted only of shopping, dining, and socializing. Madoc\u2019s dad had the info that he refused to use.</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell Madoc that, though. He knew my role in our parents\u2019 divorce, and I wasn\u2019t going to remind him.</p><p>\u201cJared, just give it a chance!\u201d</p><p>Madoc and I both jerked our heads toward his bedroom door at the shouting outside.</p><p>\u201cWoman, you are high!\u201d Jared barked. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re such a pu**y! It\u2019s just ballroom dancing,\u201d Tate yelled.</p><p>Madoc and I both looked at each other wide-eyed before running to his door and yanking it open together.</p><p>Jared and Tate had just rounded the corner and were heading down the hall in the opposite direction toward the other side of the house. To their room, presumably.</p><p>Jared turned around, walking backward. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>Madoc slung an arm around my shoulder and called out. \u201cWhat is she trying to get you to do now?\u201d</p><p>Tate swung around, hands on her hips, while Jared stopped retreating.</p><p>\u201cBallroom dancing lessons,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she got the idea.\u201d</p><p>Tate looked down. \u201cI just thought it could be a new experience, Jared,\u201d she said with her back to him. \u201cI can\u2019t expect Madoc to dance with me at every occasion, can I?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, studying her. Every occasion?</p><p>And then it hit me.</p><p>A wedding.</p><p>That\u2019s what she was thinking, only Jared\u2019s severe arched brow and Madoc\u2019s snort told me they didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>She was in love with Jared, and even I could see that he had every intention of marrying her someday. She\u2019d want him to dance with her at their wedding, of course. And Jared didn\u2019t dance.</p><p>He might not need the skill for a few years, but she was just thinking ahead. Chewing on the side of her mouth, she looked angry, but she had too much pride to say why she really wanted him to learn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d I spoke up, holding the towel securely around me and peeking around the door frame.</p><p>\u201cA race,\u201d I suggested. \u201cShe wins, and you have to take lessons until you can waltz like a pro. You win, and you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He looked away with a bored expression. \u201cI don\u2019t have to right now. What\u2019s really in it for me?\u201d</p><p>Tate pinched up her lips, looking about ready to beat the shit out of him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, dickhead.\u201d She spun around and addressed her boyfriend. \u201cYou win, and I\u2019ll do that thing you\u2019ve been wanting me to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes perked up, flashing with mischief, and I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s what Jared Trent looked like on Christmas morning.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a deal?\u201d Madoc asked.</p><p>Jared strolled up to Tate, pinching her chin between his fingers. \u201cNext Saturday night. I\u2019ll call Zack and set it up.\u201d And he walked to their room, digging his phone out of his pocket on the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want you to do?\u201d I could hear the smile in Madoc\u2019s voice. \u201cAnal? I would\u2019ve thought you two had been there by now.\u201d</p> <p>Tate\u2019s hair swayed across her back as she shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019ll lose.\u201d</p><p>She sounded more confident than sure.</p><p>Madoc laughed. \u201cYeah, okay. The last time Jared lost a race was . . . hmm, never.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right.</p><p>I think I\u2019d just had a really stupid idea, and Tate was in for it now.</p> <p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>MADOC</p><p>After another hilarious argument, Jared and Tate finally left town to go back to Chicago and school. He was trying to convince her to leave her car in Shelburne Falls\u2014since they\u2019d be back in five days anyway\u2014and she decided it was best they drive separately and not see each other all week. He had an outburst, and she mumbled something about sexual frustration weakening his normally sharp skills on the track next weekend.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to rush my time with Fallon this week, but I couldn\u2019t stop smiling at the idea of going to the Loop again. I\u2019d missed my friends more that I\u2019d admitted to myself.</p><p>Fallon decided to stay an extra day or two, so we dressed and jumped in my car. After seeing Jax, Fallon and I were going by Lucas\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cJax!\u201d I called out, opening the unlocked front door. \u201cYou awake?\u201d I heard steady footfalls on the floor above and waited until he began descending the stairs.</p> <p>He was shirtless as usual around the house and wore black Adidas track pants with no shoes or socks. His hair was pulled back in its normal ponytail, but stray hairs stuck out of it as if he\u2019d just woken up. And he was sporting a bruise on the side of his lip. He looked tired as hell, but in a good mood.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d I gave him our slap-fist-bump combo. \u201cPut on a shirt, would you?\u201d</p><p>It was kind of a joke. Kind of. I was hotter than him. No doubt. But I grabbed Fallon\u2019s hand, reminding her that she could look but not touch.</p><p>Jax had begun working out with Jared and me about a year ago, and while he was still young and growing, he could hold his own with both of us. He took care of himself the way other kids his age didn\u2019t. He had a thing about being healthy and while he dabbled in alcohol here and there, he never touched cigarettes or drugs.</p><p>In fact he had a huge problem with drugs. A guy offered him weed once, and he flipped out.</p><p>Fallon squeezed my hand, smirking at my jealous demand for him to put on a shirt.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I put on pants, dude. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I motioned to the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s step into your office.\u201d</p> <p>He turned, and we followed him upstairs to his lair. Or that\u2019s what I joked it was. Jared\u2019s mom, Katherine\u2014and my soon-to-be-stepmom\u2014had taken Jax out of foster care and brought him home with her so that her son could have his brother with him.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jax was the sun, moon, and stars to her, and she spoiled him rotten. Jared got the mom that put herself first and neglected him, and Jax got the mature mom who\u2019d grown up and behaved responsibly. Jared got left alone, and Jax got home-cooked meals and a number one fan at his lacrosse games.</p><p>It was fine, though. He damn well deserved a break after the childhood he\u2019d had, and Jared was happy that his family had finally come together.</p><p>Jax had been allowed to take Jared\u2019s bedroom when he moved to college and used the spare room as his \u201coffice.\u201d You walked in and felt like you were in an FBI surveillance van. It was dark and a little intimidating with switches, screens, and wires snaking up and down the walls. Six huge touch-screen monitors lined the wall, three in each row, and then there was a seventh propped on a tripod that Jax used to control all of them. There were three long tables lined with electronics that I wouldn\u2019t have the first clue about as well as a PC and a laptop.</p><p>When I asked him last year why he needed all of this, he\u2019d simply said that he played a lot of video games.</p><p>Yeah, this wasn\u2019t gaming. This was severe.</p><p>But given Fallon\u2019s and my situation, I was grateful Jax was around. He might be able to issue paperwork that would have me extradited to the Sudan to stand trial for treason against their king\u2014or whatever they had\u2014but he was on my side, so that was a plus.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Fallon stopped short when we entered the room, and I ran into her back.</p><p>Steadying myself, I wrapped my arm around her gray T-shirt-clad waist and waited, letting her take it all in.</p><p>Everything was as I remembered, but it was still a lot to absorb. Every screen was active, a couple displaying line after line of code that was meaningless to me, while other screens had Web pages, documents, and IMs displayed. I had to blink several times, because my brain was on overload. How the hell did Jax look at all of this action every day?</p><p>\u201cJax . . .\u201d Fallon started with concern thick in her voice.</p><p>Jax circled the room, switching off monitors and not looking at us.</p><p>\u201cAsk me no questions, Fallon, and I\u2019ll tell you no lies,\u201d he said as if he\u2019d read her mind.</p><p>Her eyes went round at me. \u201cOkay,\u201d she drawled out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. I need a favor.\u201d I walked to one of his long tables where I spied a pen and paper. \u201cCan you search this name? Patricia Caruthers.\u201d I continued writing her other surnames as well as her phone number. \u201cShe might also be found under Patricia Pierce and Patricia Fallon. Look for police records, credit card statements, friends in low places, her social calendar . . .\u201d</p><p>I handed him the paper.</p><p>\u201cPatricia Caruthers. That\u2019s your stepmom, right?\u201d he asked, looking between Fallon and me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mom.\u201d Fallon stepped in, glancing back at me before continuing. \u201cJax, I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re getting you involved, but she\u2019s taking things too far with this divorce. We want to see if you can\u201d\u2014she shrugged apologetically\u2014\u201cget anything on her. To persuade her to back off, you know?\u201d</p><p>His thoughtful eyes continued to shift between Fallon and me, but he finally nodded. \u201cGive me a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>After we\u2019d picked up Lucas, we went to Chevelle\u2019s Diner for lunch and then headed to the skate park. I\u2019d told Lucas where we were going at the restaurant as I walked him to the bathroom\u2014and stood guard outside the door, because of creepers. He\u2019d never been skateboarding. I also told him to keep his flippin\u2019 mouth shut. I wanted to surprise Fallon, and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d take the idea. So I decided to ambush her.</p><p>Better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right? That\u2019s my motto.</p><p>My phone kept buzzing in my pocket as I drove, and I felt for the power button through my pants, switching it off.</p><p>Fallon looked over at me, narrowing her eyes on my pants.</p><p>I grabbed her hand. \u201cStop checking me out.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>My mom and dad had been calling and texting for the last hour. And I knew why. I didn\u2019t want Fallon worrying, though.</p><p>They knew we were together, and I knew how they knew.</p><p>I didn\u2019t blame Addie for telling them, though. She would never have volunteered the information. One of them must\u2019ve talked to her and asked about my whereabouts. Addie couldn\u2019t lie, not that she should.</p><p>My mom was far away in New Orleans. I didn\u2019t worry about her showing up tonight.</p><p>My dad, on the other hand, might be surprising us.</p><p>And at this point, it was do or die. I wasn\u2019t giving up Fallon.</p><p>She rubbed small circles across my knuckle, and I peeked in the rearview mirror to see Lucas bobbing his head to his iPod. Darn kid had grown up so much. His hair was longer around his ears, and he\u2019d grown at least two inches in the past four months.</p><p>Fallon\u2019s grip on my hand tightened, and I looked at her out of the corner of my eye, seeing that she\u2019d noticed we\u2019d turned into Iroquois Mendoza Park.</p><p>Her scowl tightened as the wheels turned in her head.</p><p>I bit back my smile and wiggled my hand loose, sticking it between her legs and cupping her to distract her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my hand with both of hers. \u201cStop it!\u201d she whisper-yelled, making swift, nervous glances over her shoulder to Lucas.</p><p>He still bobbed his head and stared out the window.</p><p>I started massaging her and rubbing circles. At least she wasn\u2019t thinking about possibly being mad at me about the skate park right now.</p><p>Keeping my eyes on the road, I slid my hand out and down her thigh, increasing the pressure.</p><p>Looking over at her, I mouthed, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you so hard tonight. Just watch.\u201d</p><p>She pinched up her lips and threw off my hand.</p><p>I turned my smile out the front windshield and jerked to a halt. \u201cAwesome! We\u2019re here!\u201d I shouted, yanking up the parking brake and turning off the ignition.</p><p>Lucas followed me out of the car right away, and we rounded to the trunk to dig out the skateboards. I\u2019d snuck down to the basement this morning to round them up where they hid between the half-pipe and the wall.</p><p>I\u2019d also noticed that the boxes underneath the piano were emptied and Fallon\u2019s stuff was all over the floor. She wasn\u2019t talking about it, and I was in no rush to explain myself, so we\u2019d avoided the subject of her whole life tucked safely away these past two years.</p><p>\u201cFallon!\u201d I called. \u201cQuit jerking off and get out here!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. \u201cMadoc!\u201d she screeched. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid! Mind your language.\u201d</p><p>I arched a sarcastic eyebrow at Lucas.</p><p>He shook his head, mumbling, \u201cChicks.\u201d</p><p>I lifted the lid of the trunk, steadying it with one hand and peeking around it toward Fallon. \u201cCome on. Pick your poison.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>FALLON</p><p>Pick my poison?</p><p>I\u2019d rather have Lucas shoot rubber bands at my face.</p><p>Slamming the car door, I stuffed my hands into my pockets and stiffened my arms against the chill in the air.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you insisted on loose clothing,\u201d I accused.</p><p>When I\u2019d started putting on jeans this morning, Madoc had told me to wear something loose-fitting and to shut up about it.</p><p>Such a charmer.</p><p>So I donned some loose, straight-leg black pants, a gray Obey T-shirt, and stuck my hair in a ponytail. Ready for whatever little adventure he had planned.</p><p>Every muscle in my body had tightened. Even though I used to be a proficient skater, I was out of practice. Whereas my body was still in shape, my confidence wasn\u2019t, and with skating, confidence and quick wit were the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>I tried to ignore Madoc as he waited, to let him know that I wasn\u2019t up for this, but my gaze couldn\u2019t resist shifting to the trunk.</p><p>I gasped without making a sound, my mouth hanging open. I pulled my hands out of my pockets and clutched the edge of the trunk, gaping at all of my skateboards.</p><p>My boards!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start crying,\u201d Madoc teased me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t save your Legos and not your boards.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. Tears blurred my eyes as I looked at all five boards, each one having a special set of memories. My first board that was splintered on every centimeter of the edges and probably had blood on it. My second and third boards that I\u2019d adorned with custom wheels and first learned how to do ollies, kick-flips, and heel-draggers. My fourth board that was my favorite to use in the bowl. And my fifth. Brand-new. Never been used.</p><p>My lungs were empty, but I didn\u2019t feel the ache. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looking up at Madoc, I actually gulped through my smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said in a shaky voice.</p><p>He winked in his oh-so-sexy way, telling me he\u2019d take that as a thank-you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use this one,\u201d Lucas called out, grabbing the never-been-used board.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I snatched it from him. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you.\u201d I held out the ratty, torn-up one with the traction nearly worn away.</p> <p>He stuck out his top lip, taking the board from me.</p><p>\u201cYou have to graduate,\u201d I explained. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took the board while I grabbed the new one. Madoc slammed the trunk shut without taking one. I looked at him, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not skating,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI like to watch.\u201d</p><p>I gripped the board at my side, grumbling, \u201cGreat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Madoc called, and we both turned around. \u201cPut these on.\u201d</p><p>Madoc tossed him a mesh bag with pads and a helmet, and I tried to contain my smile. Lucas pinched his eyebrows together like he was way too cool for protective gear, but I was impressed.</p><p>Madoc was good at this big brother thing.</p><p>Was he like this years ago? Or had he grown up after I\u2019d left? I searched my memory, remembering times he\u2019d drink my Snapples to piss me off, but then always come and watch TV with me, making me feel less alone.</p><p>And all of the times he ignored me at school, but then send me candy-grams and balloons so I wasn\u2019t left out when everyone else got classroom deliveries on holidays. He\u2019d jot down some profanity or a gross poem, of course, but it still felt good to receive something.</p><p>Addie was right. Madoc picked up the pieces.</p> <p>\u201cLucas.\u201d I set my board down on the sidewalk and ruffled his blond hair. \u201cHave you ever skated before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I want to do that!\u201d He pointed down into the bowl as we stood near the edge. He already had his helmet and elbow pads on.</p><p>\u201cYou can get in there today,\u201d I assured him, taking his board and setting it down next to mine. \u201cBut it\u2019ll take a lot of practice before you\u2019re ready to go fast. Let me show you the first steps. Do you know which one is your front foot?\u201d</p><p>The blood flowing through my arms felt hot, and my heart was pounding. Damn, I was glad Lucas was here. Madoc sat down, arms spread out and slung over the back of the bench as he watched us. Or me.</p><p>At least having Lucas here meant I wasn\u2019t the center of attention. Madoc should\u2019ve just told me to come out here on my own. Get my feet wet again without an audience.</p><p>But he knew me. He knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything without being pushed.</p><p>\u201cFront foot?\u201d Lucas looked confused as he lifted one foot and then set it down to lift the other, unsure.</p><p>I smiled, touching his arm to get his attention. \u201cOkay, go and walk up those stairs over there.\u201d I pointed up the sidewalk.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d I ordered with more authority but keeping my voice soft.</p><p>Lucas left his board on the ground and swung his arms back and forth as he walked up the path.</p><p>As soon as he raised a foot on the first step, I yelled. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He halted, keeping his left foot raised and wobbling as he looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your front foot,\u201d I told him. \u201cCome back.\u201d</p><p>Madoc had gone back over to his car and left the doors open so we could hear music. Method Man\u2019s \u201cAll I Need\u201d vibrated out, and my face tingled with amusement seeing Lucas bob his head like the teenage boy he wasn\u2019t. This song was older than Madoc and me, for crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I bent down and pointed to his feet. \u201cYour front foot goes toward the top of the board, and your back one goes on the tail.\u201d</p><p>He did as he was told, and I watched as he climbed on, testing the give in the board by leaning left and right. My feet started humming for the feel of my own board.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cNow, when you\u2019re moving, turn your front foot forward and push off with your tail foot. When you put both feet back on, turn them sideways like this again.\u201d</p><p>He wasted no time. Before I\u2019d even straightened back up, he was gone. He\u2019d turned his front foot forward, at least as far as I could tell, since his black pants were so long his shoes were nearly covered. At least he looked like a skater.</p><p>Pushing off with his tail foot, he touched ground time and again, pushing faster and faster, increasing his speed.</p><p>His arms flailed, and I tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he yelped, and I watched as he stumbled off his board and into the grass.</p><p>I let out the breath I was holding and looked back to Madoc.</p><p>He shrugged and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s going to fall, Fallon. Relax.\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s outstretched arms were taut, and my eyes lingered way too long on the dips and curves of his biceps and triceps in his short-sleeved, heather gray T-shirt. The wide, toned expanse of his chest, I remembered, felt lean and rigid under my fingertips. Madoc was hard and soft in all of the right places, and my mouth actually watered at the thought of massaging him, so I could smooth my fingers along every inch of his skin.</p><p>With oil. Lots and lots of oil.</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, snapping my eyes back up to Madoc\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWipe the drool, baby,\u201d he commanded. \u201cWe\u2019re getting under the sheets later. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>My sex clenched, lightning shot from my belly down to my legs, and I looked away, running my hands over my face.</p><p>And then he was laughing.</p><p>Stupid ass**le jerk.</p><p>Shaking him out of my head\u2014violently\u2014I walked up the path to where Lucas was making his way back.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You stayed on the board a lot longer than I did the first time.\u201d I put my arm around his shoulder. \u201cAnd you did what you were supposed to do. When in danger, jump off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a wuss,\u201d Madoc called out. \u201cShow him how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him through hooded lids and looked down to my board, curling my toes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? Scared?\u201d Lucas looked up at me, the honest question plain all over his face.</p><p>How could I encourage him to do something I wouldn\u2019t do? What kind of parent would I make?</p><p>Twisting my lips side to side and already feeling the sweat on my neck, I stepped onto the board, straightening my legs against the shake in my muscles. Leaning slowly back on my heels and then forward on the balls of my feet, I breathed shallowly as I swayed front and back, bending the board and remembering the feel of how to maneuver and guide myself.</p><p>People often think skateboarding is just about feet, but the truth is, it\u2019s a whole-body workout. Every muscle comes into play. You lean with your shoulders, steer with your heels and add or subtract pressure depending on how you want to jump, flip, or glide.</p><p>Turning my Van-clad foot forward, I kicked off with my other and bent my knees slightly, clenching my fists against the sudden rush in my chest.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>My eyes went wide, and I let out a laugh before covering my mouth.</p><p>Oh, my God. I hope they didn\u2019t hear that. I just got an adrenaline rush from kicking off?</p><p>Touching ground again, I kicked and kicked, my heart jumping in my chest as I tacked to the left, avoiding the stairs. Staying on the sidewalk, I continued kicking off and gliding on the sidewalk around the bowl, fireworks going off in my belly and brain.</p><p>Fucking amazing. This is what it felt like.</p><p>How did I ever give this up?</p><p>Digging into the ground, I pushed off hard and charged ahead straight for Lucas. Spreading out my arms, I dropped my back leg, bringing the front of the board up off the ground and skidding to a halt, circling Lucas until I stopped.</p><p>I squeezed every muscle in my body, wishing I could pinch up my face in a shitty-ass grin and jump up and down.</p><p>But that would be uncool.</p><p>Hopping off the board, my breaths fast and sharp against the afternoon cold, I got into Lucas\u2019s wide-eyed face.</p><p>\u201cDo I look scared to you?\u201d I teased.</p><p>His mouth was hanging open. \u201cI want to learn that.\u201d</p><p>I stomped down on the tail of my board and caught the front end in my grasp. \u201cHeel-draggers are way off. Let\u2019s do some tic-tacking.\u201d</p><p>Over the next couple of hours, Lucas and I exhausted ourselves with steering, bailing, ollies, and just plain practice. I showed him how to use his body, and how to fall with a smile. Because falling happens. A lot.</p><p>I promised him that we\u2019d work on kick-flips next time, and then he spent some time practicing in the bowls while Madoc and I sat on the ledge to watch.</p><p>Laying my head on his shoulder, I closed my eyes and, for once, didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said in a raspy voice. \u201cFor today, I mean. I needed that.\u201d I think I had laughed, shouted, and cheered more in the last few hours than in the last couple of years put together. Even though I\u2019d be feeling the pain tomorrow, I was light-headed with happiness. Madoc\u2019s smell enveloped me in the car on the ride home, I\u2019d be cuddled next to him tonight, and every muscle felt loose from the release of stress.</p><p>He reached over and kneaded my thigh as he steered through the streets of town. We\u2019d just dropped off Lucas in time for dinner and were heading home.</p><p>I sat back in my seat, my sleepy head lying sideways and looking up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be freaked out by this question,\u201d I started, \u201cbut did you have any relationships in high school? Like girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>He snorted and flipped on the windshield wipers. \u201cWomen always have to ask questions they really don\u2019t want the answers to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d My voice stayed light. I actually did want to know. We\u2019d missed years, and I wanted to know everything about him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, nodding his head and not meeting my eyes. \u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy spread through my brain like a disease. Who were they? What did they look like? What did he do with them? What were their names, Social Security numbers, and addresses?</p><p>It\u2019s crazy how thoughts and suspicions can splinter your peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I urged softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never told anyone I loved them,\u201d he shot back. \u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to me, shutting me up with his serious, straight face.</p><p>The pulse in my neck throbbed, and it took a moment to realize my mouth was hanging open.</p><p>He tipped his chin at me. \u201cSo what does the Valknut tattoo mean?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled an impatient breath and turned to look out the window. \u201cWay to beat a dead horse,\u201d I half-joked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evading.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I am. But what the hell could I do? How do you tell someone who you want a future with that you got rid of his child without his knowledge? Madoc would care. I just couldn\u2019t tell him exactly what the tattoo means. Not yet.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he asking about my Out of Order tattoo or the script down the side of my back?</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, focusing on the rain on my window. \u201cThe tattoo means a lot of things to different people. For me it\u2019s about rebirth.\u201d That was partly true. \u201cIt\u2019s about moving on. Surviving.\u201d And then I turned to him and shrugged. \u201cIt looked cool, okay?\u201d</p><p>There. Hopefully that\u2019d be the end of it. For now, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019d tell him everything. Eventually. As soon as I could. For now, I just needed tonight with him.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I remembered one of the skills of a good talker.</p><p>Distract him with a change of subject.</p><p>Clearing my throat, I spoke up. \u201cYou never ask about the script on my back.\u201d And I watched his eyes dart down to my hands as I lifted my shirt up and over my head.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s round eyes were glued to my nearly na**d chest clad only in a hot-pink, lacy bra.</p><p>\u201cEyes on the road,\u201d I reminded him in my sultriest voice.</p><p>He blinked and glanced back out the windshield. \u201cFallon, I\u2019m driving. This is not cool.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A grin tickled the corners of my mouth watching him squeeze the life out of the wheel.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I turned and showed him the writing that ran vertically from the back of my shoulder down my blade to just below. \u201c\u2018Nothing that happens on the surface of the sea can alter the calm of its depths.\u2019 It\u2019s my father\u2019s favorite quote.\u201d</p><p>I felt my body sway with the swerve of the car, and I had the good sense not to laugh. I liked his eyes on me, and I liked that I distracted him.</p><p>\u201cAnd then . . .\u201d I lifted up my butt, ignoring the excited lump in my throat as I quickly shimmied out of my pants, taking my shoes and socks off with them. \u201cI have another one right here.\u201d I pointed to the shamrock on my hip.</p> <p>\u201cFallon!\u201d Madoc barked, his forearms flexed, showing the powerful cords in his arms as he jerked the steering wheel to get the car straight. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself and reclined the seat all the way back. Madoc\u2019s windows weren\u2019t tinted, and since we were still in town, anyone could see me in my bra.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I whispered, blinking innocently.</p><p>He barely unclenched his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be home for another ten minutes. Are you seriously doing this to me right now?\u201d</p><p>I gazed up at him with my hand behind my head and my eyes hooded. Dancing my tongue just outside of my lips, I caught the little silver ball between my teeth and watched the fire flash in his eyes.</p> <p>My skin was probably flushed pink everywhere, but I didn\u2019t care. Nothing felt better than seeing his hands fumbling with the wheel as he tried to keep up on the road or the way his eyes glided down my body.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d I murmured, turning on my side and propping my head on my hand. \u201cI want you to f**k me in your car.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared, and his body went still as if the car was now driving itself. He gripped the wheel, yanking the stick shift into sixth gear, and sped out of town.</p><p>Before I knew it, the sky was dim, the rain poured hard, and we were parked on a silent gravel road for the next hour.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>MADOC</p> <p>All through high school, I followed people. Followed my dad. Followed Jared. Followed the norm.</p><p>When you follow, you forget to grow. Days pass, years roll over you, and you\u2019re left with little to show for your life. My father was proof of that. He worked and hid, loving a woman he didn\u2019t have the courage to claim, and for what? So he could have a city full of people at his funeral and a hefty estate to leave his estranged son?</p><p>My father had nothing. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>I knew he loved me, and in that respect I was a lot luckier than Jared and Jax, but I didn\u2019t aspire to be like my dad. There were some good memories, but I honestly wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d react if he were suddenly gone.</p><p>That\u2019s the thought that snapped me awake in my bed. Heat drifted down my neck and back, and I didn\u2019t have to touch my skin to know that I was sweating.</p><p>My father knew what he wanted, but he never took it. I didn\u2019t want those regrets.</p><p>I looked over, seeing Fallon curled into a ball and fast asleep at my side. She was dressed in a tank top and sleep shorts, and the blankets rested at her waist. With her hands tucked under her cheek and her hair draping over the pillow above her head, she looked so tiny and helpless.</p><p>My mouth turned up with a smile at the thought, because Fallon was anything but helpless.</p> <p>I still liked enjoying this view of her, though. My heartbeat slowed, watching her steady breathing.</p><p>Grabbing my phone off the nightstand, I checked the time, seeing that it was only nine p.m. After skating this afternoon and our little detour, our bodies had been dragging. We crashed in my room, not even caring to eat the roast Addie had left in the oven for us.</p><p>My phone buzzed, and I held it above me, opening up the text from Jax.</p><p>Can you come over? Alone?</p><p>Alone? He must\u2019ve found something on Fallon\u2019s mom, but why did I have to come alone?</p><p>Be there in twenty.</p><p>Turning on my side, I nudged Fallon awake. \u201cBabe?\u201d I whispered, kissing a trail from her cheek to her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to run out for an hour. Be back soon.\u201d</p><p>She moaned, pursing her lips. \u201cOkay,\u201d she sighed. \u201cCan you bring me a Snapple when you get back?\u201d</p><p>And then she was passed out again, and I was laughing.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I arrived at Jax\u2019s house about fifteen minutes later. The rain was still falling outside, but it was lighter, and I was happy to see light pouring out of his windows.</p><p>Katherine was home.</p><p>His \u201cmom\u201d\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure what to call her\u2014still spent a lot of time with my dad, but I heard she insisted on him staying at her house more so she could be home for Jax. I wondered how my dad felt about gaining two stepsons. He had a hard enough time with me.</p><p>The kitchen and living room lights glowed with warmth as I knocked on the front door and then immediately turned the handle.</p><p>I\u2019d stopped waiting to be let in years ago, and we still lived in a town where you really didn\u2019t worry about keeping the doors locked at all times.</p><p>Waving at Katherine, who\u2019d poked her head out of the kitchen, I sprinted up to Jax\u2019s \u201ccomputer room\u201d and walked in, closing the door behind me.</p><p>I jerked my chin at him as he cruised the monitor wall, touching different screens. \u201cHey, what have you got?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. Sorry to drag you over here, but I thought you should see this in person.\u201d</p><p>Walking back over to his printer, he picked out a couple of papers, reading them over.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, whipping off my button-down and wearing only my dark gray T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m really not finding much on your stepmom.\u201d He shot me an apologetic look. \u201cSorry, but she\u2019s pretty one-dimensional. I accessed her social calendar, and personally, I find C-SPAN more entertaining.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sank a little, and I sighed.</p><p>He let out a bitter laugh. \u201cAside from the dirty dippings into male prostitution\u2014she has a standing reservation at the Four Seasons every Thursday night for that\u2014she\u2019s actually pretty clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why am I here?\u201d</p><p>His eyes fell, and he hesitated.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Sitting down in his office chair, he wheeled over to me. \u201cI found something else, actually. I was going through all of her credit card statements, and this came up.\u201d</p><p>He handed me a paper and rolled away.</p><p>I stared down, my eyes scanning but not really reading. Words jumped out at me. Words like clinic. Fallon Pierce. And Women\u2019s Health. They came together as my eyes darted over the thin, white paper that started to crinkle in my hand.</p><p>Then my scanning slowed when I caught words like pregnancy termination and balance due.</p><p>My lungs were anchored to the floor. They wouldn\u2019t expand when I tried to breathe, and I narrowed my eyes as the words condensed in my head like moisture in the sky coming together to form a cloud.</p><p>One big, dark cloud.</p><p>I blinked and looked at the date of the bill. July 2. A couple of months after she disappeared two years ago.</p><p>My eyes shot down to the balance due. Six hundred and fifty dollars.</p><p>I gripped the paper, my eyes burning with anger . . . horror . . . fear. I didn\u2019t know what. I just knew I felt sick.</p><p>I closed my eyes. She had been pregnant. With my kid.</p><p>Six hundred and fifty dollars.</p><p>Six. Hundred. Fifty. Dollars.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, Fallon\u2019s a friend.\u201d Jax spoke up. \u201cBut I just thought you might need to know about this. Was it your kid?\u201d</p><p>The acid rolled in my stomach, and bile burned in my throat.</p><p>I swallowed, my voice sounding more like a threat, as I said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fallon?\u201d I growled at Addie.</p><p>I\u2019d stormed upstairs once I got home and found the bed empty. She didn\u2019t have Tate\u2019s car or her bike, so unless she left by foot, she had to still be here.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Addie\u2019s eyes rolled to the ceiling, thinking. \u201cBasement, I think. That\u2019s the last time I saw her.\u201d</p><p>Her hands buried in dough, she nodded to the stove as I walked around to the basement door.</p><p>\u201cYou both haven\u2019t eaten dinner,\u201d she yelled behind me. \u201cI\u2019m packing it up! Okay?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, I pummeled down the stairs, letting the door slam behind me.</p><p>The cement stairs were covered in carpet, so I was virtually silent charging down. The lights were on, but it was ghostly quiet.</p><p>I spotted Fallon right away.</p><p>She sat in the dip of her half-pipe, lying back against the incline with her legs bent up.</p><p>Dressed in a long, white cotton nightgown, her wet hair told me she\u2019d just showered.</p><p>\u201cI came down here so Addie wouldn\u2019t hear the yelling,\u201d she admitted before I said anything. Her hands rested on her stomach, and her eyes were glued to the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I know.\u201d</p><p>The half of her face that I could see was relaxed and accepting, as if she\u2019d expected a storm.</p><p>\u201cJax called when I was in the shower. He wanted to warn me. Said he was sorry, but he felt that you should know.\u201d</p><p>Every soft step up to the pipe was made with clenched muscles. I was f**king pissed. How dare she be this calm! She should be feeling what I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>Or at least scared!</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me,\u201d I snapped, my deep voice coming from the pit of my stomach. \u201cI deserved the truth, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sat up. \u201cI was planning to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn her. She was still so calm, looking at me with sincere and unfailing eyes. Speaking with a golden voice. She was handling me, and that pissed me off even more.</p><p>I ran my hand through my hair. \u201cA baby?! A f**king baby, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was I supposed to tell you?\u201d Her voice was shaky, and tears watered her eyes. \u201cYears ago when I thought you didn\u2019t want me? This past summer when I hated you? Or maybe the last two days when things between us were more perfect than anything has ever been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known about it!\u201d I bellowed. \u201cJax knew before me! And you just got rid of it without me knowing anything about it. I should have known!\u201d</p><p>She looked away, her throat moving up and down like she was swallowing.</p><p>Shaking her head, she kept her voice soft. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to be sixteen-year-old parents, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you wait?\u201d I bared my teeth, sneering. \u201cDid you even think about me before you did it? Or did you rush to a clinic as soon as you found out?\u201d</p><p>Her pained eyes shot to me. \u201cRush?\u201d she choked out. Tears spilled, and while she tried to hold them back, her face was contorted in agony. Red, wet with tears, and pained.</p><p>Getting up, she charged past me, and I grabbed her arm, pulling her to my side.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou stay here and fight. Own this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t rush!\u201d she yelled, getting in my face. \u201cI wanted the baby, and I wanted you! I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you. I was breaking, and I needed you!\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped, and her shoulders shook as she cried, and that\u2019s when it hit me.</p><p>Fallon loved me even then. She didn\u2019t want to leave, so why would I think she\u2019d want to go through that without me?</p><p>Her hands fisted at her sides, and she stood there, shaking with silent tears but too strong to crumble completely.</p><p>\u201cThe Valknut,\u201d she gasped, looking up at me with desperate eyes. \u201cRebirth, pregnancy, and reincarnation. It was always with me, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, the quiet streams of tears cascading down her beautiful face.</p><p>The weight of what she went through alone slapped me in the face, and I remembered the signature on the bill I now had tucked in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cOur parents,\u201d I realized.</p><p>She was silent for a few moments, and then sniffled. \u201cYour dad knew nothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stood there, so close yet so far away, and I was done.

She wore fitted black pants, a sleeveless black-and-white animal print blouse\u2014I hated animal print\u2014and a black fedora.</p><p>Really? A fedora?</p><p>Every time I saw her, she was trying to look younger and younger. Or more like an Italian heiress. I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I was shocked at the gruffness in my tone. The episode last night with Madoc had worn me out, but I felt strong and alert\u2014from the neck up, at least.</p><p>She smiled, her impeccable skin glowing in the morning sun that poured through the windows. \u201cI live here, Fallon. You don\u2019t. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Looking to the other side of the bed, I noticed Madoc wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on my mother as she walked to the foot of the bed. \u201cGet out,\u201d I ordered.</p> <p>She grabbed Madoc\u2019s T-shirt and started folding it. \u201cSleeping your way to the top, I see. I\u2019m not surprised to find you back in his bed. Again.\u201d</p><p>I threw off the covers and reached for my glasses on the nightstand but then stopped.</p><p>No. I didn\u2019t need them to talk to her.</p><p>Dropping my hand, I stepped out of bed and lifted my chin. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get out, I\u2019ll remove you myself.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a threat. I was looking for a reason to hit her.</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s expecting me.\u201d She hooded her eyes, trying to look bored. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way. Did you know that? The sordidness of you and Madoc together is the one thing my husband and I can agree on.\u201d</p><p>I winced at the word \u201chusband.\u201d It was funny. I never thought of them as married. Maybe because they never looked like it.</p><p>She stepped up to me, rubbing her cold hands up and down my bare arms. \u201cJason has ways of influencing his son. You\u2019d better warm up to that fact as soon as possible, Fallon. For your own sake. Madoc isn\u2019t in this for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d a deep voice startled us both.</p><p>My back straightened, and my eyes shot to the doorway where Madoc stood, glaring at my mother.</p><p>She\u2019d turned as well at the sound of his deep command, and all of a sudden my arms and legs rushed with power. I felt stronger with him here.</p><p>Not that I relied on Madoc to fight my battles. It just felt good to not be alone.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she assured, and I heard the smile in her voice. \u201cYour father will be here soon, so get dressed. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced between us and then walked toward the doorway as Madoc stepped in. His arms were crossed, and the muscles in his na**d chest were flexed. Madoc wouldn\u2019t hit a woman, but right now he looked like he wanted to.</p><p>My mother stopped in the doorway and looked back at us.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, you\u2019re going to be shipped back to Notre Dame. And, Fallon? You\u2019ll be coming with me today. Back to Chicago. I have the Triumph Charity Event to plan, and you\u2019re going back to school.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help the laughter that sprang up. I pinched my eyebrows together in disbelief. \u201cAre you from the planet Delusion? What makes you think you can tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you back to Chicago, and you\u2019re not seeing Madoc again.\u201d Her words were sharp, each syllable a threat. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be associated with him or his father after the divorce. And they don\u2019t want you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Madoc growled.</p><p>She shut her mouth and swallowed, momentarily stunned.</p><p>Arching an eyebrow, she continued, addressing Madoc. \u201cOnce your father arrives, he\u2019ll make you see sense. You won\u2019t see my daughter again, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>Madoc charged my mother, taking long, deep steps into her space until she was forced back into the hallway. I followed them, and he came to a slow stop, glowering down at her.</p><p>\u201cMake that threat again,\u201d he challenged. \u201cI will put you through a wall to get to her.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burned, and I smiled to myself.</p><p>He was at least six inches taller than my mother, and I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d really do it, but my blood rushed hot seeing him like this.</p><p>She pursed her lips in defiance before finally deciding to shut her f**king mouth and walk away.</p><p>God, I loved him.</p><p>\u201cMadoc . . .\u201d I ran up to him, and he turned just in time to catch me in a hug. I whispered in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot.\u201d</p><p>His body shook with laughter, and he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me up off the ground. I circled my arms around his neck and slammed the bedroom door after he\u2019d walked us in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got problems,\u201d said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re eighteen. And my father is bluffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded like a kid that wanted ice cream. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike love me so much that you wouldn\u2019t even be able to kill me if I turned into a zombie?\u201d he pressed with mischief on his face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He set me down and dug in his pants, pulling out a circular, black leather box. As he opened it up, I nearly slumped at the sight of what I saw.</p><p>A ring, beautifully detailed around the platinum band with a large round diamond in the center and several smaller round diamonds down each side, shimmered in the room\u2019s glow.</p><p>When my wide eyes looked up, Madoc was on one knee.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cMan, are you sure you\u2019re ready to do this?\u201d Jared leaned on the counter on Madoc\u2019s other side as we signed the papers for our marriage license.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous,\u201d Madoc joked. \u201cWe can still be friends. Just not friends with benefits.\u201d</p><p>Jared rolled his eyes and walked back to the wall of chairs, sitting down with his elbows on his knees.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look worried. Definitely concerned, though. Maybe a little frantic, too.</p><p>I knew I certainly was. I was nauseous, nervous, petrified, worried, and tense.</p><p>And completely in love.</p><p>It had taken me all of two seconds to find my voice and whisper \u201cyes\u201d when Madoc asked me to marry him. And even though I had a hurricane of concerns and questions spinning in my stomach, I was completely sure and calm about one thing.</p><p>Madoc.</p><p>I didn\u2019t doubt him for a single moment, and I never hesitated when I asked myself if I was his.</p><p>I was, am, and will always be. This was it.</p><p>We\u2019d left our house before Madoc\u2019s dad got home and drove straight into Chicago. I\u2019d barely had any clothes with me, so we headed to my dorm first so I could clean up and grab Tate, and then we\u2019d texted Jared to ditch class and meet us at the City Clerk\u2019s Office.</p><p>We needed witnesses and, of course, we wanted our friends there.</p><p>I definitely didn\u2019t look like a bride, though. Tate and I had the same style in clothes, which meant I was out of luck for dresses. It was probably for the best, though. I would\u2019ve been uncomfortable.</p><p>I wore a flimsy, white blouse with a fancy tie collar and capped sleeves tucked into some nice skinny jeans, and some black ballet flats with a matching black Burberry military coat. It was fitted at the waist and flared out as it fell mid-thigh. Madoc complemented me in his usual expensive jeans and a black military style fall coat that fell just below his waist. He had slapped some paste into his hair to make it stick up and the way he looked at me now, flashing his bright smile, was already doing me in.</p><p>Tate and I had scrambled on hair and makeup, but Madoc wouldn\u2019t stop looking at me like he wanted to eat me, so I guess we did all right.</p><p>I interlaced my fingers, each hand clutching the other.</p><p>The big diamond ring felt like heaven on my finger, and that was saying something for a girl who didn\u2019t wear conventional jewelry.</p><p>He\u2019d said it was a family heirloom, and that his father had given it to his mother for their engagement. When I hesitated, he\u2019d laughed and explained that even though her marriage ended in divorce, the grandmother and great-grandmother who\u2019d worn it before all had long, happy lives with their husbands.</p><p>Husband.</p><p>Questions flooded my head. Where would we live? How badly were our parents going to react? What about school? Would I be good to him? Good for him?</p><p>Looking down, I stared at the ring with its intricate detailing on the band, considering the history it represented and the man who gave it to me. He loved me. He was faithful. He was strong.</p><p>And our parents had to face the fact that we would never leave each other alone.</p><p>\u201cYou look happy.\u201d Tate stood at my side as Madoc finished up with the clerk.</p><p>I held my stomach and sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up, actually.\u201d</p><p>Madoc turned his head, eyeing me with raised eyebrows.</p><p>I rushed to add, \u201cBut it\u2019s like a wow-I\u2019m-so-excited-I-think-I\u2019m-going-to-be-sick feeling.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and plopped a quick kiss on my lips. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s head to the courthouse.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and grabbed the marriage license off the counter, but I dug my feet in, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d My voice sounded as timid as I could make it. \u201cI think . . . maybe . . . we should find a priest.\u201d</p><p>I scrunched my face in an apology.</p><p>\u201cA priest?\u201d he asked, his expression confused.</p><p>Madoc and I were both raised Catholic and attended parochial elementary schools. However, we\u2019d both stopped practicing, so I could see how he was blindsided by my request.</p><p>I gulped. \u201cI just think that my father may kill you unless a priest marries us.\u201d I tipped one corner of my lips up in a smile and clutched Madoc\u2019s hand, dragging him forward. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jared followed with Tate in his car, and Madoc and I led the way in his. Sovereign\u2019s Pub was on the north side of Chicago, between the Clerk\u2019s Office where we\u2019d come from and Northwestern. We parked in the rear, and I led the way into the bar, knowing exactly where to go.</p><p>Sitting in a back room that could be closed off with red velvet curtains, I saw Father McCaffrey sitting at a round table with three buddies. Two of them priests like himself and one old-timer in a leather jacket.</p><p>\u201cFather, hi,\u201d I greeted, my hand still in Madoc\u2019s.</p><p>He pulled his pint away from his lips and looked at me wide-eyed. \u201cFallon, dear. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He had a strong Irish accent even though he\u2019d lived in this country for more than twenty years. I think he worked hard to maintain the accent. Not only did his parishioners love it, but I knew he helped my father with business and having the accent helped when dealing with Irish clients. And since he\u2019d baptized me, I knew him well. He had graying dark-blond hair, light blue eyes, and a bit of a beer belly. Other than that he was in good shape. His freckles made him look younger than he was. Dressed in his black pants and dress shirt, he also wore an emerald green sweater vest that allowed his clerical collar to be visible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFather, this is Madoc Caruthers. My . . . fianc\u00e9.\u201d Madoc and I exchanged sideways glances and smiled.</p><p>In one respect it felt strange to say \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d when I\u2019d never even called Madoc my boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Father McCaffrey\u2019s jaw hung open.</p><p>Right away my heart started to sink. He was going to put up a fight.</p> <p>\u201cFather, I know this is unusual\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d Madoc stepped forward, interrupting. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get married. Can you handle that for us or not?\u201d</p><p>Way to sweet-talk him, dude.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Father asked.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Madoc tipped his chin down like an adult speaking to a child. \u201cRight here, right now.\u201d</p> <p>Father\u2019s eyes about popped out. \u201cHere?\u201d he gasped, and I almost laughed.</p><p>I had actually thought I\u2019d coerce Father McCaffrey back over to the church a few blocks away, but Madoc seemed to want to get down to business. Fine by me. If I had a choice between a staunchy Clerk\u2019s Office, a drafty church, or an old Irish pub smelling of furniture polish and Guinness, I\u2019d rather be here. The wooden bar and tables and chairs all shined with the afternoon sun pouring in through the windows, and the green curtains made the place feel comfortable and homey.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d I started, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not in the church, you\u2019re at the bar, and we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon, shouldn\u2019t you be waiting for your father\u2019s blessing, dear?\u201d The worry was clear all over his face.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d I stated firmly, \u201ctrusts my judgment. You should as well, Father.\u201d</p><p>Madoc grabbed my hand, slid the ring off my finger, and set it down with the marriage license and the silver band he had picked out for himself this morning on the table.</p> <p>\u201cMarry us, please, or we\u2019ll have to go to the courthouse with or without the Church\u2019s blessing. That is something her father won\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>Jared snorted behind us, and I looked back to see him and Tate trying to bite back smiles.</p><p>Glad they were enjoying this. Sweat broke out across my forehead.</p><p>Father McCaffrey sat there, and so did everyone at the table. They looked between Father and us, I looked between Father and Madoc, and Father looked between Madoc and me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whose move it was, but I didn\u2019t think it was ours.</p><p>Father finally stood up, and slipping his hand inside his vest, he pulled out a pen and leaned down, signing the paper.</p><p>I dipped my head, a huge smile stretching my face. Madoc turned to me, cupping my face, and leaned down to plant a soft kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>I breathed him in through my nose, inhaling his rich scent, and started taking off my coat. \u201cChildren will wait until after college,\u201d I stated low enough for only us to hear. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his forehead rubbing against mine. \u201cDefinitely. As long as we can have five later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive?!\u201d</p><p>Jared cleared his throat, bringing our attention back to the people around us, while Madoc laughed under his breath. I took a deep breath and swallowed.</p><p>Yeah, we were going to have to talk about that later.</p><p>Father brought us around to sign our parts under \u201cGroom\u201d and \u201cBride,\u201d and then Jared and Tate came around to sign as witnesses, also having to print their names at the bottom with Father McCaffrey as the officiant.</p><p>\u201cEveryone quiet now!\u201d Father shouted to the fifteen or so people in the bar. They quieted down and turned to us, finally noticing what was going on behind them. The bar fell silent as the music was cut off, and Madoc turned to me, taking my hands in his as they hung down between us.</p><p>Father began the short service, but I barely heard him as I looked up at Madoc. His blue eyes that always held a bit of mischief. His angular jaw and high cheekbones that looked even more amazing when they were wet from a pool or shower. His broad shoulders that could encapsulate me with warmth.</p><p>But what I thought of most as Father bound us together was how little I was thinking about myself right now. Forever since I can remember, I\u2019d thought about how much I hated my mother or missed my father. I thought about the disappointment and the anger, the wrongs and the loneliness.</p><p>I dwelled on the past, not realizing that it kept me from moving forward.</p><p>Now it was gone.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t forgotten, of course. It just didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>This was my future, and as Madoc put the ring on my finger, I knew the best part of my past was right here with me.</p><p>I glanced at Tate, who watched with love in her eyes, and Jared, who had his arm around her, and the happy tears spilled down my cheeks.</p><p>Madoc smiled, grabbing me by the back of my neck and gently bringing my head into his chest. \u201cFinish, Father,\u201d he ordered over my head. \u201cShe needs to be kissed.\u201d</p><p>The laughter in his voice was intoxicating. And I definitely needed to be kissed.</p><p>\u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Madoc wasted no time. Wrapping a quick arm around my waist, he hauled me off of my feet and kissed me hard, his lips shooting a lightning bolt of desire from my mouth straight down to my stomach. I held his face in my hands, and turning my head to the side, I kissed him back with full force.</p><p>Keeping me locked to him, he turned us and walked us out of the small space.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I grinned back at Father McCaffrey over Madoc\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Madoc called to the bartender over my shoulder. \u201cDo you have any music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cU2,\u201d the middle-aged guy answered.</p><p>Madoc scowled. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all a man needs.\u201d I heard the answer and started laughing in Madoc\u2019s ear.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSomething slow then.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his hands, he cupped the bottom of my thighs and brought my legs up and around his waist. Next thing I knew chairs started grinding against the floor, and when I looked around, everyone in the bar was pushing back the table sets to make a dance floor.</p><p>U2\u2019s \u201cAll I Want Is You\u201d started spilling softly out of the speakers, haunting at first as it drifted into our ears. Madoc started swaying from one foot to the other, moving us from side to side. I put my forehead to his, listening to him whisper the words to the song and fighting back the burn in my eyes. As the song built stronger and louder and we moved more, spinning slowly and every once in a while, I placed a kiss on his lips.</p><p>All I want is you.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>MADOC</p><p>As soon as we left Sovereign\u2019s, Fallon and I drove to the Waldorf Astoria for our honeymoon night. Tate thought we should all go out to dinner, but Jared got the hint.</p><p>The whole drive there, as the valet took the car, and during check-in I kept rubbing the inside of my pinky finger over the flat fit platinum wedding band. The discomfort of something new when I never wore jewelry\u2014except for my piercing\u2014contrasted to the hum I felt in my hand.</p><p>It was weird, but it was also powerful.</p><p>The ring reminded me that I was Fallon\u2019s. It reminded me that I was her protector, her lover, and her partner.</p><p>Eventually it occurred to me that the ring also meant I couldn\u2019t come and go as I like, I couldn\u2019t look at other women, and I was probably the only person in my high school graduating class that had a wife already, but I didn\u2019t care much about what others thought now.</p><p>I was cool with this. It was right for us.</p><p>By the time we reached the elevator, Fallon\u2019s hands were doing things that technically weren\u2019t allowed in public, and I was really f**king glad Jared and Tate had given us space.</p><p>Fallon had her hand under my coat, kneading my lower back. She was burying her nose in my chest as I walked with my arm around her. Her eyes were looking up at me saying everything that was in her head but couldn\u2019t leave her lips.</p><p>As soon as the elevator doors closed, I pushed her into the wall and leaned down into her face, her hot breath rushing against mine.</p><p>\u201cFallon Caruthers,\u201d I challenged, pushing hard against her body. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, huh?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers started working the button of my shirt under my open jacket. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she panted against my lips. \u201cI\u2019m just really ready for my husband right now.\u201d</p><p>And all at once her hands were inside my shirt, all over my bare chest, and my bottom lip was between her teeth. I grabbed her by the back of her thighs and hauled her up against the wall, diving into her mouth and tasting the raw heat that sent my c**k jerking and hardening. I needed to get these f**king clothes off of her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not changing my name,\u201d she said between kisses.</p><p>I felt the laugh in my throat that I thought would be a really bad idea to let loose right now.</p><p>It was my wedding night. I wanted to get laid, after all.</p><p>\u201cYes, you will,\u201d I stated matter-of-factly as I put my hand between her legs and rubbed.</p><p>The elevator stopped, and I dropped her feet to the floor. Thank God no one was outside the doors, because we were flushed and breathless.</p><p>Dragging her by the arm, I dug the card key out of my coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll hyphenate it then,\u201d Fallon mumbled behind me, and I took a second to remember she was talking about our last names.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d I slipped the key in, opened the door, and pulled her in. \u201cHyphenating your name is like saying \u2018I just don\u2019t want to admit defeat\u2019 when the truth is women who hyphenate their names have already lost. Men don\u2019t hyphenate their names.\u201d I pointed out, slamming the door behind me as I dug my slow heels into the plush carpet, stalking her. \u201cNow. You are going to be Fallon Caruthers, because you love me, you want to make me happy, and you want everyone to know that you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She had about enough time to drop her jaw and for anger to flare in her eyes before I was on her. Taking the hair at the back of her head, I pulled it down to expose her neck, and I sunk my lips and teeth in, biting and kissing so hard and soft that she wouldn\u2019t know which end was up.</p><p>Truth was I was an easygoing guy. For the most part. But my wife would have my name, or else.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about controlling her, and it wasn\u2019t about stealing her identity or whatever women liked to claim these days. It was about unity. We and our kids someday would have the same goddamn name, and that was it.</p><p>Hopefully she knew when some battles weren\u2019t worth fighting.</p><p>And that\u2019s when it hit me.</p><p>I pulled back and closed my eyes, running my hands through my hair.</p><p>Kids.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI forgot condoms.\u201d</p><p>I heard her sympathetic exhale that sounded almost like a laugh. I looked up, scowling. This wasn\u2019t funny. I was harder than a rock right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She waved away the angry expression on my face. \u201cWe\u2019re fine, Madoc. I\u2019ve been on birth control for a long time, actually. Ever since . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped.</p><p>The knot in my heart twisted tighter and tighter, and without hesitation, I scooped her up into my arms and carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>Ever since the abortion, she was going to say.</p><p>Since I\u2019d found out about it, I\u2019d had a hell of a time figuring out how I felt about it. I wished we\u2019d had the kid, but I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t. Which didn\u2019t make sense, but it kind of did.</p><p>On the one hand, I hated that Fallon had to go through that. I hated that we weren\u2019t more careful. I hated that she was alone. I hated that someone else\u2014someone I hate\u2014made a decision about my kid without me.</p><p>On the other hand, I knew we were too young. I knew it probably would\u2019ve changed our lives in a way that wouldn\u2019t have been beneficial. I knew that I wanted a house full of kids someday, but I didn\u2019t want them yet.</p><p>Final verdict: I\u2019ll be a good father. And I\u2019m glad I get to wait to find out for sure.</p><p>Setting Fallon down next to the bed, I planted my lips on her, damn near chewing on her I was in so much need, and ripped off my coat and shirt. After I\u2019d kicked off my shoes, I started working the button and zipper of her jeans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I growled low when she started undoing her shirt. \u201cLeave it on. I undress you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Slipping my hands inside the back of her jeans, I couldn\u2019t help but run my hands up and down her smooth ass in her thong. As I pushed her pants down her legs and bent down to slide her shoes and jeans off, I breathed out a long breath, thankful she wasn\u2019t doing anything right now.</p><p>As much as I wouldn\u2019t change the nights we spent together years ago, I needed to redeem myself. A little more, at least. Going after her like a starving pubescent teen who can\u2019t hold his load wasn\u2019t how this night was going to go.</p><p>Slow.</p><p>She wore a tiny black thong, and her white blouse fell just below her hips. She looked down at me, heat and patience in her eyes, and just waited for me to make my move.</p><p>Unbuttoning her shirt, I felt the quick and shallow rise and fall of her chest under my hands. Sliding it down her arms, I kept it clenched in my fist and tightened as I felt a surge of blood rush to my cock.</p><p>She wore a matching black see-through bra, which I didn\u2019t expect. The white blouse didn\u2019t reveal it. Her br**sts were perfectly visible through the sheer material, and I rubbed my hand over her hard nipple.</p><p>I touched her face, my thumb running along her bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re a dream.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and took my thumb in, sucking on the length, drawing it out slowly. Every nerve in my body hummed like it had just fallen asleep.</p><p>Taking my hand back, I reached behind her back and unclasped her bra, pulling it forward and letting it drop to the floor. Then I took the blouse still in my hand and threw it behind her and slipped it up her arms again.</p><p>As I met her eyes, I saw the question there, but what can I say? I used to give her crap about her clothes and how much she\u2019d hide, but it turns out I liked girls with mystery.</p><p>Pushing her down to the bed with a soft hand, I guided her to lay back and then slid her thong down her legs.</p><p>Coming to hover over her, seeing one of her br**sts peeking out of the open shirt, I couldn\u2019t help my strained voice. \u201cI want to see you in this shirt tonight, Fallon. In only this shirt. All night and every time I make you come.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows pinched together, but before she had a chance to say anything, I slipped a finger into her scorching heat, loving the little moan that came out of her and the way her head fell back.</p><p>Everywhere my finger touched was like a shot to my groin. She coated my middle finger so tight that it felt like it was in glove. I pushed in and out, completely turned on by how she pushed into my hand, grinding for more. Her moans turned to mewls, and I added another finger, barely feeling the strain in my other arm as I supported myself.</p><p>Her closed eyes and lips were tensed, and the sharp breaths coming out of her were the only sound in the room.</p><p>In my fingers went and out they came, wet and needy as I continued my rhythm and started circling her wet cl*t with my thumb. Her h*ps rolled faster and faster, sliding into my hand for more.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whimpered, breathing hard. \u201cMore, faster.\u201d She sucked in a breath, crying out.</p><p>Sliding in faster and harder, I watched as she slammed up and down, falling into a rhythm with my hand. Every thrust and exhale was like a plea.</p><p>More.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>More.</p> <p>Harder.</p><p>\u201cDamn, baby. Look at you.\u201d I swallowed, knowing she was almost there. Knowing she couldn\u2019t go any faster.</p><p>Diving as deep as I could go, I sunk my fingers into her and held them there, massaging her insides in circles.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d she cried, arching off the bed in waves as she came all over my hand. Throwing her head back two times, she drew in quick, ragged breaths as I held my fingers inside of her and rubbed my thumb over her cl*t again and again.</p><p>Everything about her was gorgeous. Hovering right over her, I whispered, \u201cFallon.\u201d</p><p>She blinked her eyes open, the aftershocks of the orgasm still straining her face and a light sheen of sweat on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou were my first everything. And my only love.\u201d</p><p>I wanted her to know that. Even through all the years, the separation, the pain, I wanted her to know that she was the only one I\u2019d loved.</p><p>Sitting up, she held my face in her hands. \u201cNo one can stop us now.\u201d But it sounded more like a battle cry than a fact. It was like she was saying \u201cYeah, we\u2019re married, and you can\u2019t take that.\u201d But also \u201cGo ahead and try.\u201d</p><p>I caught her lips and slipped my tongue into her mouth, kissing her fiercely with every muscle in my body tight.</p><p>Pulling away, I stood up and stripped out of the rest of my clothes. Her eyes shot down to my erection, and I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from the shirt draped over her braless chest.</p><p>Coming down on her, I flattened her on the bed and didn\u2019t stop kissing her as I worked my c**k into her entrance. Dipping inside\u2014just barely\u2014I slipped back out, bringing her wetness with me and swirled my top around her clit. The vibration of her groan hit my lips, and I entered her again\u2014only halfway\u2014and pulled out, rubbing the tip of my dick around her hard nub again.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d she whimpered, sounding pained. \u201cI\u2019m not a piano. Stop playing me.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and entered her again, taking each centimeter of her slowly. \u201cAm I too heavy?\u201d I asked, putting all of my weight on her.</p><p>When I had sex, I usually didn\u2019t favor missionary. Other positions felt better and allowed you a better view of the woman\u2019s body, but this time was different. I wanted to feel her everywhere.</p><p>She shook her head under my kiss. \u201cNo, I love it.\u201d Her hands scaled down my back and pulled my h*ps deeper into her. \u201cRight there,\u201d she begged. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I put my forehead to hers and inhaled the breaths she was letting loose. Her chest\u2014the parts that peeked out of the shirt\u2014were moist with sweat, and the friction of her hot skin was sending me reeling. My dick was slick with her, sliding in and out faster with her urgent hands pulling me in harder.</p><p>Fuck, she was so damn needy, and it was turning me on. I wasn\u2019t going to last long. Grabbing her thighs, I rolled us over so that she was on top. Her shirt had fallen off one shoulder, and one breast lay bare. As much as I wanted to touch her, I just watched her move. Holding onto her h*ps only, I kept my eyes glued to her grinding on me, the corner of her bottom lip between her teeth, and her exposed skin glistening with sweat.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d she cried out, riding me faster.</p><p>I groaned, shutting my eyes. \u201cCome on, baby.\u201d</p><p>The tingles spreading throughout my body weren\u2019t going to hold off. I was too damn turned on, and she was too damn hot.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d Her pained whisper shot right to my heart, and I arched up off the bed, pushing up into her as hard as I could.</p><p>\u201cAhhh.\u201d And she came apart, jerking and moaning, and I let go as well, releasing everything inside her and thrusting up again and again.</p><p>Christ. My eyebrows remained pinched and my eyes shut. My body was anything but relaxed right now.</p><p>I\u2019d never come inside of a woman without a condom before.</p><p>Except Fallon. Years ago.</p><p>No wonder the consequences could be bad. There was always a price on something that felt that good.</p><p>Fallon collapsed on my chest, and for a while, we just stayed silent and tried to calm down.</p><p>But then she whispered into my neck. \u201cFallon Caruthers, then.\u201d</p><p>And I flipped her on her back, ready for round two.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We stayed tangled together in the hotel room for the next twenty-four hours, finally pulling ourselves out of each other\u2019s asses\u2014no pun intended\u2014to have a conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do have a little money. My father pays my tuition up front and puts extra funds in my account for spending money. It\u2019s not much but enough to set up an apartment.\u201d</p><p>I kept my lids shut but gave her my attention. \u201cWhat about your tuition for next year? Won\u2019t you need the money for that?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds but then answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I had to chew the inside of my cheek to keep from smiling, but it didn\u2019t work. The rumble escaped my chest, and I let out a soft laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, still not looking at her. \u201cFallon, baby, we\u2019re fine. We will have no money problems if our parents cut us off,\u201d I finally told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Her tone was more abrupt.</p><p>\u201cI mean we\u2019re fine.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>When she said nothing and didn\u2019t press, I opened one eye and peered at her staring at me over her laptop. She looked like she was about to start boiling.</p><p>I exhaled an annoyed breath and leaned on my side, propping myself up with my elbow. Grabbing her laptop I logged in to my account and then turned the laptop back to her, showing her the screen. I didn\u2019t wait to see her expression before I lay back down and closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she exclaimed quietly. \u201cIs this . . . your savings account?\u201d</p><p>I grunted.</p><p>\u201cAll of this money is yours?\u201d she pressed, sounding like she didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t have access to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the money in there has nothing to do with my father. My mom\u2019s family is wealthy in their own right. She gave me my inheritance when I graduated high school,\u201d I explained.</p><p>I rarely touched the money in my bank account. My father made sure all of my expenses were paid, and I had a credit card for things I didn\u2019t have cash for. He liked to see what I was up to, so the credit card statements came in handy to him when he wasn\u2019t around to see what I did with my days. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust me. He did. I just think looking at my purchases made him feel like a part of my life and let him feel like he was in control.</p><p>Oh, look. Madoc got gas at 8 a.m. on a Saturday. Must be coming home from a party.</p><p>Oh, look. Madoc bought car parts. He must have a race coming up soon.</p><p>Oh, look. Madoc went to Subway. Glad he\u2019s eating.</p><p>\u201cYour mother gave an eighteen-year-old this much money?\u201d</p><p>I snapped my eyes back open, coming back to the now.</p><p>Looking over at Fallon, I scowled with mock hurt. \u201cHey, I\u2019m trustworthy. You know that.\u201d I laughed at her arched eyebrows and continued. \u201cMy father also gave me a third of my trust when I started college, so that\u2019s some of the money in there, too. I get another third when I graduate and another third when I turn thirty. But even if I don\u2019t get those two-thirds, obviously, we\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d I waved my hand at the laptop, referring to the balance in my account. \u201cYou\u2019ll go back to school next Monday, I\u2019ll withdraw from Notre Dame and transfer, and we\u2019ll get an apartment here in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I locked my hands behind my head and waited for her to say something. It made me feel happy she actually risked giving up her security for me, but that would never have to happen.</p><p>She pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve had this worked out all day, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I have.\u201d I flashed her a boyish smile. \u201cYou think I\u2019d give myself a wife to take care of and not have a plan?\u201d</p><p>Leaning up, I slipped my hand around her neck and brought her in. But as her eyes closed for the kiss she was no doubt expecting, I flicked her nose with my tongue instead and plopped back down, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t try to divorce me and take half,\u201d I threatened.</p><p>\u201cUgh, that was gross,\u201d she whined, probably wiping my spit off her face.</p><p>I heard the laptop close and the bed move as she climbed on top of me, straddling my waist. I went to place my hands on her thighs, but she grabbed them and pinned them to the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I won\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t make me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was too late. Her weight on me and her heat on my stomach already had me rolling my h*ps into hers as her moist breath sent a silver shot down to my groin.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I was fully hard now, and I needed some damn sleep. Didn\u2019t want sleep but needed it. Her mouth darted up to my neck, and she sunk her teeth in. I opened for her.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I choked out a groan. \u201cI never want to leave this room. Take my T-shirt off your body. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Pounding on the door sounded from the other room, and we both jerked our heads toward the noise.</p><p>\u201cMadoc Caruthers?\u201d a stiff voice called.</p><p>Fallon turned her wide eyes to me, and I sat up, setting her to the side of the bed.</p><p>Walking toward the door, I shook my head in dawning realization. I should\u2019ve had Jared register the room. I\u2019d been smart enough not to use my credit card, but I never thought my father would take the time to call the hotels of Chicago looking for me.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I asked, opening the door and then immediately dropping my f**king jaw.</p> <p>The cops? What the hell?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to ask you a few questions,\u201d a lean black officer said with his hand resting on his baton. I didn\u2019t take that as a threat. Maybe I should? The other cop was a female. Middle-aged with red hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>The lady cop tipped her chin at me. \u201cIs Fallon Pierce with you?\u201d</p><p>My heart started thumping. What now?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I finally answered.</p> <p>\u201cYour stepsister, right?\u201d the male cop confirmed.</p><p>I hooded my eyes and sighed. \u201cFor the moment, yes. Our parents are getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Fallon asked, stepping up to my side. She was dressed in jeans and her white blouse from yesterday tucked in. All of the clothing that had been sitting in a ball on the floor for the past twenty-four hours. She also had her glasses on.</p><p>\u201cAre you Fallon Pierce?\u201d</p><p>Fallon crossed her arms. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother reported you missing yesterday morning,\u201d Redhead explained. \u201cShe says she was threatened by Mr. Caruthers, claiming he said he was going to . . .\u201d She looked at her notes and continued. \u201c\u2018Put her through a wall.\u2019 And then you were taken.\u201d</p><p>Both cops looked at me, and I wanted to laugh. Fallon turned to me with a smirk on her face, and as serious as cops visiting your door is, we started laughing.</p><p>The officers exchanged a look as my chest shook and Fallon covered her smile with her hand.</p> <p>\u201cDid you threaten Mrs. Caruthers, sir?\u201d</p><p>Which Mrs. Caruthers? I felt like asking, but I resisted. No one would know about our marriage yet, and our parents had to find out from us and no one else if we were going to be taken seriously.</p><p>\u201cOfficers,\u201d I assured, \u201cthese are family issues. I would never have touched my stepmother. Fallon is here of her own free will, and there is no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Caruthers,\u201d the male cop started. \u201cWe know who your father is\u2014\u201d</p><p>But then all hell broke loose. A woman and her cameraman rushed up behind the police officers and stuck a microphone between them in my direction. I reared back, and Fallon grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cMadoc Caruthers?\u201d the woman shouted, stumbling into the cops. \u201cSon of Jason Caruthers? Are you having an affair with your stepsister? Her mother claims you kidnapped her?\u201d</p><p>My f**king heart lodged like a baseball in my throat, and I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Motherfucker! Shit!</p><p>I swallowed, looking down at Fallon.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s enough!\u201d one of the officers growled, both turning around and holding up their hands to shield us from the intrusion.</p><p>What the hell? My dad was a big deal, but not that big of a deal. Someone had to have tipped these people off.</p><p>The female cop kept her voice calm. \u201cLet\u2019s get this under control. You\u2019re interfering with police business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he holding you against your will?\u201d The reporter shook her brown bangs out of her eyes, looking intense and determined.</p><p>I leaned over to grab the door to close it, but Fallon barked.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she ordered. \u201cHe\u2019s not Mr. Caruthers. And he\u2019s not holding me against my will, for Christ\u2019s sake! And we\u2019re not having some sordid relationship. He\u2019s my . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>\u201c. . . husband!\u201d she finished.</p><p>I closed my eyes, wincing, and let out a low groan.</p><p>Shit. Fuck. Son of a bitch.</p><p>I shoved Fallon back, grabbed the door, and slammed it shut, hearing the cops ordering the reporter and her cameraman away.</p><p>Locking the door, I slid down the wall next to it and crashed to my ass.</p><p>Knees bent, I rested my forearms on them and banged my head against the wall once.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d I breathed in and out, barely noticing that Fallon stayed where I\u2019d pushed her out of the way.</p><p>My fists clenched, and I was sure my face was beet red. I felt stupid. Why did I always underestimate Patricia?</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she finally said, looking dazed. \u201cThat was creepy. My mother\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s smart,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cWe just made the news and embarrassed my father.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell, and she walked over and sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cMadoc, I\u2019m sorry. I panicked.\u201d</p><p>I put my arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I guess we don\u2019t have to worry about making the rounds to the parents anymore.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2014and I mean everyone\u2014was going to know I was married by the time they went to sleep tonight. There would be no end to the texts and calls for a while as my family and friends would all want to know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cHow did they know we were here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI registered under my name.\u201d I sounded less embarrassed than I actually was. \u201cYour mom wouldn\u2019t have had to work too hard to find us if she found out we weren\u2019t at school.\u201d</p><p>Her chest fell hard. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be on the eleven o\u2019clock news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll be on the Internet in about five minutes. Media outlets have to compete with the speed of Facebook, after all. They\u2019ll have that loaded up in no time.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, quiet and stunned, trying to figure out what to do next.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she urged.</p><p>I did and fell back into the comfort of her green eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she stated. \u201cWhere should we go?\u201d</p><p>Leaning my head back, I licked my lips, thinking.</p><p>Fallon and I did nothing wrong. We weren\u2019t running away just so we could have a mini-honeymoon. And we weren\u2019t starting our marriage fearing our parents\u2019 wrath. If we wanted to be respected as adults, then we had to face the music.</p><p>I stood up, pulling her after me. \u201cHome,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was about ten o\u2019clock by the time we rolled into the driveway at my house. The pitch-black sky exploded with stars, and the conifer trees Addie had had planted so that we could have green all year bent with the light wind.</p><p>The cops had come back to our room for a few remaining questions.</p><p>Yes, Fallon and I are married. Here\u2019s the signed license.</p><p>No, I did not kidnap her, of course. See? No bruises, and she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>Yes, I threatened my stepmom, and I\u2019m using the \u201cdaddy\u201d card on this one. You can\u2019t touch me, because I\u2019m Madoc Caruthers.</p><p>Now, please go. We\u2019re honeymooning.</p><p>They left, we showered and got presentable, and we drove the hour it took to get to Shelburne Falls.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I ordered when Fallon started to open her door.</p><p>Getting out and rounding the front, I let her out of the car, took her hand, and walked side by side with her to the front step.</p><p>I took her chilled face in my hands. \u201cWe\u2019re not raising our voices, and we\u2019re not apologizing.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and together we entered the house.</p><p>The foyer and all of the rooms off it were dark, and the house hummed with only the sounds of clocks ticking and heat pouring out of the vents. The smell of grilled steaks and leather hit me, and I immediately felt at home. It\u2019s what my house always smelled like.</p><p>I remembered that Tate once said she loved the smell of tires. It brought back memories for her, and it was familiar. When I smelled grilled meat, I always thought of summers out by the pool. My mom asking me if I wanted another Crush. My dad\u2014on the occasions he was home\u2014working the grill and talking to his friends. And me seeing the fireworks light up in the star-filled sky.</p><p>Despite the issues my family had\u2014all families have issues\u2014I was a happy kid. Things could\u2019ve been better, but they were good enough, and I never wanted for anything. There was never a shortage of people to dote on me.</p><p>This house was my home, and with it came all of my good memories. Whenever I escaped, this is where I wanted to run first. Patricia Caruthers could take our name, take the money, but I\u2019d be dead before she took this house. I had to find some way to beat her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if my dad was in bed, but I knew he was here. His Audi was in the driveway.</p><p>Hand in hand, Fallon and I walked down the hall and veered to the left, coming up to his office.</p><p>\u201cDo you think our children hate us?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice asked, and I halted.</p><p>I motioned for Fallon to stay quiet by putting my finger over my lips, and we both leaned into the cracked door, listening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d my father answered, sounding resigned. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t blame Madoc if he did. Does Jared love you?\u201d</p><p>Katherine Trent. That\u2019s who he was talking to.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd if he got married tomorrow, I\u2019d be worried as hell, but I\u2019d know he was following his heart. I mean, look at us, Jason. Who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t make it at eighteen when we failed long after that age? Are we experts?\u201d</p><p>Damn. Invisible hands wrung out my stomach like a washcloth. My dad knew I was married.</p><p>I heard hard footsteps. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about priorities, Katherine. My son needs to finish college. He needs to experience life. He\u2019s been given the gifts of privilege and opportunity. Now he has a distraction.\u201d</p><p>I took Fallon\u2019s hand and held her eyes with mine.</p><p>There was some shuffling around the office, and then I heard the wheels of my father\u2019s desk chair shift as he let out a huge breath. He must\u2019ve sat down. Narrowing my eyes, I tried to figure out if he was angry or upset. I couldn\u2019t tell. I heard a grunt and some more heavy breathing. It sounded like hyperventilating. But not.</p><p>\u201cI messed up.\u201d His voice caught, and I heard the tears.</p><p>\u201cShh, Jason. Don\u2019t.\u201d Katherine started to cry as well.</p><p>My father, I thought. My dad is crying. My chest got heavy, and I looked down to see Fallon\u2019s thumb rubbing back and forth on my hand. When I looked up, her chin was quivering.</p><p>\u201cMy house is empty, Katherine.\u201d His voice was so sad. \u201cI want him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t good parents,\u201d she choked out. \u201cOur kids have paid for our lifestyle, and now it\u2019s our turn to pay for theirs. He\u2019s got a girl that he can\u2019t stay away from. They\u2019re not doing this to hurt you, Jason. They\u2019re in love.\u201d And I smiled at her words. \u201cIf you want your son back,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou need to open your arms wider.\u201d</p><p>I clasped Fallon\u2019s hand tighter and whispered, \u201cI need a few minutes alone.\u201d</p><p>Her watery eyes sparkled, and she nodded her understanding. Walking past me, she headed for the kitchen.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I saw my father in his desk chair, leaning on his knees with his head in his hands. Katherine was kneeling in front of him, comforting him, I assumed.</p><p>\u201cMs. Trent?\u201d I called, slipping my hands into the pockets of my jacket. \u201cCan I talk to my dad alone, please?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both of their heads popped up, and Katherine stood.</p><p>She looked beautiful in a cream-colored forties-style house dress with red polka dots on it. Her chocolate dark brown hair\u2014the same shade as Jared\u2019s\u2014hung over her shoulders in loose curls, but pieces were brought up in two barrettes on each side of the top of her head.</p><p>My father, on the other hand, was a mess. Disheveled hair he\u2019d probably been running his fingers through, a wrinkled white shirt, blue silk tie hanging loose, and he\u2019d definitely been crying.</p><p>He sat there, unmoving, and actually looking a little afraid of me.</p> <p>Katherine cleared her throat. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I stepped out of the doorway as she walked past, but I reached out and grabbed her hand, stopping her. I kissed her cheek and gave her a grateful smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Her eyes shined, and she nodded before leaving.</p><p>My father hadn\u2019t moved from his chair, and I did a sweep of the room, remembering that I was never allowed in here as a kid. My father wasn\u2019t hiding things. Not in here anyway. But he once said \u201chis whole life\u201d was in this room, and it wasn\u2019t a place for kids.</p><p>I think that was the first time I realized that I wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s top priority. There were things he loved more than me.</p> <p>But looking at him now . . . his weary eyes, his physical strain, and the silence that told me he didn\u2019t know what to say to me offered up a different conclusion.</p><p>Maybe my dad cared.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I stepped toward him. \u201cI never liked you, Dad.\u201d I spoke slowly, taking my time. \u201cYou worked too much, and you never showed up when you said would. You made my mother cry, and you thought money could fix everything. And the worst part is that you\u2019re not stupid. You knew the void you left in your family, but you did it anyway.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, challenging him to say something. Anything to account for himself.</p><p>But his eyes had dropped to the desk with my first words, and they had stayed there.</p><p>So I continued, straightening my shoulders more. \u201cI love Fallon. And I love this house. I want you in my life, but if you\u2019re going to throw your weight around like it matters, then you can go to hell.\u201d I paused, coming up in front of the desk. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But I do love you, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>My jaw tightened, and I blinked away the sting in my eyes.</p><p>He raised his eyes, and it was a look I\u2019d never seen before. They shimmered with tears, but they were hard. My father wanted to fight. In his head he worried about my education, Fallon and me having jobs, dealing with marriage when we were still growing up, but that\u2019s what he didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>I\u2019d stopped growing up when Fallon left.</p><p>And I started again when she came home.</p><p>You have to have something to love. Something to fight for to make living a goal instead of a job. Fallon wouldn\u2019t keep me from tomorrow. My father had done that.</p><p>I held his stare, ready for whatever he wanted to throw at me, but he should know better. If he didn\u2019t support us, we were doing it without him.</p><p>Finally standing up, he ran his hands through his hair and tightened his tie. I watched him as he went to his safe, dialed in the combination, and took out some papers. Returning to his desk, he signed the document and handed it to me over the desk.</p><p>I hesitated. It was probably a new will leaving me in the cold or some such bullshit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping the other two-thirds of your trust and doling it out as was already planned,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut here\u2019s a wedding gift . . . if we can fight hard enough to keep it.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I unfolded the papers again, and a sliver of a smile escaped my lips.</p><p>\u201cThe house?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>He\u2019d given me the deed to the house, but it wasn\u2019t in my name. Excitement and confusion rushed through my very clouded brain.</p><p>Did I want the house?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Forever and ever and ever?</p><p>Hell yes!</p><p>I loved it here, and so did Fallon. If we could keep it in Caruthers hands, we would. But what did this mean for my father? I didn\u2019t necessarily want him gone.</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>No, not really.</p><p>\u201cPatricia\u2019s trying to take the house. I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d My father\u2019s eyes clouded in an expression I was more familiar with. \u201cBut I\u2019ll drag her through court for as long as I can. It may take a year, but I\u2019ll win. The house is in my name, but as my wife, she has rights to it until a court says she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ll transfer the house to you officially when I take away that threat.\u201d He stood up straight, reaching out his hand to me. \u201cBut the house is yours for all intents and purposes. I know you and Fallon\u2014and Addie\u2014love it here, and I want you to have your home.</p><p>I took his hand, and the furious flow of blood through my veins relaxed. I wasn\u2019t sure if my father was really giving up, if he was just that tired of drama, or if he was bluffing.</p><p>But when I looked at him, I saw his relaxed eyes turn bleary, and before I knew it I was yanked in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I grunted against the crush of his arms and almost laughed. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was a joke or if it was supposed to be funny, but rare and weird things are funny. To me.</p><p>But as I tried to catch my breath, I kind of realized that my dad wasn\u2019t letting go. His arms were as tight as steel around me, and I couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d hugged me.</p><p>And I don\u2019t think it was ever this tight.</p><p>I found my arms slowly wrapping around him and returning the embrace.</p><p>\u201cKatherine\u2019s right.\u201d He stepped back and squeezed my shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay away from her, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could go back with Katherine and redo things\u2014\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen you and Jared would\u2019ve been stepbrothers a long, long time ago,\u201d he finished, understanding.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t live with those regrets. I\u2019m doing this, Dad.\u201d I held my position. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Fearing the breakup of his marriages or contending with Katherine\u2019s alcoholism in the past were things my father had let get in his way. From him I learned that mistakes can be dealt with. Loss of time can\u2019t.</p><p>He slapped me on the back and let out a heavy breath. \u201cSo where\u2019s Fallon?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>FALLON</p><p>Katherine had come into the kitchen shortly after me, and I wished I could shrink away.</p><p>Until she came up and hugged me.</p><p>I held my breath, completely confused.</p><p>Yeah, hi. I\u2019m the girl that nearly threatened to expose your affair on TV, and I\u2019m solely responsible for your boyfriend\u2019s divorce chaos right now. But sure, I\u2019ll take some hugs!</p><p>Once she let go, I sank into the barstool as she dug out all of the fixings for sundaes from the refrigerator.</p><p>There were lots of questions I wanted to ask her. She was, after all, having an affair with my mother\u2019s husband. I should despise her. Or at the very least dislike her. I definitely shouldn\u2019t respect a home-wrecker.</p><p>But for some reason\u2014or many reasons\u2014I felt like my mother was the sleazy one out of the group.</p><p>And one thing could not be denied about Katherine. A nearly eighteen-year affair was love.</p><p>She was very beautiful, too. And young. Still young enough to have more kids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re so calm about this.\u201d I picked at my vanilla and caramel sundae.</p><p>She shrugged, still scooping a serving for Madoc. All chocolate. \u201cI started young, too,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut unlike me, you and Madoc have an excellent support system.\u201d Yeah, she was right. I still didn\u2019t know where my dad stood on this, and I planned on calling him first thing in the morning. But Madoc and I had means to live, and we had Addie at the very least. We were lucky.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid Jared will get inspired and propose to Tate?\u201d I teased.</p><p>Her head fell back as she laughed softly. \u201cNo.\u201d She sounded sure.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you and Madoc have overcome . . . more mature issues, shall we say? I can understand how marriage feels like the natural next step. Jared and Tate on the other hand? They were in so much heartache for each other for so long that I think they just want to be left alone for a while. They need their calm.\u201d</p><p>Just then we heard Madoc\u2019s and his dad\u2019s voices coming down the hall, and Katherine and I turned to see them enter with smiles on their faces.</p><p>My stomach pinched with anticipation, but my shoulders relaxed a little. Seeing Jason head straight for me, I pushed my hair behind my ears, taking inventory of everything I was wearing. Jeans and one of my black fitted, long-sleeve T\u2019s, but I was still wearing my Burberry coat. My hair was still in loose curls from the \u201cwedding,\u201d and it still looked good last time I checked, despite the twenty-four hours Madoc and I had spent in bed.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes were relaxed and welcoming, but he looked like he wasn\u2019t breathing. His expression was pleasant but guarded.</p><p>Tipping my chin up, he placed a quick, gentle kiss on my forehead and then took my hand, looking down at the ring.</p><p>\u201cLooks good on you. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Huh?</p><p>That\u2019s it? That can\u2019t be it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mumbled, searching the floor for my jaw.</p><p>\u201cIf you both want some advice from a man who\u2019s about to have two divorces behind him . . .\u201d Jason looked between Madoc and me. \u201cFight. Fight through everything. Don\u2019t leave the house angry or go to bed mad. Fight until it\u2019s settled. The end of fighting is the beginning of giving up.\u201d</p><p>And then he looked at me. \u201cDon\u2019t let him off the hook. You understand?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and gave him a small nod.</p><p>\u201cMr. Caruthers?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me. \u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason. I owe you an apology. This mess with the divorce\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to happen, Fallon,\u201d he finished, cutting me off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Well, it will be fine eventually,\u201d he offered.</p><p>With a nod to Katherine, they walked out the way they came in. \u201cKatherine and I are going to her house for the night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you Friday night at the charity auction.\u201d</p><p>And they left.</p><p>Madoc plopped down on the stool at the bar. Pulling me in between his legs, he nuzzled my neck, sending shivers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d I closed my eyes, leaning in to his spectacular kisses. \u201cBaby, I am sorry, but I think I need to get back to school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Like stopped so fast, I thought he was dead. Taking his head out from my neck, he flashed slightly pissed blue eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It sounded more like a dare than a question.</p><p>\u201cOh, I got an e-mail from a professor.\u201d I picked up my phone, gesturing with it. \u201cHe\u2019s fine with me missing a few classes, but I\u2019m going to miss a guest lecturer tomorrow and a test on Friday. They\u2019re both really important.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d already missed three days of classes.</p><p>He finally heaved a sigh. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll crash with Jared, so we don\u2019t have to be separated. You go to class, I\u2019ll work out getting transferred to Northwestern, and we\u2019ll start looking for apartments. We have to be in Chicago for that charity thing on Friday anyway. We\u2019ll leave early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Hanging my arms over his shoulder, I joined my hands behind his neck. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sinking into him and his man scent, I took his top lip between my lips, and he took my bottom lip between his. It\u2019s the kiss we always ended up in. All four lips, layered as one as we just stilled and breathed each other in.</p><p>Can I just say how much I loved to smell him? I loved that he wore cologne, and he always would. Or else.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go shower,\u201d he whispered into my mouth.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I want a shower with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I backed away, unbuttoning my coat. \u201cI\u2019ve got other plans. Go get your shower, and find me in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>His forehead wrinkled. \u201cFind you?\u201d</p><p>I said nothing more. After about twenty seconds, he realized I was done talking and walked off upstairs grinning.</p><p>I smirked to myself. He thinks he\u2019s the only one capable of mischief.</p> <p>Grabbing some printer paper from the fax machine in the kitchen, I scrawled a riddle to Madoc\u2014knowing how he looooooved riddles\u2014and left it on the bottom of the bannister.</p><p>Back in the days when we used to go to war,</p><p>I\u2019d wait for the nights when you\u2019d knock on my door.</p><p>Now you\u2019ll have to look for me in a room on this floor,</p><p>Where the vampires hunt and from your lips I was torn.</p> <p>Slipping off my coat, I dropped it in on the floor next to the stairs. Taking a few steps away, I started stripping off the rest of my clothes and dropping them at small intervals on the black-and-white tiled floor. My flats, my jeans, my shirt, and then I unclasped my bra and dropped it in on the plush, beige carpet leading into the hallway to the right.</p><p>Clad only in my red lace thong, I walked down the dimly lit hallway and entered the theater room, thankful that the chill on my body distracted from the drumming in my chest.</p><p>I hated this room.</p><p>And I loved this room.</p><p>Slowly turning the dial on the wall, I brightened the area only enough to cast a soft glow. As I looked around, I took account that nothing had changed. Not that I expected it to.</p><p>This room was used rarely, but it was built for a crowd. Several black leather recliners and two long black leather couches all sat facing a massive flat screen mounted to a wall that was adorned with three smaller screens on each side. Family photos and more sports paraphernalia dressed the coffee-colored walls, and with the cream-colored carpet, everything looked cozy and cavelike in here.</p> <p>Madoc and I used to watch TV in here a lot, even though we rarely said anything nice to each other. And the only time Jason Caruthers came in here was for Super Bowl Sunday.</p><p>Walking up on soft feet, I ran my hand over the cool, smooth black leather of our couch. The one we watched the Vampire Diaries on. The one we ignored each other on, despite the thick cloud of tension between us. And the one we last slept on together before I was taken away.</p><p>My womb tightened, and a shock weaved down between my legs, making my jaw tingle with a smile.</p><p>This place should be intimidating to me. This was the place I\u2019d been shocked awake by one screaming parent and another one so angry, he couldn\u2019t even speak. My mother had hauled me off the couch nearly naked, wearing only Madoc\u2019s shirt. Jason Caruthers had stood in the hallway, refusing to even make eye contact when I was dragged past him. Madoc was nowhere in sight, and within twenty minutes, I was dressed, packed, and driven away, unknowingly carrying a child inside of me.</p><p>This room should\u2019ve been bad news to me, but it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>This couch had felt good on my skin, and I remember being so grateful Madoc had talked me out of finally leaving my room that night.</p><p>Climbing onto the sofa, I knelt up against the back and rested my forearms over the top. I wanted to see Madoc when he found me. When the door handle started to turn, I had to swallow down my smile and curl my toes to keep my excitement at bay.</p><p>As Madoc opened the door, his eyes shot straight to me, and I gave him a sexy, little smirk, hopefully coming off as playful and not the nympho I\u2019d become. He wore black pajama pants that hung low, and his golden skin looked so warm and smooth that my mouth was watering. The little hills of his six-pack flexed, and I trailed my eyes up to his pecs and further, loving the way his kind-of wet hair stuck up like it\u2019d been styled that way. When I got to his face, though, his ever present amusement was gone.</p> <p>He swallowed and held up the riddle I\u2019d left. \u201cThe theater room.\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he looking at me? His eyes were shifting around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . a . . .\u201d I stammered. My heart was starting to pump too fast. Shit! Was he mad?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you figured it out,\u201d I said, cocking my head to the side, trying to entice him to come in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well . . . the last line helped.\u201d He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cLook, Fallon. I don\u2019t want to be in here. Can we just go to bed?\u201d</p><p>What? Why?</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d I rushed to stop him. \u201cI know that this is the last place we saw each other before I left, but we don\u2019t have to be afraid of it.\u201d</p><p>I got off the couch and stood up next to the arm, my hands folded in front of me. His steamy blue eyes fell down my body and then trailed timidly back up to my face.</p><p>He walked over to me, every hard step vibrating through my veins. Taking me by the back of my neck, he kissed me deep, slipping his tongue in immediately and making every part of me warm.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d I gasped when he pulled me up off the ground. As he cupped my ass, I wrapped my legs around his waist.</p><p>I loved that he picked me up.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t like that he started walking us to the door.</p><p>\u201cWe leave in six hours,\u201d he threatened, \u201cand that may or may not be enough time to taste every part of your body. But I want to get started right now. We\u2019re going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc, no!\u201d I shot out my arms and caught the door frame, stopping him in his tracks. \u201cNo! I want to be in here.\u201d</p><p>He pushed a little, and I tightened my grasp on the door frame against the stretch in my arms. If he wanted to get me out of here, he only had to push a bit more. He was going easy on me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d he shot back. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re not kids anymore. We\u2019re going to do it in a bed like grown-ups and not on a couch like horny teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are horny teens.\u201d</p><p>He scowled up at me. \u201cLet go, or I tickle.\u201d</p><p>My chest tensed, and I almost closed my arms with the threat, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Squirming out of his grasp, I lowered myself to the ground and slammed my hands into his chest, pushing him backward. Reaching over, I grabbed the door and threw it shut.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s wide eyes locked on mine as I walked the few short steps over to him, backed him up against the back of the sofa, and started to maul him. My hand dug into his hair, my lips kissed him hard and fast on his mouth and then his neck, and my other hand shot down to his thick erection already pulsing in my hand.</p><p>\u201cFallon, Jesus,\u201d Madoc cursed.</p><p>But his head fell back as the pleasure overtook him, and he threaded his fingers into my hair as I trailed kisses down his chest and stomach.</p><p>Setting down on my knees, I freed him from his pants and, taking him in my hand, I circled my tongue around his tip, my tongue ring bumping with his piercing. He jerked, and his eyes popped open, looking down on me with fierce eyes and bared teeth.</p><p>\u201cFallon,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI want to. Please?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut and the grip in my hair loosened.</p><p>Coming down on him again, I drew him in long and slow, savoring the smell of body wash that made me so hungry. I swayed my tongue from side to side on the underside of him, so he could feel the ball on my tongue. His c**k twitched in my mouth, and I got more eager with the taste of him and his silver. Bringing him in slow, I relaxed my throat, taking in all of him down to the base.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he whispered, sucking in air through his teeth. \u201cYou better not have learned this on another guy.\u201d</p><p>I drew him out and sucked hard and fast on the tip about ten times before answering. \u201cTate and I got a book for research last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cThat\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>If I knew Madoc, he was probably imagining Tate and me practicing on cucumbers.</p><p>She had wanted to do this for Jared, but neither of us had had any experience. Obviously, she wanted to blow his mind, so I suggested watching some p**n . She gave me a huge \u201cno,\u201d saying she wasn\u2019t watching seedy videos on the Internet. So we went online and bought a book.</p><p>I sucked him all of the way into my mouth again, slowly down to the base, and swirled my tongue around him.</p><p>Reaching behind him, I pulled his pants down just below his ass and held his h*ps for support as I moved faster up and down his length. My roots stung from where he was fisting my hair. He was fully hard\u2014I hope, because I couldn\u2019t take anymore\u2014as I savored the feel of every inch of his skin.</p><p>He groaned and inhaled sharp, fast breaths, and I loved the sight of Madoc worked up. With his face pinched and eyes shut, looking like he was in pain, I had a sudden urge to crawl up his body.</p><p>My head was pulled away, and Madoc looked violent.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI want you. But not on this couch.\u201d</p><p>Licking my lips, I pinched my eyebrows together in confusion but didn\u2019t push it.</p><p>Who the hell cared right now? The couch, the chair, the floor . . .</p><p>Grabbing my hand, he pulled me over to one of the other leather couches, swung me around, and brought me down on top, straddling him in his sitting position. His erection rubbed between my legs, and then . . .</p><p>Whoa!</p><p>He slid both hands into the string of thong at my hip and ripped them clean off.</p><p>My panties were gone, and my core pulsed so damn hard that I had to bite my lip to keep from crying out.</p><p>I was uncontrollable. I dove into him, sliding my tongue across his lips and lifting up as he rubbed his tip into my entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh, Madoc,\u201d I panted.</p><p>Damn, that felt good.</p><p>I held his face in my hands and looked into his eyes, unable to stop grinding on him. \u201cWhy did you leave me in here alone that night?\u201d I ventured. I assumed that\u2019s why he was uncomfortable with the other couch. Maybe that was why he hated this room.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d His eyes were apologetic. \u201cI covered you up,\u201d he breathed out, shutting his eyes with the pleasure of my movement on him, \u201cand went to get a shower. I\u2019d planned on coming back down to wake you up, but by the time I got back, you were gone.\u201d</p><p>All this time I thought he\u2019d had his fun and just went up to bed, leaving me.</p><p>\u201cI hate this f**king room,\u201d he finished. His mouth closed but then opened again, looking like he wanted to tell me more but didn\u2019t.</p><p>I grabbed the remote and turned on the stereo. Lorde\u2019s \u201cTeam\u201d came on, and I clutched the leather sofa behind him with both of my hands and lowered myself onto him slow enough to drive him crazy. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you love it again,\u201d I promised.</p><p>He filled me up, and I dropped my head back at the feel of him inside of me.</p><p>He let out a low growl and hooded his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>MADOC</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d a voice says behind me, and I tense.</p><p>Turning around, I see my stepmother, Patricia, and I don\u2019t hide the frown at seeing her in her short white silk nightie.</p><p>Clutching the bottle of water, I slam the refrigerator door shut and try to keep my eyes averted. My head feels staticky from the liquor at the bonfire, but it doesn\u2019t dull the awkwardness of this situation.</p><p>Her long blond hair hangs loose, but it looks freshly styled as does her makeup, and her posture isn\u2019t modest. One hand on the kitchen island, another hand on her hip, she sways playfully and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d I snip.</p><p>\u201cAsleep,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIn his room. Did you have a good night?\u201d</p><p>Why was she being so nice lately?</p><p>\u201cYeah, up until now,\u201d I answer flatly.</p><p>I\u2019d just gotten back from a race and a hell of a win against Liam. And I got to see Tatum Brandt race for Jared. Along with the bonfire afterward, it had been an entertaining night.</p><p>But I am tired and not in the mood for whatever poison Patricia wants to spew.</p><p>I walk around the island, heading out, when she steps in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d She puts her hand on my chest, and I inch back. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten big with the working out. You look good.\u201d She nods her approval and gives me innocent eyes. \u201cDid you know that your dad\u2019s having an affair?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jesus. What the hell?</p><p>She definitely isn\u2019t hiding much in that nightie, either. I can see inches of her cle**age and the tan, smooth-looking skin of her arms, legs, and shoulders. Patricia works out a lot and takes care of herself very well with my father\u2019s money. At forty, she looks much younger.</p><p>A ten-ton brick crashes in to my stomach when her lips inch in for my neck.</p><p>What. The. Fuck?</p> <p>I push her hand away. \u201cAre you for real?\u201d I\u2019m almost breathless with shock.</p><p>Walking past her, I stomp down the hallway and dive in to the theater room. The only place I want to be anymore. Slamming the door, I walk over and plop down on the couch\u2014the one Fallon and I were last together on\u2014and drop my head back, closing my eyes.</p><p>My heart is thundering in my chest, and my whole body is hot with anger.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. My stepmother just came on to me.</p><p>With my head swimming, I pinch the bridge of my nose, trying to get my head straight from my alcohol-induced blur. The cool leather at the back of my neck calms my breathing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t understand why, after all this time, I still end up sleeping in this room most nights.</p><p>Fallon left. She never really liked me, so why did I want to be reminded of her betrayal?</p><p>But still . . . this is the place where we spent the most time together, sometimes in silence and one time not-so-silent.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Patricia says, and I snap my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d I shout, my lips tight in seeing her standing in front of me.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I lock the f**king door?</p> <p>I stand up and get in her face. \u201cThis is my room. Get out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flash with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019re in a mood. I can see why Fallon feared you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cFallon didn\u2019t fear me. I don\u2019t know what she told you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t handle you, Madoc.\u201d She looks up at me, drawing her bottom lip between her teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s in your past. You need to move on. She certainly has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dating someone at her boarding school,\u201d Patricia says, and my heart rings in my ears.</p><p>I barely register Patricia\u2019s hands on my chest, rubbing me through my T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even talk about you or ask about you, Madoc. I ask her to come home for visits. She won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t deserve the man you\u2019ve become.\u201d My eyes close, thinking about all of the time I spend in here, all of the nights thinking about her, and I know it\u2019s a waste of time. I f**king know it. Sure, I dated, too. I hooked up\u2014not as much as I bragged to Jared\u2014but there had been girls. My heart never belonged to any of them, though.</p> <p>Patricia\u2019s whisper wafts across my neck. \u201cI know what you crave. What will please you. And I can keep secrets.\u201d</p><p>She closes the distance, wrapping her arms around my neck, and smashes her lips to mine.</p><p>She moans, and all of a sudden I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>No . . .</p><p>No.</p><p>No!</p><p>Grabbing her by the shoulders, I shove her away from me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I yell. \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d</p><p>Her skin is flushed, and she arches an eyebrow. \u201cNo?\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think you mean that, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>I want to hit her. I actually want to slam her into a wall and erase her from the planet. Most of all, I want her out of here.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d I order.</p><p>Smirking, she walks to the couch and lays down on it. \u201cMake me,\u201d she challenges. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to touch me to do it.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at her, lying in the same place I\u2019d last seen Fallon. Her hand rests above her head, and she looks hideous. Like something I never want to remember.</p><p>I straighten my expression and speak low. \u201cLeave tomorrow, or I\u2019ll tell my dad about this.\u201d</p><p>I should tell him anyway.</p><p>But maybe I don\u2019t feel like protecting my father right now. Maybe I want him to suffer in this marriage. Maybe I hate him for bringing both of these bitches into our house.</p><p>Or maybe if I lose Patricia, I fear losing Fallon for good.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I walk out, leaving her on the couch and get out my phone.</p><p>Are you up? I text, but I\u2019m already heading for my car without waiting for a reply.</p><p>My phone buzzes. I\u2019m in bed. You have to come to me.</p><p>I shake my head, knowing that\u2019s not a problem.I need to blow off some steam. Jess Cullen, the cross-country captain, and I have a friends with benefits thing going, and I love her to pieces. Not love her, love her, but I respect her, and she\u2019s a good girl.</p><p>I punch in a reply. Be there in ten.</p><p>See you soon. I left and never entered the theater room again. Not until tonight. Many times I even entertained the idea of hosting a bonfire for that f**king couch that\u2019d now been ruined by that woman\u2019s sleaze. But after that night, she took a lengthy vacation, and I didn\u2019t see her until yesterday morning when she threatened to take Fallon away from me.</p><p>When I\u2019d seen Fallon\u2019s note tonight, instead of getting excited like I\u2019m sure she wanted me to, I\u2019d groaned. I didn\u2019t want to be in there, and I for damn sure didn\u2019t want her in there.</p><p>Who knew how she\u2019d react if I told her the truth? It certainly wasn\u2019t important, but I didn\u2019t want to risk something else f**king with our happiness again.</p><p>Carrying her up to bed that night, I leaned in and kissed her hair. Fallon, like me, had seen her parents living exactly how she didn\u2019t want. Lucky for us, our vicarious experience felt like we\u2019d already made our parents\u2019 mistakes. We knew what we wanted now.</p><p>Even though I knew she was strong, it didn\u2019t stop me from wanting to protect her and give her everything.</p><p>No one and nothing would stop us.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>During the next couple of days, Fallon and I started getting things sorted out in Chicago. She went to class, while I handled the paperwork of withdrawing from one school and transferring to another. At night, if she wasn\u2019t doing homework, we got online to look for apartments.</p><p>Fallon had been trying to contact her father to tell him about our marriage, but when she contacted one of his men, he\u2019d said that Ciaran was \u201cunreachable\u201d at the moment.</p><p>Which meant he was being detained for questioning, probably. No one was \u201cunreachable\u201d in the twenty-first century, unless their cell phone had been confiscated.</p><p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d she spoke to one of her father\u2019s men on the phone, \u201cif I don\u2019t hear from my father by tomorrow, I\u2019m going to the police myself. I, at least, need to know he\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>It was Thursday night, and she was sitting on the couch in Jared\u2019s apartment, while Tate and I had just gotten back from a run. Fallon normally joined us, but she\u2019d opted to stay in and make her calls.</p><p>Jared was still at ROTC training, and he\u2019d been gracious enough to let Fallon and me have the extra space in the loft of his apartment this week.</p><p>\u201cShower?\u201d I asked Fallon as I tore off my sweaty T-shirt.</p><p>She held up a finger for me to wait, still talking on the phone.</p><p>Tate was still breathing hard as she walked into the living room and grabbed her phone.</p><p>\u201cJared\u2019s mom called,\u201d she said more to herself.</p><p>After pushing some buttons, she held the phone to her ear, calling Katherine back, I would assume.</p><p>I walked into the kitchen, grabbing a Gatorade out of the fridge as they had their conversations. Jared walked in, slamming the door and just as sweaty as Tate and me.</p><p>\u201cToss me one of those,\u201d he said, gesturing to the Gatorade in my hand and using the bottom of his T-shirt to wipe the sweat off his face.</p><p>Throwing him mine, I snatched another one out of the refrigerator, and we were silent for a few minutes, drinking and catching our breaths.</p><p>\u201cThis shit\u2019s for the birds,\u201d he grumbled, yanking his shirt by the back of his neck and pulling it over his head.</p><p>Yeah, my throat itched with laughter.</p><p>Jared in the Army\u2014or whatever branch he was choosing\u2014was still weird to me.</p><p>Jared as part of a team. Jared following orders. Jared pressed and dressed in a uniform. Jared as a leader? For the good of mankind? I still shook my head at the idea.</p><p>\u201cSo get out,\u201d I told him. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of stuff you could do with your life. Stuff you\u2019d be good at.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me like I had three eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about ROTC. I\u2019m talking about Tate. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>I tipped my head around him, watching her on the phone. It was October, and she was running in short shorts and a tank top. Probably to tease him.</p><p>I smiled. I liked Tate a lot. There was even a time when I wanted her. But she was like a sister now.</p><p>The kind of sister I wouldn\u2019t screw, I mean.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cShe\u2019s driving me nuts, that\u2019s what. She wears stuff like that to turn me on, and it\u2019s working. I\u2019m actually Googling \u2018ballroom dancing\u2019 to find out if it\u2019s really that bad.\u201d He looked at me, wincing. \u201cI\u2019m caving.\u201d</p><p>I threw my head back, laughing. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to cry,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cWell, would you do it?\u201d It sounded like an accusation.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHow long have you known me, dude? There\u2019s not a lot I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>He blinked long and hard, knowing that that was true and then turned his head to watch Tate, probably daydreaming about all the things he was missing out on.</p><p>Fallon hung up and walked over, smiling as I put my arm around her.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cFor now.\u201d And then she scrunched up her nose. \u201cYou need a shower.\u201d</p><p>I shot a look to Jared. \u201cCan we have the bathroom first?\u201d</p><p>His fist tightened around the Gatorade, and I felt sorry for him. He probably wanted to do the same with Tate, and he was hurting.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tate called. \u201cWe need to pull together for this, so listen up.\u201d</p><p>All heads turned to her as she walked up to the bar in the kitchen.</p><p>She arched an eyebrow in Jared\u2019s direction but withheld eye contact, and I had to fold my lips between my teeth to stifle a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYour dad.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cAnd your mom.\u201d She finally looked at Jared. \u201cAre going to your family\u2019s charity function tomorrow.\u201d She then looked between Fallon and me, talking about our parents\u2019 Triumph Charity for Disabled Children.</p><p>I absorbed what she said, surprised but not uncomfortable by the news.</p><p>My dad and Katherine were appearing as a couple at his and his wife\u2019s charity function.</p><p>That would be awkward for some people. Not me, though.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she continued. \u201cKatherine has invited us to attend, but I think it\u2019s more for moral support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you that?\u201d Jared asked, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I just got the impression. It\u2019s her first public appearance with your dad\u201d\u2014Tate looked to me\u2014\u201cand his wife and her friends will be there.\u201d Her eyes snapped to Fallon, an apology in them. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be talk. We have a family table, so all of us will be seated together for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my chin at Tate. \u201cIs Jax going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said he\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d Tate picked up her bag off the barstool. \u201cMeet you after your noon class tomorrow, and we\u2019ll go shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Tate looked up to me, ordering, \u201cAnd you two get tuxes.\u201d She referred to Jared as well but didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>She swung the strap of her bag over her head to rest at her hip and grabbed her jacket, walking to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jared snapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBack to the dorm,\u201d she barked, rounding the wall leading to the door. Fallon and I couldn\u2019t see her, but Jared shot her a death glare.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019ve changed your mind about dancing,\u201d she singsonged, taunting him.</p><p>He scowled but then his eyes widened, and he shot out of the chair. \u201cDid you just flash me?\u201d</p><p>We heard the door open and slam shut, and he left, chasing after her.</p> <p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>FALLON</p><p>On the drive I held my hands in my lap, clenching my fists so hard that my nails were digging into my palm. My body was strung tight, and I could feel my pulse throbbing in my neck.</p><p>Son of a bitch. I did not want to see that woman tonight.</p><p>Or any night.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Madoc asked as he drove up to the valet at the Lennox House, the usual venue for the annual Triumph Charity Event.</p><p>Hitting Send, I stuffed my phone back into my bag. \u201cTexting my dad to let him know where I\u2019m at in case he\u2019s able to get in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about him.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d I smirked at Madoc, trying to hide my concern. \u201cMy dad still might kill you.\u201d</p><p>I caught the little smile on his lips before he climbed out of the car. Coming around to my side, he opened my door and then tossed his keys to the attendant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to kill me.\u201d He kissed me on the forehead and then turned to nod at Jared helping Tate out of his car behind us.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOf course. Everyone loves me.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, we do.</p><p>Placing my hand on the inside of his elbow, we walked into the large ballroom, followed by Jared and Tate. Both Madoc and Jared wore black wool suits with crisp white shirts and black silk ties. Madoc had a deep purple handkerchief, and Jared had nothing. Their shoes shined, their hair was adorably messy, and they were hard not to look at.</p><p>Judging from the ladies turning heads when we walked in, I\u2019m guessing they weren\u2019t ogling Tate and me.</p><p>Well, maybe. We looked pretty good, too. We\u2019d both decided to stick with black, opting for cute little cocktail dresses.</p><p>She wore a sleeveless black dress with a sheer overlay that fell to mid-thigh and flared out just a little from the waist down. It shined with horizontal, black, silk striping and showed off her great legs and arms. Her sunshine hair was curled and then pulled over into a side ponytail at the bottom of her neck.</p><p>I\u2019d also opted for a sleeveless dress but with more of a draping effect. The boatneck strap circled my neck and drew together down low in the back. It was bunched up at the left side of my waist and was held with a gold jewelry piece. My hair was styled with big curls, but I had thrown it over my shoulder, so I could feel Madoc\u2019s hand on my back.</p> <p>And while Tate and I wore strappy black heels, we still fell inches below our men.</p><p>I inhaled the fragrance of flowers in the air. My mother loved events like this, even if she was only in it for the prestige.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is going to be fun.\u201d I heard Jared\u2019s sarcastic sigh behind me. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mom at? And my brother?\u201d</p><p>No one said anything as we surveyed the enormous ballroom, looking for Jason, Katherine, and Jax.</p><p>The room was crowded already. Filled with the happy sounds of chatter, laughter, and music, the room was dressed in white draperies, white lights, and white flowers everywhere. The shiny windows around the room let the moonlight spill in, adding to the soft glow in the room. Not overly bright, but not too dark.</p><p>The stage, also decorated in white, featured a podium and a band playing some peppy covers. The dance floor was already fairly busy with three to four dozen couples dressed in their finest and smiling among their glittering jewels. Around the dance floor sat dozens of round tables adorned with white linens, candles, and the finest crystal.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tate started. \u201cWe\u2019ll circulate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d A voice I knew too well confronted us, and my back stiffened.</p><p>Turning around, I arched an eyebrow at my mother who approached us with a glass of champagne in one hand and a very young escort in the other.</p><p>Someone that young and handsome\u2014who looked like he followed orders\u2014had to be an escort.</p><p>She wore a floor-length black evening gown with a black lace overlay and cap sleeves. Her blond hair was in a chic, tight updo, and her makeup was stunning. She looked about eight years younger than she was.</p><p>Coming around in front of us, she looked at us with mock concern. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. I don\u2019t remember sending any of you an invitation. But . . .\u201d She peered behind me, probably ogling Jared, but I was too disgusted to find out. \u201cYou are all most welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t invite us to my family\u2019s functions, Patricia,\u201d Madoc spoke low and threatening. \u201cAnd Fallon has more of a right to be here than you do. You\u2019re on your way out of the family, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d She tipped her chin at us, smiling. \u201cI forgot about your marriage. Congratulations.\u201d Her eyes dropped to my hand, and her jeering expression made me want to punch her.</p><p>\u201cI see you got the family ring,\u201d she observed, taking another sip of her champagne. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a comfort to you when you\u2019re alone at night, and he\u2019s off screwing someone else. He probably already is. Didn\u2019t take his father long after our marriage.\u201d</p><p>Madoc stepped forward, but I yanked him back. \u201cNo,\u201d I warned. \u201cShe\u2019s grasping at straws. Let her spew her words.\u201d And then I looked at my mom. \u201cThey\u2019re all she has, after all.\u201d</p><p>Her face tightened, and her eyebrow shot up. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. It may be one year or five, but you will see.\u201d</p><p>She spun around with her fancily dressed and enormously quiet boy toy and walked off.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Tate laughed the kind of laugh where the only other option is to cry. I understood the feeling.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I nodded and let go of Madoc\u2019s arm. I couldn\u2019t hold on to him like a security blanket all night. \u201cI should\u2019ve hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve,\u201d Tate deadpanned.</p><p>Jared and Madoc snorted at the same time, and Tate looked down, smiling to herself. I got the impression that there was a joke I wasn\u2019t getting.</p><p>She smirked at me, seeing my confusion. \u201cViolence never solves anything, but\u201d\u2014she paused\u2014\u201cit can get people\u2019s attention. Sometimes\u2014and I stress sometimes\u2014violence is the only thing some people respect. Take Madoc for example. I broke his nose and kicked him in the balls. He finally understood me.\u201d</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I looked between Madoc and Tate. Jared rolled his eyes when I looked to him for explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her about us, Mr. Can\u2019t-Keep-His-Hands-to-Himself?\u201d Her expectant eyes on Madoc made him blush.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, Tate.\u201d He looked away like he had a bad taste in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll have to explain that now.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, not sure I liked the sound of where this was going.</p><p>But Jared seemed to read my mind.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, Fallon,\u201d he comforted. \u201cMadoc was only trying to get Tate and me together. He just thinks the end justifies the means is all.\u201d</p><p>Yep, lawyer material, I laughed to myself.</p><p>We finally found Katherine and Madoc\u2019s dad, and we spent the next hour either hanging close or on the dance floor. Katherine looked stunning in a deep red evening gown, much in the same style as mine, except hers fell to the floor. Her espresso brown hair hung down and looked beautiful next to the rich color of the dress. While we were certain she needed moral support\u2014what with these people knowing she was Jason\u2019s mistress\u2014it apparently was just fear on her part. Everything seemed fine, actually.</p><p>I realized that even though my mother\u2019s friends were the wives of Jason\u2019s colleagues, and they may be on my mother\u2019s side, they also knew what side their bread was buttered on. Their husbands followed Jason, and they followed their husbands.</p><p>\u201cDid you text Jax?\u201d Jared asked Madoc as we lingered around the bar. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering me.\u201d</p><p>Madoc took out his phone, looking through his messages. \u201cYeah, I texted twice. I\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, starting to look worried.</p><p>Madoc pulled me into his side. \u201cI\u2019m going to the men\u2019s room. Want to come?\u201d he asked, waggling his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm.\u201d I put my finger to my chin, thinking. \u201cMadoc Caruthers Caught Bending Stepsister over Bathroom Counter. Jason Caruthers Shamed in Front of All of Chicago,\u201d I read the mock headline, smiling.</p><p>He slapped me on the butt and walked away backward, mouthing, \u201cYou\u2019re so hot.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and disappeared down the hallway, while Jared took Tate out onto the dance floor. I smiled after them, thankful Madoc wasn\u2019t so inhibited about dancing. They kind of just did the hold-each-other-and-sway-from-side-to-side thing, but it was cute that he was trying.</p><p>I stood around the bar waiting for Madoc, but after about five minutes he still wasn\u2019t back. I tensed the muscles in my thighs, trying to ignore the proposal he\u2019d made for me to join him.</p><p>Taking out my phone, I noticed that Jax still hadn\u2019t texted me back, either. It was strange for him to be out of touch. Where was he?</p><p>I made my way through the small groups of people and stepped softly, afraid of tripping in my heels. When I made it into the much quieter hallway, I dialed his number and held the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHow badly do you want it?\u201d I heard my mother\u2019s taunting voice coming from the men\u2019s room, and I looked over to the swinging door. She spoke in the soft, sultry kind of voice that only means one thing.</p><p>I walked over and opened it just enough to peer inside. She and Madoc were standing there, and I winced at the sight of her leaned against the wall with her dress pulled up high on her thighs. He just stood there. Watching her.</p><p>Why the f**k was he watching her?</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his forehead. \u201cYou really are something else, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a room at the Four Seasons, Madoc. Think about how good it would feel. One night with me, and you\u2019ll get what you want. I\u2019ll let go of the house. You wanted me that night, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That night? What happened between them? I could barely make out what they were saying, the thunder in my ears so loud that my eyes were watering.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he shot back, washing his hands. \u201cI wanted you so much that I ran and screwed someone else right after I left you in the theater room.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God. I clenched my fists, drawing breaths in and out faster and faster. My face in its anger couldn\u2019t get any more tightened. My feet were anchored to the f**king floor.</p><p>What the hell? I slammed my fist into the door, sending it swinging so hard that it hit the wall behind it. Both of them spun around to face me where I stayed rooted to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cFallon!\u201d My mother made a big show of fixing herself. Putting her hand to her chest, she looked at me with sympathetic eyes.</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d Madoc held up his hand and shook his head as if he was trying to stop my thoughts in their tracks. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s nothing, okay. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, honey,\u201d my mother started. \u201cMadoc doesn\u2019t care about you. He and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no you and me!\u201d he bellowed, turning his head and killing her with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell her, then.\u201d She pushed off the wall, face even and voice calm. \u201cTell her about the theater room, you kissing me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Madoc walked over to me, looking like he was in pain. \u201cFallon, look into my eyes.\u201d</p><p>What? I dropped my eyes to the ground, trying to make sense of this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsk him.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice drifted from somewhere behind us. \u201cI told you he can\u2019t be trusted, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, starting to feel my feet melt into the floor.</p><p>\u201cFallon, nothing ever happened!\u201d someone said. \u201cI never touched her. She kissed me . . .\u201d</p><p>I hated turning corners. Closed doors.</p> <p>I could still hear them talking, but I had no idea what they were saying. My feet were gone. My legs up to my knees had faded away, and I couldn\u2019t feel anything when I tried to tense my muscles.</p><p>Your life doesn\u2019t interest me, Fallon.</p><p>You know what I used to call you? Pussy-on-the-Premises.</p><p>I sucked in quick breaths, but they left me slowly as if my body might not have the strength to take in air again. In quick. Out slow. In quick. Out slow.</p><p>How could he do this? How could she?</p> <p>You\u2019re just a slut like your mother. Madoc\u2019s words hadn\u2019t cut before, because I knew they weren\u2019t true. Why did I feel pain from them now?</p><p>Did you really think he loved you? He used you!</p><p>I squeezed my eyes closed even tighter and swallowed. Swallow it down. Swallow it down.</p><p>I heard my name. Madoc. He was saying my name.</p><p>\u201cFallon! Look at me!\u201d</p><p>Open your eyes! What do you see?</p> <p>My eyes snapped open, and I saw Madoc standing in front of me. His eyes were watery, and he was squeezing my shoulders.</p><p>Who are you? My father\u2019s smooth, Irish voice washed over me. Who are you?</p><p>I tightened my fists again and again, blinking as Madoc kissed my forehead.</p><p>I don\u2019t try to kill your demons. I run with them.</p><p>That\u2019s what makes Madoc a good kid, Fallon. He picks up the pieces.</p><p>I felt his hands on my face, his thumbs stroking circles on my cheeks.</p><p>He picks up the pieces.</p><p>Make that threat again. I will put you through a wall to get to her.</p> <p>Finish up, Father. She needs to be kissed.</p><p>Madoc.</p><p>My heart swelled. He was mine. He was always mine.</p><p>Madoc. My Madoc.</p><p>I looked into his eyes, seeing the love, the worry, the fear . . .</p><p>And I held him in my gaze, filling my lungs with air.</p><p>\u201cNothing that happens on the surface of the sea can alter the calm of its depths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon, please,\u201d Madoc begged. \u201cListen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I finally uttered, dropping my hands and tilting my chin up. \u201cStop talking,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>I walked around him and slowly\u2014very slowly\u2014approached my mother with my hands folded in front of me.</p><p>I kept my expression flat and my tone low as I dove into her space, sucking the oxygen up around her. \u201cLawyer up,\u201d I threatened. \u201cMadoc and I want the house, and it is very lonely in your corner, Mother.\u201d Leaning into her face, I barely unclenched my teeth. \u201cStand against me. And. You. Will. Lose.\u201d</p><p>I spun around before she even had time to react and sauntered out of the bathroom, grabbing Madoc\u2019s hand on the way.</p><p>\u201cFallon, let me explain. Nothing ever happened. She came onto me, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I halted in the hallway and turned to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to hear it. I don\u2019t need any reassurances where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>Taking his face in my hands, I took his lips that captivated my entire body the moment they touched. Madoc had me body and soul, and no one could stop us. Least of all my beast of a mother.</p><p>I certainly didn\u2019t give her the reaming she deserved, but it wouldn\u2019t have done anyone any good. I would\u2019ve wasted my breath. The only things that woman respected were money and power, and I just threatened her with both.</p><p>Any more of my attention, and it would be at my cost.</p><p>Never. Again. Madoc and I have a life to live.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered into his lips.</p><p>He let his forehead fall to mine as he sighed. \u201cThank God. You had me scared.\u201d</p><p>I heard someone clear his throat, and I twisted my head, only to have my heart jump into my throat.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I gasped and pulled free of Madoc to nearly knock my father over with a hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, little girl,\u201d he said, grunting from the impact.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked, pulling back to get a good look at him.</p><p>His light brown hair was slicked back, and his face\u2014usually clean shaven\u2014was scruffy as hell with his usual patches of gray showing. He was wearing a black Armani suit, favoring the necktie like Jared and Madoc instead of the bowties everyone else wore.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He nodded, rubbing my arms. \u201cSorry that I worried you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to ask him questions, but I knew this wasn\u2019t the time or place, and he generally didn\u2019t tell me much, anyway. He trusted me, but I think he thought it was better that his daughter not know about his seedy business, as if I didn\u2019t pick up things on my own anyway.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m Madoc.\u201d My husband reached his hand out. \u201cIn case you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>They had only met once, that I know of. But my father would definitely remember him. Especially after everything that had happened.</p><p>He hesitated only a moment and then took Madoc\u2019s hand. \u201cI remember. And I know everything.\u201d His look was a warning. \u201cThis is the wrong place to talk about this, and there are things I want to say to both of you, but for now, I\u2019ll just say this.\u201d He narrowed his eyes on Madoc. \u201cYou are aware of the burden of this marriage, right?\u201d</p><p>Madoc grinned down at me. \u201cFallon\u2019s not a burden, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Fallon,\u201d my dad shot out. \u201cI\u2019m talking about me. You do not want me as a pissed-off father-in-law. It would be safer for you if my child stays happy. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Awkward.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Madoc asserted, looking my father in the eye.</p><p>I smiled at both of them. \u201cI\u2019m already happy.\u201d</p><p>I could tell it was hard for my father. He\u2019d barely had me growing up, always contending with my mother and his risky business. Neither let him be the dad he wanted to be, but those were his choices, and I wasn\u2019t going to feel sorry for him. I loved him. But I chose Madoc. And I would choose Madoc forever.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d My father kissed me on the cheek. \u201cBut please tell me you were married by a priest.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snorted, and I told my father all about it as we walked to the table.</p><p>By the time we got there, we saw that everyone else was seated. Jared and Tate together, an empty seat for Jax next to Jared, then Katherine and Jason, followed by three empty seats for Madoc, my mother and me.</p><p>But there\u2019s no way in hell she was sitting at this table, so I sat my father down, and Madoc and I took the two remaining seats.</p><p>I made introductions for my father to Tate, Jared, and Katherine. But Jason didn\u2019t wait for me when it was his turn.</p><p>\u201cCiaran.\u201d He nodded, placing a napkin in his lap.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d my father responded.</p><p>And that was about as much as they talked. Jason defended guys like my father, but he didn\u2019t necessarily want to be seen hobnobbing with them, either.</p><p>And he definitely feared for his son being attached to the Pierces.</p><p>I was loyal to my father, but I understood where Jason was coming from.</p><p>Waiters started coming out with trays of the first course, and everyone started relaxing more. Katherine and Jared were talking, probably still wondering where the hell Jax was, and Tate relayed to my father and me the story of how Madoc asked her to Homecoming senior year. With totally unromantic motives, I was assured.</p><p>If not, I may have had to stop their runs together.</p><p>The band hummed with a soft jazz tune, and since the appetizers were circulated while everyone socialized and danced, the seven-course meal started off by moving right into the soup. An excellent creamy white asparagus soup was served, and although it was good, I still couldn\u2019t believe people paid ten thousand a plate to get in here tonight. Well, not per plate exactly. Per meal. But that\u2019s high society charity, I guess.</p><p>\u201cI hope everyone\u2019s enjoying the evening.\u201d</p><p>My mother came up behind us, and I warmed at the feel of Madoc\u2019s hand at my back.</p><p>\u201cCiaran, Katherine,\u201d she greeted. \u201cCertainly not the crowd I anticipated this evening. You\u2019ve got some nerve.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see my mother. And I wasn\u2019t going to look at her, either.</p><p>But I saw Katherine\u2019s eyes widen and then drop. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Jason intervened. \u201cI notified you that I\u2019d be bringing Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whore is sitting in my seat.\u201d</p><p>Jared shot out of his chair, nearly knocking it over as it rocked on its legs. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand up and control that bitch,\u201d he warned Madoc\u2019s dad, \u201cthen I\u2019m taking my mother out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jason stood, trying to squelch the situation. \u201cNo one\u2019s leaving. Patricia. You\u2019re making a scene. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop? But I\u2019m already out.\u201d She crossed her arms, her small bag dangling from her wrist. \u201cWhy would I care about making a scene? In fact, I\u2019m just getting started. I may lose this battle in court, but your slut will sink down into the mud in front of everyone. I haven\u2019t even started.\u201d</p><p>Just then, two cell phone ringers sounded, and everyone pulled their attention off Jason and Patricia.</p><p>Unsure whose phones were going off, everyone reached for theirs.</p><p>But then a few more ringers went off until we were all getting messages.</p><p>I heard Tate groan, \u201cThis can\u2019t be good,\u201d and I wondered what was going on.</p><p>Jason arched a brow at my mom before he paused their argument to check his phone as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d Madoc let out, looking at his phone. \u201cIs that Jax?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused, so I hurriedly opened up my messages, and my goddamn eyes just about popped out of my head.</p><p>My father leaned over to see, and I tucked the phone to my chest in horror. Looking around the table, I saw everyone frozen, each with a different emotion plastered on their faces as they watched the video.</p><p>Jared. Angry.</p><p>Tate. Disgusted.</p><p>Katherine. Hurt.</p><p>Jason. Dismayed.</p><p>Patricia. Dread.</p><p>Madoc. Disturbed.</p><p>\u201cFallon,\u201d he breathed. \u201cIs that Jax with your mom?\u201d</p><p>I slowly brought my phone away from my chest and looked at it again. It was unmistakable. Jax sitting on a bed. His ponytail hanging down his back. My mother on top of him. The camera cut and got to the part with her climbing off of him and walking into the bathroom. He threw a white sheet around his waist and walked up to the camera.</p><p>Not a single person breathed at the table.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled at us. \u201cI\u2019m Jaxon Trent. And I\u2019m seventeen.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone. The video went black, and every heartbeat at the table was probably rushing as quickly as mine.</p><p>All eyes started shifting to my mom who stood there, still staring at the phone she held up with a shaking hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, everyone.\u201d</p><p>We all jumped. Jax walked up to the table and pulled out his chair.</p><p>He was dressed just like Jared, minus the tie. His hair was braided in three rows above each ear and brought back to his usual ponytail at the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d my mother whimpered. She looked about ready to cry or die.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he ordered, gripping the back of the chair. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and I could hear her heavy breathing. Was she thinking of running?</p><p>Jax held up his phone. \u201cThis video is ready to go out to everyone in this room. Sit. Down.\u201d His growl was deep, and like I\u2019d never heard from him before.</p><p>My mother walked as if in a daze to the chair and sat very softly, not looking down but not looking at anyone, either.</p><p>\u201cJason. The papers?\u201d Jax held out his hand.</p><p>Jason had one hand on the back of Katherine\u2019s chair. \u201cThat was you that texted me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you to trust me,\u201d he said with a cocky tone.</p><p>Jason reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and withdrew what looked like legal papers.</p><p>\u201cSit down, everyone,\u201d Jax commanded. \u201cYou\u2019re drawing attention.\u201d</p><p>Only Madoc\u2019s dad and Jared were standing, but they didn\u2019t take their eyes off of him as they lowered themselves into their chairs.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know why any of us weren\u2019t saying anything. No one asked questions. No one voiced concerns. We just all shut up, watching Jax take control of the table.</p><p>\u201cJaxon?\u201d Katherine piped up, panic wafting off of her like perfume. \u201cHow could you have done this?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with innocence. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here.\u201d</p><p>And then the corner of his mouth turned up, and he set the papers down in front of my mother with a pen that he retrieved from his jacket.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your revised divorce agreement,\u201d he said, leaning over my mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cA nice amount of cash, no house, and no alimony. Sign,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he interrupted her. \u201cDon\u2019t issue empty threats now. That\u2019s my mom for all intents and purposes.\u201d He pointed to Katherine. \u201cAnd you\u2019re f**king with her happiness. That ends now.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, my eyes burning from watching the scene in awe.</p><p>Jax reminded me of my father in demeanor. Controlled and smooth. My dad always knew the score when he walked into a room, he was always prepared, and he didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>When my mother didn\u2019t budge, Jax held his phone out in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou do not want this video leaving this table. Did you know that the state can press charges even if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips pursed in anger, and she looked from side to side as if there was a way out somewhere. But she knew better. She picked up the pen and signed where the tabs indicated.</p><p>\u201cAnd here.\u201d Jax turned the page, pointing.</p><p>\u201cAnd here,\u201d he said, flipping another page.</p><p>In all of two seconds, he\u2019d snatched the pen back, folded the paperwork, and stood up.</p><p>He looked to Jason. \u201cThe check?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jason and almost laughed when he actually shook his head for about a second as if to figure out if that had really just happened.</p><p>Taking an envelope out of the inside of his jacket, he handed it to Jax.</p><p>Jax handed what I would assume was her settlement money to my mom and smiled his bright, white smile. \u201cCongrats. You\u2019re divorced.\u201d And looking back at Jason. \u201cNow, the house?\u201d</p> <p>Jason tossed him more papers to which Jax threw the folded bit across the table to us.</p><p>\u201cHomeowners.\u201d He nodded. \u201cIs everyone happy?\u201d</p><p>Madoc and I opened up the packet, and I covered my mouth with my hand, seeing that it was the deed to the house.</p><p>In our names.</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d I barely whispered, my throat too tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the video?\u201d My mother was more scared than I\u2019d ever seen her. She was practically shaking as she looked up at him.</p><p>He leaned down into her face, speaking to her like she was a child. \u201cYour only concern right now is never pissing me off again. You behave, and so will I.\u201d</p><p>He took the payoff check off the table, shoved it into her chest, and stood up. \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>Clutching the envelope, she didn\u2019t even look back at me as she walked out of the ballroom. I felt Madoc squeeze my left hand, and my father took my right.</p><p>My husband.</p><p>My home.</p><p>And I looked around the table . . . my family.</p><p>My chest shook with silent hysterical laughter.</p><p>\u201cThis is so surreal.\u201d Jason wiped his hand over his face as the waiters started clearing the bowls. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I should feel about all of this,\u201d he mumbled as he stood back up and held out his hand. \u201cJaxon, thank you. I don\u2019t know what to . . .\u201d</p><p>Jax swung and clocked Madoc\u2019s dad right across the jaw, sending him reeling to the ground as everyone straightened in their chair and Katherine yelped.</p><p>Silverware clattered and all conversation in the room stopped. Everyone that hadn\u2019t realized what was happening at our table saw us now.</p><p>Jason lay on his back, head up off the ground and holding his jaw.</p><p>\u201cJaxon!\u201d Katherine screeched, jumping out of her chair along with Jared and Madoc.</p><p>Jax stood by her side, looking down on Madoc\u2019s dad. \u201cYou should\u2019ve married her years ago,\u201d he scolded.</p><p>He gave Katherine a peck on the cheek and turned, walking away.</p><p>Jared, Tate, Madoc, and I took no time leaving the table and running after him. Katherine was getting Jason seated back at the table, and the room was still filled with broken conversation.</p><p>\u201cJax, stop!\u201d Jared yelled.</p><p>He pulled to a stop in the foyer, turning around to face us. But I wasn\u2019t going to let Jared yell at him.</p><p>\u201cJax, thank you.\u201d I stepped in. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have put yourself in that situation for us.\u201d I held the deed with both hands to my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d He stuck his hands in his pockets, looking very much like the boy I knew and not the threatening presence he had proven himself to be.</p><p>I shook my head, tears welling. \u201cI would never want you to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Fallon,\u201d he cut me off. \u201cYou\u2019re happy, Katherine is happy, and that makes me happy.\u201d He took a deep breath and slapped Madoc on the arm. \u201cSee you tomorrow night for the race.\u201d</p><p>I saw him jerk his chin at Jared, and he and Tate followed Jax out of the room.</p><p>Madoc wrapped his big arms around me, and I looked up him through blurry eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re free,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He took my ass in his hands and lifted me off the ground, slipping his tongue past my lips and kissing me so hard that I had to hold on to his neck.</p><p>\u201cNo one stops us,\u201d he breathed huskily into my mouth.</p><p>No one.</p><p>A throat cleared, and I snapped my eyes open as Madoc set me back on the ground.</p><p>My father stood there, probably wishing he hadn\u2019t just seen that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading out,\u201d he told me.</p><p>Madoc let me go and cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll go check on my dad.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself and watched him walk away, giving my father and me some space.</p><p>I took my father in a hug, instantly cozy and reveling in the smell of leather and Ralph Lauren.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Shelburne Falls for the weekend, but I\u2019ll be back Monday. Will you be in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll call you for lunch. Both of you,\u201d he added.</p><p>I gave him a grateful smile as he started to walk away but then stopped. \u201cFallon?\u201d He turned back around. \u201cWho is that kid exactly?\u201d He gestured to Jax talking to Jared and Tate just outside the doors.</p><p>\u201cJaxon Trent. He\u2019s Madoc\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d he asked, still watching Jax.</p><p>Not much, unfortunately.</p><p>\u201cUm, well, he lives with his half brother\u2019s mother. Dad\u2019s in jail, and his real mom split a long time ago. He\u2019s in his last year of high school. Why?\u201d</p><p>He spoke low as if thinking out loud. \u201cHe\u2019s a very impressive young man.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>MADOC</p><p>\u201cSo what is the Loop exactly?\u201d Fallon pulled her baseball cap down over her eyes and lay her head back on the headrest.</p><p>\u201cTate didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a race,\u201d she yawned. \u201cBut is it a real track or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come tonight. I know you\u2019re beat.\u201d I leaned over and rubbed her leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She tried to sound peppy, even with her eyes closed.</p><p>She certainly hadn\u2019t had it easy this week. Aside from the nonstop fun last night of dealing with her mother, her father, and then Jax showing up, she\u2019d gotten married this week and between studying and me keeping her up half the night, her body was crashing. Hard.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t gotten to bed until three this morning, and then we woke up early to look at an apartment before driving back to Shelburne Falls. When we got here, we started reorganizing my bedroom to make space for her and her things here.</p><p>Even though we liked Chicago, we loved it here more. This is where we\u2019d raise our kids.</p><p>Not that I\u2019d talked to her about that yet, but she was getting knocked up as soon as college was over.</p><p>She\u2019d agree, of course. No one could say no to me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d I announced, pulling to the end of the driveway that came up on the Loop. The rounded-square track split to the left and right ahead of us, and I turned off to the right, pulling off the side and backing into a space in the grass.</p><p>My blood rushed through my body like running rapids, filling me with energy so fast I felt high.</p><p>Damn, it felt good to be back here.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t admit it to anyone, but I was a little apprehensive about the new crop of drivers coming in this school year. While college kids like Jared, Tate, and I came back once in a while, this was mostly a high school scene.</p><p>But getting out of the car, I already saw at least ten people I knew, so I was home. Jared and Tate were already in place up on the track and had a crowd of people around them, including K.C., who must\u2019ve come back from her school in Arizona for the weekend.</p><p>Looking around, I also spotted her boyfriend, Liam, and some of Jared\u2019s and my friends that had stayed close to home as well this year.</p><p>Jax hung back, sitting on the hood of his car with his headphones on and staring into the crowd. He never raced. Although he came to the events, I got the impression that it bored him, even though I suggested that actually racing was a hell of a lot more fun than watching. He said he was working on something new for the Loop, but he wouldn\u2019t tell us what. Knowing him, I was afraid to ask.</p><p>Fallon climbed out of my GTO, and I took her hand, pulling her up onto the track. We made our way through the thick crowd, ignoring calls and congratulations on our marriage. I knew they were all laughing behind my back.</p><p>Madoc got married? Yeah, right.</p><p>I took a page from my father. Don\u2019t give them attention, and they won\u2019t give us attention. Only those close to Fallon and me understood, and we were not explaining ourselves to others. I\u2019m sure most of them thought I\u2019d gotten her pregnant.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d I greeted Jared, who turned away from Sam, grinning. He had Disturbed\u2019s \u201cInside the Fire\u201d blasting out of his car stereo, and it felt like old times.</p><p>Fallon went and talked to Tate, who stood leaning against her car, talking to K.C.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d I observed flatly, eyeing Jared. \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his hands into the front pocket of his black hoodie and shrugged. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be smiling? Even if I lose\u2014which is a huge if\u2014Tate will stop with her antics, and I can stop sleeping alone. It\u2019s her birthday tomorrow and our anniversary. I\u2019ve got plans.\u201d</p><p>I laughed to myself, shaking my head. \u201cI really wanted to see you ballroom dance.\u201d I narrowed my eyes, thinking. \u201cIn fact . . .\u201d</p><p>I twisted my head to see Tate, Fallon, and K.C. chatting. \u201cTate!\u201d I called. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She shot me an annoyed look and walked over, followed by the other two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m riding shotgun,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWhyyyy?\u201d she drawled out.</p><p>\u201cJust in case you need advice. I want you to win.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at Jared, seeing his quirked eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI have raced before,\u201d Tate said as if I thought she was inexperienced. Her hair danced in the light wind and kept blowing into her face.</p><p>I wrapped my arm around Fallon\u2019s waist and brought her into my side. \u201cYou haven\u2019t raced Jared,\u201d I pointed out to Tate. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you. That\u2019s the end of it. Will you come?\u201d I looked to Fallon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Jared jumped in. \u201cYou take my chick, I\u2019m taking yours.\u201d He hooked the collar of Fallon\u2019s T-shirt and pulled her over to his side. \u201cBut not for help. She\u2019s a hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Fallon burst out. \u201cLike I want to be killed or seriously injured in an illegal racing ring, protected by shady law enforcement and a crowd of drunk teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I brushed it off. \u201cShe\u2019d be scared.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes stung like bullets. \u201cBite me,\u201d she barked, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFallon!\u201d Tate fumed. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d I looked down at Tate and took out my iPod from my coat pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ve got MC Hammer,\u201d I bragged to Jared and Fallon, motioning between Tate and me. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch this.\u201d</p><p>Tate immediately lost it. She doubled over, holding her stomach and laughing her ass off at my play on MC Hammer\u2019s song. \u201cYou are not putting that shit in my stereo!\u201d she choked out through her laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d I threatened.</p><p>But just then, we all straightened up. Zack the Racemaster came up between the two racers\u2014or teams\u2014and cleared his throat.</p> <p>Putting his hands around his mouth to form a circle, he bellowed into the night air, \u201cLet. The. Games. Begin!\u201d</p><p>Fallon and I smiled at each other.</p><p>And let them never end.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A crack of thunder exploded through the midnight sky, and I opened my eyes as it bellowed over the house. As it slowly traveled away, I blinked against the flashes of lightning coming through the window.</p><p>Flipping my head to the side, I saw Fallon still sleeping peacefully in her green T-shirt and panties. She\u2019d kicked her side of the blankets off, and that was one thing I\u2019d noticed we had in common. We both overheated when we slept.</p> <p>There were lots of quirks about her that I\u2019d found out, and I hoped mine didn\u2019t annoy her too much.</p><p>Her neck glowed with a thin layer of sweat, and her lips opened and closed barely enough to even notice. A slice of her stomach peeked out, and her innocent face looked absolutely beautiful.</p><p>Just looking at her, I felt myself harden with want. We\u2019d already attacked each other after the race. In fact, Jared and Tate and Fallon and I all came straight here after the race, skipping the bonfire altogether. They went to their room, and we came to ours.</p><p>She\u2019d slug me if I woke her up for sex, though. Not that I would. She was exhausted.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I threw off my blankets and got out of bed, pulling on my pajama pants and leaving as quickly as possible. The harder I got, the more I didn\u2019t want to be honorable.</p><p>So I left.</p><p>I went down to the basement, rubbing my thumb across my fingers the entire way. It\u2019d been months since I played, and I felt the hum in my hands. The cool keys under my fingertips.</p><p>Playing wasn\u2019t an obsession or something that I needed to do. I just appreciated having the skill to play, though. Everyone should have a way of expressing themselves, letting the stress out\u2014even if it was just sexual frustration for me right now.</p> <p>Pulling out the bench, I sat down at my family\u2019s completely restored 1921 Steinway grand piano and sifted through the music, picking a Dvor?\u00e1k piece.</p><p>Placing my fingers on the keys, I started playing the same notes I\u2019d been practicing off and on for years. I didn\u2019t change up my music a lot, preferring to master a piece before I moved on to something else, but as I got more comfortable with the music, I\u2019d find myself adding my own flavor. Speeding up, slowing down, softer, harder . . . A single composition can have so many meanings depending on the person playing.</p><p>I liked the freedom to explore and take risks.</p><p>The same could be said for Fallon\u2019s skateboarding. She enjoyed it but only so much as she was left alone to own it.</p><p>Cool skin touched my bare shoulders, and I straightened, taking my hands off the keys.</p><p>\u201cAddie said you came down here to play at night.\u201d Fallon set her chin on top of my head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just have the piano moved upstairs?\u201d</p><p>I reached up and took her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s something I would rather do alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I turned around and yanked her back to me, pulling her into my lap. \u201cI mean without my father around. I like to play. I just don\u2019t want to be forced.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against me, straddling my legs and facing the keys. \u201cIt was a sad tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best music is,\u201d I said into her ear. \u201cI\u2019m happy, though.\u201d</p><p>She ran a delicate hand over the keys, leaning her head back on my shoulder. \u201cI think we should do the dancing lessons with Jared and Tate. It would be fun.\u201d She inched up, kissing my jaw. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he lost.\u201d</p><p>My chest shook. \u201cHe threw that race. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did not,\u201d she maintained. \u201cTate was awesome. And . . .\u201d</p><p>I sunk my teeth into her neck, and she groaned, cutting off her own thought before it even got out. I sucked on her neck, my whole body twisting with need at the smell of her. Wrapping my arm around her stomach, I shifted my legs further apart. Since her thighs were outside of mine, she stretched wide. Keeping my mouth on her neck and my arm around her, I slipped my other hand inside of the front of her sleep shorts.</p><p>\u201cAlways ready for me,\u201d I breathed out, feeling how wet she was between her legs. I moved my mouth up the side of her face and over to her ear. The heat on my fingers shot right to my dick, and I circled her clit, feeling it get harder between my fingers.</p><p>She reached behind her and grabbed the back of my head. \u201cAfter we get back from hiking tomorrow,\u201d she started, breathing hard, \u201cwe should come home and try to get this piano moved up to the main floor again. Maybe get some of your friends over here to help.\u201d</p><p>Was she seriously trying to talk to me about this now? We were taking Lucas hiking tomorrow, and I didn\u2019t feel like thinking about anything else but her right at this moment.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t stop kissing her to answer, she pleaded, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>My hand around her waist slid up into her shirt. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d I snatched her lips in short, devouring kisses. \u201cYour half-pipe comes upstairs, too.\u201d</p><p>She started rolling her h*ps back onto me, and I closed my eyes with the wave that washed over me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Jason and Katherine will appreciate that thing in the living room.\u201d She sounded so weak. It was turning me on.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d I joked. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not their living room. This is our house, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they still live here.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. Nothing had changed in the living arrangements. Katherine was moving in after Jax graduated next spring. It was our house in name, though, so I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She was still rubbing herself slowly over my cock, and I slipped my fingers inside of her.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She gave in. \u201cHalf-pipe comes, too. Everyone will love that,\u201d she added sarcastically.</p><p>I took my hand out of her shorts and lifted her shirt. \u201cThis would be so much more fun for me if you were topless,\u201d I said, pulling it over her head with no resistance.</p><p>Reaching over and grabbing the insides of her thighs, I pulled her ass into me and nudged her upper body forward to lean over the keys.</p><p>Bending down, I swiped her hair to the side and dragged my tongue up her back, breaking every once in a while to sink my teeth in softly and kiss her.</p><p>God, I loved her. There was never anything or anyone I wanted more, and she was mine. When we were fourteen years old she came into my life on the heels of a cruel and self-serving woman, but I would do it all again. Every minute. Every ounce of pain. I would go through it all again to get to her.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d she whispered, tilting her face to the side. \u201cWhat does \u2018Fallen\u2019 mean? The tattoo on your back?\u201d</p><p>Questions.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say \u2018Fallen.\u2019\u201d I kissed a trail up her back, but she pushed herself up and turned her face to look at me, tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFallon?\u201d She pinched her eyebrows together in understanding.</p><p>I took her face in my hand, kissing the corner of her mouth. \u201cI got it a couple of years ago,\u201d I told her. \u201cI never forgot you. I never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed, and she reached her hand behind her to caress my cheek.</p><p>Then, looking at me again, she gave me a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>I dived in and kissed her hard. Damn right.</p>  </body></html>"]
