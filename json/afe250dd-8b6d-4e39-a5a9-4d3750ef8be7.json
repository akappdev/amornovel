It reminded me so much of the bicycle shop he had when I was a kid. Even the large display windows, shaded by a colorful striped awning, were the same. Outside my dad\u2019s shop, there were flower boxes full of red blossoms\u2014impatiens\u2014that spilled over beneath the large windows. That was Mom\u2019s contribution: impatiens in the spring and summer, chrysanthemums in the fall and shiny green mistletoe at Christmas. I plan to have flowers, too.</p><p>Dad\u2019s business grew steadily and he moved into increasingly larger premises, but I always loved his first store best. I must have astounded the rental agent who was showing me the property. She\u2019d barely unlocked the front door when I announced, \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face me, her expression blank as if she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard me correctly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to see the place? You do realize there\u2019s a small apartment above the shop that comes with it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you mentioned that earlier.\u201d The apartment worked perfectly for me. My cat, Whiskers, and I were in need of a home.</p><p>\u201cYou would like to see the place before you sign the papers, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she persisted.</p> <p>I smiled and nodded. But it wasn\u2019t really necessary; instinctively I knew this was the ideal location for my yarn shop. And for me.</p><p>The one drawback was that this Seattle neighborhood was undergoing extensive renovations and, because of the construction mess, Blossom Street was closed at one end, with only local traffic allowed. The brick building across the street, which had once been a three-story bank, was being transformed into high-end condos. Several other buildings, including an old warehouse, were also in the process of becoming condos. The architect had somehow managed to maintain the traditional feel of the original places, and that delighted me. Construction would continue for months, but it did mean that my rent was reasonable, at least for now.</p><p>I knew the first six months would be difficult. They are for any small business. The constant construction might create more obstacles than there otherwise would have been; nevertheless, I loved the space. It was everything I wanted.</p><p>Early Friday morning, a week after viewing the property, I signed my name, Lydia Hoffman, to the two-year lease. I was handed the keys and a copy of the rental agreement. I moved into my new home that very day, as excited as I can remember being about anything. I felt as if I was just starting my life and in more ways than I care to count, I actually was.</p><p>I opened A Good Yarn on the last Tuesday in April. I felt a sense of pride and anticipation as I stood in the middle of my store, surveying the colors that surrounded me. I could only imagine what my sister would say when she learned I\u2019d gone through with this. I hadn\u2019t asked her advice because I already knew what Margaret\u2019s response would be. She isn\u2019t\u2014to put it mildly\u2014the encouraging type.</p><p>I\u2019d found a carpenter who\u2019d built some cubicles for me, three rows of them, painted a pristine white. Most of the yarn had arrived on Friday and I\u2019d spent the weekend sorting it by weight and color and arranging it neatly in the cubicles. I\u2019d bought a secondhand cash register, refinished the counter and set up racks of knitting supplies. I was ready for business.</p> <p>This should have been a happy moment for me but instead, I found myself struggling to hold back tears. Dad would\u2019ve been so pleased if he could have seen what I\u2019d done. He\u2019d been my support and my source of strength, my guiding light. I was so shocked when he died.</p><p>You see, I\u2019d always assumed I would die before my father.</p><p>Most people find talk of death unsettling, but I\u2019ve lived with the threat of it for so long, it doesn\u2019t have that effect on me. The possibility of death has been my reality for the last fourteen years, and I\u2019m as comfortable talking about it as I am the weather.</p><p>My first bout with cancer came the summer I turned sixteen. I\u2019d gone to pick up my driver\u2019s license that day in August. I\u2019d successfully passed both the written and the driving tests. My mother let me drive from the licensing office to the optometrist. It was supposed to be a routine appointment\u2014I was having my eyes examined before the start of my junior year of high school. I had big plans for the day. As soon as I got home from the eye doctor\u2019s, Becky and I were going to drive to the beach. It would be the first time I\u2019d taken the car out by myself, and I was looking forward to driving without my mom or dad or my older sister.</p><p>I recall being upset that Mom had scheduled the eye appointment right after my driving test. I\u2019d been having some problems with headaches and dizzy spells, and Dad thought I might need reading glasses. The idea of showing up at Lincoln High School wearing glasses bothered me. A lot. I was hoping Mom and Dad would agree to let me wear contact lenses. As it turned out, impaired vision was the least of my worries.</p><p>The optometrist, who was a friend of my parents, seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time staring into the corner of my eye with this horribly bright light. He asked a lot of questions about my headaches. That was almost fifteen years ago, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget the look on his face as he talked to my mother. He was so serious, so somber...so concerned.</p><p>\u201cI want to make Lydia an appointment at the University of Washington. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>My mother and I were both stunned. \u201cAll right,\u201d my mother said, glancing from me to Dr. Reid and back again. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t like what I\u2019m seeing. I think it would be best if Dr. Wilson had a look.\u201d</p><p>Well, Dr. Wilson did more than look. He drilled into my skull and removed a malignant brain tumor. I say those words glibly now, but it wasn\u2019t a quick or simple procedure. It meant weeks in the hospital and blinding, debilitating headaches. After the surgery, I went through chemotherapy, followed by a series of radiation treatments. There were days when even the dimmest of lights caused such pain it was all I could do not to scream in agony. Days when I measured each breath, struggling to hold on to life because, try as I might, I could feel it slipping away. Still, there were many mornings I woke up and wished I would die because I couldn\u2019t bear another hour of this. Without my father I\u2019m convinced I would have.</p><p>My head was completely shaved and then, once my hair started to grow back, it fell out again. I missed my entire junior year and when I was finally able to return to high school, nothing was the same. Everyone looked at me differently. I didn\u2019t attend the Junior-Senior prom because no one asked me. Some girlfriends suggested I tag along with them, but out of false pride I refused. In retrospect it seems a trivial thing to worry about. I wish I\u2019d gone.</p><p>The saddest part of this story is that just when I was beginning to believe I could have a normal life\u2014just when I believed all those drugs, all that suffering had served a useful purpose\u2014the tumor grew back.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget the day Dr. Wilson told us the cancer had returned. But it\u2019s not the expression on his face that I remember. It\u2019s the pain in my father\u2019s eyes. He, above anyone, understood what I\u2019d endured during the first bout of treatment. My mother doesn\u2019t deal well with illness, and Dad was the one who\u2019d held me together emotionally. He knew there was nothing he could do, nothing he could say, that would lessen this second ordeal for me. I was twenty-four at the time and still in college, trying to accumulate enough credits to graduate. I never did get that degree.</p><p>I\u2019ve survived both bouts of cancer, and I\u2019m definitely not the carefree girl I once was. I appreciate and treasure every single day because I know how precious life is. Most people assume I\u2019m younger than thirty but they seem to find me more serious than other women my age. My experience with cancer means I don\u2019t take anything, least of all life itself, for granted. I no longer greet each day with careless acceptance. But I\u2019ve learned there are compensations for my suffering. I know I\u2019d be a completely different person if not for the cancer. My dad claimed I achieved a certain calm wisdom, and I suppose I have. Yet in many ways I\u2019m naive, especially when it comes to men and relationships.</p><p>Of all the compensations, the one I\u2019m most grateful for is that while undergoing treatment I learned to knit.</p><p>I may have survived cancer twice, but unfortunately my father didn\u2019t. My second tumor killed him. That\u2019s what my sister Margaret believes. She\u2019s never actually said so, but I know it\u2019s what she thinks. The truth is, I suspect she\u2019s probably right. It was a heart attack, but he aged so much after that second diagnosis I\u2019m sure it affected his health. I knew that if he could\u2019ve switched places with me, he would have done it gladly.</p><p>He was at my bedside as much as possible. That, in particular, is what Margaret can\u2019t seem to forgive or forget\u2014the time and devotion Dad gave me throughout this ordeal. Mom, too, as much as she was emotionally able.</p><p>Margaret was married and a mother of two before the second tumor was even discovered. Nevertheless, she seems to assume that she\u2019s somehow been cheated because of my cancer. To this day, she acts as if being sick was my choice, an option I preferred over a normal life.</p><p>It goes without saying that my sister and I have a strained relationship. For Mom\u2019s sake, especially now that Dad\u2019s gone, I try my best with Margaret. She doesn\u2019t make it easy. She can\u2019t hide her resentment, no matter how many years it\u2019s been.</p><p>Margaret was against my opening a yarn shop, but I sincerely doubt she would\u2019ve encouraged me in any undertaking. I swear, her eyes brightened at the prospect of seeing me fail. According to the statistics, most new businesses do go under\u2014usually within a year\u2014but I still felt I had to give the yarn shop a chance.</p><p>I had the funds. The money was actually an inheritance I received from my maternal grandmother who died when I was twelve. Dad invested it wisely and I had a small nest egg. I should have probably saved it for what Mom calls a \u201crainy day,\u201d but it\u2019s been raining every day since I turned sixteen and I was tired of holding on to it. Deep down, I know Dad would approve.</p><p>As I said, I learned to knit while undergoing chemotherapy. Over the years I\u2019ve become an accomplished knitter. Dad always joked that I had enough yarn to open my own store; recently I decided he was right.</p><p>I love to knit. There\u2019s a comfort to it that I can\u2019t entirely explain. The repetition of weaving the yarn around a needle and then forming a stitch creates a sense of purpose, of achievement, of progress. When your entire world is unraveling, you tend to crave order, and I found it in knitting. In fact, I\u2019ve even read that knitting can lower stress more effectively than meditation. And I guess for me it was a better approach, because there was something tangible to show for it. Maybe because knitting gave me a sense of action, of doing something. I didn\u2019t know what tomorrow held, but with a pair of needles in my hands and a ball of yarn in my lap, I was confident I could handle whatever lay ahead. Each stitch was an accomplishment. Some days all I could manage was a single row, but I had the satisfaction of that one small achievement. It made a difference to me. A very big difference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over the years I\u2019ve taught a number of people how to knit. My first students were other cancer patients going through chemotherapy. We met at the Seattle Oncology Center, and before long, I had everyone, men included, knitting cotton washcloths. I think every doctor and nurse in that clinic has enough knit washcloths to last a lifetime! After washcloths, I had my band of beginning knitters move on to a small afghan. Certainly I\u2019ve had some failures but far more successes. My patience was rewarded when others found the same serenity I did in knitting.</p><p>Now I have my own shop and I think the best way to get customers in the door is to offer knitting classes. I\u2019d never sell enough yarn to stay in business if I ran classes in washcloths, so I\u2019ve chosen a simple baby blanket to start with. The pattern\u2019s by one of my favorite designers, Ann Norling, and uses the basic knit and purl stitches.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to expect of my new venture, but I\u2019m hopeful. Hope to a person with cancer\u2014or to a person who\u2019s had cancer\u2014is more potent than any drug. We live on it, live for it. It\u2019s addictive to those of us who\u2019ve learned to take one day at a time.</p><p>I was making a sign advertising my beginners\u2019 class when the bell above the door chimed. My first customer had just walked in and I looked up with a smile on my face. The pounding excitement in my heart quickly died when I realized it was Margaret.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, doing my best to sound happy to see her. I didn\u2019t want my sister showing up on my very first morning and attacking my confidence.</p><p>\u201cMom told me you\u2019d decided to go ahead with this idea of yours.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Frowning, Margaret continued. \u201cI was in the neighborhood and thought I\u2019d stop by and see the shop.\u201d</p><p>I gestured with one arm and hated myself for asking. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to mention that Blossom Street was decidedly out of her way.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you name it A Good Yarn?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d gone over dozens of shop names, some too cute by half, some plain and ordinary. I love the idea that \u201cspinning a yarn\u201d means telling a story, and sharing stories with people, listening to their experiences, is important to me. Another legacy of the clinic, I suppose. A Good Yarn seems like a warm and welcoming name. But I didn\u2019t explain all that to Margaret. \u201cI wanted my customers to know I sell quality yarn.\u201d</p><p>Margaret shrugged as if she\u2019d seen a dozen knitting shops with more impressive names than mine.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, despite my determination not to ask again. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Margaret glanced around a second time, although nothing had changed after her first inspection. \u201cIt\u2019s better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>I considered this high praise. \u201cI don\u2019t have a large inventory yet, but I\u2019m hoping to build it up over the next year or so. Of course, not all the yarn I\u2019ve ordered has arrived. And there\u2019s more I\u2019m planning to get, some wonderful imports from Ireland and Australia. Everything takes time and money.\u201d In my enthusiasm I\u2019d said more than I intended.</p> <p>\u201cAre you expecting Mom to help you?\u201d The question was blunt.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019m doing this entirely on my own.\u201d So that was the reason for her unannounced visit. Margaret thought I was going to take advantage of our mother. I wouldn\u2019t and the question offended me, but I bit back an angry retort.</p><p>Margaret glared at me as if she wasn\u2019t sure I was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI cashed in my Microsoft stock,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s deep brown eyes, so much like my own, nearly doubled in horror at what I\u2019d done. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>What did my sister think? I had the necessary cash lying around in my bottom drawer? \u201cI had to.\u201d Given my medical history, no bank would grant me a loan. Although I\u2019ve been cancer-free for four years now, I\u2019m viewed as a risk in just about every area.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your money, I guess.\u201d The way Margaret said it implied I\u2019d made a terrible decision. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Dad would have approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve been the first one to encourage me.\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Margaret said with the caustic edge that never failed to appear in our conversations. \u201cDad couldn\u2019t deny you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money was my inheritance,\u201d I pointed out. I suppose her share is still accruing profit.</p><p>My sister walked around the shop, eyeing it critically. Considering Margaret\u2019s apparent dislike of me, I don\u2019t know why my relationship with her is so important, but it is. Mom\u2019s health is fragile and she hasn\u2019t adjusted to life without Dad. Soon, I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019ll be only Margaret and me. The thought of not having any family at all terrifies me.</p><p>I\u2019m so grateful not to know what the future holds. I once asked my father why God wouldn\u2019t just let us know what tomorrow would bring. He said that not knowing the future is actually a gift because if we knew, we wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for our own lives, our own happiness. As with so much else in life, my dad was right.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your business plan?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m starting small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about customers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve paid for an ad in the Yellow Pages.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention that the new phone directory didn\u2019t come out for another two months. No need to hand Margaret any ammunition. I\u2019d distributed flyers in the neighborhood, too, but I didn\u2019t know how effective that would be. I was counting on word of mouth to generate customer interest and, ultimately, sales. Which was something else I didn\u2019t mention.</p><p>My older sister snickered. I\u2019ve always hated that scoffing sound and had to grit my teeth in order to hide my reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting ready to post a sign for my first knitting class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think a handmade sign taped in the window is going to draw people into your store?\u201d Margaret demanded. \u201cParking is a nightmare out there and even when the street\u2019s open again, you can\u2019t expect much traffic through this construction mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you well, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked, cutting her off. My hands shook as I walked over to the display window and secured my notice for knitting classes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face my sister who, at five foot six, stood a good three inches taller than me. She outweighed me by about twenty pounds, too. Looking at us now, I wonder if anyone would guess we were related and yet when we were small we resembled each other quite a bit.</p><p>\u201cI think you want me to fail,\u201d I said honestly.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true! I came this morning because...because I\u2019m interested in what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Her chin went up a notch as if she was daring me to challenge her again. \u201cHow old are you? Twenty-nine, thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time you cut the apron strings?\u201d</p><p>That was blatantly unfair. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do exactly that. I left Mom\u2019s house and I moved into the apartment upstairs. I\u2019ve started my own business, too, and I\u2019d appreciate your support.\u201d</p><p>She turned her hands over to display her palms. \u201cDo you want me to buy yarn from you? Is that what you want? You know I don\u2019t knit and have no desire to learn. I much prefer to crochet. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d I said, cutting her off a second time, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you think of one nice thing to say?\u201d I waited, silently pleading with her to search inside her heart for at least a token word of encouragement.</p><p>My request seemed to be an overwhelming task for Margaret. She faltered for several seconds. \u201cYou have a good eye for color,\u201d she finally said. She gestured toward the display of yarn I\u2019d arranged on the table by the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, hoping to sound gracious. I didn\u2019t mention that I\u2019d used a color wheel to create the display. Hard as it was for Margaret to offer me praise, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to give her an opportunity to withdraw it.</p><p>Had we been closer, I would\u2019ve told her the real reason I\u2019d decided to open a yarn store. This shop was my affirmation of life. I was willing to invest everything I had to make it a success. Like the Viking conqueror who came ashore and burned his ships behind him, I had set my course. Succeed or go under.</p><p>As my father might say, I was taking responsibility for a future I couldn\u2019t predict.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed again. I had a customer! My first real customer.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>T he angry exchange of words with her married son had distressed Jacqueline Donovan. She\u2019d honestly tried to keep her negative feelings regarding her daughter-in-law to herself. But when Paul phoned to tell her Tammie Lee was five and a half months pregnant, Jacqueline had lost her temper and said things she shouldn\u2019t have. Paul had hung up in mid-rant.</p><p>To complicate everything, her husband had phoned soon afterward, asking her to drop off blueprints at the construction site on Blossom Street. The argument with Paul weighing on her mind, she\u2019d confessed what she\u2019d said and now Reese was upset with her, too. Truth be told, she didn\u2019t much care what her husband thought, but Paul, her only child\u2014now, that was a different story.</p><p>Feeling anxious and depressed, Jacqueline drove down to the job site and wasted twenty minutes finding a parking space. Needless to say, the one she found was quite a distance down the street, across from a seedy-looking video store. Clutching the blueprints, she picked her way through the construction mess, muttering under her breath. Just leave it to Reese to screw up her entire day!</p><p>\u201cYou brought the drawings?\u201d Her husband of thirty-three years walked out of the trailer to meet her as she neared the site. Jacqueline stepped over steel tubes, trying not to dirty or damage her Ferragamo heels. Her husband\u2019s architectural firm, Donovan and Gray, was responsible for this renovation project. Dressed in a Brooks Brothers suit and a hard hat, Reese was still a good-looking man at fifty-nine.</p><p>Jacqueline handed him the all-important set of rolled-up prints. It was unusual for Reese to ask anything of her, which suited her perfectly. He set the prints inside the trailer and turned back to face her, standing just outside the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Paul,\u201d she said, doing her best to maintain her composure. Reese gave a tired shrug. He worked long hours and Jacqueline pretended to believe that all the time he spent away from home was business-related. She knew otherwise. So if he was tired, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to sympathize.</p><p>For the sake of Paul and their friends, Jacqueline and Reese managed to put up a good front, but the marriage hadn\u2019t been happy for a number of years. Reese had his life and she had hers. They hadn\u2019t slept together since Paul left for college twelve years ago. In fact, there was very little they shared except their love for their son.</p><p>\u201cSo Tammie Lee is pregnant,\u201d her husband said, ignoring her concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacqueline nodded. \u201cObviously Tammie Lee\u2019s a breeder, just as I suspected.\u201d</p><p>Reese frowned; he disapproved of her natural wariness toward Paul\u2019s wife. But they knew practically nothing about her family. What little Jacqueline had unearthed, between the girl\u2019s tales of aunts and uncles and God-only-knew how many cousins, had been disheartening to say the least.</p><p>The sound of a crane overhead distracted Reese momentarily and when he returned his attention to her he was frowning again. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Reese! How do you expect me to feel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike a woman who\u2019s about to be a grandmother for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline crossed her arms. \u201cWell, I for one am not thrilled.\u201d Several of her nearest and dearest friends had delighted in their status as new grandmothers, but Jacqueline doubted she\u2019d make this latest adjustment as smoothly as her friends.</p><p>\u201cJacquie, this is our grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known better than to say anything to you,\u201d she said angrily. Jacqueline wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it at all if not for the argument with Paul. She\u2019d always been close to her son. He was the reason she\u2019d stayed in this empty shell of a marriage. Her son was everything she\u2019d hoped for: handsome, smart, successful and so much more. He\u2019d gone into banking and was quickly climbing up the corporate ladder\u2014and then, a year ago, he\u2019d done something completely out of character. He\u2019d married the wrong woman.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t given Tammie Lee a chance,\u201d Reese insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThat is blatantly unfair.\u201d To Jacqueline\u2019s horror, her voice shook with emotion. She\u2019d given this awkward relationship with Tammie Lee her best effort. For the life of her, Jacqueline couldn\u2019t understand why her sensible son would marry this stranger, this...this little girl from the swamps, when so many of her friends\u2019 daughters were interested in him. Paul called Tammie Lee his southern belle, but all Jacqueline saw was a hillbilly. \u201cI took her to lunch at the country club and I\u2019ve never been so mortified in my life. I introduced her to Mary James, and the next thing I know, Tammie Lee\u2019s discussing a recipe for pickled pigs\u2019 feet or some such with the President of the Women\u2019s Association.\u201d It had taken Jacqueline weeks to gather up enough courage to face her friend again.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Mary in charge of the cookbook? It makes perfect sense that the two of them would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I need is for you to criticize me, too,\u201d Jacqueline blurted out. There was no point in trying to explain anything to Reese. They couldn\u2019t even have a civil conversation anymore. Besides, this construction dust was ruining her makeup and the wind was playing havoc with her French twist. Reese didn\u2019t care, though. Appearances were important, but he had no appreciation of everything she did to maintain herself physically. He didn\u2019t have any idea how much work was involved in styling her hair and doing her makeup properly. She was in her midfifties now, and it took a subtle hand to hide age lines.</p><p>His voice rose slightly. \u201cWhat exactly did you say to Paul?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline squared her shoulders in an attempt to preserve her dignity. \u201cJust that I wished he\u2019d waited a while before starting his family.\u201d</p><p>Her husband offered her his hand to assist her into the construction trailer. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline ignored his gesture of help and stepped into the trailer. Although Reese routinely visited his work sites, this was the first time she\u2019d been inside one of these trailers. She glanced around and took note of the blue-prints, empty coffee cups and general disarray. The place resembled a pigpen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me everything.\u201d Reese poured coffee and silently held out a cup. She declined with a shake of her head, afraid the cup hadn\u2019t been washed in weeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume I said anything more than the fact that I was disappointed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you very much.\u201d Her throat was thickening but she refused to let him see how his rebuke had hurt her. \u201cTo make matters worse, Tammie Lee\u2019s nearly six months along. Naturally Paul had a convenient excuse for keeping us out of the picture. He said they didn\u2019t want to say anything until they could be sure the pregnancy was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t believe him?\u201d Reese crossed his arms and leaned next to the open door.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. People usually wait three months before they share their good news,\u201d she said sarcastically, \u201cbut six? You and I both know he put off telling us because he knew how I\u2019d feel. I\u2019ve said from the first, and I\u2019ll say it again, this marriage is a very big mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Jacquie...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat else am I to think? Paul goes off on a business trip to New Orleans and meets this girl in a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were both attending the same financial conference, and met for a drink later that evening.\u201d</p><p>Why did Reese have to drag up unnecessary details? \u201cThey were together all of three days and the next thing I know he announces that he\u2019s married to a girl neither of us has ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I agree with you there,\u201d Reese conceded. \u201cI do wish Paul had told us, but it\u2019s been almost a year.\u201d</p><p>It still upset Jacqueline that her son hadn\u2019t had a large church wedding the way she\u2019d always envisioned. Jacqueline felt it was what Paul was entitled to\u2014what she was entitled to. Instead she hadn\u2019t even been invited to the wedding.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t territory she particularly wanted to revisit. Her son\u2019s only excuse was that he was in love, knew he wanted Tammie Lee with him for the rest of his life and couldn\u2019t bear to be apart from her any longer than necessary. That was the reason he\u2019d given them, but Jacqueline had her suspicions. Paul must\u2019ve known she wouldn\u2019t be pleased\u2014and he must have realized that his in-laws would be an embarrassment. She could only imagine the kind of wedding Tammie Lee\u2019s family would hold. The reception dinner would probably consist of collard greens and grits, with deep-fried Hostess Twinkies instead of wedding cake.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee got pregnant within six months of the wedding.\u201d She didn\u2019t hide her contempt.</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2019s over thirty, Jacqueline.\u201d Reese had that disapproving look in his eyes. She\u2019d always hated it.</p><p>\u201cAnd old enough to know about birth control,\u201d she snapped. Paul had sprung the news on her the same way he had the marriage: over the phone without a moment\u2019s warning.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he wanted a family,\u201d Reese murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot this soon, I\u2019ll bet,\u201d she burst out. Talking to Reese was impossible. He didn\u2019t seem to care that Paul had married beneath him. Her daughter-in-law was nothing like the woman she\u2019d envisioned for their son. Jacqueline had honestly tried to welcome Tammie Lee into the family, but she couldn\u2019t bear to be around her for more than a few minutes. All that sweetness and insincere southern charm simply overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cBut Paul\u2019s pleased about the baby, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline leaned against the table and nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s thrilled,\u201d she muttered. \u201cOr so he says...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he doesn\u2019t seem to think I\u2019m going to make much of a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Reese,\u201d she said, feeling terrible now. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I told him I thought he\u2019d made a terrible mistake in marrying Tammie Lee and that this pregnancy complicates everything.\u201d She\u2019d assumed that a year or two down the road, Paul would recognize his lapse in judgment and gracefully bow out of the marriage. A child made that a whole lot less likely.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t actually say that to Paul, did you?\u201d Reese sounded furious and that only made Jacqueline more defensive.</p><p>\u201cI realize I should\u2019ve kept quiet, but really, can you blame me? I\u2019m just getting used to the fact that our only son eloped with a stranger and then he hits me with this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be happy news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to our son and Tammie Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy is it every girl from the south has two names? Why can\u2019t we call her Tammie without the Lee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her name, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Reese studied her as if he was really noticing her for the first time. \u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid of losing my son.\u201d Paul and her close relationship with him was the only consolation she had in a life that brought her little joy. Now she\u2019d done something stupid and insulted her son.</p><p>\u201cCall him back and apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou could order flowers for Tammie Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But the gesture would be for Paul\u2019s sake, not his wife\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy not go to the flower shop on Blossom Street.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded. \u201cI plan to do something else, too.\u201d She prayed it would be enough. She hoped her son realized she was making an effort to accept his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a sign in the window of that new knitting shop. I\u2019m going to register for a knitting class. The sign says the beginning project is a baby blanket.\u201d</p><p>Reese so rarely approved of anything she did that the warmth of his smile moved all the way through her.</p><p>\u201cI might not like Tammie Lee, but I will be the best grandmother I can.\u201d Someone had to provide the appropriate influences for Paul\u2019s child. Otherwise her grandchild might grow up eating deep-fried pickles. Or going through life as Bubba Donovan...</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol Girard had never imagined that getting pregnant could be this difficult. Her mother obviously hadn\u2019t had any trouble; Carol and her brother, Rick, were born two years apart.</p><p>Before they were married, Doug and Carol had talked about having a family one day. Because of her high-powered job with a national brokerage firm, he wanted to be sure she was as interested in a family as he was. Doug had asked if she\u2019d be willing to put aside her career for a few years in order to have children. The answer had been an unqualified yes. Babies were a given with her. She\u2019d always pictured herself as a mother, always saw kids as an important part of her life. Doug would be a wonderful father and she was deeply, passionately, in love with her husband. She wanted to have his children.</p><p>Heating her lunch in the microwave, Carol glanced around the kitchen of her sixteenth-floor condo overlooking Puget Sound. She\u2019d quit her job only a month ago and she already felt restless and impatient. She\u2019d left the brokerage firm with the sole intention of allowing her body to relax, to unwind from the demands of her routine. Doug had convinced her that job-related stress was the reason she hadn\u2019t conceived, and her obstetrician conceded that it was possible. A barrage of humiliating tests for both her and Doug had revealed that in addition to her age, thirty-seven, she had to contend with something called ASA or antisperm antibodies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rang and she leapt on it, grabbing the hand-set before it had a chance to ring twice.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said cheerfully, eager to talk to anyone, even if it was a sales call.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey. I wondered if you were still at home.\u201d</p><p>A momentary panic attacked her. \u201cAm I supposed to be somewhere?\u201d</p> <p>Doug chuckled. \u201cI thought you said you were going for a walk this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>That was something recommended by one of the books they\u2019d read. As a result, Carol had decided she should exercise more, and now that she was home during the day she had plenty of opportunity to spend time outside. This was all part of the program they\u2019d discussed and agreed upon before she\u2019d left her job.</p><p>\u201cRight. I was just getting ready to head out.\u201d She eyed the microwave and turned her back on her waiting lunch.</p><p>\u201cCarol? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Her husband recognized her mood, her depression and anxiety. Doug had been right to suggest she quit work. They were both frightened, since there was a very real possibility that she might never carry a pregnancy full-term. It didn\u2019t help that they had one last shot with in vitro fertilization. The insurance company where Doug worked had its headquarters in Illinois, where state law mandated that company health coverage could pay for three attempts; their first two had failed. IVF was the very end of the technological line, the ultimate procedure the fertility clinic had to offer in the quest for a biological child. July would be their last attempt, and after that they were on their own financially. At the start they\u2019d agreed to limit in vitro to the three attempts. If she wasn\u2019t pregnant by then, they\u2019d begin the adoption process. In retrospect, it had been a wise decision. The emotional devastation of the two failures proved she couldn\u2019t endure this process indefinitely. Twice a fertilized egg had been implanted and twice she\u2019d miscarried. No couple should repeatedly face this kind of heartache.</p> <p>Carol and Doug never mentioned that this third IVF attempt was the end of their hopes, but the fact loomed in their minds. It was vitally important that she get pregnant\u2014and stay pregnant\u2014this time.</p><p>Carol was willing to give it everything she had. Willing to forsake the job she loved, willing to be poked and prodded and humiliated. She was willing to withstand all the doubts, confront the emotional highs and lows of their attempts at conception, all for the sake of a baby. Doug\u2019s baby.</p><p>\u201cI love you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Although she said it flippantly, Carol did know. Doug had been with her through this entire process, through the doctors\u2019 visits, the testing, through the tears, the frustration, the anger and the grief. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll hold our child in your arms and we\u2019ll both know that everything was worth it.\u201d They\u2019d already chosen the names. Cameron for a boy and Colleen for a girl. She could clearly see their child, could feel the baby in her arms, and see the joy in her husband\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Carol held on to that dream, and the image of a baby in her arms helped her endure the most difficult aspects of the IVF process.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be home?\u201d It had never concerned her before, but now she regulated her life by her husband\u2019s comings and goings. His routine shaped her own, and his return from the office was the highlight of her day. Several times each afternoon she checked her watch, calculating how many hours and then minutes until Doug was home.</p> <p>\u201cUsual time,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Her husband of seven years worked as an insurance underwriter. Carol was the one who earned the big bucks in the family. It was her income that had enabled them to make a substantial down payment on the condo. When they got married, her wise and frugal husband had insisted they adjust their lifestyle to live on his income alone. He feared that otherwise they\u2019d come to rely on her salary and defer having a family. They\u2019d waited three years after marrying, not expecting problems, building up their savings. It was a good thing because even with insurance, the cost of infertility treatments was staggering. And now that she wasn\u2019t working...</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how dreadful daytime television is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTurn off the TV and go for your walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she replied in military fashion.</p><p>Doug laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that staying home isn\u2019t anything like I thought.\u201d Life at home wasn\u2019t supposed to be endless hours of boredom, desperately searching for ways to amuse herself until Doug came home. She was used to frequent meetings, adrenaline-fuelled decisions, constant busyness. Being at home alone was a new experience and not one she enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to check in with you later?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re right, I do need to get outside and it\u2019s a lovely afternoon.\u201d No place on earth was more beautiful than Seattle when the sun was shining. It was a perfect May day and she gazed out at the snow-topped Olympic Mountains in the distance, the blue-green waters of Puget Sound below her.</p><p>\u201cSee you around five-thirty,\u201d Doug said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d Before Carol had left the brokerage firm, it was Doug who\u2019d arrived home first. Doug who started dinner. Doug who had the local news blaring from the television. Carol didn\u2019t have any trouble adjusting to this role reversal of a role reversal. Right now, it was one of the few interesting things in her life.</p><p>She deposited her lunch in the refrigerator and grabbed an apple on her way out the door. They\u2019d lived in the condo four years, and she still didn\u2019t know her neighbors. They were upwardly mobile types just like her and Doug, with both husband and wife working long hours. Only a few had children and the little ones were rushed off to ultra-expensive day-care centers early in the morning.</p><p>Carol rode an empty elevator down to the condo foyer and headed out the double glass doors onto the downtown sidewalk. Munching on her apple as she walked swiftly toward the waterfront, she realized that one fear, at any rate, hadn\u2019t come to pass.</p><p>All the women in the office had given her dire warnings when they learned she was leaving. The word was that stay-at-home wives and mothers battled constantly with their weight. Being in the kitchen and continually around food made it impossible to maintain a slim waistline, according to her former colleagues. That wasn\u2019t a problem for Carol. Never in her life had she eaten more healthfully. Diet was all part of her new regime and she\u2019d maintained her size 8 figure without difficulty.</p><p>A cool breeze blew off the water as she strolled along her usual route. Then on a whim she headed east, climbing toward Pill Hill, where Virginia Mason Hospital and Swedish Hospital were situated. She was breathing hard as she made it up the steep incline and continued slowly for several blocks, looking around at the unfamiliar neighborhood, until she came to Blossom Street.</p><p>A number of buildings were being renovated. The street was blocked off, but the sidewalk was accessible. The work on one side of the street seemed to be completed, with freshly painted storefronts and a green-and-white awning over the florist\u2019s shop. Tulips and lilies were arranged in buckets outside the front door.</p><p>Despite the clang and racket of construction, Carol ventured down the street. A video store and a depressing brick apartment building sat at the far end of the block and a restaurant called Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9 was across the street. The contrast between the old and the new was striking. The unrenovated portion of the street resembled a quaint small town with friendly merchants straight out of a 1960s television series. Granted, some of the buildings were a bit shabby, but they seemed welcoming nonetheless. It was hard to tell that Blossom Street was less than a mile from the heart of downtown Seattle with its high-rises and congested streets.</p><p>Next to the florist was another surprise: a yarn store. The shop was new, judging by the computer-lettered \u201cGrand Opening\u201d sign. A woman, probably close to her own age, sat in a rocking chair inside, her hands busy with a pair of needles. A large ball of lime-green yarn rested on her lap.</p><p>Because she had nothing better to do, Carol walked through the door, setting off a pleasant chime. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound cheerful and interested. She wasn\u2019t sure what drew her into the shop, since she didn\u2019t knit and had never been particularly keen on crafts.</p><p>The petite woman greeted her with a shy smile. \u201cHello and welcome to A Good Yarn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The proprietor nodded. \u201cI opened yesterday, and you\u2019re my first customer this afternoon.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cFirst customer today,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you knitting?\u201d Carol asked, feeling slightly guilty because she wasn\u2019t a customer at all.</p><p>\u201cA sweater for my niece.\u201d She reached for her project and held it up for Carol to examine.</p><p>The colors, lime-green, orange and turquoise, immediately brought a smile to Carol\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you knit?\u201d</p><p>The question was inevitable. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d like to learn someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve come to the right place. I have a beginners\u2019 class starting next Friday. If you register for the class you get a twenty-percent discount on your yarn purchases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be any good at knitting.\u201d Carol felt genuinely regretful, but she wasn\u2019t the sort of woman who was comfortable doing things with her hands. Calculating compound interest and figuring annuities, investments and mutual funds\u2014that was where her skills lay.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try. I\u2019m Lydia, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d She offered her hand, and Lydia put down her knitting to clasp it warmly. Lydia was petite and small-boned, her dark hair worn short. Her brown eyes shone with intelligence, and Carol liked her right away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting the class with a simple project,\u201d Lydia continued.</p><p>\u201cIt would have to be really simple if I were to take up knitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d have everyone work on a baby blanket.\u201d</p><p>Carol froze and tears sprang instantly to her eyes. She turned away before Lydia noticed. Under normal circumstances she wasn\u2019t a volatile person, but with the hormone shots, her emotions seemed out of control. This was too weird, though, too much of a coincidence.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will sign up for the class, after all,\u201d she said, fingering a ball of bright yellow yarn.</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d Lydia walked over to the counter and brought out a clipboard.</p><p>These days, Carol looked everywhere for signs and portents, and she had frequent conversations with God. Without a doubt she knew she\u2019d been sent to this shop. It was His way of letting her know He was about to answer her prayers. When she went in for the fertilization process this third and final time, she would be successful. In the not-too-distant future she was going to need a baby blanket for her child.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix Townsend smashed her cigarette butt into the cracked concrete sidewalk with the toe of her knee-high black combat boots. The manager of Blossom Street Video frowned on employees smoking in the break room and rather than put up with his snide comments, she chose to smoke outside. The man was a prick, anyway, constantly complaining about the staff, the economy and life in general. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lloyd Fund was right about one thing, though\u2014all this construction was killing business. Alix figured it was only a matter of time before she got her RIF notice, followed by word that her apartment building had been sold. It was inevitable with all the changes taking place in the neighborhood. Either that or she was in for a big rent hike. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mayor.</p><p>She burrowed her hands in her black leather jacket and glared down the street at the dust and debris. She wore the leather coat rain or shine, summer or winter. This jacket had cost her big time, and she wasn\u2019t taking it off so someone could conveniently walk away with it. Someone like her roommate, the overweight Laurel, although it was doubtful anything Alix owned would fit her. Leaning against the building, knee bent, one foot braced against the wall, she concentrated on the other side of the street.</p><p>All the storefronts were newly painted. The new florist shop had already opened, as well as a beauty parlor. Those were a real boon to the neighborhood\u2014as if she had use for either one. The shop situated between them remained something of a mystery. A Good Yarn. Either it was a bookstore or a knitting shop. In this neighborhood neither would last long, she suspected. On closer inspection she decided it was a yarn store. The people who lived in her building weren\u2019t exactly the type who got off on a ball of yarn.</p><p>A knitting shop did bring up an interesting prospect, though. With another five minutes left of her break, Alix crossed the street. She peered through the window and saw a handmade sign offering knitting classes. If she started knitting, it would get the court off her back. Maybe she could do something about those community-service hours Judge Roper had thrown at her.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alix said, letting her voice boom when she walked in the front door. She liked making an entrance.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>The proprietor was a dainty woman, fragile-looking with large brown eyes and a ready smile.</p><p>\u201cYou own this shop?\u201d Alix asked, giving the other woman a cool glance. She couldn\u2019t be much older than Alix.</p><p>\u201cThis is my shop.\u201d She rose from her rocking chair. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to know about that knitting class.\u201d Her case worker had once suggested knitting as a means of anger management. Maybe it would work. And if it allowed her to meet her community-service obligations at the same time...</p><p>\u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d</p><p>Slowly Alix walked around the shop, her hands shoved inside her pockets. She\u2019d bet this knitting lady didn\u2019t get many customers like her. Recently a notice in the courthouse had caught Alix\u2019s attention\u2014all about homemade quilts and blankets for kids who\u2019d suffered domestic violence. \u201cYou ever heard of the Linus Project?\u201d she asked, thinking this yarn lady probably hadn\u2019t stepped inside a courtroom in her lifetime.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The woman joined her hands and followed Alix as if she was afraid Alix might try to lift some yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s a police-instigated project that involves knitting blankets for children who are the victims of violence.\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged it off as if it were merely a passing thought. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lydia, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlix, spelled A-L-I-X.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected to get on a first-name basis with the woman, but that was all right.</p><p>\u201cHello, Alix, and welcome to A Good Yarn. Are you interested in knitting for the Linus Project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Her thoughts on the subject had been pretty vague. \u201cI might be if I knew how to knit,\u201d she finally muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the classes are for.\u201d</p><p>Alix gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t be any good at knitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to learn? It isn\u2019t difficult.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, making an intentionally derisive sound. The truth was, Alix didn\u2019t really know why she was here. Perhaps it was because of something from her childhood, some remembered moment or feeling. Her early years were blocked from her mind. Those court-appointed doctors had said she suffered from childhood amnesia. Whatever. Every now and then a fleeting memory flashed through her mind. Most of the time she didn\u2019t know what had really happened and what hadn\u2019t. What she did remember was that her parents had fought a great deal. An argument would break out and Alix would hide in her bedroom closet. With the door shut and her eyes closed, she managed to convince herself there was no yelling and no violence. In that closet she had another family, one from an imaginary world where mothers and fathers loved each other and didn\u2019t scream or beat each other up. Her imaginary world had a real home where half the refrigerator wasn\u2019t filled with beer and there were cookies and milk waiting for her when she got home from school. Through the years, fantasy had played as great a role in Alix\u2019s memory as reality did. One thing she recalled in vivid detail was that this fantasy mother who loved her used to knit.</p><p>Alix escaped into that closet quite often as a kid....</p> <p>\u201cI have a beginners\u2019 class starting next Friday afternoon if you\u2019d like to join.\u201d</p><p>The words shook her from her reverie. Alix grinned. \u201cYou honestly think you could teach someone like me to knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Lydia returned without a pause. \u201cI\u2019ve taught lots of people and there are only two women signed up for the class, so I could give you plenty of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m left-handed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>The lady must be desperate for a sale. Excuses were easy enough to supply and eventually Lydia would give up on her. As for learning to knit, she didn\u2019t have money to blow on yarn.</p><p>\u201cWhat about knitting a blanket for the Linus Project, like you mentioned?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>Alix had walked right into that one.</p><p>Lydia kept on talking. \u201cI\u2019ve knit several blankets for the Linus Project myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d So this woman had a heart.</p><p>Lydia nodded. \u201cThere are only so many people to knit for, and it\u2019s a worthy cause.\u201d</p><p>People to knit for... The mother in the closet knit. She sang songs to Alix and smelled of lavender and flowers. Alix had wanted to be like that mother one day. However, the path she\u2019d followed had led her in a different direction. Perhaps this knitting class was something she could\u2014should\u2014do.</p><p>\u201cI guess I could try,\u201d she said, jerking one shoulder. If Laurel found out about this, Alix would be the subject of a lot of jokes, but so what? She\u2019d been ridiculed most of her life for one reason or another.</p><p>Lydia smiled warmly. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the blanket for the Linus Project doesn\u2019t turn out, then it really doesn\u2019t matter. It isn\u2019t like anyone\u2019ll know I was the one who knit it.\u201d</p><p>Lydia\u2019s smile slowly faded. \u201cYou\u2019ll know, Alix, and that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...well, I\u2019m thinking your class could serve a dual purpose.\u201d That sounded good, Alix thought, pleased with herself. \u201cI could learn to knit, and the time it takes me to finish the blanket will use up some of the hours I owe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe someone hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudge Roper gave me a hundred hours of community service for a bogus drug bust. I didn\u2019t do it! I\u2019m not stupid and he knows it.\u201d Her hands involuntarily clenched. She still felt upset about that charge, because the marijuana had belonged to Laurel. \u201cDoing drugs is stupid.\u201d She paused, then blurted out, \u201cMy brother\u2019s dead because of drugs. I\u2019m not interested in giving up on life just yet.\u201d</p><p>Lydia straightened. \u201cLet me see if I understand you correctly. You\u2019d like to sign up for the knitting class and give the blanket to the Linus Project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the time it takes you to knit this blanket\u2014\u201d she hesitated briefly \u201c\u2014you want to use against your court-ordered community-service hours?\u201d</p><p>Alix detected a bit of attitude on Lydia\u2019s part, but when it came to attitude, she had plenty of her own to spare. \u201cDo you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>Lydia hesitated. \u201cNot really, as long as you\u2019re respectful to me and the other class members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Fine.\u201d Alix glanced down at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work. If you need me for anything, I\u2019m almost always at the video store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d All of a sudden Lydia didn\u2019t sound as confident as she had before.</p><p>The video store was busy when Alix returned, and she hurried behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Laurel demanded. \u201cFund asked where you were and I told him you\u2019d stepped into the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I went outside for a cigarette.\u201d According to the labor laws, she was entitled to a fifteen-minute break.</p><p>\u201cDid you meet any of the construction guys?\u201d</p><p>Alix shook her head as she moved over to the cash register. \u201cNot a one. Four o\u2019clock, and those guys are out of here faster than Seabiscuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got to get ourselves a union,\u201d Laurel whispered.</p><p>\u201cBenefits.\u201d Alix knew she was back in that dream world again. One day she\u2019d find a job that paid more than minimum wage. It would be nice to have an apartment all to herself and not share it with Laurel. Laurel lived on the edge and was in danger of slipping off entirely. Alix\u2019s biggest fear was that when Laurel went, she\u2019d take Alix with her.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>\u201cIf you can knit, purl and follow instructions, you can make anything.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Linda Johnson, Linda\u2019s Knit \u2018N\u2019 Stitch, Silverdale, Washington</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I was afraid Margaret could be right and A Good Yarn would fail before it even had a chance to get off the ground. So far, only three women had signed up for the knitting class and Alix, the latest one to enroll, looked like a felon. I couldn\u2019t imagine how Jacqueline and Carol would react to a classmate who sported a dog collar and wore her hair in purple-tinged spikes. I\u2019d encouraged Alix to join, and then the moment she left the store I wondered if I\u2019d done the right thing. What was I thinking? What was I thinking?</p><p>The construction noise wasn\u2019t quite as disruptive now, which was a relief, but that hadn\u2019t brought any more customers into the shop. On a positive note, I hadn\u2019t had this much uninterrupted knitting time in months. I should\u2019ve been counting my blessings, I suppose, but I was too worried about the lack of walk-in traffic.</p><p>Every knowledgeable person I\u2019ve talked to about opening the store suggested I have enough money in the bank to pay for a minimum of six months\u2019 expenses. I do, but I hope and pray I\u2019ll be able to keep at least part of my inheritance intact. Now that I\u2019ve actually taken the risk, I feel bombarded with second thoughts and fears.</p><p>Margaret always does that to me. I wish I understood my sister. Some days I think she hates me. A part of me recognizes what the problem is: I was the one who got all of Mom and Dad\u2019s attention, but I needed them. I refuse to believe that my sister would seriously think I was so hungry for attention that I wished the cancer upon myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even more than Margaret resented me, I resented the cancer. I longed to be healthy and normal. I still live my life standing directly under a thundercloud, fearing lightning will strike again. Surely my one and only sibling can appreciate my circumstances and support my efforts to support myself!</p><p>On Wednesday morning, I was knitting a pair of socks for display, my concentration focused on shaping the gusset, when the bell above the door chimed. Thrilled at the prospect of a customer\u2014and potential class member\u2014I stood with a welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cHello, there.\u201d The UPS driver walked into the shop, wheeling his cart stacked five high with large cardboard boxes. \u201cSince I\u2019m going to be making regular deliveries to the neighborhood, I thought I should introduce myself.\u201d He released the cart and thrust out his hand. \u201cBrad Goetz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lydia Hoffman.\u201d We shook hands.</p> <p>He passed me the computerized clipboard for my signature. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Brad asked as I signed my name.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only my second week.\u201d I bypassed his question rather than confess how poor business actually was.</p><p>\u201cThe construction will be finished soon, and customers will flock to your store.\u201d He smiled as he said it and I felt instantly grateful and\u2014shocking as this sounds\u2014attracted, too. I was so starved for encouragement that it was only natural, I suppose, but I was drawn to him like a bird to the sky. I hadn\u2019t felt that particular tug in a very long while. Shamelessly, I glanced at his ring finger and saw that he wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding band.</p><p>This is embarrassing to admit, but my sexual experience is limited to a few groping attempts at lovemaking in the back seat of my college boyfriend\u2019s car. Then the cancer returned. Roger was with me for the second brain surgery, but his calls and visits stopped shortly after I started chemotherapy and lost all my hair. Bald women apparently weren\u2019t attractive, although he claimed otherwise. I think it had more to do with the fact that he saw me as a losing proposition, a woman who could die at any time. A woman who couldn\u2019t repay his emotional investment. Roger was a business student, after all.</p><p>Brian had been my high school boyfriend and his reaction was the same as Roger\u2019s. He hung around for a while, too, and then drifted away. I didn\u2019t really blame either one.</p> <p>My breakups with Roger and Brian, if you could even call them that, were inevitable. A few short relationships followed after Roger, but no one worth mentioning. After my earlier experiences, I should\u2019ve realized that most men aren\u2019t romantically interested in a two-time cancer patient. Without sounding like a martyr, I understand how they feel. Why get emotionally involved with a woman who\u2019s probably going to die? I don\u2019t even know if I can have children or if I should. It\u2019s a subject I prefer not to think about.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother used to knit,\u201d Brad said. \u201cI hear interest in it\u2019s been revived in the last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Longer, although I didn\u2019t correct him. Damn, but he was good-looking, especially when he smiled, and he seemed to be doing a lot of that. His eyes were a deep shade of blue, eyes a woman could see a block away. He wasn\u2019t overly tall, which was nice. I\u2019m barely five foot three, and when I stand next to someone who\u2019s six feet or taller, it\u2019s intimidating. Brad was just right and that was the problem. I didn\u2019t want to notice anything about him, about the boyish, charming way his dark hair fell over his forehead or how the dark-brown uniform stretched across his broad shoulders. But I did notice all those things...and more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you knitting?\u201d he asked, gesturing down at my current project. He didn\u2019t wait for me to respond. \u201cLooks like socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re only using two needles. When Grandma knit socks, she had maybe half a dozen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese are circular needles. It\u2019s a more modern method,\u201d I explained, holding up the half-completed project for his inspection. He seemed interested and I continued chattering away, giving him far more information than he probably wanted. \u201cUntil only a few years ago, socks were knit using the five-needles method. But now it\u2019s possible to knit them on two circular needles, or even one except that it\u2019s forty inches long. Notice the yarn, too,\u201d I blathered on. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed colors to make these stripes. The striped pattern is in the yarn itself.\u201d</p><p>He touched the strand of yarn and seemed genuinely impressed. \u201cHave you been knitting long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor almost ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look old enough to be out of high school, let alone open a yarn store.\u201d</p><p>That was a comment I\u2019ve heard far too often. I smiled in an offhand manner, but the truth is, I don\u2019t consider it a compliment.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d better get back to work,\u201d Brad said when I let the conversation drop. I wouldn\u2019t have minded exchanging pleasantries for another few minutes, but I was sure he was on a schedule. So was I, in a manner of speaking. Besides, I never was much good at flirting.</p><p>\u201cBefore I go, can I help you put these boxes someplace? They\u2019re heavier than they look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage, but thank you.\u201d Distracted as I was by Brad\u2019s friendly visit, I\u2019d hardly noticed he was delivering new yarn. One of the delights of opening my own shop was being able to buy yarn at wholesale prices. Unsure of what would interest my clientele, I\u2019d ordered a number of different varieties. My first order was for good solid wool in two dozen colors. Wool is a must, especially with the popularity of felting. That\u2019s where the pattern is knit in a bigger size and then shrunk in hot water, which also mats the yarn, creating a consistency like felt. Next came the cotton yarns; they\u2019re some of my favorites. The fingering weight yarns have become increasingly popular, too, as well as the imported European sock yarns. The yarns most in demand, I thought, would be the blends of wool and acrylic, so I\u2019d ordered all the basic colors, as well as the colors that were, according to my knitting magazines, this year\u2019s trends. Most of my shipments had arrived before I opened my doors but the smaller orders were dribbling in day by day.</p> <p>\u201cDo you live in the neighborhood?\u201d Brad asked as he tucked the clipboard under his arm and reached for his empty cart.</p><p>\u201cI have the apartment above the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because parking around here is a headache.\u201d</p><p>As if I didn\u2019t already know that. I wondered where he\u2019d left his truck and supposed it must be quite a distance away. Any customers I was bound to attract would need to find parking a block or two down the street, and I worried that many people wouldn\u2019t be willing to go to that trouble. The alleyway behind the store was open, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of place I wanted to be caught alone, day or night.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Brad,\u201d I said as he opened the door.</p><p>He gave a cheery wave and was gone. It seemed for a moment as if all the sunshine had left the room. I recognized that feeling for what it was: regret verging on misery. This wasn\u2019t the time or the place, I told myself sternly. If I\u2019m going to wallow in self-pity I want to make sure I\u2019ve got an Eric Clapton CD playing and a sad movie or two in reserve. Ice cream is always a help, but only if it\u2019s a really bad case.</p><p>There was nothing stopping me from getting involved in a relationship. Nothing except my own fears. Good grief, I\u2019m thirty years old. Okay, here\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to risk falling in love when in all likelihood the relationship will end. I\u2019ve tried several times and as soon as I admit I\u2019ve had cancer not once, but twice, I can see it in their eyes. I hate that look the most. The wary look that\u2019s a mixture of pity and regret, of disappointment and sympathy.</p><p>Often the change in attitude is immediate, and I know it won\u2019t be long before the relationship that once seemed so promising falls apart and dies. And with it my hopes for what women have always cherished\u2014a husband and children. A family of my own.</p><p>I know I sound terribly sorry for myself. I\u2019ll admit that I struggle with the subject of men and relationships. Even my girlfriends sometimes act uncomfortable around me. I do my best not to think about it. I have so much for which to be grateful, and for the sake of my sanity, I choose to concentrate on those things.</p><p>To put it simply, I don\u2019t handle relationships well. That wasn\u2019t always the case. BC (before cancer), I\u2019d been popular and outgoing, with lots of friends, boys and girls. All the boys in my life eventually bailed. Actually I\u2019d come to expect that, but I was the one who pushed my female friends away. It was foolish, I know, but I couldn\u2019t stand to hear about all the fun they were having. In retrospect I realize I was jealous. I so desperately wanted to be like them, to laugh and stay up all night talking and confiding secrets. To go out on dates. Discover life. Instead, my daily routine consisted of doctors and hospitals and experimental drugs. I\u2019ve never recaptured what cancer took away from me. The point is, I don\u2019t have close friends, and now that I\u2019m thirty, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve lost the knack for making them.</p><p>I shoved Brad Goetz out of my mind.</p><p>I\u2019d just started to unpack the boxes and sort through my treasure of yarns when I saw a flash of brown uniform in my display window. Despite my earlier determination, I craned my neck, hoping for a glimpse of Brad. I wasn\u2019t disappointed as he flung open the door and hurried inside.</p><p>\u201cLydia, are you doing anything after work tonight?\u201d</p><p>To my utter astonishment, my mouth went dry. \u201cDoing anything?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s last-minute and all, but can I take you to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Again I faltered, trapped between the yearning to leap at his invitation and the knowledge that, in the end, I\u2019d be left with nothing but raw feelings and regrets.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, hoping I conveyed just the right tone, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got plans this evening.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention that it was finishing the gusset on the sock, but that was information he didn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow? My ex has my son for the next two nights and I thought, you know, that we might get together and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I could give in to temptation, I shook my head. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brad\u2019s smile faded. It probably wasn\u2019t often that a woman turned him down. \u201cSee you around, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered as my fingers crushed a bright yellow ball of worsted yarn. \u201cSee you around.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>L eaning back in her bubble-filled tub, Jacqueline glanced up from the latest best-selling murder mystery at the sound of the front door opening.</p><p>Reese didn\u2019t generally arrive home on Tuesdays until long after she\u2019d turned in for the night. For a while, his absence, followed by endless conjecture regarding his whereabouts, had profoundly distressed her. The subject of a mistress wasn\u2019t one a wife discussed openly with her husband, so Jacqueline\u2019s speculation had run rampant. Years ago, she\u2019d accepted that her husband had another woman. More than one so-called friend had delighted in letting her know that Reese had been seen with some blonde. A careful inspection of their cancelled checks and credit card receipts had confirmed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blonde. Men were so predictable.</p><p>Jacqueline had turned her head the other way and pretended all was right in her marriage and her life. That didn\u2019t mean this blonde-on-the-side didn\u2019t hurt. The pain of Reese\u2019s betrayal cut deep, but Jacqueline was mature enough not to dwell on such unpleasantness. Lord knew her husband hadn\u2019t come to her bed in years. As far as she was concerned, his mistress was welcome to him.</p><p>To be fair, separate bedrooms had been by mutual agreement. Early on in their marriage she\u2019d produced the requisite offspring and following a respectable two-year span they\u2019d tried for another child. But after two late miscarriages and the subsequent depressions, Jacqueline had given up hope.</p><p>All too soon Paul was no longer a boy. Almost overnight, it seemed, he was ready for college. When their son moved into a dorm room, Jacqueline had casually suggested Reese take advantage of the extra bedroom. The very next day, he\u2019d moved his things into the other room. She\u2019d been a little chagrined at the promptness of his action, but relieved, too.</p> <p>Frankly she\u2019d come to look upon sex as an intrusion. All that sweating and heaving and grinding while she did her best to pretend she was interested\u2014it was just plain silly. Oh, the lovemaking had been pleasant and even enjoyable, especially in the beginning and then for a while after Paul. She was sure it would\u2019ve been different if she\u2019d been able to carry a second pregnancy to term. Jacqueline had wanted a daughter, but that was never to be. With the perspective of the last twenty years, she understood that her lack of interest in sex was due to anxiety or perhaps guilt. Still, it didn\u2019t matter now. And she had no intention of visiting the doctors with couches in their offices to find out.</p><p>Not having a daughter was one of Jacqueline\u2019s lifelong regrets. Reese had told her years ago, when she was feeling particularly depressed, that she\u2019d have her daughter when Paul got married. And that was supposed to be a comfort!</p><p>Involuntarily, Jacqueline cringed. Tammie Lee was so far removed from what any daughter of hers would be that it wasn\u2019t worth contemplating.</p><p>\u201cJacquie, are you home?\u201d Reese shouted from the hallway leading to their respective bedrooms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a bath,\u201d she called back, setting the book aside. It was barely after seven; perhaps his interest in the other woman had waned. The scented water and bubbles sloshed as she stood up. On second thought, maybe something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t imagine what. She reached for a thick oversized towel from the heated rack. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>Reese knocked briefly on the bathroom door and, without waiting for her to respond, walked inside. His eyes widened as he took in the sight of her, breathless and rosy from the hot water, with a towel wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, flustered that he\u2019d walked in on her practically nude. At one time, her body had been sleek and lovely, but the years had taken their toll. Her stomach sagged and her breasts were those of a woman in her fifties. She pulled the towel more securely about her.</p><p>\u201cAre you kicking me out of the bathroom, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate my privacy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed to go cold for a moment before a blank look slid into place. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for a few minutes when you\u2019re available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>Reese backed out of the room and closed the door.</p><p>As Jacqueline stepped out of the tub, she realized she was trembling. She rested one hand on the counter to steady herself, and drew in a deep, calming breath while she gathered her wits. She dried off, then slipped into her satin nightgown and matching robe. She cinched it tightly about her waist and paused in an effort to still her pounding heart before seeking out her husband.</p><p>Jacqueline found Reese in the kitchen, standing in front of the open refrigerator. He removed a take-out container she\u2019d brought home from lunch two days earlier. She rarely cooked anymore, especially since Martha, their housekeeper, was more than willing to assume the task. Jacqueline had her own commitments and no longer bothered with meal preparation. Reese usually ate alone because he tended to stay late at the office. Or so he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead he lifted the lid and examined what remained of her Caesar salad with shrimp. Apparently it didn\u2019t suit him because he closed it again and stuck the container back in the refrigerator. \u201cDo we have any eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said, stepping between him and the refrigerator door. \u201cWould you like me to make you an omelet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d He acted surprised that she\u2019d offered.</p><p>Irritated, Jacqueline took the egg carton from the door and grabbed a cube of Monterey Jack cheese.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing home?\u201d she asked. If she was going to cook for him, the least Reese could do was answer her questions.</p><p>He perched on the bar stool and watched as she chose a small frying pan and set it on the burner. \u201cDo we have any mushrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Reese sighed laboriously.</p><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t tell me,\u201d she muttered and turned away. Rummaging in the vegetable bin, she located a useable green pepper, half an onion and a questionable-looking zucchini, which she deftly tossed in the garbage.</p><p>\u201cYou sent Paul and Tammie Lee a floral bouquet, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I would,\u201d she said irritably. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to explaining her actions to her husband. Since when was she accountable to Reese? And she hated the way he\u2019d been nagging her about their daughter-in-law.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from Paul?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline pinched her lips to hide her displeasure. \u201cNo, but Tammie Lee phoned to thank us for the roses,\u201d she answered with bad grace. Actually Tammie Lee had gushed with appreciation and chattered on as if she\u2019d never seen a dozen roses before.</p><p>\u201cIs that all she said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould she have said more?\u201d she snapped. Jacqueline resented this inquisition, and she wanted him to know it.</p><p>Reese glanced away. \u201cI have no idea. You were the one who spoke to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe informed me that she\u2019s thrilled about being pregnant. According to her, the pregnancy was a surprise.\u201d Jacqueline could hardly wait to hear what her country-club friends said when they learned Tammie Lee was expecting. Everyone knew her feelings toward her daughter-in-law and her hope that Paul would recognize his mistake.</p><p>\u201cI think she did it on purpose.\u201d Jacqueline bristled just saying it. Tammie Lee knew exactly what she was doing. This baby was no more an accident than Pearl Harbor had been.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paul\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need to keep having the same conversation?\u201d The pan was hot and she cut off a small slice of butter and let it melt before tossing in the chopped vegetables. Taking her frustration out on the eggs, she cracked their shells against the side of the bowl and beat three eggs into a frothy foam.</p><p>\u201cDid you sign up for the knitting class?\u201d</p><p>Reese was certainly full of questions, and she concentrated on her task rather than respond. It didn\u2019t escape her notice that he was close-mouthed about the details of his own life. She wondered how he\u2019d feel if she started asking him questions. Like why he happened to be home at this time of night when he was supposed to be with his mistress. Or why he was suddenly so curious about what Jacqueline was doing. She decided not to answer.</p><p>Jacqueline half expected Reese to be angry at her lack of response. Instead he laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I can\u2019t imagine you with a pair of knitting needles.\u201d</p><p>She decided to let that remark pass. She wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of letting him know he\u2019d annoyed her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like any grandma I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014especially in the bathtub just now, all pink and pretty.\u201d</p><p>Again Jacqueline let his comment slide. She poured the beaten eggs on the semi-cooked vegetables and added a heaping handful of grated cheese. With practiced ease she loosened the edges of omelet and flipped it over. When the eggs had cooked the way she knew Reese liked them, she slipped the omelet onto a plate and handed it to her husband.</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes lit up appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cYou never did say why you\u2019re home this early.\u201d He\u2019d already refused to answer her once and she wondered if he would again.</p><p>\u201cI was hungry,\u201d he said simply and dug into the eggs and cheese.</p><p>Whatever had really happened, Reese obviously didn\u2019t plan to tell her. She watched him a moment and then said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed to read.\u201d</p><p>Setting the dirty pan into the kitchen sink for Martha to wash in the morning, she left the kitchen.</p><p>Reese didn\u2019t say anything until she was halfway out of the room. \u201cJacquie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked in a resigned tone.</p><p>\u201cThanks for making me dinner.\u201d</p><p>She sighed audibly and slowly shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d With that she walked into her bedroom. She took off the robe and sat on the edge of the queen-size bed piled high with decorative pillows, running her hand over the lacy cover. Turning aside the down comforter, she slid beneath the cool sheets and arranged her pillows so she could sit up and read.</p><p>In the distance she heard Reese rinse off his plate and put it in the dishwasher. Soon afterward the television in the den went on; just when she was about to complain, he lowered the volume.</p><p>Jacqueline read for about ten minutes\u2014until tears unaccountably blurred her vision. She didn\u2019t understand why she was crying. Leaning across the bed to the night-stand, she plucked a tissue from the decorative box.</p><p>It was because everything was happening at once, she decided. This untimely pregnancy, and then Paul and their angry exchange the day before, followed by Reese\u2019s unexpected arrival tonight. Her life was a shambles. She\u2019d be the laughingstock of her friends, she thought bitterly. Mrs. Donovan with her white-trash daughter-in-law. Her pregnant daughter-in-law, her love-struck fool of a son and her straying husband.</p><p>Still, she was determined to prove to Reese and Paul that she\u2019d be a good grandmother if it killed her.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol was in a hopeful mood as she prepared dinner on Thursday evening. Doug was due home any minute and she was full of news. Cutting a chicken breast into bite-size pieces, she poured soy sauce over the uncooked meat to marinate for his favorite stir-fry.</p><p>She smiled when the door opened and her husband entered the condo. \u201cHi, honey,\u201d he said as he hung up his suit jacket, then joined her in the kitchen. Carol immediately turned into his arms and enthusiastically brought her lips to his. The kiss was long and involved, revealing her eagerness for lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this greeting?\u201d Doug asked, leaning back far enough to take a slow, lingering look at her.</p><p>\u201cI had a marvelous day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you did,\u201d he said. He loosened his grip on her waist and began to examine the mail, which she\u2019d placed on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cAfter you left for work I went for another walk to that yarn store I found on Tuesday. Lydia said it wasn\u2019t necessary until our class tomorrow, but I picked out the needles and yarn for the baby blanket. Just wait till I show you the picture! It\u2019s so cute!\u201d Carol rushed into the other room and produced a pattern and a ball of off-white yarn. \u201cIsn\u2019t this just perfect?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doug stared at the yarn as if he wondered how she could possibly get this excited over something so mundane.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d she said. \u201cDoug, we\u2019re going to have a baby! I feel so confident. This time everything will be different. Earlier in the week I was thinking I can\u2019t endure this agony anymore. Everything\u2019s been so hard. But all at once I have hope, real hope. Oh, Doug, Doug, we\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>She could see that some of her fervor was finally touching him. \u201cA baby,\u201d she repeated, her voice quavering with emotion. She reached for his free hand and pressed his palm against her flat stomach.</p><p>Doug\u2019s gaze held hers, desire warming his eyes. He dropped the mail on the floor and wrapped her in his arms. Their kisses were passionate, luxurious. After several minutes of escalating excitement, he drew back slightly and caught her lower lip between his teeth. Familiar with her husband\u2019s wants and needs, Carol slowly undulated her hips, stroking his arousal. She murmured words of encouragement, whispered lewd promises for him alone.</p> <p>Doug moaned softly and kissed her again. \u201cYou know what you do to me when you talk like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you do to me,\u201d she countered.</p><p>He had her blouse unfastened and half off her shoulders when they stumbled into the living room. Arms entwined, they fell onto the sofa, giggling and eager now to finish what they\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been married too long for this kind of crazy sex,\u201d Doug said as he jerked off his tie and unbuttoned his shirt.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you want to wait until later?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t either. This spontaneity was in stark contrast to the scheduled lovemaking that had become their norm. What had once been impulsive and natural was now as routine, as prosaic, as a doctor\u2019s appointment. Their focus was on timing, on the effort to match her ovulation cycle, their purpose to achieve conception. Now, for the first time in years, their lovemaking was liberated\u2014and liberating. Once he\u2019d dispensed with his suit pants and Carol her slacks, she lay back on the sofa and stretched out her arms to welcome her husband.</p><p>Doug lowered himself onto her and Carol closed her eyes at the exquisite sensation as his body linked with hers. This was the way lovemaking was supposed to be. She\u2019d nearly forgotten what it was like to feel this urgency. Their purpose was love and hope, and they were drunk on their need for each other.</p><p>With Carol\u2019s arms around Doug\u2019s neck, her fingers delved into his dark hair. She whimpered and arched to meet each thrust and gave herself over to the warmth and the joy of their lovemaking.</p><p>They held each other for a long time afterward, savoring each moment. Neither spoke, afraid, she guessed, to disrupt the peace of this joining of bodies and souls. Their coupling was an affirmation of their deep-rooted love, of their commitment and their unwavering belief that one day they would be parents. Carol was sure. She\u2019d been convinced of it the day she\u2019d walked into the yarn store and learned the project for the beginners\u2019 class was a baby blanket. It was a sign.</p><p>After a while, Doug lifted his head and kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>Sated and content, she smiled up at her husband. \u201cI love you, too. I think little Cameron\u2019s going to be very happy with his daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Colleen, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have twins, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, the more the merrier.\u201d</p><p>They continued to gaze at each other until it was too uncomfortable to remain in the same position. After dressing and straightening her blouse, Carol picked up the yarn. Just holding it brought her comfort. She\u2019d knit this baby blanket and with each stitch, each row, her unborn child would feel her love.</p><p>The phone rang after dinner while Carol was putting their plates and cutlery into the dishwasher. Doug sat in front of the television, half listening to the news and reading the paper. He lowered the sports pages and saw that Carol had answered the phone in the kitchen.</p><p>Caller ID told Carol it was her brother, Rick, a pilot for Alaska Airlines, calling from his cell phone. He was based in Juneau, Alaska, where his ex-wife, Ellie, lived, too. Rick\u2019s schedule often brought him to Seattle, but he rarely had time to see her.</p><p>\u201cHello, big brother,\u201d Carol said, her happiness evident in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cCarol, you sound wonderful. Are you...?\u201d He hesitated, but Carol knew what he was asking.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Doug and I are working on it, though\u2014all hours of the day and night.\u201d She tossed her husband a saucy look, but he was reading his paper and didn\u2019t notice. \u201cHow long are you in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight and tomorrow this time around. I fly out in the late afternoon. Any chance we can get together? Not necessarily this trip, if that doesn\u2019t work for you, but soon.\u201d</p><p>Carol immediately checked the calendar. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d His invitations were few and far between, and she\u2019d make whatever adjustments were necessary to accommodate her brother. \u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not much of a morning person.\u201d</p><p>Carol did remember the trouble her brother had always had getting up for school. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing these days?\u201d he asked conversationally.</p><p>\u201cNot much. Doug and I go to the gym three mornings a week and tomorrow afternoon I\u2019m starting a knitting class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you treat me right, once I learn I\u2019ll knit you a sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those Irish ones with all the intricate cables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I was thinking more along the lines of a simple cardigan with raglan sleeves.\u201d</p><p>Her brother chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my sister, who managed two-hundred-million dollars\u2019 worth of mutual funds, with a pair of knitting needles in her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, imagine it, because it\u2019s happening.\u201d She wondered whether he had something on his mind. \u201cAny particular reason you want to see me?\u201d</p><p>Rick didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we talked,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d get a chance to catch up. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. It doesn\u2019t sound as if tomorrow\u2019s going to work out. When are you in town next?\u201d She heard pages flipping in the background as Rick checked his work schedule. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come here for dinner?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back next week. Does that suit you and Doug?\u201d He gave her the date and Carol wrote it on the wall calendar. With the pencil still in her hand, she paused. While it wasn\u2019t unusual for her brother to call, he didn\u2019t often pursue the issue of their getting together.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Rick?\u201d He\u2019d been divorced for more than a year now and although he spoke about it matter-of-factly, even dismissively, Carol suspected the breakup had caused him a lot of pain. She didn\u2019t know the exact reasons Ellie had filed for divorce, but Carol figured it had to do with Rick\u2019s career. It couldn\u2019t be easy to maintain a relationship with a husband who was away from home so much. At one time Ellie had hinted he was unfaithful, but Carol refused to believe it. Her brother wouldn\u2019t cheat on his wife. He just wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWell...sort of okay, but I don\u2019t want to go into it now. There\u2019s nothing for you to worry about,\u201d he added, clearing his throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner next week and talk then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d Carol told him. \u201cHave you seen Mom and Dad lately?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was in Portland last weekend and they\u2019re fit as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Carol and her brother made polite conversation for a few more minutes. She frowned as she replaced the receiver, curious about Rick\u2019s problem, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cThat was Rick?\u201d Doug asked from the living room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having dinner with him next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him in a while, have we?\u201d</p><p>Carol wandered into the other room and sat on the arm of Doug\u2019s chair.</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI wish I knew, but something\u2019s going on with my brother.\u201d Resting her arm along the back of the chair, Carol leaned down and kissed the top of Doug\u2019s head. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll always love me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d he said and raised his left hand to show her his wedding ring. \u201cI\u2019m yours, whether you want me or not.\u201d</p><p>Carol relaxed against her husband\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever loved you more than I do at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are words a husband likes to hear,\u201d he said, sliding his arm around her waist and pulling Carol into his lap. She nestled in his arms, grateful to her brother who\u2019d introduced her to Doug, and to her husband for his love. Still, Rick\u2019s call bothered her and she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong. He might tell her not to worry, but how could she help it?</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix regretted signing up for the knitting class, but it was too late now. As soon as she\u2019d received her weekly paycheck, she\u2019d returned to A Good Yarn and paid for the class. She\u2019d acted impulsively; it was stupid to throw away good money on a useless knitting class. The more she thought about it, the more annoyed she felt. She\u2019d gotten suckered by some childhood fantasy of the perfect mother. Well, Alix had a mother and she was far from perfect.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s here,\u201d Laurel whispered, stepping up behind Alix at the counter. Her roommate had been seeing one of their regular patrons for about six months now, but as far as Alix was concerned, the guy was a sleaze. He might be good-looking and wear suits, but she saw what kind of movies he rented and they all began with X. His favorites were the kinkiest of the lot.</p><p>Early on, John had let Alix know he was interested in her, but she didn\u2019t encourage him. Laurel, however, had been keen on him from the first and seemed to think the world revolved around him. Laurel was welcome to John Murray, used-car salesman, but Alix wanted to tell her friend she could do better. The problem, Alix suspected, was Laurel\u2019s weight. Because she weighed well over two hundred pounds, Laurel seemed to believe no guy would want to be with her. It didn\u2019t help that she wore her thin, stringy blond hair long and straight and didn\u2019t wash it often. Her entire wardrobe consisted of jeans, T-shirts\u2014most of them with either dumb or offensive slogans\u2014and the occasional blouse. All of Alix\u2019s efforts to get her into leather and black pants had failed. Still, no matter how much she weighed or how she dressed, Laurel deserved better treatment than John gave her.</p><p>Even if John had been a different kind of guy, Alix wouldn\u2019t have been interested. She had her eye on someone else. She\u2019d made a point of being at the counter when he came in recently and learned his name was Jordan Turner. In the looks department, he wasn\u2019t anything special. Just a regular guy, clean-cut but with a nice smile and warm brown eyes. His rental history told her he didn\u2019t go for kinky stuff the way Laurel\u2019s sick puppy did. Jordan didn\u2019t watch over-the-top violent movies, either. His last visit, he\u2019d checked out True Lies and Dumb and Dumber, pretty tame compared to what Lover Boy chose. She\u2019d once known a guy named Jordan Turner, but that was in sixth grade. She\u2019d really liked him. His dad was a minister and she\u2019d gone to church a few times because Jordan had asked her to. So, in a way, her first \u201cdate\u201d had been at a church. Now, that was a laugh! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCover for me,\u201d Laurel said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cLaurel,\u201d Alix protested, biting off a warning. She hated this because she knew exactly what happened when Laurel and John slipped inside the back office and locked the door.</p><p>John watched his sicko sex videos, then returned to the video store all hot and bothered and gave Laurel ten minutes of his time. He left full of promises to take her out, which he had on rare occasions, paying her just enough attention to keep her dangling. The guy was a loser, but if Laurel didn\u2019t see that, she wasn\u2019t going to listen to anything Alix had to say.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d her friend promised, giggling as she hurried toward the back of the store, leading John by the hand.</p> <p>At least it wasn\u2019t busy. By nine in the evening, most people who were going to rent movies had already done so. There were only four or five customers browsing among the shelves.</p><p>Involved in her thoughts, Alix was surprised when she glanced up to find the very guy who\u2019d been on her mind. Jordan Turner was standing at the counter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>Caught off guard, Alix needed a moment to control her reaction. She shrugged, then asked in as casual a voice as she could manage, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please check to see if The Matrix is available?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Alix turned to the computer keyboard and typed in the movie title. Although no one would guess\u2014she hoped\u2014her heart was hammering wildly. She hadn\u2019t expected Jordan on a Thursday night. He almost always came in on Tuesdays.</p><p>\u201cI looked on the shelf, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all rented,\u201d Alix told him, staring at the computer screen. \u201cWould you like me to recommend another movie along the same lines?\u201d</p><p>He considered her offer, then shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He put Catch Me If You Can on the counter and paid for the rental. Before she could think of anything to delay him, he was gone.</p><p>Laurel reappeared at the counter, John in tow. She had a hickey on her neck and her blouse was misbuttoned. Alix glared at John who glared back, and whispered something to Laurel. Alix couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying, but she could guess. Laurel shook her head adamantly.</p><p>John was out of the store a minute later but not soon enough to suit Alix.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting him after work,\u201d Laurel informed her in a righteous tone. \u201cHe\u2019s taking me to dinner.\u201d Her eyes challenged Alix to say anything negative about John now, but Alix wasn\u2019t taking the bait.</p><p>\u201cHe certainly seems to be in a good mood,\u201d she muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Laurel said. \u201cHe sold a car today and we\u2019re going out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to fix your blouse before you leave the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Laurel said, looking down. Her fingers immediately went to work righting the last three buttons. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Alix shook her head, and lifted a tray of videos to return to the shelf.</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t come back to the apartment tonight,\u201d Laurel said, \u201cso don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>As if Alix would. \u201cI\u2019m not your mother. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother wouldn\u2019t care anyway. She dumped me with my uncle when I was ten. My nasty uncle, if that tells you anything.\u201d</p><p>Laurel\u2019s home life hadn\u2019t been any better than Alix\u2019s. They\u2019d met a year earlier when they were both living day to day, mostly in hotel rooms, and not the kind that came with small bottles of shampoo, either. When you\u2019re pulling down minimum wage, you can\u2019t afford first and last month\u2019s rent. It\u2019d taken Laurel and Alix six months to get into their current place. You\u2019d have thought they\u2019d moved into a castle when they found the apartment. Between them they could manage the rent, but with all the neighborhood renovation, Alix was afraid they\u2019d soon be out on the street. Rumor had it the apartment complex had been sold to the same company that bought the old bank.</p><p>The apartment was a dump, with sagging floors, a permanently stained bathtub and cracks in the ceiling. But it was the first home Alix had ever considered truly hers. All the furniture was stuff even Goodwill wouldn\u2019t take. She and Laurel had collected it piece by piece over the past few months, through word of mouth and a couple of times right off the street.</p><p>Neither girl was in contact with her parents. The last Alix had heard, her dad was living somewhere in California but she hadn\u2019t seen him in ten years and frankly she didn\u2019t feel she was missing much. He hadn\u2019t made any effort to find her and she had no desire to seek him out. Her mother was doing time for forging checks. No one knew that, other than Laurel, whom she\u2019d told in a moment of weakness. Alix had sent her mother several letters but when she wrote back, all she wanted was for Alix to send her money\u2014or even worse, get her stuff she shouldn\u2019t be asking for.</p><p>Alix\u2019s only other family was her older brother, but Tom had gotten mixed up with a rough crowd and ended up dead of a drug overdose five years ago. His death had hit her hard. It still did. Tom was all she\u2019d had and then he\u2019d gone and...given up. When she first heard, she\u2019d been angry, so angry that she\u2019d wanted to kill him for doing this to her. The next thing she knew, she was huddled on the floor, wishing she was eight years old again and could hide in a closet and pretend her world was safe and secure.</p><p>Without Tom, she\u2019d faltered, become reckless and got into trouble. It took her a while to find her way, but she had. These days Alix was determined not to make the same mistakes her brother had. She\u2019d looked after herself from the age of sixteen. In her own opinion, she\u2019d done a fairly good job of staying sober and sane. Sure, she\u2019d butted heads with the boys in blue a few times and been assigned a social worker, but she was proud that she\u2019d stayed out of serious trouble\u2014and off welfare.</p><p>\u201cYou got a call this afternoon,\u201d Laurel informed her just before closing. \u201cI meant to tell you but it slipped my mind.\u201d</p><p>They could afford an apartment but not a phone, so all contacts were made at the video store, which annoyed the manager. \u201cWho\u2019d be calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone named Ms. O\u2019Dell.\u201d</p><p>The social worker had started coming around after the bogus drug bust. Alix had been caught with Laurel\u2019s stash of marijuana. She still hadn\u2019t forgiven Laurel for wasting money on it in the first place and, even worse, hiding it in Alix\u2019s purse. She wasn\u2019t the one using, but no one was willing to listen to her protests of innocence, so she\u2019d shut up and accepted the black mark against her record.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d Alix asked, although Mrs. O\u2019Dell was actually returning her call. Before Alix invested all that time, energy and money in knitting the baby blanket, she wanted to be sure the effort would count toward her community-service hours.</p><p>\u201cShe said it was fine and it might help you with anger management, whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d At least the woman hadn\u2019t actually mentioned the knitting class, which saved Alix from having to tell Laurel what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>Alix narrowed her lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re roommates, Alix. You can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can,\u201d she snarled. \u201cJust like I could trust you to tell the truth to the cops.\u201d She wasn\u2019t letting Laurel forget that she\u2019d taken the fall for her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Laurel snapped and held up both hands. \u201cHave it your way.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what Alix intended.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>\u201cWe are all knitted together. Knitting keeps me connected to all the women who have made my life so rich.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Ann Norling, designer</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>A lthough I\u2019d taught knitting for a number of years, I\u2019d never worked with such an eclectic group as the women in my small beginners\u2019 class. They had absolutely nothing in common. The three of them sat stiffly at the table in the back of the store, not exchanging a word.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should begin by introducing ourselves. Explain why you decided to join this class,\u201d I said and motioned for Jacqueline to start. She was the one I worried about the most. Jacqueline was clearly part of the country-club set, and her initial reaction to Alix had been poorly disguised shock. From the look she cast me, I was afraid she was ready to make an excuse and bolt for the door. I\u2019m not sure what prompted her to stay, but I\u2019m grateful she did.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jacqueline said in a well-modulated voice, nodding at the other two women who sat across from her. \u201cMy name is Jacqueline Donovan. My husband\u2019s architectural firm is responsible for the Blossom Street renovation. I wanted to learn how to knit because I\u2019m about to become a grandmother for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Alix jerked her head up and stared at the older woman. \u201cYour husband\u2019s the one behind this whole mess? You tell him to keep his hands off my apartment, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you speak to me in that tone of voice!\u201d</p><p>The two women glared at one another. Alix was halfway out of her chair, and I had to admire Jacqueline, who didn\u2019t so much as flinch. I quickly turned to Carol. \u201cWould you mind going next?\u201d I asked and my voice must have betrayed my nervousness.</p><p>I\u2019d come to know Carol a little; she\u2019d been in the shop twice already and had bought yarn. I knew why she\u2019d joined the class and hoped we could be friends.</p><p>\u201cYes, hi,\u201d Carol said, sounding as unsettled as I felt.</p><p>Alix continued to glare at Jacqueline but the older woman did a masterful job of ignoring her. I should have known something like this would happen, but felt powerless to stop it. Alix and Jacqueline were about as different as any two women could be.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Carol Girard and my husband and I are hoping for a child. I\u2019m currently undergoing fertility treatments. I\u2019m having an IVF attempt in July. The reason I\u2019m in this class is that I want to knit a blanket for my yet-to-be-conceived baby.\u201d</p><p>I could see from Alix\u2019s face that she didn\u2019t understand the term.</p><p>\u201cIVF refers to in vitro fertilization,\u201d Carol explained.</p><p>\u201cI read a wonderful article about that in a recent issue of Newsweek magazine,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what doctors can do these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there are quite a few miracle drugs available now, but thus far Doug and I haven\u2019t received our miracle.\u201d</p><p>The look of longing on Carol\u2019s face was so intense, I yearned to put my hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJuly is our last chance at the IVF process,\u201d she added. Carol bit down on her lower lip and I wondered if she knew how much of her anxiety she revealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they do to you with this in vitro stuff?\u201d Alix asked, leaning forward. She seemed genuinely interested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rather long, drawn-out process,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you want me to take class time to go though it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind?\u201d Alix asked, surprising me with her curiosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jacqueline chimed in, but I doubted that her interest was as sincere as Alix\u2019s seemed to be.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Carol said, clasping her hands on the table, \u201cit all starts with drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everything?\u201d Alix laughed at her own joke, but no one else joined in.</p><p>\u201cI was on this drug that stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs, and once the eggs appeared, they had to be harvested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly slightly, but all I had to do was think about a baby, and any discomfort was worth it. We both want to be parents so badly.\u201d</p><p>That much was obvious, and from what I\u2019d seen of Carol I was sure she\u2019d be a wonderful mother.</p><p>\u201cAfter the doctor collected Doug\u2019s sperm, my eggs were inseminated to create a number of embryo cultures. These are then transferred to my uterus. We\u2019ve had two attempts that didn\u2019t succeed, and the insurance company will only pay for three and, well, it\u2019s just very important that I get pregnant this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re putting lots of stress on yourself,\u201d Alix said in what I found to be an insightful comment.</p> <p>\u201cHow nerve-racking for you both,\u201d Jacqueline murmured.</p><p>\u201cI feel so confident, though.\u201d Carol positively beamed with it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why, but for the first time in months I feel really good about all of this. We decided to wait after our last attempt. Mostly because Doug and I needed a while to deal with our disappointment over the second failure. I also felt it was necessary to prepare myself physically and mentally. But it\u2019s going to work this time. I just know we\u2019re going to have our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do,\u201d Alix said. \u201cPeople who want children should have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always adoption,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cHave you considered that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d Carol replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a viable option, but we don\u2019t want to try for adoption until we\u2019ve done everything possible to have a biological child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, there\u2019s quite a waiting period,\u201d Jacqueline said and then seemed to regret speaking.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know...Doug and I have talked about that, too. We might have to look into an overseas adoption but we\u2019ve read that those can be difficult. Anyway, these are all options we\u2019re willing to consider if we can\u2019t have our own child, but we\u2019ll make those decisions when and if the time comes.\u201d</p><p>I waited a moment and then gestured to Alix. \u201cTell us a little about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. \u201cMy name\u2019s Alix Townsend and I work at the video store across the street.\u201d</p><p>I hoped she wouldn\u2019t mention working on the baby blanket to deduct hours from her court-ordered community service, but I couldn\u2019t stop her if she did. Once Jacqueline heard that, I figured she\u2019d probably walk right out of the class. Forgive me for being so mercenary, but Jacqueline would buy far more yarn than Alix ever could.</p><p>\u201cI happen to like living in this neighborhood,\u201d Alix said pointedly, \u201cand I hope I can continue to live here once they\u2019re through screwing up the street.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she stared across the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d Jacqueline muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d I said, still standing, \u201cthat we could discuss the different weights and types of yarn for our first lesson.\u201d I felt an urgent need to distract Alix, although I was a strong supporter of the Linus Project. \u201cThe pattern I\u2019ve chosen is one of my favorites. What I like about this particular pattern is that it\u2019s challenging enough to keep you interested, but not so difficult as to discourage you. It\u2019s done in a four-ply worsted weight yarn and knits up fairly quickly.\u201d</p><p>I had a large wicker basket filled with samples of several worsted weight yarns in a variety of colors. \u201cI know it might sound rather self-serving, but I feel I should mention something here. Always buy high-quality yarn. When you\u2019re investing your time and effort in a project, you defeat yourself before you even start if you use bargain-basement yarn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree one-hundred percent,\u201d Jacqueline said firmly. I\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.</p><p>\u201cWhat if some people can\u2019t afford the high-priced stuff?\u201d Alix demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that could make things difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said anyone taking the class gets a twenty-percent discount on yarn. Are you sticking to that or have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sticking to it,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t have a lot of change jingling around in the bottom of my purse.\u201d She reached for a pretty pink-and-white blend of wool and acrylic. \u201cThis costs how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive dollars a skein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor each one?\u201d A horrified look came over her.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow many would I need if I knit the blanket using this?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the pattern and then calculated the yardage of the worsted against the total amount of yarn required for the project. I grabbed my calculator. \u201cIt looks like five should do nicely. If you only use four you can return the fifth one to me for a full refund.\u201d</p><p>Alix stood and reached into her pocket and dragged out a crumpled five-dollar bill. \u201cI can only buy one this week, but I should be able to pick up the second one next week, if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to get the same dye lot for each project, so I\u2019ll put aside what you need and you can pay me as you go.\u201d</p><p>Alix looked pleased. \u201cThat works for me. I suppose the lady married to that fancy architect can buy all the yarn in your shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Jacqueline and I\u2019d prefer that you use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you all to choose your yarn now, if you would,\u201d I said quickly, cutting the two of them off before Alix leaped across the table and attacked Jacqueline. I hated to admit it, but the older woman wasn\u2019t the most personable soul. Her attitude, although different, wasn\u2019t any better than Alix\u2019s.</p><p>Jacqueline sat by herself and took up half the table. When Carol arrived, she\u2019d had no choice but to sit next to Alix. It was clear from Jacqueline\u2019s manner that she expected to be catered to, not only in this class, but in life.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help wondering what I\u2019d gotten myself into with these knitting classes, and frankly I was worried. I\u2019d thought...I\u2019d hoped to make friends with my customers, but this was starting off all wrong.</p><p>The class lasted two hours and we barely got through casting on stitches. I chose the knitting on method, which is by far the simplest way to learn but not the preferred method. I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm my three students during their first lesson.</p><p>I had reason to doubt my teaching abilities by the end of the class. Carol picked up the technique immediately, but Alix was all fingers. Jacqueline didn\u2019t take to it quickly, either. When at last it was closing time, my head was pounding with an approaching headache and I felt as if I\u2019d run a marathon.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Margaret phoned just as I was getting ready to close for the day.</p><p>\u201cA Good Yarn,\u201d I said, scooping up the receiver, hoping to sound upbeat and eager to be of service.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d my sister returned in a crisp business tone. With a voice like that, she should be working for the Internal Revenue Service. \u201cI thought we should discuss Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>She was right. Opening the store had so completely consumed me that I hadn\u2019t remembered. \u201cOf course, we need to do something special for Mom.\u201d It would be our first Mother\u2019s Day without Dad and I realized it was going to be difficult for all of us, but especially for Mom. Despite our differences, Margaret and I did something together every year to honor our mother.</p><p>\u201cThe girls suggested we take her to lunch on Saturday. We\u2019re seeing Matt\u2019s mother on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea, but my shop is open on Saturdays.\u201d I knew Saturday was a prime business day and I couldn\u2019t afford not to be open; I closed the shop on Mondays instead.</p><p>My sister hesitated and when she spoke again, she seemed almost gleeful. It didn\u2019t take me long to discover why.</p><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t get away, the girls and I will see Mom on Saturday and you can have your own time with her on Sunday.\u201d This meant Margaret wouldn\u2019t have to share our mother with me. Mom\u2019s attention would be on my sister, which was clearly why Margaret had arranged things this way. I didn\u2019t understand why everything had to be a competition for her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d all be together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not working on Sunday, are you?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sagged. \u201cNo, but...well, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice, do I?\u201d Margaret said in the surly, aggressive tone I have long detested. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who can\u2019t make lunch on Saturday. I suppose you want me to adjust my schedule to yours, but I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words, but I could read between the lines. I do have a husband, you know, and he has a mother, too. For once we wanted to spend Mother\u2019s Day with her.\u201d</p><p>Rather than get into an argument, I kept my voice as unemotional as possible. \u201cPerhaps we could compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Mom would love to have lunch on the waterfront. I could meet you there and close the shop for a couple of hours. That way we could all be together and then I\u2019d join her on Sunday, as well.\u201d</p><p>I could tell from the lengthy pause that Margaret wasn\u2019t happy with that idea. \u201cYou expect me to pick up Mom and drive into Seattle on a Saturday afternoon\u2014because it\u2019s more convenient for you? We both know how dreadful the traffic is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather we celebrated Mother\u2019s Day separately this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Perhaps we should.\u201d I left it at that and made a mental note to call Mom to explain.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ve got that settled.\u201d I noticed that Margaret didn\u2019t ask about my first two weeks of business. Nor did she make any other inquiries or give me an opportunity to ask what was going on in her life.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cJulia\u2019s dancing class starts in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her my love,\u201d I said. My two nieces were a joy to me. I loved them deeply and felt close to both Julia and Hailey. Sensing my feelings, Margaret did her best to keep the girls away from me. But now that they were pre-teens, they had minds of their own. We often chatted and I suspected they didn\u2019t let their mother know.</p><p>My sister hung up without so much as a goodbye. That was typical behavior for Margaret.</p><p>I walked over to the front door and turned over the sign to read Closed. As I did, I saw Brad Goetz coming out of the apartment building where Alix lived. He was in a hurry, half-jogging to his truck. I couldn\u2019t see where he\u2019d parked, but I thought I knew the reason for his rush. He was handsome and eligible, and there was every likelihood he had a Friday-night date. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could\u2019ve been the one joining him for dinner\u2014only I wasn\u2019t.

After the first sip she stepped into the kitchen and brought out the hors d\u2019oeuvre platter for their guests. Martha had put together crackers artfully swirled with herb-mixed cream cheese and decorated with tiny shrimp. Paul had phoned earlier in the week to ask if he and Tammie Lee could stop by the house on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>They\u2019d spent the Mother\u2019s Day weekend in Louisiana with Tammie Lee\u2019s mother, who apparently wasn\u2019t feeling well. Jacqueline had made a conscious decision not to take offense.</p><p>This was the first time Paul had ever asked permission to visit the family home, and Jacqueline\u2019s nerves had been badly frayed ever since his phone call.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Reese said, following her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a good feeling about this,\u201d Jacqueline murmured. She glanced at the clock on the microwave and realized it was a full ten minutes before her son and daughter-in-law were due to arrive. She cringed at the prospect of making small talk with Tammie Lee, and feared that Paul was about to announce he\u2019d accepted a transfer to the New Orleans branch so Tammie Lee could be close to her family.</p><p>\u201cSetting up an appointment to come over here isn\u2019t like Paul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was just being thoughtful.\u201d Reese walked around the counter and sat on a stool. \u201cIsn\u2019t knitting supposed to soothe your nerves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d Jacqueline snapped. \u201cI\u2019m dropping out of that ridiculous class.\u201d</p><p>His head flew back at the vehemence of her declaration. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the look on Reese\u2019s face\u2014as if he was disappointed in her. But he wasn\u2019t the one confronting that ill-mannered punk rocker or whatever those people called themselves these days. Alix, spelled A-L-I-X, resembled a gang member; the girl frightened her. \u201cWhy should you care what I do?\u201d Jacqueline leaned against the counter across from her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed excited about it last week,\u201d he said blandly. It was obviously of no consequence to him. \u201cI thought it was a conciliatory gesture on your part. I assumed you signed up for the classes to show Paul you\u2019re planning to be a good grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am determined to be a wonderful grandmother. For heaven\u2019s sake, what chance does a child of Tammie Lee\u2019s have? She\u2019ll grow up learning how to pickle pigs\u2019 feet.\u201d She shivered at the very idea.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Jacqueline...\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I blame you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Reese straightened and for a moment he seemed about to laugh outright. \u201cYou blame me for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the fact that I\u2019m in this...this awful knitting class.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young woman in the class. I can\u2019t imagine why she\u2019d ever want to learn to knit, but it\u2019s not important. She\u2019s vile, Reese. That\u2019s the only word I can think of to describe her. Her hair is the most ludicrous shade of purple and she took an instant dislike to me when she learned that you\u2019re responsible for what\u2019s happening in the Blossom Street neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Reese reached for his wine. \u201cMost people there welcome the renovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix lives in the apartment building at the end of the street.\u201d As far as Jacqueline could see, it was a rat-infested dump. If it was slated for demolition, all the better. Alix and her kind would need to look elsewhere for low-rent housing. Girls like that weren\u2019t wanted in an upscale neighborhood, which Blossom Street would soon become.</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d Reese murmured and sipped his wine. \u201cNow I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s planned for the building?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t been decided.\u201d Reese gently swirled his wine against the sides of the goblet. \u201cThe city is talking to the owner. My idea was to completely remodel the place into condos, but it seems some advocates for low-income housing now have the mayor\u2019s ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. Those low-rent people will ruin the neighborhood. You might as well kiss all your hard work goodbye.\u201d She hated to sound like a pessimist, but if Alix was any indication of the quality of person living in that building, then the entire street was at risk.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should give the knitting class another try,\u201d Reese suggested, ignoring her outburst.</p><p>The truth of it was that Jacqueline wanted to continue. She hadn\u2019t found the class \u201cawful\u201d at all; that was an exaggeration for Reese\u2019s benefit. Other than the confrontation with Alix, she\u2019d enjoyed the lesson. At one point, Lydia had told them to walk around the shop and choose three balls of yarn in their favorite colors. At the time it\u2019d seemed like a useless exercise. Jacqueline had chosen a silver gloss, a deep purple and a vibrant red. Lydia\u2019s next instruction had been to choose wool in the color she disliked most. Jacqueline had gone immediately to a skein of bright yellow, which was the color that appealed to her least. Lydia had talked about contrasting colors and showed how they often complement each other. In fact, the yellow had looked completely different against the purple, and just as Lydia had said, the contrast was surprisingly effective.</p><p>She\u2019d discovered that so much of knitting was about choosing the textures and colors, which was something she hadn\u2019t considered before. Jacqueline had walked out of the class with the realization that she\u2019d learn far more than the basic knitting stitches. That, however, did little to quell her uneasiness concerning Alix.</p><p>\u201cI might decide to attend the second beginners\u2019 session later in the summer,\u201d Jacqueline muttered, still unsure of what to do. She\u2019d paid for the entire six-week course and detested the thought of some hoodlum driving her away with intimidation and ill-manners.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Jacqueline felt the tension crawl up her spine. While Reese answered the door, she forced a smile and moved into the formal living room, hands clasped in front of her. She waited for Reese to greet Paul and Tammie Lee in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful to see you both,\u201d Jacqueline purred, extending her arms to Tammie Lee and her son as they entered the room. She briefly hugged her daughter-in-law and grazed Paul\u2019s cheek with her lips. Now that she knew Tammie Lee was pregnant, she wondered how she hadn\u2019t guessed earlier. Her daughter-in-law was definitely showing\u2014enough to be wearing a maternity top.</p><p>Paul and Tammie Lee sat on the sofa, so close their shoulders touched. They held hands, as if to proclaim that nothing would tear them apart.</p><p>While Reese poured a glass of wine for Paul, Jacqueline carried in the platter of hors d\u2019oeuvres. Tammie Lee smiled up at Jacqueline.</p><p>\u201cI just love shrimp and ever since I\u2019ve been pregnant I\u2019ve had the worst craving for them,\u201d she said in a soft twang. \u201cJust ask Paul. I think he must be thoroughly sick of shrimp, but he never complains.\u201d She gazed lovingly toward her husband as she accepted a small napkin and two crackers.</p><p>Paul cast his wife a look of love and pride, and it was all Jacqueline could do to maintain her composure. For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t understand what her son saw in this girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d Reese asked Tammie Lee when he brought Paul his wineglass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice of you to ask, but I\u2019m just fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>If there was anything for which to be grateful, Jacqueline mused, it was the fact that Tammie Lee seemed to be taking care of herself during the pregnancy. At least she had that much common sense.</p><p>Reese and Jacqueline sat across from them in leather chairs, with a polished mahogany end table between them. They so rarely used the formal living room that five years after she\u2019d purchased the chairs they still smelled of new leather.</p><p>\u201cI think we should tell them,\u201d Tammie Lee whispered to Paul.</p><p>Paul nodded and squeezed her hand. \u201cTammie Lee had an ultrasound this afternoon and it seems we\u2019re having a baby girl.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSometimes they can\u2019t be sure, but our technician was quite positive it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl,\u201d Reese repeated and the happiness in his voice was unmistakable. He stood and clapped Paul on the back. \u201cDid you hear that, Jacquie? We\u2019re finally getting our baby girl!\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline felt her hands go numb. \u201cA granddaughter,\u201d she repeated as the odd tingling sensation spread up her arms. Oh, how she\u2019d once longed for a daughter.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t chosen any names yet,\u201d Tammie Lee rushed to add in that soft drawl of hers. It always made her sound as if she was talking underwater. \u201cWe only decided this afternoon that we wanted to know the sex of the baby. You\u2019re the first people we\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I had always hoped for a little girl,\u201d Reese said, echoing Jacqueline\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...wonderful,\u201d Jacqueline finally managed.</p><p>\u201cWe decided we should let you know, Mom,\u201d Paul said, directing his attention to her for the first time, \u201cso you\u2019d know what color yarn to get for the baby blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Donovan, I declare, when Paul told me you were knitting a blanket for the baby, it just warmed my heart. Y\u2019all have been so kind to me.\u201d She planted both hands over her stomach and sighed.</p><p>That twang of Tammie Lee\u2019s put Jacqueline\u2019s teeth on edge. Some might find it pleasing, but to Jacqueline it sounded uneducated. Unrefined.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more news,\u201d Paul said, moving toward the edge of the sofa cushion.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Reese said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that.\u201d Paul laughed shortly.</p><p>Tammie Lee grinned at her husband. \u201cTwins! I\u2019m so nervous about one baby, I can\u2019t even imagine what would happen if we had two.\u201d</p><p>Paul turned to share such a gentle look with his wife that Jacqueline glanced away. Any hope she had of her son regretting his marriage died a quick death.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your other news?\u201d Reese asked.</p><p>Paul\u2019s face brightened. \u201cI got word last week that Tammie Lee and I have been accepted into the Seattle Country Club.\u201d The club, to which Jacqueline and Reese belonged, was the most prestigious in the area. New memberships were limited to only a few each year. It went without saying that only the right kind of people were accepted. One of Jacqueline\u2019s first thoughts when she was introduced to Tammie Lee was that Paul had ruined his chances of ever joining the country club.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased,\u201d Jacqueline said, doing her best to smile. Apparently Tammie Lee\u2019s lengthy and inappropriate discussions of southern cuisine hadn\u2019t been as much of a detriment as she\u2019d assumed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asked to work on the cookbook committee,\u201d Tammie Lee gushed as if this was the greatest compliment of her life. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times someone\u2019s asked me to share my mama\u2019s, Aunt Thelma\u2019s and Aunt Frieda\u2019s favorite recipes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRecipes for what?\u201d Jacqueline blurted out the question before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cMainly folks want to know about hush puppies. Four or five ladies have already asked me about those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush puppies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like cornbread, Mother,\u201d Paul supplied.</p> <p>\u201cI know what they are,\u201d she said between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cPaul loves my hush puppies,\u201d Tammie Lee twanged in her eagerness to continue. \u201cMy mama told me they got their name from hunters who threw leftover ends of the cornbread to their dogs to keep \u2019em quiet at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the recipe you\u2019re submitting to the Seattle Country Club Cookbook?\u201d Jacqueline was convinced she\u2019d never be able to show her face in public again.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I asked Mama for Grandma\u2019s recipe for Brunswick stew, which is my daddy\u2019s all-time favorite. My grandma was raised in Georgia before she married my grandpa and moved to Tennessee. I was almost eighteen before we moved to Louisiana, so I really consider myself a bluegrass girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrunswick stew,\u201d Jacqueline said. That at least sounded presentable.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a southern version of chili. Mama always served it when we had a barbecue. Mama has Grandma\u2019s original recipe and I\u2019ll need to change it a bit. Everyone uses pork or chicken nowadays, instead of possum or squirrel.\u201d</p><p>One more word from this woman and Jacqueline was afraid she\u2019d keel over in a dead faint.</p><p>\u201cI hope you give them your recipe for deep-fried okra,\u201d Paul said as if he\u2019d never tasted anything so good in his life. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what Tammie Lee does with okra. I swear I\u2019ve died and gone to heaven.\u201d</p><p>Once and only once had Jacqueline sampled the slimy green vegetable. It\u2019d been in some kind of soup dish. Never having seen it before, she\u2019d lifted it from the bowl and been repulsed by the thick slime that had dripped from her spoon. She\u2019d nearly gagged just looking at it and now her son was telling her he enjoyed this disgusting vegetable.</p><p>\u201cI have a recipe for pecan pie that\u2019s a family favorite and I\u2019d be happy to share that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think it\u2019s because of Tammie Lee\u2019s cooking that we got accepted by the country club.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline had to bite her lip to keep from reminding Paul that she\u2019d been volunteering there for years. Her charity projects had been some of the club\u2019s most successful fund-raising events. Reese\u2019s name carried plenty of weight, too, but apparently their son hadn\u2019t taken his parents\u2019 longstanding contribution into account. Oh, no, he assumed it was Tammie Lee\u2019s method of cooking road kill\u2014squirrel, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2014that had opened the doors.</p><p>\u201cYou do seem to be full of good news,\u201d Reese said, grinning in a way that conveyed his delight.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jacqueline agreed, making an effort to look equally delighted. She was trying, trying hard, but it was difficult.</p><p>\u201cI declare I don\u2019t know any couple happier than Paul and me,\u201d Tammie Lee drawled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe any man has as much love for a woman as Paul does for me, especially since we found out about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have you as part of our family,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cI can feel your love,\u201d Tammie Lee said, looking at Reese. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t thank you enough for welcoming me the way you have.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes connected with Jacqueline\u2019s. He knew her feelings. She might be able to fool Tammie Lee, but her son knew her all too well. Until now, Paul had protected his young wife from her disapproval. At one time, mother and son had shared a special closeness, but since the advent of Tammie Lee, that had virtually disappeared.</p><p>In that moment, Jacqueline saw the fierce challenge in her son\u2019s gaze. She knew that if she said one word to hurt Tammie Lee, he\u2019d never forgive her.</p> <p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol placed the bouquet of fresh flowers in the center of the dinner table and stepped back to examine her handiwork. She\u2019d walked down to Pike Place Market early in the afternoon and purchased the white lilies and red astromeria, along with fresh salmon and just-picked baby asparagus spears. She\u2019d arranged the flowers herself, using a porcelain vase that had come with the roses Doug had sent on their last anniversary.</p><p>For so many years, all her efforts and energy had gone into her career. When she\u2019d first quit her job she\u2019d faltered, unsure of how to fill her days. She would\u2019ve been completely lost if not for her online support group. These women had become as close as sisters; they all struggled with the problems of infertility and gave each other information and encouragement. She was heartened to discover that several of the other women had started knitting for relaxation and a sense of accomplishment. Carol shared those goals, but for her knitting was also a symbol of the life she wanted to live, would live\u2014as a mother.</p><p>Everything had changed for the better the day she\u2019d found the knitting shop on Blossom Street.</p><p>After meeting Lydia and the others last week, it was as if a whole world had opened up to her. For the first time she looked upon her condo as more than a place to sleep and occasionally entertain. It was her home and she decided to make it a real one, with small feminine touches that conveyed her love for her husband and soon-to-be child.</p><p>Usually when her brother stopped by they went out to eat. This evening, Carol was cooking their meal. Rick had sounded troubled when he\u2019d phoned and she wanted to create a comfortable, intimate atmosphere where they could talk freely. The shopping and flower-arranging had taken up most of the afternoon, but she\u2019d loved every minute of it. Six months ago she would\u2019ve scoffed at the idea of arranging flowers or spending a morning wandering the aisles at a local farmer\u2019s market. Now those small domestic activities were a source of pleasure and satisfaction. Because she was doing them for her family.</p><p>Rick called from the lobby and Carol hurried to meet him at the door, hugging her brother hard as soon as he stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Rick said, leaning back, apparently surprised by the warmth of her greeting. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be knocked off my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Rick laughed and looked around the condo. \u201cWhere\u2019s Doug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe phoned\u2014he\u2019s running late. I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be much longer.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch as she led Rick into the living room. Doug hadn\u2019t shown nearly as much enthusiasm about this dinner with Rick as she had. \u201cWould you like a beer?\u201d Her brother preferred ale to hard liquor. He only drank when he was twenty-four hours from flying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one.\u201d He sat down where he had an unobstructed view of the waterfront and was quiet for a long moment as he gazed out the window. He accepted the beer and smiled his thanks. \u201cCan I do anything to help with dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. Everything\u2019s almost ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done all right for yourself, little sister,\u201d he said, sounding almost sad. He tipped back the beer bottle and took a drink.</p><p>\u201cSo have you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Rick chuckled softly. \u201cHave I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Rick,\u201d she said, trying to lighten his somber mood. \u201cYou\u2019re a pilot for a major airline. It\u2019s your dream come true.\u201d Her brother had worked his way up through the ranks. For as long as Carol could remember, Rick had talked about being a pilot. From the time he could drive, he started hanging around airports, talking to the pilots, learning what he could.</p><p>He smiled as if in agreement. \u201cI should be happy, then, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d She went into the living room, abandoning the salad she\u2019d set on the counter. The finishing touches could wait. Sitting across from him, she leaned close. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d He laughed off the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me. I\u2019m fine. Forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to forget it. Now, tell me what\u2019s on your mind. You didn\u2019t come all this way to check out my view for the umpteenth time.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, dismissing her question. \u201cActually, I was in a great mood until I saw what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what have I done?\u201d Carol asked with a smile. \u201cAnd why would that ruin your mood?\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked around, and, after a few minutes, frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, but there\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed. Actually, everything was in the same place it\u2019d been during his last visit. The furniture was all the same, too; outwardly very little had changed. Yet the condo felt transformed. The flowers and polished wood and shining glass were small things, but they expressed her new attitude toward home and what it meant. This was a place of love, a place waiting to welcome a child.</p><p>\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d Carol confirmed, \u201cbut I\u2019m the one who\u2019s changed. I\u2019m happy, Rick, genuinely happy.\u201d</p><p>The forlorn expression on her brother\u2019s face was enough to bring tears to her eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathed. He leaned forward and braced his arms against his legs, letting the beer dangle between his parted knees. \u201cNothing seems right without Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Her brother and Ellie had divorced a year ago. He\u2019d never spoken of the breakup before, and his willingness to introduce the subject now was an indication of how miserable he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still in love with her,\u201d he confessed, \u201cbut I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Carol held her breath. Because she loved and respected both her brother and his wife, she\u2019d done her best to stay out of it. The one conversation she\u2019d had with Ellie since the divorce had been awkward and unsettling, and Carol hadn\u2019t phoned her since.</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t the only one in the dark, either. Even her parents didn\u2019t know what had caused the dissolution of Rick\u2019s marriage. Whatever it was, he seemed to regret his divorce and want his ex-wife back. \u201cHave you been in touch with Ellie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Rick nodded. \u201cShe said it\u2019d be better if we went our separate ways. I tried, Carol, I gave it a real effort, but my life isn\u2019t any good without her. I had no idea it would be like this.\u201d He briefly tilted his head toward the ceiling and forcefully expelled his breath. \u201cI hear she\u2019s dating again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must hurt.\u201d Rick and Ellie had been college sweethearts. Carol remembered the first time she\u2019d met the outgoing blonde. She\u2019d instantly liked Rick\u2019s girlfriend and had hoped to have her as a sister one day.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of Ellie with some other man is driving me insane. All I can think about is how stupid I\u2019ve been. I\u2019d give anything to work this out with her. If it meant quitting my job, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Carol felt at a loss to help him, especially since she still didn\u2019t know what had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you want to explain what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d he asked, his eyes widening. \u201cI assumed she had.\u201d</p><p>Carol shook her head. \u201cI called her after you told me she\u2019d filed for divorce, but she said she\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that Ellie had been sobbing at the time. Until the end, Carol had hoped the two of them would be able to settle their differences and reunite. After the divorce, though, it seemed Ellie was intent on moving forward with her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m away from home so much,\u201d her brother said. \u201cIt gets lonely, you know?\u201d</p> <p>This was what Ellie had implied but Carol had refused to accept it. Rick would never do such a thing, she\u2019d told herself. He was her older brother, her hero. Still, she had to know. \u201cYou...didn\u2019t have an affair, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that...But Ellie\u2014well, she can\u2019t accept the fact that I\u2019m around beautiful women on the job and away from home. It became a trust issue.\u201d</p><p>Carol wouldn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable with Doug constantly being around other women, either, but she didn\u2019t say so. Her brother didn\u2019t need to hear about her own insecurities.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she felt that way,\u201d Rick went on. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellie I love.\u201d He wiped his face in a weary gesture. \u201cI tried to convince her that she\u2019s the only woman for me but she wouldn\u2019t listen. I can\u2019t believe she threw away our marriage because she didn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t believe it, either, but she kept her thoughts to herself. There were two possibilities: Ellie had been jealous and irrational or there was more to Rick\u2019s behavior than he was saying.</p> <p>\u201cI did everything I could to talk Ellie out of the divorce,\u201d he continued. \u201cOkay, so maybe I was tempted, but hell, what am I supposed to do every night? Sit in my hotel room and watch television? I did go out occasionally. Can you really blame me for that?\u201d</p><p>Maybe there was some basis for Ellie\u2019s distrust. Still, Carol found it practically inconceivable that her brother would cheat on his wife. He was an honorable man but he was a man, and if he had a drink with a flight attendant or a female pilot now and then\u2014was that so bad? Perhaps Ellie had simply overreacted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be grateful we delayed having a family,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Carol agreed; if there was anything to be grateful for, it was that. She hated the thought of children suffering the upheaval of a broken home.</p><p>\u201cEllie wanted kids, but I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAny idea what I should do now?\u201d he asked, peering at her as if she could provide him with answers.</p><p>She patted his arm gently, not knowing how to respond. Rick could be his own worst enemy. He\u2019d always been a sociable person, the life of the party, a natural daredevil, and she\u2019d loved and admired him as her gallant older brother. It saddened her to see how unhappy he was.</p><p>\u201cYou need to prove yourself to Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Carol, I\u2019m at my wits\u2019 end. Ellie claims she doesn\u2019t want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could write to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter yet, use e-mail. Tell her you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she already knows that.\u201d For the first time since they\u2019d started talking, she saw a hint of smile on his face. \u201cWhat if she won\u2019t answer me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t take no for an answer. Let her know you aren\u2019t giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I send her flowers? That kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her strawberries and fresh fruit from the Pike Place Market.\u201d Fresh fruit was available in Juneau, but it was extremely expensive. \u201cA whole basket,\u201d Carol suggested. \u201cAs I recall, Ellie loves blueberries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick! You should know that. She was your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d her brother moaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay her near enough attention. I didn\u2019t realize how much I loved her until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and it was the same boyish smile she remembered from childhood. \u201cYour enthusiasm is catching. You really think I can win her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried. It felt good to have her brother turn to her, to need her help. Rick had made a mistake and hadn\u2019t fought for his marriage, but she\u2019d do everything she could to support him.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>L aurel owed Alix, so she had her roommate cover for her the minute Jordan Turner showed up at the video store on Tuesday night. As soon as she saw that he was getting ready to leave, she slipped out front and pretended to be on break. Her hand shook as she lit a cigarette; she leaned against the building and took a deep drag, hoping the nicotine would calm her.</p><p>When the door opened and Jordan stepped outside, Alix called to him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I didn\u2019t see you earlier,\u201d she lied. \u201cI put aside The Matrix for you if you\u2019re still interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please.\u201d She reached for her cigarettes and silently offered him one.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve guessed he was a nonsmoker. She stared at the tip of her lit cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m trying to cut back. These are the low-nicotine cigarettes, but I swear I\u2019m going to end up with a hernia getting any taste out of this.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her stupid joke and a warm, happy feeling came over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you around the neighborhood,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cAlix Townsend. Alix, spelled A-L-I-X.\u201d She thrust out her hand, which he shook. \u201cYou\u2019re Jordan Turner,\u201d she went on before he had a chance to introduce himself. \u201cYour driver\u2019s license is on file. You live off Fifth Avenue, don\u2019t you?\u201d She didn\u2019t mind letting him know she was interested. She thought of the boy she\u2019d once known with the same name, but that was years ago, back in grade school. He\u2019d been a decent kid, and she\u2019d had a crush on him, but it felt like something that had happened in another time and another place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Could it be the same Jordan Turner? She studied him, wondering if it was possible. She took another deep drag of the cigarette in an effort to calm her rattled nerves.</p><p>No, this couldn\u2019t be the same Jordan Turner, she decided. Still, her memories of him were fleeting and she wasn\u2019t absolutely sure. She might have dredged up the courage to ask, except that he continued the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t work far from here.\u201d</p><p>So he stopped in for videos on his way home from work. Lots of people did.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell a lot about a person from the videos they rent,\u201d she said casually. She tossed the cigarette onto the sidewalk and crushed it with the toe of her combat boot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I learned about you?\u201d This was one of her best conversational gambits\u2014character analysis through movie selection\u2014although she didn\u2019t have much opportunity to use it.</p><p>He grinned, and she was struck by how cute he was when he smiled. Laurel couldn\u2019t understand what Alix saw in a guy as average as Jordan. She couldn\u2019t explain it to her friend, either. Someone attracted to a guy who rented XXX videos just wouldn\u2019t get it.</p><p>Jordan leaned against the wall beside her. \u201cGo ahead and tell me what you\u2019ve figured out.\u201d</p><p>Flustered now, Alix suddenly found it difficult to express herself. She faltered and struggled with what she wanted to say and to her utter humiliation, she couldn\u2019t do it. In one final attempt to redeem herself, she gestured weakly with her hands and said. \u201cThey\u2019re cool, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool?\u201d Jordan repeated. \u201cYou mean I pick cool movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She wanted to crumple onto the sidewalk and disappear.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The heat was radiating from her face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work,\u201d she said gruffly and without another word, she practically ran back into the store.</p><p>To make matters worse, Laurel was waiting for her. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d her roommate asked eagerly the instant Alix returned.</p><p>Alix glared at her.</p><p>Laurel raised both hands. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling attacked Alix\u2019s stomach. It was like the nausea she\u2019d experienced as a kid when her parents started to fight. That painful sensation used to corrode her stomach\u2014as if she were somehow responsible for every bad thing that had befallen their lives. Jordan might be the same Jordan Turner she\u2019d once known, but there\u2019d been no time to ask. And she couldn\u2019t now, not after she\u2019d run away!</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Laurel asked, studying her.</p><p>Alix brushed aside the question and marched to the back of the store, where she walked into the employee rest room. The toilet was disgusting. She didn\u2019t want to guess how long it\u2019d been since the last cleaning. The blue additive didn\u2019t begin to disguise the yellow ring around the inside of the bowl. Funny she\u2019d notice that now.</p><p>Standing in front of the sink, Alix stared into the mirror. The voices that came to taunt her were familiar ones. They were the ugly, negative voices that shouted words she tried to ignore. Voices that laughed in her face and said she was a loser. No matter what she did or how hard she tried, she\u2019d never amount to anything. Her life was doomed. This was her lot. She\u2019d never earn more than minimum wage, never be loved, never have a real home with things that normal people took for granted, like a phone and a dishwasher.</p><p>Pressing her hands to her face, Alix closed her eyes and felt the dark misery descend. She could feel its oppressive weight settle on her shoulders, shoving her down to a place deep inside. She tried unsuccessfully to shake off the depression, tried to shake off the ugly words that echoed in her mind.</p><p>The repulsive names her mother had called her rang through her head. She could hear a teacher\u2019s chastisement and belittling comments next, and the humiliation returned as strong now as it had been twelve years earlier. She wanted to bury all the hurtful words. Instead they reverberated through her mind with such force she nearly slumped to the rest room floor.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, startling her. Alix jerked her head toward the noise.</p><p>\u201cAlix, you in there?\u201d</p><p>Laurel. Damn. \u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy you were just talking to. I don\u2019t know his name.\u201d</p><p>Alix bit her lower lip. \u201cYou help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laurel said irritably. \u201cAm I supposed to read minds, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute, all right?\u201d Alix straightened, brushing her hands through her hair as she came to grips with this information. She wondered what possible reason Jordan could have for seeking her out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because her face was beet-red, she ran cold water over her hands and then brought them to her cheeks, not caring what it did to her makeup.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how much time had passed before she finally found the courage to come out and face Jordan.</p><p>He was standing at the counter waiting. He smiled as she approached.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d she asked as if he\u2019d interrupted her. She didn\u2019t want to give him the impression that she was happy to see him, and in truth, she wasn\u2019t. After humiliating herself once, she didn\u2019t feel like doing it again. Not this soon, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d put aside The Matrix for me?\u201d</p><p>Her relief was intense. \u201cOh, yeah, I almost forgot. I\u2019ve got it up front.\u201d She moved past him and behind the counter to the spot where she\u2019d placed the video.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you doing that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, busying herself with the computer screen. She rang up the total and asked for his card. After he\u2019d paid her the rental fee, she set the video in its protective plastic case, then slipped it inside a bag and handed it to him over the counter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a special on microwave popcorn this week if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I bought a case at Costco my last visit. I\u2019ve got enough popcorn to last me for the next ten years.\u201d</p> <p>She rested her elbows on the counter, feeling awkward and a bit embarrassed. She had no idea what to say, what to ask. If she mentioned the Jordan Turner from sixth grade, it would sound like a pick-up line. \u201cUh, any other movies you want me to put aside for you?\u201d That wasn\u2019t exactly a scintillating question but at least it made sense.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t think of any at the moment, but if I do I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Jordan left. The glass door closed and as if by magic Laurel appeared. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA movie, what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come he only wanted you to help him?\u201d</p> <p>Alix didn\u2019t feel inclined to go into the details. \u201cHow am I supposed to know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get all snappy with me.\u201d</p><p>The door chimed and to Alix\u2019s astonishment, Jordan stuck his head inside. \u201cAlix, what time do you get off work?\u201d</p><p>She was too shocked to answer immediately. \u201cEleven. I close three nights a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you close tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m here until nine on Wednesdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to meet for coffee then? After work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d She found it hard to believe he was actually asking her out. Well, sort of out. \u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d she said as if it wasn\u2019t any big deal.</p> <p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d He waved and was gone.</p><p>A bubble of happiness rose up inside her. It demanded every ounce of restraint she possessed not to stamp her feet with joy.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>\u201cKnitting\u2014my Amazing Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Nancie M. Wiseman, Editor, Cast On magazine and author of Classic Knitted Vests and The Knitter\u2019s Book of Finishing Techniques</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>M y mother phoned me early in the week to suggest she, Margaret and I go out to the cemetery together on Memorial Day to visit my father\u2019s grave. It had only been a few months since we laid Daddy to rest. These were difficult days for Mom as she had yet to find her footing as a widow.</p><p>I readily agreed to join her, but I wondered about Margaret\u2019s response. She\u2019d managed to manipulate the situation so we didn\u2019t see each other on Mother\u2019s Day. At every family function, my sister acts prickly and standoffish. It seems she\u2019d prefer to forget we have the same parents. More than once, the thought has passed through my mind that Margaret would rather I was the one who\u2019d died instead of our father. That isn\u2019t a pleasant notion to entertain, but given her attitude, I feel it\u2019s true. Yet I continue to try. Some perverse part of me refuses to let go. She\u2019s my sister. Having been so close to death, I feel that even though we might not like each other, we need each other.</p><p>I arrived at my mother\u2019s place early Monday afternoon and found Mom sipping tea on the back patio near her garden. She\u2019d dressed in her long black skirt and silk blouse and sat in the wicker chair, enjoying the sunshine.</p><p>The roses were trimmed and budding, and the sweet aroma of the lilac bush scented the air. I could see from the linen hankie clutched in her hands that Mom had been weeping.</p><p>I moved beside her, wordlessly pressing my hand to her shoulder. She glanced up and managed a teary smile before she laid her hand over mine and gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. \u201cI still miss him, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I whispered, emotion choking my voice.</p><p>\u201cDad would be upset to see us so maudlin. It\u2019s such a lovely day and soon I\u2019ll have both my daughters with me. How can I possibly be sad?\u201d She reached for the teapot and I realized she\u2019d brought out a second cup, expecting me to join her. Without asking she poured and I sat down beside her.</p><p>We chatted a bit. Mom was full of questions about A Good Yarn, my beginning class and the three women who\u2019d signed up. I mentioned Jacqueline, Carol and Alix frequently and talked to her about my other customers, too. Slowly, one by one, I was building my clientele and perhaps just as importantly, I was making friends. My world expanded a little more with each day and I was happy. Whiskers was, too, and has taken to spending time in the shop, often sunning himself in the front window. My cat\u2019s become a real conversation starter, and charms my customers no end. He accepts all the attention as his due.</p><p>Because of the holiday weekend, my beginners\u2019 class decided to skip the previous Friday. Jacqueline and Carol were both going out of town. Alix didn\u2019t divulge her plans, but I suspected she didn\u2019t have much opportunity to get out of the city.</p><p>I was pleased with the progress each woman had made. I\u2019d had a bit of a challenge talking Jacqueline into staying in the class. She\u2019d planned to quit before the third session, but I convinced her to keep at it. I had the feeling she wanted me to change her mind and I\u2019m glad I did. There\u2019d been a couple of rough moments when Alix dropped a stitch during the second class and let loose with a blue streak that nearly put Jacqueline in a coma. Immediately I suggested Alix find an alternative method of expressing her frustration. To my surprise, she apologized and my appreciation for her increased. Alix isn\u2019t so bad once you get to know her.</p><p>Carol\u2019s my star pupil, already half done with the baby blanket, and eyeing other projects. She\u2019s been coming by the shop at least twice a week, often staying to chat. Whiskers sat in her lap a couple of times, just to show he approves of my choice of a friend.</p><p>Mom loves hearing stories about my customers. We talk nearly every day. She needs that and frankly, so do I. I might be thirty years old but a girl never outgrows her need for her mother.</p><p>\u201cMargaret and the girls will be here at one,\u201d Mom said conversationally, but I wasn\u2019t fooled. She was giving me fair warning. She set her china cup in the saucer and rested her hands in her lap. My mother possesses a natural grace I envy. Margaret\u2019s a great deal like her in that regard.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to describe my mother. One might well assume she\u2019s as fragile as she looks, but that\u2019s not the case. She\u2019s strong in ways I can only admire. She was a fierce advocate for me in dealing with the doctors and the insurance company during my bouts with cancer. She\u2019s loving and generous and constantly tries to meet the needs of others. Her one drawback is in coping with sickness. She couldn\u2019t bear to see me\u2014or anyone else\u2014suffer and tended to simply withdraw. Fortunately, Dad was always there for me.</p><p>\u201cAre Julia and Hailey coming with Margaret?\u201d I asked. My two nieces are a source of wonder to me. The likelihood of my ever bearing children was slim to none, so my sister\u2019s daughters hold an important place in my heart. Margaret seemed to sense this and, for whatever reason, jealously guarded her daughters, keeping them away from me as much as possible.</p><p>Julia and Hailey, however, recognized my genuine affection and much to Margaret\u2019s consternation, loved me unabashedly. Their undiluted joy at every chance encounter rankled Margaret so much that she did whatever she could to block my access to my nieces.</p><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d Nine-year-old Hailey loped into the backyard, her arms extended. When she saw me, she squealed with delight and after hugging my mother, vaulted into my arms, nearly strangling me in her enthusiasm.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old Julia was a bit more restrained, but her eyes revealed her pleasure at seeing me. I stretched out my free arm to her and when she stepped toward me, we clasped hands and I squeezed her fingers. How tall Julia had grown, more woman than child now, and such a beauty. My heart swelled with pride at the sight of her.</p><p>\u201cAunt Lydia, will you teach me how to knit?\u201d Hailey begged, still clinging to me.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder just in time to see my sister and brother-in-law come out the back door and onto the patio where I sat with my mother and the girls. From the frown Margaret wore, I could see she\u2019d heard the question. \u201cI\u2019d love to teach you, but it\u2019s up to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d Margaret said sharply. Hailey placed her arm around my shoulders, unwilling to release me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Matt,\u201d I said.</p><p>My brother-in-law grinned and winked at me. I remember when Matt and Margaret first started dating. Because she\u2019s five years older than me, I viewed seventeen-year-old Matt as mature and sophisticated, a man of the world. They\u2019d married young and my father disapproved, believing Margaret should wait until she\u2019d graduated from college. She did finish her schooling but hasn\u2019t used her education in the way Dad wanted. My sister has worked at a number of jobs through the years but she\u2019s never found any position that\u2019s really suited her. Margaret is currently employed part-time at a travel agency, but she\u2019s never discussed her job with me. I do applaud her decision to be home as much as possible for the girls, but I\u2019ve avoided sharing my thoughts, uncertain of their reception.</p><p>After a brief exchange of chitchat and news, we drove out to the cemetery in two cars. Mom had brought a large bouquet of lilacs from her garden, and Julia and Hailey set them in the receptacle at my father\u2019s gravesite. A large number of American flags flapped in the wind across the cemetery, reminding us of the men and women who sacrificed their lives for our country.</p><p>I\u2019ve always found cemeteries curious places. As a child, I had an almost ghoulish fascination with tombstones. I especially enjoyed reading the epitaphs on those from the 1800s and early 1900s. While Margaret and my parents paid their respects to my grandparents, I\u2019d invariably wander off. I broke my leg when I was five when a statue of the Virgin Mary fell over on me. I didn\u2019t tell Mom and Dad that I\u2019d been climbing on her at the time, hoping to look at her face.</p><p>I never really knew my grandparents. One set lived on the East Coast and visited only on rare occasions. My mother\u2019s family had come to Seattle at the time of the Great Depression, but her parents had died shortly after I was born. Each Memorial Day we visited their graves and placed flowers by their headstones. I felt little emotion for my long-dead relatives, perhaps a twinge now and then, wishing I remembered them, but that was about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now as I stared down at my father\u2019s marker, so fresh and new, a surge of harsh grief came over me. The marble tablet said so little. His name, JAMES HOWARD HOFFMAN, and the dates of his birth and death: May 20, 1940\u2014December 29, 2003.</p><p>Birth to death, and all that appeared between those two events was a dash. That silent dash said nothing about his two tours of duty in Vietnam, or his unwavering love for his wife and daughters. That dash couldn\u2019t possibly reveal the countless hours he\u2019d spent at my bedside, comforting me, reading to me, doing whatever he could to help me. There are no words to describe the depth of my father\u2019s love.</p><p>The familiar blinding pain struck me then. One consequence of the tumor that continues to linger is migraine headaches. With the new medicines now available, I can almost always catch them early. The telltale signs are unmistakable. This one, however, had caught me by surprise.</p><p>I fumbled in my purse for the pills I carried with me constantly. My mother, aware of my situation, came toward me when she saw me stumble. \u201cLydia, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>I breathed in slowly and deeply. \u201cI need to get home,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes to the blinding sunlight.</p><p>\u201cMargaret, Matt,\u201d Mom called urgently. She slid her arm around my waist. Within minutes she\u2019d bundled me into the car but instead of having Matt drive me to my own small apartment above the yarn shop, my mother insisted on bringing me to her house.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before I was in bed in the room where I\u2019d spent most of my childhood. The shades were drawn. Mom draped cool washcloths on my forehead and then tiptoed out of the room to allow me to sleep.</p><p>I knew that once the medication had been given a chance to work, I\u2019d sleep for a couple of hours. Afterward I\u2019d be fine, but reaching that point\u2014the beginning of relief\u2014was difficult.</p><p>Soon after my mother left and the horrible throbbing was at its peak, I heard the bedroom door creak open again. Although I was completely prone and my eyes were closed, I knew it was my sister who\u2019d walked into the room.</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it, could you?\u201d Her words were weighted with bitterness. \u201cYou can\u2019t let a day pass without being the center of attention, can you?\u201d</p><p>I found it hard to fathom that my sister would seriously believe I\u2019d intentionally bring on a migraine for the sake of a few minutes\u2019 attention. If Margaret had ever suffered with one, she\u2019d know differently. But I was in no shape to argue, so I kept silent.</p><p>\u201cSomeday it\u2019s only going to be the two of us, you know.\u201d</p><p>I did know and wanted so badly to have a good relationship with my sister. If I hadn\u2019t been hounded by pain I would\u2019ve tried to explain how much I wished things could be different between us.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to step in and pick up where Mom and Dad left off, you\u2019re sadly mistaken.\u201d</p><p>I almost smiled. I couldn\u2019t imagine Margaret doing anything of the kind.</p> <p>\u201cI refuse to pamper and spoil you. It\u2019s time you grew up and became an adult, Lydia. In fact, it\u2019s long past time you accepted responsibility for your own life. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you can look for sympathy elsewhere.\u201d Having made her great pronouncement, she stalked out of the room.</p><p>The sound of the slammed door reverberated through my head. My lungs froze and my heart skipped a beat. With the cool washcloth over my face, it took me a moment to realize tears had dripped from my eyes.</p><p>Now more than ever, I was convinced that a relationship with Margaret was impossible.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>J acqueline checked her reflection in the hall mirror and sighed, praying for patience. Paul and Tammie Lee had invited her and Reese to their home for a barbecue. She couldn\u2019t refuse; Paul would easily see through any excuse. Trapped, Jacqueline had no choice but to grit her teeth and make the best of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Reese asked for the third time.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, Jacqueline joined him. He was jingling his car keys and pacing back and forth in front of the kitchen door that led to the garage.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get out of this?\u201d she asked, knowing it was impossible.</p><p>Reese gave her one of his looks. He had several expressions that spoke as clearly as words, and over the years she\u2019d come to identify them all. This one was the off-center humorless smile that conveyed his displeasure at something she\u2019d said or done.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong this time?\u201d she asked, fuming. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re actually looking forward to this barbecue?\u201d Heaven only knew what Tammie Lee might prepare for their dinner. Grilled possum? Barbecued squirrel?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d her husband said. \u201cPaul wants us to get to know Tammie Lee and love her the way he does.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline shook her head in a gesture of denial and frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, no matter how many barbecues he insists we attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is give Tammie Lee a chance.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline was beginning to resent Reese\u2019s attitude. Her husband was well aware of the importance of marrying the right person. He hadn\u2019t chosen her because of her cute smile. Their parents were good friends, and she\u2019d attended all the best schools and so had he. Yes, she\u2019d loved Reese, but there was so much more to finding an appropriate marriage partner than love, which in her opinion was highly overrated, anyway.</p><p>She feared Paul was fast becoming like his father, with his brains situated somewhere below his waistline. Only Paul had married the girl. If he held genuine feelings for Tammie Lee, then her son should do as his father had and set her up someplace, visiting her once a week. Jacqueline didn\u2019t know the extent of her husband\u2019s monetary investment in his Tuesday-night woman, but she suspected it was substantial. She hadn\u2019t checked his financial records after the first year, preferring not to learn the truth. His absence each Tuesday night told her all she needed to know.</p><p>They rode in silence to Paul and Tammie Lee\u2019s house, a respectable two-story near Kirkland with a nice view of Lake Washington. Smoke spiraled from the backyard and Jacqueline suspected they\u2019d already put on the meat. Good! The sooner this family gathering was over the better.</p><p>Reese rang the doorbell and together they stood on the steps and waited. Tammie Lee opened the door in bare feet, frayed jean shorts and a maternity top, looking like she\u2019d stepped out of the 1960s television series Petticoat Junction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she drawled, reaching for Jacqueline\u2019s hands and practically dragging her into the house.</p><p>\u201cMom. Dad.\u201d Paul was directly behind his wife. He shook hands with his father and briefly hugged Jacqueline.</p><p>Jacqueline didn\u2019t mean to start the afternoon off on a negative note, but she didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for Tammie Lee to be traipsing around the house barefoot. God knows what she could step on or where she might slip.</p><p>\u201cI hesitate to mention this, but shouldn\u2019t you be wearing shoes?\u201d She\u2019d asked out of genuine concern for the girl, but Jacqueline could see from the way Paul\u2019s mouth thinned that he was annoyed with her.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re right,\u201d Tammie Lee said, leading everyone through the house and into the freshly mowed backyard. \u201cBless his heart, Paul keeps telling me the same thing, but I just can\u2019t make myself wear shoes. I kick \u2019em off the minute I walk in the door. Then last week I made the mistake of walking around the yard in my bare feet and I stepped on a slug.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline cringed.</p><p>\u201cI started screaming like the Holy Spirit had come down upon me.\u201d</p><p>Paul chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve never run so fast in my life. I thought she\u2019d been attacked by a swarm of bees or something.\u201d</p><p>The patio table was already set and Tammie Lee held up two pitchers of iced tea. \u201cSweetened or unsweetened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>In Jacqueline\u2019s view, iced tea should be served only one way and that was unsweetened. Anyone who wanted to add sugar could do so at the time it was served.</p><p>\u201cUnsweetened,\u201d she said and took her place at the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the same,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>Tammie Lee poured the tea and handed a glass to Jacqueline, who frowned at the green leaf floating on top. \u201cThere seems to be something in my tea,\u201d she said, picking up her spoon to remove it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mint leaf,\u201d Tammie Lee said. \u201cMy mama wouldn\u2019t let me serve iced tea without fresh mint and lemon slices.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like a fool, Jacqueline leaned back in her chair, determined not to say another word. Of course it was mint\u2014she should\u2019ve recognized it\u2014but with Tammie Lee one never knew what to expect.</p><p>\u201cThis is very pleasant. It was nice of you to invite us over,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>Jacqueline stared daggers at him. Nothing about this day was pleasant and he damn well knew it.</p><p>\u201cActually it was Tammie Lee\u2019s idea,\u201d Paul said, standing in front of the barbecue. To her relief, whatever he was cooking smelled divine. The meat sizzled and Paul coated it liberally with some garlicky kind of sauce.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tammie Lee said, returning to the patio with a notebook and pen. She pulled out a chair and sat down at the table with Jacqueline and Reese. She opened her notebook to a clean page. \u201cI wanted to ask you about family traditions,\u201d she said eagerly. \u201cIt\u2019s just so important for Paul and me to start some family traditions, and I wanted to include yours as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraditions?\u201d Jacqueline repeated as if she\u2019d never heard the word before.</p><p>\u201cYes, you know. Like Derby Day?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline exchanged a quizzical look with her husband.</p><p>\u201cThe Kentucky Derby,\u201d Tammie Lee explained, glancing from one to the other as if expecting them to smile and nod and exclaim \u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daddy and all my uncles would wear their white suits and Panama hats, and Mama and my aunts would cook for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t feel as strongly about the Kentucky Derby here in Seattle as your family does, sweetheart,\u201d Paul said, joining them at the round patio table. He shared a smile with his father. \u201cTell her about Christmas, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d Jacqueline repeated. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you used to hang my stockings on the fireplace mantel every Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I haven\u2019t done that in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about football?\u201d Tammie Lee said excitedly. \u201cY\u2019all enjoy football here, don\u2019t you?\u201d Her drawl had thickened as she grew more enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d It was Paul who answered this time. \u201cBoth Dad and I are Husky fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! We\u2019ll do tailgate parties. Mama says tailgate parties are a lot like church. All the women dress up in their Sunday best and cook up a tornado. Then we spend hours praying for a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Both Paul and Reese laughed but Jacqueline didn\u2019t see the humor in it. \u201cWhy would you pray?\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee grinned. \u201cSo our team would win.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline managed a tight smile.</p><p>As it turned out, the barbecue wasn\u2019t as bad as Jacqueline had feared. She\u2019d had visions of her daughter-in-law\u2019s centerpiece being prepared by a taxidermist, but Tammie Lee had set out a lovely floral arrangement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All in all, the afternoon was reasonably pleasant\u2014to use Reese\u2019s word\u2014despite Jacqueline\u2019s dire predictions. Dinner consisted of a delightful guacamole and blue corn chips, grilled brisket and potato salad, which was surprisingly good. The jalapeno cornbread was a bit spicy, but Jacqueline had a small piece. Reese raved about the meal, and Tammie Lee beamed with pleasure at his endless compliments. Now that she\u2019d reduced her work hours, her daughter-in-law had time to lavish on meals to please her husband. As a young married woman, Jacqueline had done the same thing. These days, her interest in cooking was nil.</p><p>On the drive home, Reese and Jacqueline were silent. Most of the dinner conversation had revolved around family traditions. Apparently Tammie Lee\u2019s family had quite a few, and she happily described each one in lengthy detail, frequently mentioning Aunt Thelma and Aunt Frieda, as well as \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cDaddy.\u201d Jacqueline had begun to wonder if the girl was homesick.</p><p>Well, if she was, Tammie Lee could pack her bags and go visit her mama. With his wife out of the house, perhaps Paul would come to his senses.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of traditions with Paul, did we?\u201d Reese said as they pulled out onto the freeway entrance.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we did,\u201d she countered, although she\u2019d been hard-pressed to think of any over dinner. \u201cWe made gingerbread houses with him every Christmas, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was years ago, when he was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there was always the Easter Egg hunt at the country club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Paul and I used to bring you breakfast in bed every Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jacqueline said, instantly feeling a sense of relief. She hadn\u2019t failed completely as a mother. \u201cJust because we didn\u2019t dress up in those dreadful white seersucker suits and Panama hats to watch the Kentucky Derby doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t have meaningful traditions with our son.\u201d</p> <p>Reese took his eyes off the road long enough to glance at her. \u201cDo you remember the year Paul insisted on making you Eggs Benedict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, it took Martha months to get the stovetop clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you ate every bite. You were such a trouper,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever loved you more than I did that day.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline\u2019s smile faded as she stared out the passenger window. They had loved each other, and in their own ways, they still did. All this talk about traditions and family had stirred up the dust of bygone years, swirling a storm of happy memories in her direction. It was all a bit unsettling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Paul and Tammie Lee want to start traditions with their daughter,\u201d Reese said as they neared the house. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jacqueline answered softly. She very much wanted that for her grandchild. She imagined a little girl, dark-haired like Paul, her small arms reaching up to Jacqueline. Tammie Lee might not be her first choice of a wife for her son, but Paul seemed happy. Soon he\u2019d make her a grandmother. Yes, there were a few compensations to be found in this marriage.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, Jacqueline felt better than she had in months. Perhaps Reese was right and she was being too hard on the girl.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol had been in a good mood all week. She and Doug had impulsively gone out for a wonderful Thai dinner last night, she\u2019d had some encouraging conversations with her online group, and her knitting skills were improving daily. She was looking forward to her class the following day, the fourth in the series. In the last three weeks she\u2019d begun to really enjoy knitting and tackled it with the same energy and enthusiasm she brought to everything in her life. Her first blanket had been a bit flawed; it had a few uneven stitches, so she\u2019d donated it to the Linus Project and bought the yarn for a second one. She had much better control of the yarn\u2019s tension and was pleased with how this new blanket was turning out.</p><p>Carrying in the mail, she set it on the table. An envelope addressed to her was on top and Carol recognized the married name of a college friend who\u2019d moved to California. She tore open the envelope, excited to hear from Christine. It didn\u2019t take her long to discover that it wasn\u2019t a letter as she\u2019d hoped, but a birth announcement.</p><p>In that instant, Carol\u2019s good mood spiraled downward. She caught her breath and sank into a kitchen chair as she read the details about Christine\u2019s infant born just two weeks earlier on May 27th. A baby boy, the card said.</p><p>Christine was the kind of woman who did everything according to a predetermined schedule. That included marrying the perfect man, getting pregnant exactly when she\u2019d planned to, and then delivering a healthy baby.</p><p>Carol swallowed hard. Few people would understand the depression she felt at that moment. Only her online friends could fully appreciate her feelings.</p> <p>Carol sat staring at the wall as she tried to overcome her sense of inadequacy and frustration. She was genuinely happy for Christine and Bill. Yet at the same time, she wanted to pull her hair out and scream at the heavens\u2014demand to know why she wasn\u2019t pregnant. Why her body didn\u2019t function the way other women\u2019s bodies did. These were all questions she\u2019d asked herself dozens of times, questions she\u2019d asked every expert she\u2019d met, and still she had no answers.</p><p>Eventually she would have a baby. Carol had to believe that. But it was taking so much longer than she\u2019d ever imagined. The waiting was the most maddening. She had to wait for the medical appointments with the specialists. Then she had to wait for the tests, wait for the treatments and wait again for additional treatments. They weren\u2019t pleasant experiences, either. Forget about privacy and modesty. Forget about everything except this compulsion to have a child.</p><p>Carol\u2019s periods had become far more than a monthly nuisance; it was as if her whole world centered on her menstrual cycle. And when they did start, her heart broke and she struggled with the bitterness of disappointment.</p><p>Every month that passed\u2014every period that came\u2014was like an hour chimed off by a grandfather clock. At best she had only twelve opportunities a year to conceive and if she wanted a second child or possibly a third, God only knew how many more years that would take.</p><p>Carol knew a lot of her friends thought of her as obsessed and moody. She was. But she was also afraid, so terribly afraid.</p><p>Making love with Doug had taken on a routine quality. Sex on schedule. And then the frantic wait, the frequent visits to the bathroom, just to check. Had her period started? And when it did...</p><p>This IVF had to work, it just had to.</p><p>If only someone could give her a definite answer. If only Dr. Ford would tell her and Doug one way or the other whether they could ever have a child. If his diagnosis was negative then they\u2019d learn to deal with it, make adjustments, make other plans.</p><p>Instead he allowed them to hope and twice now, they\u2019d plummeted into despair when the IVF failed and she\u2019d miscarried. Twice they\u2019d recovered, willing to try again, willing to do anything and everything, sacrifice all, for a baby.</p><p>Carol rubbed her eyes and stood to put on water for a cup of tea\u2014decaffeinated, of course. She\u2019d begun to avoid so many foods for fear they would hinder conception. Her grocery list read like an inventory list for a health food store. Some experts felt diet was critical; other medical professionals disagreed. Carol wasn\u2019t taking any chances. She was going to try anything that might help her stay pregnant.</p><p>In so many ways it felt as if her entire life was on hold. She\u2019d left a promising career, went to the best doctors, ate all the right foods, listened to all the motivational tapes and repeated the mantras she\u2019d learned. She had to believe her mind could control her body and that the sheer force of her determination would eventually give her what she wanted most.</p><p>Filling the teakettle with water, she set it on the burner and sat down again while she waited for the water to boil. A short handwritten note from Christine caught her eye. Carol hadn\u2019t noticed it at the bottom of the birth announcement. Christine\u2019s lovely cursive said: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in so long!\u201d</p><p>There was a very good reason for that. Carol\u2019s friendship with Christine wasn\u2019t the only one she\u2019d allowed to lapse. She\u2019d ignored many of her close friends, mainly because the struggle to get pregnant demanded so much energy. Most of the women she knew were already mothers, and her friends with children socialized primarily with other friends who had children.</p><p>Carol and Doug had less and less in common with these friends, whose lives seemed to revolve around babies and playgrounds and birthday parties. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, there were often lengthy discussions that excluded them. Conversations about schools or day care, about tantrums and teething problems.</p><p>Then there were the so-called friends who dismissed their difficulties, who trivialized her desire for a child. One heartless woman in the office had laughingly suggested Carol was welcome to raise one of her four. Other people wanted to comfort her by saying it wouldn\u2019t be long now and modern medicine was so wonderful that within a year\u2019s time she was sure to be pregnant. Well, she wasn\u2019t, and the most horrible fear of all had taken root. There might never be a baby for her and Doug. She could hardly bear it, but she\u2019d rather face the truth than continue like this.</p><p>The kettle whistled and she slowly stood and poured the boiling water into the pot. She couldn\u2019t allow such negative thoughts to invade her mind. That only made things worse. She had to believe. She couldn\u2019t let a birth announcement do this to her. God had given her a sign. She had to believe, push aside all negative thinking. She had faith....</p><p>The door opened and Carol whirled around, surprised to realize it was so late. \u201cDoug! Is it that time already?\u201d She tried to sound cheerful but knew she\u2019d failed.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, studying her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d she asked, returning her attention to the teapot.</p><p>\u201cSure. It was fine.\u201d</p><p>Doug immediately zeroed in on the mail. He walked over to the table and discovered Christine and Bill\u2019s birth announcement. She watched his face as he read it, and wanted to cry out in pain at the longing she saw in his eyes. After a moment he set it aside as if it were a matter of only the slightest interest. She knew otherwise.</p><p>\u201cThey had a boy,\u201d she said, fighting to keep the emotion out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>It should\u2019ve been them, she wanted to scream. They should be the couple mailing out birth announcements. They were good people. They had a strong marriage and they\u2019d be wonderful parents....</p><p>The infertility was a constant stress on their marriage. Doug had dealt with as much of the indignity as she had. The semen collection in a bathroom off Dr. Ford\u2019s waiting room, the post-coital examinations\u2014all of this was dreadful for him.</p><p>People assured her that one day they\u2019d laugh about it. Carol didn\u2019t think that was possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost half done with the second baby blanket. I have another class tomorrow afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her husband nodded and grabbed the newspaper, heading for his favorite chair in the living room.</p><p>Carol wanted to shout at him to talk to her. Instead she bit her tongue and began preparing dinner, a meal she had no appetite for.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p> <p>S itting at a window table in Starbucks, Alix concentrated on moving the stitches from one needle to the other and completing the row. No one else in class seemed to have a problem with this basic knitting concept. Carol was already working on her second blanket. Jacqueline was having a few difficulties, but not nearly as many as Alix. No matter how hard she concentrated, Alix would start out with a hundred and seventy-one stitches and by the time she finished the row, there\u2019d be a hundred and eighty or more. Or less, depending on what she\u2019d done wrong.</p><p>Lydia reassured her on a regular basis that this was a common problem and explained with limitless patience that Alix wasn\u2019t completing the stitch properly. Well, duh! Then she\u2019d show her again. And Alix would make the same stupid mistake. She didn\u2019t care; she wasn\u2019t giving up until she learned to knit, even if it killed her. She already had thirty bucks invested in this project!</p><p>At the end of the row Alix paused, sipped her frappuccino, a rare treat, and counted the stitches. Damn! A hundred and eighty-three! She\u2019d done it again and added stitches where she shouldn\u2019t. \u201cDamn, damn, damn,\u201d she muttered, which was a tame version of what she was thinking. Apparently being around Jacqueline was rubbing off on her. She barely used the F-word anymore.</p><p>Shoving the knitting onto her lap, Alix closed her eyes, trying to ignore the frustration. This class was supposed to help her with anger management? That was a joke if she\u2019d ever heard one.</p><p>Even more irritating, Laurel was at the apartment with John and had asked Alix to stay away for a couple of hours. She didn\u2019t know what was going on with those two, but Alix didn\u2019t think it could possibly be good. Things had gotten pretty intense between them recently. John had been making regular appearances at the video store, and Alix hated the way Laurel gushed all over the sleaze. As far as she was concerned, John was bad news.</p> <p>Once her nerves were calm, Alix carefully unraveled the row, taking out one stitch at a time, which took more effort than it did to complete the frigging row in the first place. Two stitches from the end of the row, she lost her grip on the needle and dropped a stitch. A muttered curse escaped before she could stop herself.</p><p>Good thing Jacqueline wasn\u2019t there to hear it. She was offended each and every time the knitting got the better of Alix, which unfortunately was often. Still, she was improving.</p><p>Thus far, Alix had avoided a confrontation with the other woman, but she could feel one brewing. At best Jacqueline tolerated Alix, and Alix felt the same way about her.</p><p>Jacqueline had a twisted view of the world, in Alix\u2019s opinion. The only things that seemed important to her were pretense and prestige. At each class, she sat and chatted away, putting on airs as if anyone really cared who she saw at social events and club meetings. Most of the time, Alix didn\u2019t know who she was talking about, anyway. Jacqueline spent most of the lesson name-dropping or discussing some ritzy party she\u2019d attended. Well, la-di-da!</p><p>Biting down on her lower lip, Alix managed to pick up the dropped stitch and then just before she could slip it onto the needle, she lost it and the whole thing unraveled another two rows.</p><p>She muttered an even more furious curse under her breath and was tempted to ditch the entire project. If she had any sense she\u2019d throw it in the garbage, needles and all, and slam out the door.</p> <p>Alix felt someone\u2019s presence and glanced up to find Jordan Turner standing next to her table. Her mouth went dry and her mind went blank. He was the last person she\u2019d expected to see.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re having a bit of trouble.\u201d He pulled out the chair beside her, turned it around and sat down facing her.</p><p>All Alix could do was stare at him with her mouth hanging open. She hadn\u2019t seen him in a couple of weeks. After suggesting they have coffee sometime, he\u2019d vanished. Alix had been bummed out ever since. It was the story of her life; the minute she showed interest in a guy he either ended up in jail or skipped town.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, making sure he knew she wasn\u2019t pleased to see him.</p><p>\u201cActually, I came in looking for you.\u201d He folded his arms over the top of the chair and leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cSure you did.\u201d That was the type of line John fed Laurel. Alix wasn\u2019t going to fall for it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. You can talk to Danny. I went into the store and asked him if he knew where I could find you.\u201d Danny worked part-time during the day shift and was reliable. If she asked him about it, he\u2019d be square with her.</p><p>Ignoring Jordan, she caught the dropped stitch and finished the row before she raised her eyes. \u201cWhy were you looking for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d buy you a cup of coffee. Are you always this difficult?\u201d</p><p>She fixed her gaze on him and refused to blink. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this I-don\u2019t-give-a-damn attitude is for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>She smiled despite her mood. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Her lack of welcome apparently didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>Alix picked up her knitting again. It sounded childish and petty to say she was disappointed because he\u2019d led her to believe he\u2019d be by to take her to coffee. Then...nothing. Rather than tell him all that, she started knitting again, paying close attention to her stitches, concentrating as she completed the action of slipping it onto the next needle. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around lately,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>\u201cAre you implying you missed me? I thought a lot about you while I was away, you know.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, looked up and felt a smile lift one side of her mouth. \u201cI might have.\u201d</p><p>He liked hearing that; Alix could tell by the way he shifted in his chair and leaned closer. He watched her for a moment and then asked, \u201cWhat are you knitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby blanket for the Linus Project.\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that. There was a notice in the church bulletin about it a couple of months ago.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he went to church, too? She really knew how to pick \u2019em. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m doing this wonderful deed out of the kindness of my heart,\u201d she said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m not putting this much effort into a baby blanket out of civic duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why knit it for the Linus Project?\u201d</p><p>She might as well admit the truth, and looked up, wanting to gauge his reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to serve the community hours the court assigned me.\u201d If that didn\u2019t scare him off, then nothing would. She believed in being honest, and if this clean-cut guy was still interested in her, great. If not, she was better off knowing that now.</p><p>\u201cCourt-ordered community service? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crossed the law and the law won,\u201d she said, finishing the row and paying less attention to the stitches than she should. \u201cBut it was a bogus rap and the judge knew it. I got community service instead of jail time. Does that shock a good boy like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she believed him but let it slide.</p><p>\u201cMy mother knits.\u201d</p><p>Alix stopped herself just in time from telling him that her mother was in prison. Enough honesty for today, she decided; no need to overload him with the truth. His interest flattered her, and she rather liked the fact that he\u2019d sought her out. Glancing up, she was tempted to ask what grade school he\u2019d attended, still wondering if he was the Jordan Turner she\u2019d once known. She only half remembered what that boy had looked like, although she recalled he\u2019d worn glasses. Unlike this Jordan. She might have asked, except that he posed a question instead.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the display counter in the front. \u201cThey\u2019ve got great scones if there are any left. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat,\u201d she said which wasn\u2019t the most gracious statement she\u2019d ever made.</p><p>He got up and walked to the counter. Alix watched him for a moment and tried to calm her pounding heart. She turned back to her knitting and finished the row, then triumphantly counted exactly one hundred and seventy-one stitches. Jordan returned to her table, a coffee cup in one hand, with a plate and scone balanced on top of it. In the other hand he carried a second plate with a scone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in luck,\u201d he said as he set everything down on the small round table. \u201cThey only had two left.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, accepting the scone. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jordan took a sip of his drink. \u201cDanny didn\u2019t actually know where you\u2019d be and I just happened to see you in the window as I walked by.\u201d</p><p>She broke the scone in half and was grateful this had been the only table available when she\u2019d arrived an hour earlier. Normally she wouldn\u2019t have sat in view of the entire street. It depressed her to see what was happening to the neighborhood, mainly because she sensed it was only a matter of time before she and Laurel lost the apartment. If that happened, it wouldn\u2019t be long before she\u2019d be back to sleeping in cheap, rat-infested hotel rooms every night. Getting another apartment would mean taking on a second job and waiting tables for tips in places decent guys like Jordan didn\u2019t frequent.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d Alix asked, since he hadn\u2019t volunteered the information. He\u2019d said he was away.</p><p>He sipped his coffee, then put it down. \u201cI was running a youth retreat at Warm Beach.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t have a clue what that was. \u201cThis whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely, but the church needed help with the organization, so I worked in the Stanwood office for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This was the second time he\u2019d mentioned church, and she\u2019d begun to feel a niggling suspicion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know you missed me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she said a bit more defensively than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>Alix was relieved to see she hadn\u2019t offended him. \u201cWell, maybe I missed you a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got any more youth retreats you need to organize?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Frankly, I hope not. When I accepted the job as youth minister, I expected to spend my time with the teenagers here in the Blossom Street neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Alix felt as if her world had caved in. \u201cYou\u2019re...a preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYouth minister,\u201d Jordan corrected. \u201cI\u2019m currently working at the Free Methodist church in the neighborhood, the one right off Blossom.\u201d His mouth twitched; he seemed to be suppressing laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she muttered irritably.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just that you made it sound as if being a minister was like being a drug lord. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Alix was aghast and words failed her\u2014as they always did when she was flustered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a youth minister, Alix,\u201d he said and reached for her hand. He smiled then. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is you!\u201d Damn, she\u2019d thought so and wished like crazy that she\u2019d said something first.</p><p>\u201cRemember sixth grade at Jackson Elementary? It took me a while to make the connection myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be you.... I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Her mind flashed back to grade school and she narrowed her eyes as she studied him. \u201cWe were in the same class, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I remember,\u201d Jordan said, grinning, \u201cwas that you sat next to Jimmy Burkhart.\u201d</p> <p>Alix remembered Jimmy as though it was yesterday. She\u2019d given him a bloody nose and ended up in the principal\u2019s office, and all because Jimmy had been teasing her about wanting to marry Jordan Turner. She and half the other girls in the sixth grade had been agog over the preacher\u2019s son\u2014and now, apparently, Jordan had followed in his father\u2019s footsteps. He was a minister. Damn, wouldn\u2019t you know it?</p><p>\u201cI had a valentine for you.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, overwhelmed by the memory of that fateful year\u2014the year her mother had tried to kill her father.</p><p>\u201cI brought it to school and you weren\u2019t there and you never came back.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t answer. The night before the sixth-grade Valentine party, her mother shot her father. Both had been drinking heavily and then, inevitably, a fight had broken out. Soon the police had arrived, followed by paramedics. Her mother was led away in handcuffs and because there were no relatives to take them, Alix and her brother had been shuffled off to foster homes. That night was the beginning of the end of Alix\u2019s family life, sad as it\u2019d been. Her mother had been sent to prison, and her father, once he was released from the hospital, drifted away, losing contact with his children. Soon she and Tom were wards of the state. With all the turmoil, Alix had never returned to Jackson Elementary...and the valentine Jordan claimed to have for her.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jordan said, leaning closer. \u201cI was wondering what you would\u2019ve said if I\u2019d asked you to be my sixth-grade valentine?\u201d</p><p>She nearly laughed aloud. Yeah, sure. The daughter of drunks and the son of a preacher. Somehow, she didn\u2019t think this relationship was going to last.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>\u201cWith a little practice and patience, our hands learn to knit, then our minds are free to enjoy the process.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Bev Galeskas, Fiber Trends</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p> <p>B usiness was beginning to pick up and I was pleased. I\u2019d sold out of most of my inventory in nearly every yarn weight. I already had my second order into my main supplier. My first beginners\u2019 class was about to officially end. I couldn\u2019t believe six weeks had gone by so quickly. I was thrilled that after five weeks, my three students claimed they wanted to continue, so I agreed to extend the course. Because each class member was working on a different project now, except Alix, I suggested we turn Friday afternoons into a knitting support group. That way, they could all bring in whatever they wanted to work on, and I\u2019d be there to help them at each stage of development. Despite their differences, these three dissimilar women were becoming friends. I could see it happening. Friends with each other and my friends, too.</p><p>As for their skills as knitters, Carol\u2019s the most adept and has started a felted hat project.</p><p>Alix and Jacqueline still struggle with the basic stitches, but Alix has limited time to knit and Jacqueline\u2014well, Jacqueline\u2019s attitude bothers me. She\u2019s obviously not fond of her daughter-in-law, although she\u2019s never spoken openly about her. Jacqueline has started eyeing other projects now and is leaning toward the pricier yarns. Alix paid for her yarn a little each week, which made it abundantly clear that this is an extravagance. Still, the group simply wouldn\u2019t be the same without her.</p><p>Just when I was ready to close on Tuesday afternoon, I saw my sister walking across the street toward the shop. She\u2019d only come here once before, on my first day of business. She\u2019d taken such pride in forecasting financial disaster, but I refuse to allow her to get me down and I braced for a confrontation.</p><p>When Margaret entered the store, I knew instantly that something was wrong. She hadn\u2019t come to spread doom and gloom or chastise me. Her face was pale and she seemed close to tears.</p><p>\u201cMargaret, what is it?\u201d I hurried toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d She had trouble speaking and grabbed my hand so hard I almost cried out.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d I said, steering her to the back of the store where I had the table and chairs set up for my class. \u201cSit down. Can I get you a glass of water?\u201d</p> <p>Margaret shook her head. I\u2019ve never seen my sister this upset. I couldn\u2019t imagine what had caused her distress or driven her to approach me.</p><p>\u201cDr. Abram\u2019s office phoned,\u201d she said, looking up at me as if I should be able to figure out the problem from that little bit of information. I didn\u2019t know who Dr. Abram was. I wondered if Matt had fallen ill or been involved in some kind of accident. Another possibility loomed and filled me with dread.</p><p>\u201cIs this about Mother?\u201d I asked. The thought of something happening to Mom so soon after losing Dad terrified me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is about me. Dr. Abram said my mammogram needs to be retaken.\u201d She grabbed my hand again. \u201cIt seems\u2014it seems I have a lump in my breast.\u201d My sister stared up at me, eyes wide and fearful.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit I was shaken by this and sat down next to her. The pressure on my hand increased when she realized I understood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so afraid,\u201d Margaret whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d I tried to sound reassuring, but it was difficult. Margaret was thinking the same thing I was. I\u2019d already been on intimate terms with the big C. Mom and Dad had always worried that they\u2019d passed on a genetic flaw that made us vulnerable to the disease. Two of our grandparents had died of it. When I\u2019d first been diagnosed, Mom had insisted Margaret be thoroughly checked, as well. Everything had seemed all right then\u2014but now...</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the second mammogram scheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...was just there.... The technician wouldn\u2019t tell me anything. She said Dr. Abram would have the results read. Then he\u2019d like to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Margaret, I\u2019m so sorry. What can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to scare him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your husband! He has a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him when I have something to report.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was cold, and I knew better than to argue. My sister did things her own way and in her own time. Pressuring her wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel when you found out you had cancer?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>I had to strain to make out the words. I\u2019d been sixteen during my first illness and I hadn\u2019t known what I do now or even what I did the second time. The day I learned the tumor had grown back was the worst of my life. I was well aware of what lay ahead and in some ways death seemed preferable.</p><p>I knew what this could mean to my sister, and I couldn\u2019t hide my reaction. \u201cI was frightened, too,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Her grip on my hand tightened briefly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been keeping this to yourself?\u201d I asked and gently smoothed the hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cFive days,\u201d she whispered and then added urgently, \u201cI want you to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I assured her. Margaret had never asked anything of me before and I was willing to comply, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom.\u201d</p><p>I hated keeping secrets from our mother but in this case I agreed with Margaret. It was useless to upset Mom until we had the facts.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, clearly relieved.</p><p>\u201cAnything, Margaret. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held mine. \u201cWould you...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t ask, but would you go to the doctor with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I\u2019d been planning to offer.</p><p>She seemed shocked. \u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to close the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you face this alone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes swam with tears and I reached for a box of tissues and handed her one. Then, because I\u2019ve always regretted that Margaret and I aren\u2019t close, I put my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be with you, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She sobbed against my shoulder for a minute before she regained her composure. Breaking away from me, she blew her nose and sniffled. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to get the appointment on a Monday\u2014but if I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what time of day it is or even what day,\u201d I insisted. I intended to help my sister through this, no matter what.</p><p>Margaret seemed about to speak when the bell above the door chimed. I wanted to groan at the interruption, but I was in business and my job was to serve my customers. Even at quarter past five...</p><p>The friendly whistle told me it was Brad Goetz, my UPS deliveryman. He wheeled in three large boxes and set them next to the cash register. \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d he asked as he handed me the computerized clipboard, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cReally well,\u201d I said and quickly signed my name, eager to push him out the door.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I come by I see women in the shop, especially on Friday afternoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a class then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it.\u201d He seemed oblivious to my efforts to steer him toward the exit. \u201cI bet you\u2019re pretty beat at the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>He grinned then, as if he\u2019d made his point. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you relax and have a drink with me?\u201d</p><p>This was his second invitation and of all the bad luck, he had to ask me in front of my sister.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d Margaret said from the back of the shop.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Brad said, eagerly leaping on Margaret\u2019s encouragement. \u201cWe can stay right here in the neighborhood. There\u2019s a nice bar maybe two blocks away. No commitments, just a few minutes to relax and unwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but I\u2019d better not.\u201d I walked over to the door and all but opened it. He still didn\u2019t take the hint.</p><p>Brad raised his hands in frustration and glanced in Margaret\u2019s direction. \u201cIs it something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no.\u201d I didn\u2019t want him to think that.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d Margaret called out. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister. She\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to shout at Margaret to kindly keep her trap shut, but I couldn\u2019t. I much preferred to tell him the truth in some other way and at some other time, but the choice had been taken away from me. Rejecting him over and over again seemed cruel. Although I didn\u2019t want to do it like this, I owed him my honesty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had cancer,\u201d I said bluntly. \u201cNot once, but twice, and furthermore I don\u2019t have a single guarantee that the tumor won\u2019t grow back again and the next time I might not be so fortunate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCancer?\u201d he repeated and from the shocked look on his face I knew it was the last thing he\u2019d expected me to say.</p><p>\u201cThe big, ugly scary kind,\u201d I said, unable to hide my sarcasm. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make an emotional investment in me because it might not pay off.

What harm would it\u2019ve done to have a beer with the guy?\u201d</p><p>I covered my face with both hands, unwilling to admit that it\u2019d been so long since I\u2019d been on a date, I didn\u2019t know how to act around a man.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute and he\u2019s interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou said you started this shop as an affirmation of life.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI did\u2014\u201d Margaret didn\u2019t allow me to finish.</p><p>\u201cThen live.

Once a month, a group of nine friends got together to celebrate their birthdays. If no one had a birthday that particular month, they celebrated anyway.</p><p>For June they chose a Mexican restaurant. While the ambience wasn\u2019t really up to their usual high standards the food was excellent. After the women had finished a leisurely lunch and several margaritas, four of the waiters came to their table wearing large sombreros. It was time to serenade the birthday girl. One of the waiters had a guitar slung over his shoulder. Another brandished a pair of maracas.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1oritas, you celebrate a birthday, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d Bev Johnson, president of the women\u2019s group, told him. \u201cIt\u2019s Ginny\u2019s birthday.\u201d She pointed across the table at the other woman, who blushed and giggled like a schoolgirl.</p><p>The man with the guitar strummed a few chords and strolled over to Ginny. \u201cWould you like the long version or the short version?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Jacqueline loved to see her normally poised and collected friend flustered by the attention. \u201cBy all means the short version.\u201d</p><p>All four of the waiters immediately got down on their knees as they sang the traditional birthday song with a definite Mexican flair. The nine women at the table laughed and applauded, Jacqueline included.</p><p>She\u2019d needed this outing in order to put Tammie Lee\u2019s pregnancy out of her mind. Despite everything, Paul seemed genuinely in love with his wife; Reese, too, was taken with her. That left Jacqueline feeling like the villain of the piece. But even if Tammie Lee wasn\u2019t quite as manipulative or tasteless as Jacqueline had assumed, she was so obviously wrong for Paul.</p><p>After Ginny blew out the candle on her small cake, and passed it around for everyone to taste, the party broke up. Jacqueline was waiting in line to pay the cashier when Bev came to stand beside her.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Tammie Lee last week,\u201d the president of the women\u2019s club said.</p><p>Jacqueline froze. Bev was the most influential member of the association and she could only imagine what her friend thought of Paul\u2019s wife. Already Jacqueline could feel the heat creep up her neck. She could think of no way to explain her son\u2019s lapse in judgment.</p><p>\u201cHaywood said he approved their application to the club.\u201d Haywood was Bev\u2019s husband and in charge of admissions.</p><p>\u201cNaturally Reese and I were very pleased they were accepted.\u201d It was gratifying to know that her years of volunteer work with the country club were paying dividends.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always liked Paul.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline smiled. Anyone would be impressed with her son. He was charming and intelligent and destined to succeed in life. She had to restrain herself from bragging about his accomplishments.</p><p>\u201cI understand Tammie Lee\u2019s going to work on the cookbook committee.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline\u2019s heart fell. She\u2019d hoped to speak privately to the committee chairwoman and suggest that perhaps Tammie Lee might serve more effectively somewhere else. The thought of her daughter-in-law\u2019s recipe for boiled peanuts and cheese grits in the Country Club Cookbook made Jacqueline shudder. What an embarrassment! She couldn\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to Louise about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stroke of genius,\u201d Bev said.</p><p>It was Jacqueline\u2019s turn to pay her lunch tab, and she set the cash on the counter, breathing far too fast. Surely she\u2019d misunderstood Bev. She stepped aside after collecting her change and waited while the other woman paid.</p><p>\u201cA stroke of...genius?\u201d Jacqueline repeated as they started out the restaurant door.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. I first met Tammie Lee a few months ago. Haywood and I instantly fell in love with her. She\u2019s a breath of fresh air that our women\u2019s group badly needs. She\u2019s so energetic. Don\u2019t you just love that sweet southern accent of hers? I swear I could listen to her speak all day.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline had to bite her tongue to keep from admitting how irritated she was by Tammie Lee\u2019s twang.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Paul fell in love with her. I think Haywood\u2019s halfway there himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure how to respond.</p><p>\u201cThe committee puts out a cookbook every two years and it\u2019s always the same people and the same recipes. Just how many recipes for Cranberry Mold do we need?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline refrained from mentioning that she\u2019d been the one to submit the gelatin recipe, which had long been a club favorite.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee had some wonderful ideas, and frankly I\u2019m thinking of asking her to chair the committee. Louise has done it for several years and she\u2019s ready to try her hand at something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Jacqueline could no longer remain silent. She respected Bev\u2019s opinion, but in this case her friend was wrong. Tammie Lee would be an embarrassment to them all.</p><p>\u201cI know, of course, that with a baby due in the next few months, I can\u2019t ask her to take on any additional responsibility,\u201d Bev said as she neared the parking lot. Her convertible BMW was parked next to Jacqueline\u2019s Mercedes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overwhelm her. Paul would never forgive me, although I think Tammie Lee\u2019s a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, she\u2019s going to have her hands full,\u201d Jacqueline agreed and stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move while Bev climbed into her car and drove off. Had the entire world gone mad? Jacqueline wondered. Was she the only one who recognized Tammie Lee as the insincere little manipulator she was?</p><p>Her thoughts troubled, Jacqueline pulled into the garage at home and was astonished to realize she couldn\u2019t remember driving there. One moment she was in the restaurant parking lot and the next she was in her own garage.</p><p>Another surprise awaited her when she found Reese in the kitchen. He was dressed in one of his best suits and either he was home early or ready to take his blonde out for the evening. Jacqueline didn\u2019t ask. She\u2019d rather not know than have to hear him lie.</p><p>She put away her purse and glanced at the mail, paying special attention to the sale flyers. When she\u2019d finished, she walked over to the liquor cabinet and reached for a bottle of gin. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d The margaritas had long since worn off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Reese frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve never known you to drink this early in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome occasions call for it.\u201d She turned around to study this man with whom she\u2019d spent most of her life. She knew him so well\u2014and yet she didn\u2019t know him at all.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was genuinely interested or making small talk. Jacqueline found it curious that he was questioning her whereabouts; he\u2019d done that a few times recently but she had no idea why.</p><p>\u201cOut with the girls. For our monthly birthday lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might invite Tammie Lee on one of your outings sometime.\u201d</p><p>He had to be joking. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s your daughter-in-law and it would be one way of welcoming her into the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to be a hypocrite. She isn\u2019t welcome. She\u2019s tolerated and frankly even that\u2019s becoming difficult.\u201d If one more person sang her daughter-in-law\u2019s praises, Jacqueline swore she was going to scream. \u201cWhy does everyone think Tammie Lee\u2019s so terrific? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Reese stared at her for a long moment. \u201cHave you ever asked yourself why Paul fell in love with her?\u201d His voice was cool and controlled, which usually indicated that he was curbing his anger.</p><p>\u201cOf course I understand why Paul married her. He was ruled by hormones instead of common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Reese shouted, slapping his palm against the kitchen counter.</p><p>Jacqueline nearly leaped out of her skin at her husband\u2019s uncharacteristic display of temper.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee is loving and caring and generous. The only person who doesn\u2019t see it is you and only because you\u2019re so blinded by your own agenda for our son you refuse to open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline stared at him. \u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019m a cold, selfish bitch, Reese?\u201d How dare he speak that way to her!</p><p>It looked as if he meant to leave without any kind of response, but apparently he changed his mind. \u201cPerhaps you should answer that question yourself,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he walked out, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cHandknitting is a soothing and comforting means of creative expression that can result in a warm, useful and lovingly knitted garment...what a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Meg Swansen, Schoolhouse Press</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>T he three women in my knitting class sat around the table, eager for the last scheduled lesson. Before I could start, however, Jacqueline spoke up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to let everyone know I\u2019ve decided against returning for the new session.\u201d She meant our knitting \u201csupport group,\u201d for which I charged five dollars a week.</p><p>No one made any protest, so I felt I should say something. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Jacqueline.\u201d I was, and my feelings weren\u2019t entirely mercenary, although I knew if she stayed, Jacqueline would be inclined to purchase the higher-end yarns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Alix said without so much as a second\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything different from you,\u201d Jacqueline muttered, not hiding her scorn.</p><p>Truth be known, I was just as glad not to be stuck refereeing those two, although it did make for an amusing moment now and then. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen two women who disliked each other more intensely. I\u2019d believed that their animosity had lessened in the past few weeks, but apparently I\u2019d read the situation completely wrong. Once again, my lack of experience when it came to relationships was showing.</p><p>Jacqueline was difficult to know\u2014and to like. I did give her credit, though; she\u2019d made a genuine effort to learn to knit and had nearly completed the baby blanket she was making for her first grandchild.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I should attend the last class and tell everyone what I\u2019d decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019d care,\u201d Alix mumbled under her breath.</p><p>Standing behind Alix, I placed my hand on her shoulder as a way of asking her to keep her comments to herself. Through the last six weeks, I\u2019d discovered that for all her crusty exterior the girl was actually quite sensitive. Even a hint of criticism was enough to make her withdraw.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could stop knitting now if I wanted to,\u201d Carol said. She was working on a sweater for her brother. The cashmere yarn was the most expensive in the shop and she\u2019d bought it in a creamy gray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to continue, too,\u201d Alix said, glaring across the table at Jacqueline as if to suggest the older woman lacked willpower. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get this blanket right no matter what it takes.\u201d</p> <p>I had to admire Alix\u2019s determination. She was still rather clumsy in her handling of the yarn and needles, but she refused to give up. I suspect she undid as many rows as she knit in the first few weeks. Thankfully, she\u2019d learned what she was doing wrong and was progressing nicely. Her biggest hindrance was lack of time.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m a quitter?\u201d Jacqueline asked, challenging Alix.</p><p>\u201cIf the fancy shoe fits, then walk in it. It\u2019s no biggie, right? You certainly won\u2019t be missed by me.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline and Alix\u2019s constant bickering wore on my nerves. But before I could react, Carol leaped in.</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d she said in a blatant effort to change the subject. I was grateful to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to hide the relief in my voice.</p> <p>\u201cMonday morning Doug\u2019s taking me in for the last IVF attempt.\u201d</p><p>Although she presented a cheerful facade, I sensed\u2014and I\u2019m sure the others did, too\u2014a deep-seated fear. I hoped everything would work this time and Carol would carry the pregnancy full-term. She\u2019d been going in for regular appointments, although she hadn\u2019t given us details. She\u2019d talked briefly to the group about her fertility problems and a bit more to me privately, but not much. My heart ached for her.</p><p>To my surprise, it was Jacqueline who spoke first. \u201cOh, my dear, I certainly wish you success. Reese and I only had the one child and we longed for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point Doug and I would be ecstatic with just one.\u201d Her smile trembled.</p><p>\u201cI so wished for a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you mention that your son and his wife are having a girl?\u201d I seemed to remember that from an earlier conversation with Jacqueline.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline had been suspiciously quiet about her son and Tammie Lee lately. It made me wonder if something had happened that she preferred not to discuss. With her it was hard to tell. While Carol and Alix had grown comfortable with each other, Jacqueline remained emotionally distant. I had the impression that the only women she allowed into her life were her country club friends.</p> <p>Alix kept her head lowered and concentrated on her knitting. \u201cI think only people who really want kids should have them.\u201d She\u2019d said something similar to this earlier, I recalled. She seemed to have strong feelings about it. I could only assume that was because of her own experience.</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Carol agreed. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why so many couples who love children seem to have such difficulty getting pregnant. When I think back on all the years I put off having a family, I want to weep. I thought I had lots of time, but how was I to know?\u201d A pained look came over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Alix asked, glancing in my direction.</p><p>I was sure my face went scarlet, although why the subject of children should bother me, I don\u2019t know. In response I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alix demanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t want kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t worry my mother. She was six months pregnant with my brother before she got around to marrying my father. It was the worst mistake of her life, she claims, but that didn\u2019t stop her from having me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA child can\u2019t be blamed for the circumstances of his or her birth,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s not the way I heard it.\u201d Alix jerked viciously on the ball of yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely a lovely young woman like you will marry one day,\u201d Jacqueline said, directing the comment at me.</p><p>Jacqueline had a tendency to catch me off guard once in a while. Only moments earlier she\u2019d expressed compassion and understanding for Carol, and her comment about me being lovely\u2014well, that was an unexpected compliment.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but...\u201d I let the rest fade. I\u2019d rather not reveal the details of my life if I can help it.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Carol pressed.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make a very good wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Alix again. \u201cYou\u2019d sure as hell be a better wife than my mother ever was.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was fast becoming uncomfortable. \u201cHusbands have...expectations.\u201d</p><p>Alix looked up with a puzzled frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I could see the other two were equally curious. \u201cI\u2019ve already gone through two bouts of cancer. It\u2019s possible that our family has a predisposition to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank God, but my older sister had a recent scare.\u201d Thankfully Margaret\u2019s second mammogram had been clear. I\u2019d gone to the doctor\u2019s office with her and given her the support she needed. Afterward she\u2019d invited me to lunch to celebrate the results.</p><p>This was the closest I\u2019d felt to my sister since I was a teenager. Perverse as it sounds, I\u2019m grateful for the alarm that initial mammogram caused. For the first time in years, my sister and I had something in common\u2014fear. And for the first time ever, I was the one who had the greater knowledge...and the authority of personal experience.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you get married?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>I sighed. I really didn\u2019t want to get into this. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee the cancer won\u2019t come back,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>I discovered all three women staring at me with blank expressions.</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, life doesn\u2019t exactly come with guarantees,\u201d Alix said. \u201cI should know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it did, I\u2019d be a mother by now,\u201d Carol added.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Jacqueline said, gesturing toward Carol.</p><p>My sister had been saying the same thing. Our lunch had gone well until she\u2019d mentioned Brad. I hadn\u2019t seen the UPS guy for several days and as far as I was concerned, the question of my dating him was a moot point. After two rejections, I doubted he\u2019d ask me out again. Really, why should he? I\u2019d made it plain that I wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been on a date in so long, I\u2019m not sure how to act,\u201d I told my friends. It was the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou just act normal,\u201d Carol said as if that was understood.</p><p>\u201cJust be yourself,\u201d Jacqueline threw in. To my astonishment, she drew out her knitting. I\u2019d had the impression earlier that she intended to make her big announcement and leave. I was glad to see her join the others.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you have the hots for some guy?\u201d</p><p>Naturally Alix would ask such a question. \u201cOf course not.\u201d My denial was fast and firm. Once again, the heat in my face reflected my embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou do so,\u201d Carol said, watching me. She laughed softly. \u201cAll right, give. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, refusing to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late.\u201d Jacqueline leaned toward me.</p><p>\u201cTell us the name,\u201d Alix encouraged.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t drop the matter and I could think of nothing to say or do that would take the conversation elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lydia,\u201d Alix insisted again. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then with a deep sigh told them about Brad. \u201cHe won\u2019t ask me out again,\u201d I said when I\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Alix agreed. \u201cWhat you have to do now is ask him out.\u201d</p><p>Both Jacqueline and Carol nodded. It seemed Brad had won Margaret to his side and now my entire knitting class, too.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>S unday night before the IVF procedure, Carol waited until she was sure Doug had fallen asleep. When she heard the heavy, even cadence of his breathing, she slipped out of bed and crept silently into the living room.</p><p>She loved the view of Puget Sound at night. From her living room window, she could see the dark, shimmering water. Beyond West Seattle was Vashon Island and the lights of the Kitsap Peninsula.</p><p>Sinking into her favorite chair, she dropped her head back and ordered her mind and her body to relax. She couldn\u2019t go into this procedure tense; she had to will her body to accept the fertilized eggs, to accept the baby or babies she yearned for.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what was happening to her. If she wanted a child so much, then why did her body reject pregnancy after pregnancy? Nothing added up, nothing made sense, no matter how often she tried to analyze the situation.</p><p>Her own body had become her worst enemy, it seemed; her womb had betrayed her in the most fundamental way, by denying her the ability to reproduce. She was fast approaching a time when her age would make it impossible to conceive. Already her egg production had started to fall off.</p><p>While outwardly everyone was sympathetic, Carol knew her friends were bored with the subject. She also knew how badly her mother wanted grandchildren. All her mother\u2019s friends carried around purseloads of pictures of their grandkids, while her own mother sat by, silent and depressed. Neither Carol nor Rick had given her bragging rights. She said it jokingly, but Carol felt her mother\u2019s disappointment as keenly as she felt her own.</p><p>To this point, Doug\u2019s parents had been supportive and encouraging, but they too were weary of waiting. Thankfully, his younger sister had made them grandparents twice over, but his father was hoping for a grandson to carry on the family name. The pressure wasn\u2019t explicit but it was there and Carol nearly suffocated under the weight of it.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. Never in all her life had she wept as much as she had in these last few years. Before long, she had a thick wad of tissues in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t tried. She\u2019d submitted to every therapy available and ingested a pharmacy full of drugs. All those drugs. God only knew what she\u2019d done to her body or what risks she\u2019d taken, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Nothing mattered except having a baby. She was willing to swallow anything, inject her stomach with drugs, volunteer for any experimental program, if there was even the slightest possibility it would help her get pregnant\u2014and stay pregnant.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Doug came into the room wearing striped pajama bottoms and no top; it was how he always slept. He sat down across from her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Afraid that he might hear the tears in her voice, she shook her head.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything and they sat together in silence. After a few minutes, her husband stood up and stretched out his arm to her and pulled her into his embrace.</p> <p>\u201cYou should try to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to lead her back to bed and she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can sleep without you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, comforted by the knowledge that she was as much a part of him as he was of her.</p><p>A ferry glided toward Vashon Island and Carol forced her attention onto its slow progress from Fauntleroy to Southworth. The terrible tension returned and she had to ask the one question that had hounded her for months. \u201cWhat are we going to do if I don\u2019t get pregnant this time?\u201d Her words came out a broken whisper. \u201cAdopt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. I need to know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the adoption agencies decide we aren\u2019t fit parents? What if we can\u2019t get an infant the way we want? What...what if the IVF fails again? Oh, Doug, I shouldn\u2019t think like that and yet I can\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p> <p>Doug\u2019s sigh rumbled from deep within his chest. \u201cThen don\u2019t think like that. If the IVF fails, we\u2019ll adopt and if we aren\u2019t accepted by the agency, then we won\u2019t have children. Other couples have survived and we will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...we won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be all right between us for a while, but then one day you\u2019ll look at some little boy or girl and\u2014\u201d The lump in her throat made it impossible to continue.</p><p>Doug didn\u2019t try to deny it. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>She gave a helpless shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think we won\u2019t be able to adopt? Other couples our age adopt. Why can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re too late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo late? Why is it too late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the waiting lists are years long. By the time they get to our name, we\u2019ll be in our midforties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re erecting roadblocks where there aren\u2019t any.\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t respond. Her misery was too great. It was easy for Doug to say she was agonizing over nonexistent problems; it wasn\u2019t his body that failed them month after month.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby,\u201d Doug said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cCarol, stop it. You\u2019re getting hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hysterical and frightened and depressed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefeated. Why go through with the procedure if you\u2019ve already decided it isn\u2019t going to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know that you can\u2019t get pregnant?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Doug thought he was helping but he wasn\u2019t. In fact, he was making everything worse. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, for heaven\u2019s sake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you here. I need some time by myself.\u201d It was like this with the drugs, these wild mood swings. They\u2019d been warned; nevertheless, Carol was caught un-prepared.</p><p>Doug stood up and walked over to the window. Gazing into the moonlit night, he rubbed his hand over his face as though considering his options. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should leave you alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cPlease just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now...I need to be by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol...\u201d He turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Doug.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then reluctantly walked into the bedroom.</p><p>As soon as he was gone, Carol wanted him back. She wanted him to take her in his arms and reassure her of his love. She wanted him to tell her he\u2019d love her to the end of time, with or without a child.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she fought off the ugly negative voices that harassed her from all sides and tried to think positive thoughts. It was a technique she\u2019d learned from her online support group\u2014creating the image of what you want and seeing it in such clear detail that you begin to accept the possibility...the reality.</p><p>She pictured herself pregnant, her stomach extended, wearing a cheerful maternity top. Doug\u2019s hands rested on her tummy and he bent over and kissed her belly. When he straightened, his eyes were full of love and pride. That was the image she held on to, the picture she framed in her mind. She refused to let her doubts defeat her.</p><p>At some point during the night, she must have fallen asleep on the sofa. Before dawn, she stirred and climbed back into bed. Pressing her body against Doug\u2019s, she cuddled him close and draped her arm across his waist.</p><p>When she woke again, Doug was cuddling her. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d She groaned and rolled onto her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you come to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled on her ear. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>She managed a soft smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She could hear coffee brewing in the background. \u201cIs it time to get up already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>She struggled into a sitting position and offered Doug a tired smile.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you lately how much I love you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He told her in a thousand different ways. \u201cYup,\u201d she said in the middle of a loud yawn.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very important day, you know,\u201d Doug said, sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d Carol whispered. This was the day she\u2019d welcome Doug\u2019s child into her womb.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix stepped outside the video store and lit up a cigarette. She was cutting back, but giving up smoking was difficult. Taking a long drag, she savored the immediate soothing effect and exhaled, tilting her head upward. It was when she started to take a second puff that she noticed Jordan Turner walking down the opposite side of the street. A sense of dread filled her; she didn\u2019t want to talk to him.</p><p>What was the point? He obviously wasn\u2019t interested in her. Oh sure, she amused him, but he saw her as a leftover challenge from the sixth grade\u2014the girl he wanted to save. Another notch in his ministerial belt. Preachers couldn\u2019t accept that Alix wasn\u2019t looking for salvation. Oh, sure she\u2019d ridden the church bus to Sunday School. Her parents would\u2019ve been willing to let her go anywhere if it meant she was out of their hair for an hour or two. She\u2019d done the Jesus thing at ten and eleven, but it hadn\u2019t gotten her anywhere. Been there, done that, and been awarded the prize Bible for memorizing scripture.</p><p>She\u2019d been on her own since she was sixteen and one of the hardest lessons life had taught her was that the only person she could rely on was herself. It wasn\u2019t a lesson she was likely to forget.</p><p>Crushing out her half-smoked cigarette, Alix went back inside the store, hoping Jordan would take the hint and leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick,\u201d Laurel muttered as Alix joined her behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into the back room.\u201d</p><p>Laurel frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you-know-who comes in, tell him I\u2019m not working tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still avoiding Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Alix snapped and hurried to the back of the store before the preacher man caught up with her. It\u2019d been two weeks since they\u2019d bumped into each other at Starbucks and he\u2019d dropped his bomb. The explosion still reverberated in her ears. Jordan was a minister\u2014and she wanted nothing to do with him or his God.</p><p>No more than a minute later, Laurel appeared, and she didn\u2019t look any too pleased. \u201cHe saw you.\u201d</p><p>Alix whirled around. \u201cThen tell him I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already tried that.\u201d</p><p>This was getting irritating. \u201cSo tell him something else. I don\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding,\u201d Alix insisted, which was a pretty weak argument.</p><p>\u201cDo what you want,\u201d Laurel said. \u201cBut he told me he was going to wait until you came out.\u201d With that, her roommate and supposed friend returned to the front of the store.</p><p>Alix waited an agonizing ten minutes and figured that by then Jordan would\u2019ve given up on her. No such luck. Arms crossed, he stood by the microwave popcorn display next to the cash register. His eyes narrowed when he saw her.</p><p>Rather than try to avoid him anymore, she strolled purposely toward Jordan. \u201cYou don\u2019t take a hint, do you?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cNot easily,\u201d he admitted. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d already squandered her fifteen-minute break and that was her last of the evening. The video store wasn\u2019t doing a robust business, but they were busy enough.</p><p>\u201cMeet me after work.\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. She might as well get this over with. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word is good?\u201d</p><p>The challenge in his voice offended her sense of pride. \u201cDamn straight it is! I\u2019ll be at Starbucks ten minutes after closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Annie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>It could\u2019ve been Alix\u2019s imagination, but she thought she saw Jordan wink at Laurel on his way out the door. She wondered what the hell that was about and then decided it didn\u2019t matter. If he was interested in her friend, then fine. She hoped the two of them would be very happy. Jordan was a damn sight better than that slimy used-car salesman.</p><p>Only Alix did care, and she was in a bitch of a mood for the rest of her shift. By eleven o\u2019clock Laurel was no longer speaking to her and left in a huff. Alix was just as glad to be rid of her.</p><p>Exactly ten minutes after closing out the till, locking up the store and making the deposit, Alix walked into Annie\u2019s. The caf\u00e9 was half a block down from the video store. As a treat every payday, Alix bought herself dinner there. The food was good, plentiful and cheap.</p><p>Jordan was in a booth reading the menu when she approached. She scowled at him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? And your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cTrue, but I figure you owe me an explanation as to why you ditched me in sixth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ditch you. I...I got caught up in circumstances beyond my control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but consider it common courtesy to explain what happened.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d obviously been taught etiquette. She, on the other hand, didn\u2019t know anything about it.</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said aggressively, \u201cwe can spend the rest of the evening arguing about something that happened in grade school or we can talk. You decide.\u201d</p><p>It was all too apparent that Jordan intended to pester her until he got the answers he wanted. She\u2019d already decided she\u2019d rather not get involved with a minister, but he was making that difficult. Frowning, she slid into the booth across from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Alix?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>This was an interesting approach but before she could answer, the waitress appeared. Alix knew Jenny, who worked swing shift, and she watched as the older woman glanced between them, not bothering to hide her surprise.</p><p>Folding over the top sheet of her pad, Jenny asked, \u201cWhat can I get you two?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan closed the plastic-coated menu. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a bacon cheeseburger with the works.\u201d Then he looked at Alix. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth watered at the thought of one of Annie\u2019s mammoth cheeseburgers. But first she had to find out who was paying for it. \u201cYou buying? Or am I getting my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Alix tucked the menu behind the sugar canister. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo bacon cheeseburgers,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd two Cokes.\u201d He gave Alix a questioning smile and she nodded.</p><p>Jenny wrote down the order and left.</p> <p>As soon as the waitress was gone, Jordan rested his hands on the table. \u201cSo,\u201d he began.</p><p>Squarely meeting his gaze, Alix sighed heavily. \u201cSo I\u2019m not interested in church,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not exactly the church-going kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what kind is that?\u201d</p><p>Alix rolled her eyes. \u201cLadies who wear hats and gloves and exchange polite conversation with a few \u2018praise the Lords\u2019 thrown in.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s head reared back and he snorted with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re describing a garden party, not church. I can tell you haven\u2019t attended in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Sunday School back in grade school but skipped the church part,\u201d she told him. The truth was, she\u2019d gone a few times but left early, bored by all the preaching. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny brought their Cokes and Jordan waited impatiently before he responded.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he burst out when she was gone. \u201cJordan, I think you\u2019re great.\u201d She took a long sip of her drink. \u201cI remember your dad and he was nice, too.\u201d Jordan\u2019s father had come to the house once to talk to her mother, after Alix had been awarded that prize Bible. It was the one and only time he\u2019d stopped by, and she didn\u2019t blame him for never visiting again.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know you\u2019re not interested in church unless you try it? Why don\u2019t you come one Sunday and see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Alix said, trying to be as honest as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to save me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly got me figured out,\u201d he said, a little sarcastically.</p><p>Being rude was natural for her, but she was determined to keep the peace until after she\u2019d eaten the cheeseburger. After all, he was paying for it. And she was hungry.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important for me to go to church?\u201d she demanded, and then answered for him. \u201cIt\u2019s because you want to change me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he argued. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>Sure he did!</p><p>\u201cI liked you in sixth grade and I like you now. Do I need an excuse?\u201d He leaned across the table, unwilling to break eye contact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you decide that on your own, or did someone else make up your mind for you?\u201d</p><p>She bristled at his question. \u201cI make up my own mind.\u201d</p><p>She could see he was growing angry. His hand clenched the silverware wrapped in a paper napkin. \u201cLet me see if I understand you. I was all right to hang with until you found out I\u2019m someone you knew ten or twelve years ago\u2014who just happens to be a minister?\u201d</p><p>Alix lowered her eyes and refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou liked me just fine in grade school, and now you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>That bacon cheeseburger had better show up fast, because holding her tongue was damn difficult. Alix bit the inside of her lip.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d she snapped. \u201cThat it doesn\u2019t matter? Well, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and then faltered, unsure of herself. \u201cYou\u2019re...You\u2019re...\u201d She gestured toward him, making circular motions with her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re...good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Jordan repeated. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and searched with growing desperation for Jenny. It never took this long for an order to come up. Her stomach growled and reminded her it\u2019d been midafternoon since her latte and she was hungry. As soon as her meal arrived, she could say what she wanted and take her cheeseburger home. Only he was confusing her. All she could think about was how badly she\u2019d wanted to attend that valentine party. She hadn\u2019t told him, but she\u2019d had a valentine for him, too.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cso you\u2019d better explain it to me. What the hell makes me good?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and realized he was serious. \u201cGod,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His expression went blank. \u201cGod?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re this lily-white guy who grew up with a perfect family. I didn\u2019t. You had parents who loved you. I didn\u2019t. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that\u2019s relevant,\u201d he countered, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cMy mother did jail time for shooting my father. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cThere was plenty of talk about it, but all I wanted to know was what had happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This was unexpected.</p><p>Alix nearly sighed in relief when Jenny appeared with two plates. The cheeseburger was left open and the cheese had melted perfectly. The French fries glistened and sizzled, fresh from the fryer. Her mouth watered just looking at her meal.</p><p>\u201cI asked my dad to find out where you were. He tried, but didn\u2019t get anywhere. Apparently you and your brother had already been sent to foster homes in another part of the city,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>Alix reached for the salt shaker but her eyes didn\u2019t leave his the whole time she salted her fries. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and picked up a fry.</p><p>Hungry though she was, Alix hadn\u2019t touched her food. \u201cWhat made you decide to go into the ministry? Like father, like son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a story for another night.\u201d He added lettuce and a slice of tomato to his burger and closed it before taking his first bite.</p><p>Alix bit into her burger, too. \u201cJust remember I don\u2019t need you to save me,\u201d she said, still chewing.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and drank some more of her Coke. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I do. I leave the salvation up to God. He saves, I just point the way.\u201d He took another fry, dipping it into a small pool of ketchup he\u2019d squirted onto his plate.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t trust him. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said. \u201cWanting to see me.\u201d</p><p>He cast her a strange look. \u201cIs there some law that says I\u2019m not supposed to be attracted to you? I liked you in sixth grade and I still think you\u2019re kinda cute.\u201d</p><p>He liked her? He thought she was cute? \u201cYou do?\u201d she asked and was mortified by the slight quiver in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so if I didn\u2019t.\u201d He stretched out his hand and stole one of her French fries.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She slapped his hand.</p><p>He laughed and gave her his sliced pickle.</p><p>They finished eating, talked about movies they\u2019d both seen and then left the caf\u00e9 an hour later. \u201cAre you going to stop avoiding me now?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>Alix figured she\u2019d play it cool. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecide soon, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how much longer I can afford to rent movies.\u201d</p><p>Alix laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou coming to church on Sunday?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d She didn\u2019t see herself sitting next to any church lady with sagging panty hose and a big purse. Jordan might want her to show up, but she didn\u2019t think those goody-goody types would take kindly to her purple-tinted hair.</p><p>Church was for people who had regular lives and who had goals and dreams. Okay, Alix had dreams, too, but damn little chance of ever seeing them come to life. She wanted to be a chef. Not just a cook, but a real chef in some fancy restaurant. She\u2019d worked in a couple of caf\u00e9s like Annie\u2019s over the years and always liked the kitchen jobs best. The last place she\u2019d worked\u2014before the video store\u2014had closed down, but working there had set the dream in place.</p><p>She suspected he was laughing at her. Before she knew what he intended, he pulled her into the shadows of the alley and backed her up against the brick wall.</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment, neither breathing, neither saying anything.</p><p>Then his mouth was on hers, and it was all she could do not to crumple at the effect of his kiss. Her head started to spin and her knees actually went weak. The only thing left to do was hold on to him, so she wrapped her arms around Jordan\u2019s neck. From there, her senses took her on a roller-coaster ride more exciting than anything Disney had to offer.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked, her voice sounding like something rattling around in a tin can.</p><p>When Jordan finally lifted his head, he whispered. \u201cI figured you owed me that because I had my heart broken in sixth grade.\u201d</p><p>Alix moistened her lips. \u201cYeah...well, you weren\u2019t the only one.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of a knitter, yarn becomes the medium that binds the heart and soul.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Robin Villiers-Furze, The Needleworks Company, Port Orchard, Washington</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>A nother Friday had come to an end.

She\u2019d spread the word about the store, and two of her affluent friends had recently stopped by. Despite all her threats to quit the class, she showed up each and every Friday. And Jacqueline\u2019s country club friends had purchased four hundred dollars\u2019 worth of yarn. With big sales like these I didn\u2019t need to worry about making the rent payment, which was one of my biggest concerns when I opened my door.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t actually earning enough to pay myself a real salary yet, but I was managing the rent and after less than three months in business, that excited me. My strategy was to live simply and believe in myself.</p><p>When I arrived upstairs, I left the smaller windows in the living room open. A gentle breeze filtered through. Whiskers was all over me, weaving between my feet in an effort to attract my undivided attention. I love my cat and he\u2019s excellent company, but there are days I\u2019d like a few moments to myself to unwind. Whiskers\u2019s demands come first, however.</p><p>I opened a can of his favorite tuna and set it down. He\u2019s terribly spoiled, but I can\u2019t help it. While Whiskers chowed down on dinner, I sorted through the day\u2019s mail and came upon an envelope with a familiar scrawl. Margaret.</p> <p>I hesitated before I tore it open. Inside were two thank-you notes, one from each of my nieces, thanking me for the sweaters I\u2019d recently knit. It was the first time they\u2019d formally acknowledged my gifts. In the past I\u2019d often suspected Margaret hadn\u2019t given them the things I made them.</p><p>In retrospect, I probably shouldn\u2019t have reacted by phoning my sister. Except that our strained relationship showed recent signs of improvement, and I was feeling encouraged. Before I could change my mind, I punched out her telephone number.</p><p>At the first ring, I nearly did change my mind and hang up. But I knew she had Caller ID and would immediately contact me and ask why I\u2019d phoned.</p><p>Hailey answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cI got your thank-you note,\u201d I told her.</p> <p>\u201cMom said we should write you, but I would have anyway. It\u2019s a cool sweater, Aunt Lydia. I love the colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d I\u2019d chosen a lime-green yarn and accented the cuffs and button bands with bright orange. It turned out to be really cute, even if I do say so myself.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s here,\u201d Hailey said and before I could tell her it wasn\u2019t necessary to interrupt Margaret, my sister was on the line.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she demanded in that gruff unfriendly tone she holds in reserve for me.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI got the note from the girls today and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only ever phone if something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>That was categorically untrue but I didn\u2019t want to argue with her. Normally I avoided calling Margaret because the experience was so often unsettling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d I tried to laugh but it sounded phony.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen that handsome UPS driver lately?\u201d</p><p>I could feel my face heat up at the mention of Brad. I hadn\u2019t phoned her to talk about him. \u201cHe was by the other day.\u201d Instantly I tried to think of something to distract her from the subject of Brad Goetz, and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The UPS driver was as friendly as ever but he no longer asked me out. He knew about my cancer now, and that explained it. I was grateful he didn\u2019t force me to invent plausible-sounding excuses. But when he\u2019d left after his most recent visit, I\u2019d experienced a twinge of regret. That slight but unmistakable sense of loss stayed with me the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cDid you suggest the two of you get together?\u201d Margaret pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I...\u201d That was all I got out before my sister cut me off.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling me this shop of yours is an affirmation of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you put your money where your mouth is.\u201d</p><p>It distressed me that my sister seemed to enjoy harassing me. \u201cIt\u2019s my life, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife?\u201d She said it scornfully. \u201cWhat life? All you do is work and knit, which is your work. Oh sure, you visit Mom and have a couple of friends, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to cut her off. \u201cI make my own decisions about the men I date.\u201d</p><p>Margaret acted as if she hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cAsk him out for a beer,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why I was so adamant. \u201cBecause...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I almost shouted, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Margaret, you make everything seem so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him out and don\u2019t call me again until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d say anything like that to me.</p><p>\u201cDead serious.\u201d She disconnected the phone.</p><p>I stared at the receiver a full minute before I stepped away. Margaret could be so dictatorial. My own sister refused to speak to me until I contacted a man she\u2019d only seen once, and briefly at that? Well, she could forget it; I wasn\u2019t giving in. That decided, I went to find something decent for dinner.</p><p>Because I feel diet is so important in maintaining a healthy body, I avoid processed foods as much as possible. On occasion I microwave a frozen entr\u00e9e, but only rarely. I did that evening, however, because my head was spinning. Margaret had said I should invite Brad out for a drink. Okay, so maybe she had my best interests at heart. Maybe, just maybe she was right, and it was time for me to throw caution to the winds. The women in my knitting class seemed to think so, too. But I had no idea how.</p><p>At nine, I phoned her back.</p><p>Knowing my sister, I half expected her to slam down the receiver but I didn\u2019t give her the chance. \u201cWhat do I say?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ve already turned him down twice. Now that he knows I\u2019ve had cancer, he probably isn\u2019t interested. He might tell me no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might. And I wouldn\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the encouragement,\u201d I muttered under my breath and to my surprise Margaret laughed. Generally not even a stand-up comic can get a response out of my sister. She\u2019s one of those deadpan women born without a funny bone. I had no idea I was so amusing.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually asking me for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you refuse to talk to me until I make a fool of myself over a man, then the least you can do is tell me how to go about it.\u201d</p><p>That shut her up, but not for long.</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My voice must have betrayed my lack of confidence.</p><p>\u201cThen tell him you think it might be nice for the two of you to have a beer one night if he\u2019s still interested. Offer to buy and then leave the ball in his court.\u201d</p><p>That sounded reasonable.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>I leaned against the wall, fiddling with my hair. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cI think I will.\u201d</p><p>I sounded brave on Friday night, but by Monday morning it was a different story. It would\u2019ve been easier if Brad had come with a delivery later in the week, but he didn\u2019t. As luck would have it, he showed up Monday afternoon when I wasn\u2019t expecting him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t usually see you on Mondays.\u201d Now that was a clever remark, I thought with disgust, especially since I\u2019m officially closed on Mondays.</p><p>\u201cNot usually,\u201d he said, wheeling the stack of boxes over to the cash register. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Instantly my mouth went completely dry.</p><p>Brad handed me the computerized clipboard, just the way he always did, so I could sign my name. I looked at it as if I\u2019d never seen it before.</p><p>\u201cI need a signature,\u201d he said.</p><p>Thankfully I was able to manage that much. I glanced down long enough to finish the task and returned the clipboard. Brad smiled and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d I called out.</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>I came out from behind the counter and walked toward him. My mind whirled with everything Margaret had suggested I say and in my eagerness, the words rushed out, stumbling all over themselves. \u201cI\u2019ve had a change of heart, that is, if you\u2019re still interested. If you aren\u2019t, I understand perfectly, and I\u2019m making a complete idiot of myself, and...and let\u2019s have a beer one night. Oh, and I\u2019ll buy. Margaret said I should buy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened as he held up one hand. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>I clamped my mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cNow start over at the beginning, only slower this time.\u201d</p><p>I was convinced my face was brighter than any fire truck in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve reconsidered your invitation to meet for a drink after work.\u201d</p><p>A smile appeared on his face and I could tell he was pleased. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>A warm feeling replaced the chill that had left my teeth chattering. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Friday night after you close the shop?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the cart, whistling on his way back to the truck. A few minutes after he left, I realized I was humming. I had a date!</p><p>Hot damn. I had a date. Just wait until Margaret heard about this.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>J acqueline had her day all planned. She had a nail appointment at nine, followed by lunch with her friends, then major shopping, a few necessary errands and finally home. Tuesday was her busiest day of the week; she arranged it that way on purpose. Preoccupation was the key to forgetting that her husband would be spending part of the night with another woman.</p><p>While she was at the mall, she\u2019d make sure she was justly rewarded for turning the other way, although she still had to grit her teeth every time she thought about it.</p><p>Just minutes before she planned to leave for the nail salon, the phone rang. For half a moment, she was tempted to ignore it, but then she saw that it was Reese\u2019s cell. Reluctantly she picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cI need a favor,\u201d her husband said urgently. \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting and I forgot my briefcase at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to drop it off?\u201d It would mean she\u2019d be late for her nail appointment, but Reese wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t necessary. She intended to spend a good deal of his money that afternoon, so the least she could do was accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cWould you, Jacquie? I\u2019d come back for it, but I need it ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He told her where to find it near his desk in the den. Jacqueline went in there and found the briefcase just where he\u2019d said it would be. The den was in Reese\u2019s section of the house and she rarely ventured inside. For a moment, she lingered, trailing her fingers over the perfectly aligned books on the mahogany shelves. On rare occasions Reese smoked a cigar and the scent of rich tobacco and leather was more prominent in this room than anywhere else in the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sense of nostalgia filled her and a longing she could hardly explain. She felt a dull ache as she remembered the love they\u2019d somehow let slip away. The love of their early years...She never allowed herself to acknowledge the isolation they\u2019d forced upon each other. She did now, and the sadness settled over her like a heavy rain-drenched coat.</p><p>It was hard to figure out precisely when it\u2019d happened to them or why. His Tuesday-night mistress was a symptom of their alienation, not a cause. They were already drifting apart when she\u2019d entered the scene. Slowly, through the years, Jacqueline and Reese had lost that closeness. They were both at fault; Reese was stubborn\u2014but so was she.</p><p>Their marriage had eroded to the point that they were roommates more than partners, friends more than lovers. It happened to many couples\u2014she\u2019d heard enough veiled hints and outright confessions from other women to be aware of that. Still, it didn\u2019t lessen her feelings of acute loss. Putting aside her thoughts, she reached for the briefcase and hurried to the garage.</p><p>Jacqueline phoned the nail salon from her car as she headed directly to Blossom Street. The renovations were going well, although parking was still impossible. Jacqueline suddenly realized Reese hadn\u2019t told her where she should leave her car.</p> <p>She tried calling him, but apparently he\u2019d turned off his cell. Twice around the block turned up nothing. The street wasn\u2019t wide enough for her to double park, either. After wasting a precious ten minutes in a fruitless effort to secure a parking space, she pulled into the alley behind A Good Yarn. It wasn\u2019t the best area of town in which to leave an expensive car, and Lydia had warned them against using it, but Jacqueline didn\u2019t have any choice. The alley was narrow and dark and she shuddered involuntarily as she quickly locked the car.</p><p>When she got to the construction site, Reese was nowhere to be seen. However, as soon as she arrived at the trailer, his project manager greeted her. Jacqueline couldn\u2019t recall his name, although she was fairly certain Reese had mentioned the young man. It\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d kept track of his employees\u2019 names.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d the youthful-looking man told her. \u201cI know Reese was pretty upset about forgetting this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any problem,\u201d she murmured, stepping over a pile of rebar on her way out.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, she walked across the street and down the block to the alley entrance. Unfortunately the yarn store wouldn\u2019t be open for another twenty minutes, or she could\u2019ve walked through there. As she entered the darkened alley, Jacqueline\u2019s anger increased steadily. No wonder her marriage was in trouble. Instead of greeting her personally, Reese had sent his assistant\u2014as if he took for granted that she\u2019d interrupt her entire day on his behalf. Next time he could damn well retrieve his own briefcase.</p> <p>Disgruntled, Jacqueline was halfway into the alley before an eerie warning sensation crawled up her spine. She stopped and looked suspiciously around. Nothing. She relaxed and mentally chastised herself for being foolish. The sun had yet to clear the tops of the buildings and the area remained cool and shady. She moved forward two more steps and stopped again as the sensation grew stronger, more compelling.</p><p>Her imagination was running away with her, Jacqueline decided. She\u2019d watched one too many episodes of CSI. Still, her fear persisted, growing more intense by the moment. But she had to get to her car. What alternative did she have? It was either that or stand here all morning.</p><p>She was no more than twenty feet from her Mercedes when two men stepped out from the shadows. They loomed in front of her, half-obscured by the darkness. Menacing. She couldn\u2019t see their faces clearly but she saw their sneers. They were street people, she thought, unkempt and filthy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d one called to the other, who moved quickly to block her exit.</p><p>Jacqueline broke into a cold sweat. Instinct told her to run, but she feared her legs were about to collapse. And in her heels, she had little chance of escaping if they decided to chase her.</p><p>\u201cKindly get out of my way,\u201d she demanded and was rather pleased with her bravado.</p> <p>\u201cKindly,\u201d the second man, the taller of the two, echoed in a falsetto voice, raising his right arm and dangling his wrist. \u201cWe got ourselves a genuine lady here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow give it up, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline clutched her purse tighter against her side. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever could refuse a dare, could we, Larry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d the other man shouted, obviously angry that his friend had said his name. He pulled out a switchblade and brandished it in front of Jacqueline.</p><p>Despite her determination to remain calm, she gasped. The blade gleamed in what little light had broken through the alley.</p> <p>He held out his arm as if he expected her to meekly hand over her purse, and Jacqueline realized this wasn\u2019t a request but a command. Any resistance would surely be met with violence.</p><p>Although she wasn\u2019t aware she\u2019d released it, her designer bag fell to the asphalt.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch that if I were you,\u201d a brusque female voice shouted from behind Jacqueline. \u201cAren\u2019t you on probation, Ralph? Be a real shame to see your sorry ass back in jail so soon.\u201d</p><p>It took Jacqueline a moment to recognize Alix Townsend\u2019s voice. Alix, the girl she considered a felon and a crude punk rocker, had risked her own life and come to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this,\u201d Larry growled, baring his teeth at the two women.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys,\u201d Alix said, waltzing forward, \u201cbut this lady happens to be a good friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline stayed where she was, incapable of moving. Even her breathing had gone shallow.</p><p>Larry looked at the purse. \u201cYou want her for yourself,\u201d he muttered. He clenched the knife tighter and raised it.</p><p>A clicking sound followed but the noise didn\u2019t immediately register in Jacqueline\u2019s mind. Then she understood. Alix carried a switchblade of her own.</p><p>\u201cThey can have the money.\u201d Jacqueline didn\u2019t care; she just wanted both of them out of this mess without getting hurt.</p><p>\u201cNo, they can\u2019t,\u201d Alix yelled as the two men started toward them. \u201cGet over to the yarn store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jacqueline didn\u2019t know where she found the courage, but she scooped up her purse and swung it wildly at the two men. She\u2019d paid seven hundred dollars for the Gucci bag and it served her well, connecting with a solid crunch against the shorter man\u2019s head. Ralph howled with pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on back here?\u201d Lydia shouted from the rear door of her shop.</p><p>\u201cCall 9-1-1,\u201d Jacqueline screamed, panic raising her voice.</p><p>Alix crouched forward, her arms outstretched with a switchblade firmly gripped in her left hand. The men looked at the two women and at the empty door frame where Lydia had stood only seconds earlier. They glanced at each other and then ran for it, racing past Jacqueline and Alix.</p><p>As soon as they were out of sight, Jacqueline started to shake. The trembling began in her hands, and quickly moved down her arms and legs until it seemed that her knees had taken on a life of their own.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>Jacqueline shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThe police are on their way,\u201d Lydia called.</p><p>\u201cLarry and Ralph are gone now.\u201d Alix wrapped her arm around Jacqueline\u2019s waist and guided her through the back door of Lydia\u2019s shop.</p><p>The table where they sat for their classes seemed a mile away before Jacqueline reached it and literally fell into a chair.</p><p>\u201cI...I could\u2019ve been murdered.\u201d She\u2019d seen the look in those men\u2019s eyes. God only knew what they would\u2019ve done to her if Alix hadn\u2019t come into the alley when she had.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d In that moment, Jacqueline wanted to call back every ugly thought she\u2019d ever had regarding the young woman. She didn\u2019t care what color Alix dyed her hair. The girl had saved her from a fate she could hardly imagine.</p><p>Alix sat down next to her, and Jacqueline soon noticed that she was badly shaken, too. She\u2019d put on a brave front when she confronted the two men, but she\u2019d been terrified.</p><p>A siren blared outside and Lydia dashed to the front of the store to wait for the patrolmen. A few minutes later, two police officers entered the shop.</p><p>All three women started talking at once. Jacqueline felt she should be the one to explain; she was the one who\u2019d been accosted, after all. She continued speaking, raising her voice in order to be heard above the other two.</p><p>\u201cOne at a time, ladies,\u201d the first officer said, holding up his hand. He was young and clean-cut and reminded her of her son. Paul would be outraged when he learned she\u2019d nearly been mugged.</p><p>The officer started with Jacqueline and when he\u2019d finished, he asked Alix a few questions and finally Lydia. Each woman described the men in slightly different ways, although Alix seemed reluctant to discuss the matter. At first she didn\u2019t reveal their names, but if Alix had forgotten, Jacqueline hadn\u2019t.</p><p>With their descriptions known, plus their first names, it made sense that the two hoodlums would be apprehended shortly. Jacqueline had already decided to press charges. All the while she was speaking, she clutched her Gucci bag with both hands.</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d the patrolman asked, glancing from Jacqueline to Alix.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking knitting classes together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Alix muttered, and defiantly tilted her chin in their direction as if daring him to challenge her. \u201cJacqueline and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved me from God knows what,\u201d Jacqueline murmured.</p><p>The officer shook his head. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been smarter just to give them your purse.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline knew he was right. All the survival manuals stated that in such a situation, the best course of action was to drop the purse and run.</p><p>Once the policemen had left, Jacqueline looked over at Alix who remained seated at the table across from her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded in full agreement. She still wasn\u2019t sure what had led Alix into the alley. When questioned by the police she explained that she\u2019d seen Jacqueline go in there and didn\u2019t think it was a safe place for her friend to be. So she\u2019d followed her. And Jacqueline would be forever grateful that she had.</p><p>Her one concern was that she owed Alix now. She could only speculate what the girl would want as payment.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>T he two days following the IVF procedure had been the worst. The specialist had instructed Carol to stay perfectly still for forty-eight hours. The enforced rest got on her nerves after only a few hours, but with every breath she drew, with every solid beat of her heart, she made herself think positive, nurturing thoughts.</p><p>She was all too aware that she was at the very end of the road, technologically speaking, for a biological child. She and Doug had decided this was it. They got their three chances through the insurance company and two of them were gone. IVF was expensive, time-consuming, unpredictable and uncertain. Correction, some aspects of the procedure were a certainty. Injections, frequent bloodwork and ultrasounds. She\u2019d been poked and prodded so often she barely noticed it anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol refused to allow herself to dwell on any of the negatives. This time she\u2019d have her baby. This time at least one of the fertilized eggs implanted in her womb would take hold\u2014and she\u2019d keep the pregnancy. Nine months from now, she\u2019d hold a baby in her arms and experience the joy that had been denied her all these years.</p><p>Doug had been wonderful. He\u2019d done everything possible to make her comfortable. Still, Carol recognized the look in his eyes, the longing that went un-spoken, and the fear that despite everything, they couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, have a child. This wasn\u2019t easy for Doug and while he tried to hide it, Carol knew he was worried. So was she.</p><p>Thinking positive had grown more difficult by the second day, especially with Doug tiptoeing around her. The argument that flared between them that dreadful evening was neither her fault nor his; it was an explosion of emotion and frustration. Doug had stormed out of the house and didn\u2019t return until after midnight. Carol was relieved he hadn\u2019t been driving, because she smelled alcohol on his breath when he returned.</p><p>They made up the next morning, just as she\u2019d known they would, and Doug had left for work after downing two cups of coffee and refusing breakfast. Now they had to wait, three weeks to be sure of the pregnancy and three months to be confident about it. By then their patience would be even more frayed.</p> <p>Ten days after the procedure, Lydia phoned. This was the first time she\u2019d called Carol at home and it was good to hear a friendly voice.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you and was wondering how you\u2019re doing,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The high-pitched burst of enthusiasm betrayed her.</p><p>\u201cI mean, how are you really feeling?\u201d Lydia murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot so great,\u201d Carol admitted. \u201cOh, Lydia, this is hard. Right now, it\u2019s a waiting game, and both Doug and I are so tense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me take you to lunch, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Lunch out sounded divine, but she knew Lydia had responsibilities. \u201cWhat about the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to Mom, and she\u2019s going to come here for a couple of hours. Would you like to meet on the waterfront? It\u2019s such a perfect day for it.\u201d</p><p>Carol agreed. The sun was out and Puget Sound was an intense sapphire blue. Nothing would please her more than to get away from the condo for a few hours.</p><p>They chose a restaurant, a little hole-in-the-wall place that specialized in fish and chips, scallops and shrimp dishes. By the time Carol arrived, Lydia had already obtained a table on the patio. The breeze off the water had the briny scent of sea air. Seagulls shrieked in their usual exuberant way. The white-topped peaks of the Olympics glowed in the distance and a Washington State ferry was docked at the pier close by. It was everything Carol loved about living in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>\u201cThis is an unexpected surprise,\u201d Carol told her as she took the chair across from Lydia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so beautiful I couldn\u2019t bear to stay inside a minute longer. My mother\u2019s been after me to take some time for myself, and today I decided she was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little\u2014enough to get by. She loves the idea of standing in for me. It gives her an emotional boost to think she\u2019s helping, and she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank her for me.\u201d</p><p>Lydia smiled. \u201cActually, I\u2019m grateful for the break, too. I needed it. I\u2019m glad you could join me at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>Carol had only known Lydia a short while, but she considered the other woman her friend. Not since her college days had she had time to invest in friendships. Lydia had mentioned her eagerness to make new friends, too; they\u2019d arrived at a similar point in their lives but for entirely different reasons. They\u2019d talked frequently and Lydia encouraged Carol\u2019s growing love for knitting. It was easy to like Lydia; she was so gentle, so quiet and unassuming. Carol had never once heard Lydia raise her voice or lose her patience. Only when she talked about knitting and yarn did she become animated or excited. Carol was impressed by Lydia\u2019s calm manner when she dealt with the outbursts between Alix and Jacqueline. It couldn\u2019t be easy having them both in the same class. More than once Carol had to bite her tongue to keep from asking if their behavior wasn\u2019t a little juvenile.</p><p>Seated under the shade of the overhead umbrella, Carol glanced at the menu. She decided on seafood fettuccini, a longtime favorite. She almost never ordered it in a restaurant because no recipe had ever matched the one her mother had given her. While she hadn\u2019t done much cooking until recently, she made a delectable olive-oil-based seafood spaghetti that Doug always raved about.</p><p>They discussed knitting and friendship, shared stories of growing up and talked about books they\u2019d both read. The highlight of their lunch was the story of Alix rescuing Jacqueline from muggers in the back alley.</p> <p>Carol decided to stop at the market on her way home to pick up something for dinner. Her appetite had been nonexistent lately, ever since the procedure, and dinners had been thrown together at the last minute with little forethought or effort. If not for Doug, she would have foregone the meal entirely.</p><p>When Carol left the waterfront, she felt a great deal better. Amazing what a little girl-time could do. She bought a small sirloin tip roast at the market and walked back to the condo, feeling refreshed, glorying in the sunshine.</p><p>The moment he arrived home, Doug noticed the difference in her mood. He smiled and kissed her, then went into the bedroom to change clothes. When he reappeared, he had on his Mariners baseball jacket and hat.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said when he saw the look on her face. \u201cBill and I have tickets for the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She shrugged off her disappointment. Her afternoon with Lydia had done her a world of good and she wouldn\u2019t begrudge her husband a night with his longtime college friend.</p><p>Minutes later, he was out the door. It was the first time all week she\u2019d cooked a decent meal, and Doug wouldn\u2019t be home to enjoy it. Life seemed to be full of such little ironies.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t feeling sorry for herself, not really, but her elated mood had definitely sagged by the time her brother phoned. They hadn\u2019t talked since his visit the month before.</p><p>\u201cCan I come over?\u201d he asked, sounding depressed.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but it\u2019s just me. Doug\u2019s at the Mariners\u2019 game with Bill.\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s sigh was audible. \u201cActually, that\u2019s probably better.\u201d</p><p>This was a surprising comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I get there.\u201d</p><p>Her brother showed up less than half an hour later. Carol hadn\u2019t ever seen him look this bad\u2014unshaven, with dark circles under his eyes. He collapsed into a chair and when she offered him a beer, he muttered, \u201cDo you have anything stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer, then.\u201d He leaned forward and braced his elbow on his knees, letting his forearms dangle.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me or do I have to guess?\u201d she asked as she handed him a cold beer.</p><p>Rick twisted off the cap and took a deep swig. \u201cWas I born stupid or did I recently acquire this personality trait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer depends on your problem,\u201d she said, sitting across from him. Infuriating though Rick could be, it was difficult to stay angry with him for long. She supposed his easygoing personality was as much of a hindrance as it was an asset. Perhaps everything had come too easily for him.</p><p>\u201cLisa\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he said.</p><p>Carol stared at him blankly. \u201cLisa? Lisa who?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. \u201cA flight attendant I\u2019ve seen a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you\u2019ve done more than see her,\u201d Carol snapped, unable to hide her anger. This was unbelievable. For a moment she thought it might be a bad joke, but one look told her he was serious. Just a few weeks ago he\u2019d declared his undying love for his ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ellie?\u201d she cried. \u201cThe last time we talked, you were hoping to get back together with her.\u201d Sleeping with some other woman certainly didn\u2019t prove his devotion.</p><p>\u201cI know...I love Ellie and I want her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what were you doing with Lisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just sort of happened,\u201d he mumbled dejectedly.</p><p>Carol shook her head, barely able to take in what her brother was telling her. \u201cYou just sort of fell into bed together?\u201d Her voice grew more agitated with every word. So this was the reason Ellie didn\u2019t trust him. She\u2019d hinted at the truth, but Carol had refused to listen, refused to believe that her big, strong, wonderful brother had clay feet\u2014and a clay heart.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d Rick urged.</p><p>Carol shook her head again, viewing her brother in an entirely different light. All these years he\u2019d been her hero; now, all of a sudden she saw him for the weak charmer he really was. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly made a mess this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, little sister, you can\u2019t say anything I haven\u2019t already said to myself. This ruins everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd exactly whose fault is that?\u201d she demanded. Unable to stay seated any longer, she jumped to her feet and started pacing the room. \u201cYou\u2019re too smart to have unprotected sex, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Rick closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoes Ellie know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He nearly shouted the word. \u201cI\u2019m not telling her, either, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? She\u2019s in shock, too\u2014apparently whatever she used for birth control failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Carol was furious with her brother and too angry to care what he thought.</p><p>She took a few minutes to adjust to the news. She sat down again and placed her hand over her mouth. Her brother hadn\u2019t come to her so she could rant at him. He was clearly looking for some sort of direction, although she had no idea what to suggest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one hundred percent sure the baby is yours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and studied his hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty involved lately.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a retort. \u201cHow far along is she?\u201d she asked instead, her voice brisk.</p><p>\u201cShe just found out. A month, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Carol flipped her hair away from her face and tried to concentrate. \u201cWhen did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. She phoned me in a panic and, hell, I didn\u2019t know what to say. What could I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>Rick considered her question for a moment, then slowly shook his head. \u201cI care about her and I like her, but as for loving her, not really. I know I don\u2019t want to marry her. Why should I marry her because she forgot to swallow some pill?\u201d Rick\u2019s expression was miserable, shocked and angry all at once. \u201cI love Ellie,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellie I want to be with, it\u2019s Ellie I need in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve kept your pants zipped.\u201d Carol didn\u2019t mean to be crude, but her brother frustrated her. If he loved Ellie, truly loved her, he should be willing to do whatever it took to win her back. Sleeping with a flight attendant shouldn\u2019t even be on that list. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to marry Lisa, then what?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>With her eyes opened, Carol confronted him, daring him to tell her the truth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time for what? If you\u2019re asking whether I\u2019ve fathered other kids, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve always been careful, but Lisa said...\u201d He let the rest fade.</p> <p>\u201cI meant this isn\u2019t the first time you cheated on Ellie.\u201d Technically they were divorced, so it couldn\u2019t really be considered adultery. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason she filed for divorce, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked up briefly and nodded.</p><p>Rick stayed for an hour, and they talked while dinner went cold. He was still in shock and, frankly, so was she. Rick had always been her idol and in the space of a few minutes he\u2019d tumbled from his pedestal.</p><p>She ended up making steak sandwiches and coffee, and Rick left soon afterward for his hotel. He definitely needed sleep, but he and Carol planned to talk again the next day.</p><p>Doug returned home an hour later, thrilled that the Mariners had handily defeated the Yankees. Carol told him about the visit from her brother and his devastating news.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d her husband told her. They sat side by side on the sofa, Doug\u2019s arm around her. \u201cRick\u2019s always been a ladies\u2019 man.\u201d</p><p>Carol found it hard to believe her brother could be so morally lacking. It was as if this person she\u2019d grown up with and loved was a stranger. \u201cYou knew and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. You always thought he could do no wrong.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it ever since I\u2019ve known him. Fooling around with one woman while seeing another.\u201d Doug held her close for several seconds. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m not overly fond of Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoug! How can you say such a thing?\u201d Rick was the one who\u2019d introduced her to her husband. They\u2019d been college friends and dorm mates. But now that she thought about it, Carol realized Doug had never shown as much enthusiasm for seeing Rick as she did.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, honey. The only good thing that came out of the friendship was meeting you. I\u2019ve never liked his ethics.\u201d</p><p>Carol let his words sink in. She was seeing her brother realistically for the very first time. He was a selfish little boy who refused to grow up. She wondered how many people had recognized it before her.</p><p>Later, as Carol snuggled close to her husband in bed, she couldn\u2019t help thinking about life\u2019s many injustices.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it,\u201d she asked in a whisper, \u201cthat women who don\u2019t want to get pregnant have such an easy time of it?\u201d</p><p>She felt her husband\u2019s slight nod of agreement. \u201cI wish I had an answer, sweetheart, but life just isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she muttered for the second time that night.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p> <p>A lix slept late on Friday morning, lying in bed while the last remnants of sleep faded away. She was warm and comfortable and unwilling to move. Keeping her eyes closed, she let her mind linger on the kiss she\u2019d shared with Jordan. Never in all her life had she realized a kiss could be so good.</p><p>She\u2019d been kissed plenty, and had lots of other experience, too. Still, no kiss had affected her like that one. The men she knew tended to be rough and sweaty and urgent in their need to dominate. She\u2019d never known such sweet pleasure from a simple kiss. But then, she reminded herself, this could all be tied up with a childhood dream that had been shattered one night in the sixth grade.</p><p>Even now, more than a week later, she remembered every nuance of his kiss. His hands had framed her face and his eyes had locked with hers. She\u2019d seen his look of surprise\u2014and uncertainty. They\u2019d parted soon afterward, and it almost seemed to her that they needed to get away from each other in order to assimilate what had happened.</p><p>Alix hadn\u2019t seen Jordan since, hadn\u2019t talked to him, either. She tried not to dwell on that. Unsure what prompted her, on Sunday morning Alix had walked over to the Free Methodist church Jordan had mentioned. She stood across the street and chain-smoked three cigarettes while she watched people file in.</p><p>Jordan was right about one thing: only a few of the older adults wore hats and gloves and dresses. Various families came with youngsters in tow, all carrying Bibles. Alix had only ever owned one Bible and that had been so long ago, she didn\u2019t know where it had gone. Staring at the churchgoers, she saw that most people wore casual clothes, but that wasn\u2019t a strong enough incentive to send her inside.</p><p>She\u2019d loitered on the corner, hoping, she guessed, that Jordan would notice her. He obviously hadn\u2019t; she didn\u2019t see him either.</p><p>The music was good, upbeat and lively\u2014not what she remembered at all. Alix had heard church music as a kid and it had sounded like something out of the Middle Ages, but it wasn\u2019t that way now. Once she\u2019d even caught herself humming along and quickly stopped.</p><p>After about forty minutes, she\u2019d walked away, hands buried deep in her pockets. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt to slip into the back pew and take a look, but fear made that impossible. Analyzing her actions now, nearly a week later, Alix wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d been so afraid of. The possibility of someone talking to her, perhaps.</p><p>Rather than brood on last week\u2019s disappointment, Alix tossed back the sheets and climbed slowly out of bed. Laurel was sitting in front of the television, an old model with a faded picture tube and tinfoil-wrapped rabbit ears. Her roommate stared intently at a kids\u2019 cartoon.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Alix muttered as she wandered into their tiny kitchen.</p><p>Laurel ignored her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d she asked irritably. They were supposed to be friends, but Laurel rarely spoke to her anymore. She\u2019d been sulking for weeks now.</p><p>Laurel shook her head, silently indicating that she didn\u2019t want to talk. Alix had no idea what was bothering her, but she assumed it had something to do with that worm of a used-car salesman. He hadn\u2019t been around lately. For a while they\u2019d been together constantly and then all of a sudden he was out of the picture. Whatever had happened remained a mystery. Laurel certainly wasn\u2019t telling.</p><p>\u201cFine, be in a bad mood.\u201d Alix reached for a banana. \u201cSee if I care.\u201d</p><p>Once again Laurel ignored her. Peeling the banana, Alix plopped down on the one stuffed chair in the apartment. Someone had abandoned it in a vacant lot. Alix and Laurel had come upon it and carried it the three blocks back to the apartment. It was pretty ratty, but Alix had found a printed sheet and spread it over the chair. With a few tucks and folds it wasn\u2019t half bad. No designers would be asking her to make a guest appearance on their shows, but it worked for now.</p><p>Biting into the banana, Alix noticed that the baby blanket she was knitting lay on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d she demanded. She flew off the chair to rescue her project. The ball of yarn had unwound and ended up near the apartment door.</p><p>Laurel wasn\u2019t paying her any heed.</p><p>Standing directly in front of the television, Alix glared at her roommate. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is, but get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your knitting away from me.\u201d</p><p>Alix snickered; she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did it chase after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you threw it at the door?\u201d Talk about unreasonable!</p><p>Laurel didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Alix examined the nearly completed blanket, unsure what she\u2019d do if Laurel had caused her to drop stitches or worse, pulled out the needles. Laurel was treading precariously close to a fight. Alix was sick of her roommate\u2019s bad moods, sick of her slovenly habits and sick of her mooning over a man who was a loser with a capital L.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, will you?\u201d she snapped on her way back to the bedroom. They shared the one bedroom, which made life all the more difficult. The latest rumors floating around said the apartment building had been sold. Where they\u2019d move next was as unclear as the stitches Alix had yet to master.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be so cruel if you...\u201d Laurel didn\u2019t finish. Instead she buried her face in her hands and burst into tears.</p><p>Alix felt awful. Sitting next to Laurel, she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s lover boy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Laurel nodded. \u201cHe said...he doesn\u2019t want to see me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Anything Alix could say at that moment would have been wrong. Laurel didn\u2019t want to hear what a loser John was. Alix didn\u2019t understand why Laurel couldn\u2019t see it when everyone else did. Okay, so John had a decent job. Nevertheless, he was a sleaze and nothing would discount that sad truth.</p><p>Laurel pulled her feet up and locked her arms around her knees. She\u2019d been overweight when they met but now she seemed to be even bigger than Alix remembered. She\u2019d obviously gained weight since the breakup. Now that Alix thought about it, they\u2019d been going through a lot of groceries lately.</p><p>\u201cEating isn\u2019t going to help.\u201d Alix strived to sound sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m fat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fat, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m fat and ugly. You think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Her voice dipped with venom and her greasy blond hair fell forward as she buried her face in her knees. \u201cAnd mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean?\u201d Alix asked, her suspicions growing.</p><p>Laurel nodded. \u201cJordan stopped by the store on Tuesday and asked me to give you a message and I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A chill came over Alix. \u201cWhat was the message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he wanted to take you roller-skating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon with a bunch of kids from his church and I didn\u2019t tell you.... I know I should have, but I didn\u2019t want you to have a man when I don\u2019t. I\u2019m fat and ugly and no one wants me.\u201d</p><p>Laurel stood and reached inside her jeans for a folded-up piece of paper. \u201cI was supposed to give you this.\u201d</p><p>Alix unfolded the flyer and saw that it announced an afternoon skating party at a rink five blocks away. Alix stared at the page and turned it over to find a note Jordan had written her. \u201cAlix, I\u2019m looking for a partner. You interested?\u201d</p><p>The way her heart nearly exploded told her she was. But skating? Her? Alix had never put on a pair of skates in her life. When she was five or six, all the kids who lived in the same apartment complex had roller skates. Alix had desperately longed for a pair. But finances were always a problem for her family. There wasn\u2019t enough money for beer, cigarettes, drugs and roller skates, too.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d she asked Laurel, well aware of what it felt like to be excluded.</p><p>Laurel looked up, then shook her head. \u201cNo. Are you actually doing it?\u201d She didn\u2019t hide her astonishment.</p><p>Alix shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She took an hour to think it over. Jordan claimed he liked her for herself. She wasn\u2019t sure she should believe him; what he remembered was the girl she\u2019d been at eleven, which was a far sight from the woman she was now. Despite her doubts she realized she wanted to trust him, wanted to be with him, the same way she had all those years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing had ever come easy for Alix. Everything had been a struggle. If she was going to have a good life, she had to make it happen herself. That recognition fired her determination to give this relationship a chance.</p><p>Alix was waiting outside the skating rink, leaning against the building, when the big yellow church bus pulled up. The doors opened and about a thousand pre-teens poured out. No one paid much attention to Alix until Jordan walked over to her, wearing the biggest grin she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not skating.\u201d She wanted that understood. \u201cI came to watch.\u201d She wasn\u2019t willing to play the role of klutz in front of a crowd of teenyboppers.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be missing out on all the fun.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t care; no one was strapping her into a pair of skates.</p><p>The rink opened and the kids swarmed inside. Alix hung around on the street, smoking a cigarette, then casually wandered into the rink. Already kids were skating on the polished wooden floor, speeding around and around with the music blasting. This wasn\u2019t music Alix recognized\u2014but then she realized she did. She\u2019d heard one of the songs while she was standing outside the church last Sunday morning. The rink apparently provided Christian rock.</p><p>Alix had to look for Jordan. Then she saw him, surrounded by kids. They followed him wherever he went\u2014as though he were Moses, she thought with a smile. Some of that Bible stuff had definitely stuck. Jordan was busy helping them with their skates and putting on his own. Before he ventured into the rink, he stopped and gazed around. When he saw her, he smiled that lazy, happy grin and she nodded her head in acknowledgement. He winked back, and it felt as if the sun was shining directly on her.</p><p>Despite her curiosity, Alix remained in the background, taking everything in. Jordan finally skated into the rink, faltering a bit before he found his balance. Once he did, he began skating smoothly and confidently; she found it a pleasure to watch. A few of the kids skated around him, and some of them were really good, skating backward and doing creative dance-style moves to the music.</p> <p>When Alix lost sight of Jordan, she moved closer to the railing. Jordan skated past and waved. It didn\u2019t take long for the church kids to notice the attention he paid Alix. Several stopped to look at her and chat among themselves. Alix ignored them.</p><p>\u201cIs Jordan your friend?\u201d a girl asked. She couldn\u2019t be more than thirteen, with perfect dark hair and olive skin. Another girl, a blonde in braces, stood beside her.</p><p>Alix nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned you,\u201d Blondie said.</p><p>Okay, so Alix was curious. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>The other girl answered. \u201cJordan said he\u2019d invited a friend to join him. He said you used to be his valentine.\u201d</p> <p>Alix shrugged. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kinda cute, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Blondie said.</p><p>Alix shrugged again. Anything she said was sure to get back to Jordan.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to skate?\u201d the first girl asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>Jordan went around the rink at least a dozen times, then pleaded fatigue and glided over to stand next to Alix. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to think you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>She almost hadn\u2019t, but she didn\u2019t mention the reason.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never skated before, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery kid\u2019s skated,\u201d she returned, rather than confess the truth.</p><p>An hour later, Alix was wearing a pair of skates. Before she knew it, her two newfound friends had convinced her to give it a try. Once Alix had on the skates, the girls led her into the rink, each holding one of her hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we aren\u2019t going to let you fall,\u201d the blond girl promised.</p><p>The girls gripped her fingers hard enough for Alix to believe it.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Two feet onto the slick wooden floor, Alix started flailing. Not ten seconds later, she was flat on her butt. She didn\u2019t have a chance to even think before Jordan came up behind her and tucked his arms under hers, swooping her upright.</p><p>\u201cEveryone falls.\u201d Then with his arm around her waist and his free hand holding hers, they made one full circuit of the rink. Kids whizzed past them at speeds that made Alix dizzy. She didn\u2019t look. Couldn\u2019t look. She needed all her concentration to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t so hard.\u201d She was starting to get the feel of it. Despite herself she laughed. It was as if she were six years old again and Santa had delivered that pair of roller skates, after all.</p><p>\u201cCherie says you\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t care what the little blond girl thought. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d she asked Jordan.</p><p>He grinned down at her. \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty cool, too.\u201d</p><p>His words were more beautiful than any music she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>\u201cPeople who say they don\u2019t have enough patience to knit are precisely those who could most improve their lives by learning how!\u201d</p><p>\u2014Sally Melville, author of The Knitting Experience series</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>T his has been quite a week. It\u2019s unheard of for me to have two social engagements within the same seven-day period. My lunch on Wednesday with Carol did so much good\u2014for both of us. I feel I connected with her and extended a hand of friendship. She responded, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll stay in touch, whether or not she continues to knit.</p><p>The class earlier this afternoon was the best yet. Following the incident in the back alley, Alix and Jacqueline were cordial and just shy of friendly. Jacqueline relayed the details of the confrontation in minute detail, with Alix leaping in to add comments. Anyone looking at them would think they were longtime friends.</p><p>When I asked Jacqueline how her husband had reacted when she told him about the incident, she\u2019d gone suspiciously quiet. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that, but I have the feeling all is not well between Jacqueline and Reese Donovan.</p><p>The class flew by, and then I was seeing Brad for drinks. We were meeting at The Pour House for a beer at six after I\u2019d closed for the day. Despite the drizzle we\u2019d had intermittently since early morning, I was in a great mood.</p><p>The Pour House was about two blocks off Blossom, and seemed to be a popular hangout for the after-work crowd. The noise level was high with music blaring from a jukebox, high-spirited laughter and a television above the bar, which had a ball game on. I\u2019m not very interested in sports, but I know lots of men are. Between the noise and the room\u2019s darkness, I felt a bit disoriented.</p><p>Brad had found a booth near the back, and when he saw me, he stood, waving his arms over his head. I smiled and waved back, then quickly made my way across the room, negotiating tables and chairs.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to think you weren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said as he slid back into the booth.</p><p>\u201cAm I late?\u201d I glanced at my watch, and was surprised to see that it was almost fifteen minutes past six. I shook the rain off my jacket and Brad hung it up for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it, but I\u2019ve only got half an hour or so. The day care teacher said she\u2019d keep Cody until seven-fifteen but not a minute longer and it takes me at least twenty minutes to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight. He keeps telling me he\u2019s too old to be in day care, but I\u2019m not letting him stay by himself all day.\u201d Judging by Brad\u2019s frown, I guessed this had been a frequent argument over the summer. \u201cSometimes I swear that kid\u2019s eight going on eighteen.\u201d</p><p>I thought of my own two nieces and while I might not be a mother, I understood what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cSince we don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Brad said, \u201cI\u2019d rather not waste it talking about me. I want to learn about you.\u201d</p><p>I considered myself the least intriguing of subjects. Nevertheless, I was flattered by his curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of interest in knitting, but isn\u2019t it risky to open a shop right now?\u201d he asked before I could forestall him with questions of my own. I knew so little about Brad except what my eyes told me. He was as handsome as sin. From bits and pieces of conversation, I also knew he was divorced and apparently had custody of his eight-year-old son, but that was about it.</p><p>He certainly wasn\u2019t the first person to express concern about my timing. Everyone worried that I was going to become a victim of our weak economy, that I was in over my head. But I\u2019d been treading water since I was sixteen, so opening my own yarn store was no riskier than anything else in my life. Margaret had come right out and declared that I was making a mistake. But if I\u2019d waited until all the conditions were ideal, it would never have happened. After two bouts with cancer, I knew I couldn\u2019t wait for life to be perfect. I had to find my own happiness and quit waiting for it to find me.</p><p>I saw that he\u2019d already ordered a pitcher of beer, which had just arrived. He paid the waitress and poured us each a glass. \u201cMy dad died just after Christmas,\u201d I said as if that explained everything. \u201cI was dealing with that loss, and then one day I found myself knitting furiously and remembered a conversation we\u2019d had several years earlier.\u201d</p><p>Brad sipped his beer and nodded for me to continue.</p><p>My throat got a bit scratchy but I ignored the emotion that filled me at the mention of my father. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever grow accustomed to having lost him. I paused for a moment.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Brad encouraged.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, I figured I was the one who didn\u2019t have long to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d I wanted to be sure he understood. I waited for a reaction from him, but he gave me none.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou were talking about your father.\u201d</p><p>I sipped my beer. He\u2019d chosen a dark ale and I liked it. \u201cI was in the hospital, and it was the night before my second brain surgery. Mom and Dad came to spend the evening with me. Mom was reading, and Dad and I were talking.\u201d I remember that night so well because in my own heart I was convinced I\u2019d be dead before the year was over. Dad was the one who believed in me, who insisted I was going to cheat death a second time.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to describe one perfect day,\u201d I told Brad. I knew he was forcing me to acknowledge that I wanted to live. The question was his way of drawing me into a future. A future I firmly believed was unavailable to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Brad had leaned forward and cupped both hands around his mug.</p><p>I closed my eyes for a few seconds. \u201cThat I wanted to wake up in my own bed instead of one in a hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame you there.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. Brad made it surprisingly easy to talk about myself. \u201cNext I wanted to be able to smell flowers and be close to the water and feel sunshine on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Pacific Northwest?\u201d He smiled as he asked the question and I couldn\u2019t help responding with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy perfect day happens in late summer, when we get plenty of sunshine.\u201d This past Wednesday was a good example. \u201cNow don\u2019t distract me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d His eyes fairly twinkled and for a moment I was so mesmerized I had to make myself look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wake to sunshine and the sounds of birds,\u201d I continued, \u201cand my perfect day would begin with a cup of strong coffee and a warm croissant. I\u2019d take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d knit.\u201d I remember how astonished my father had seemed when I told him that. He shouldn\u2019t have been. By that time I\u2019d been knitting for years. I remembered how my wanting to knit\u2014seeing it as a perfect part of my perfect day\u2014bothered him. Knitting, in his eyes, was such a solitary activity that I\u2019d soon become a recluse.</p> <p>\u201cKnitting in your own store?\u201d Brad murmured.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d One of the things I love most about being a knitter is the community of other knitters. Anytime I run into another person (usually a woman but not always) who knits, it\u2019s like finding a long-lost friend. The two of us instantly connect. It doesn\u2019t matter that only seconds earlier we were strangers, because we immediately share a common bond. I\u2019d talked to other knitters in doctors\u2019 offices, in line-ups at the grocery store\u2014anywhere at all. We\u2019ve exchanged horror stories of misprinted instructions and uncompleted projects. And we all loved to brag about fabulous yarn buys and, of course, discuss our current efforts.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to help people discover the same sense of satisfaction and pride that I feel when I finish a project for someone I love.\u201d That was the best way to describe it, I thought.</p><p>\u201cHow would you end your perfect day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith music and champagne and candlelight,\u201d I said shyly, which was only partially true. I\u2019d told my dad I wanted to end the day dancing.</p> <p>My father had told me I\u2019d have that perfect day. What neither of us knew was that he wouldn\u2019t be there to enjoy it with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brad asked, watching me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI was just thinking about how much I miss my father.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, Brad reached across the table and squeezed my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough time of it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I bristled. I didn\u2019t want his sympathy or his pity. What I yearned for more than anything was to be normal. One of my biggest fears was that I could no longer recognize what normal was.</p><p>\u201cCancer is part of who I am, but it isn\u2019t everything. I\u2019m in remission today but I can\u2019t speak for tomorrow or next week. I was in a holding pattern for most of my twenties but I\u2019m beyond that now. It wasn\u2019t just the doctors or the medicine or the surgery that saved me, especially since I\u2019d died emotionally when I learned the cancer had returned.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cMy father refused to let me give up, and when I discovered knitting, I felt like I\u2019d found the Holy Grail because it was something I could do by myself. I could do it lying in bed if I had to. It was a way of proving I was more than a victim.\u201d</p> <p>Brad\u2019s eyes grew somber and I think he really heard me.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you want to ask me?\u201d I sat up straighter, prepared to back off now.</p><p>A grin lifted the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow come it took you so long to say yes to a beer with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationships aren\u2019t part of my perfect day,\u201d I teased, although that was far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Mostly I\u2019d been afraid of rejection, I guess. But all I said was, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to go out with me again?\u201d His eyes held mine.</p><p>I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGood, because I only have a few more minutes and I want us to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>We talked for a little while longer, and I finally had the opportunity to ask him some personal questions, mainly about his marriage and his son.</p><p>Forty minutes later, I parked in front of Margaret and Matt\u2019s house. I realized I\u2019ve never shown up at my sister\u2019s home without an invitation. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever actually invited me\u2014and yet here I was, so excited I couldn\u2019t hold still. I was dying to talk to someone, and since my sister had practically forced me into this, I figured she should be that someone.</p><p>I rang the doorbell and then stepped back, half afraid she wouldn\u2019t ask me in. It was Hailey who answered. When she saw me, she shrieked with happiness\u2014and left me standing on the porch while she ran to get her mother.</p><p>\u201cLydia.\u201d Margaret burst into the room and stood on the other side of the closed screen door. \u201cIt is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it was,\u201d Hailey said from behind her mother.</p><p>My sister unlocked the screen door and held it open for me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually drop by unannounced,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I just had to tell you about my meeting with Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, that was tonight.\u201d My sister\u2019s eyes lit up as she pulled me into the house. Before I could comprehend what was going on, she had me sitting at the kitchen table and was on a stepstool in front of the refrigerator, standing on tiptoe as she removed a liquor bottle from the cabinet above.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, almost giddy.</p><p>\u201cA night like this calls for homemade margaritas.\u201d She had a bottle in each hand\u2014one of tequila and one of cointreau.</p><p>I giggled like a schoolgirl. Hailey dug into the freezer portion of the refrigerator for ice cubes while Margaret found limes, then brought out the blender and special glasses.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, my sister had mixed the drinks and dipped the rims of both glasses in salt; she\u2019d also made a virgin drink for Hailey, something involving ginger ale and fruit juice.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Matt and Julia?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBonding at a baseball game,\u201d Margaret explained, handing me my glass. \u201cNow tell all.\u201d</p><p>After two beers and now sipping a mixed drink, I wasn\u2019t sure where to start. \u201cI met Brad at The Pour House.\u201d Both my sister and Hailey drew closer. \u201cHe had less than an hour because he had to pick up his son from day care.\u201d If not for that, I had the feeling we could have spent half the night talking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s paying extra time at day care on a Friday night?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou can bet he paid through the nose for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d I looked from my sister to my niece who hung on every word.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. He asked a lot of questions but he didn\u2019t talk much about himself. Mostly he talked about his son.\u201d</p><p>Margaret shrugged as if that didn\u2019t impress her half as much as his paying extra charges at the day care center. \u201cWhat did he have to say about his ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>I had to think about that for a moment, which gave me time to take another sip of the margarita. My sister possessed talents I would never have suspected. For one thing, this was the best margarita I\u2019d had in years.</p><p>\u201cMostly he glossed over the divorce. They were too young and she decided she didn\u2019t want to be married or responsible for a child. Not once in the entire conversation did Brad say anything negative or derogatory about Cody\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Margaret smiled. \u201cI like him, you know.\u201d</p><p>So did I, but I was cautious. And nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou told him about having cancer?\u201d my niece asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI felt it was only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d Margaret\u2019s gaze was sharp.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took another sip of my drink. \u201cOne more of these margaritas, and I\u2019d probably be willing to marry him.\u201d</p><p>My sister broke into peals of laughter. I can\u2019t remember ever seeing Margaret this pleased with me and, silly as it sounds, I basked in her approval.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>\u201cI s everything all right with you and Reese?\u201d Tammie Lee asked as she began clearing the dining room table.</p><p>Jacqueline sighed and pretended not to hear the question. She\u2019d hoped no one had noticed the tension between her and Reese during tonight\u2019s dinner party. The mayor and two city council members had been in attendance, along with their wives and three other couples.</p><p>At the last minute, not bothering to check with Jacqueline, Reese had invited Paul and Tammie Lee. Having Paul there was, of course, perfect, but Jacqueline had cringed at the prospect of her daughter-in-law sharing her unsophisticated sense of humor with members of the city government. Well, there was nothing Jacqueline could do about it.</p><p>Thankfully, the evening had gone surprisingly well, with only one minor glitch. The mayor had asked Tammie Lee her opinion of the country club. Without a pause Tammie Lee said in her heavy southern twang that it was nothing but tennis and bridge, dining and whining. After a second\u2019s pause, during which Jacqueline wanted to slink away and die, the mayor laughed uproariously. He said it was the most honest thing anyone had ever said to him. Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure whether he actually meant it or was just being a good guest.</p><p>Reese had glared across the dinner table at Jacqueline, as if to tell her how wrong she was about Tammie Lee. And how right he was.</p><p>The invitation to their son and his wife wasn\u2019t the crux of their most recent argument, however. Jacqueline and Reese rarely argued; there was no reason for it. But Reese had exploded when he learned she\u2019d been accosted and nearly mugged by those two creeps. Thank goodness both had been apprehended and arraigned. Despite that, her husband had ranted at her for at least ten minutes, unwilling to listen to reason and all because she\u2019d parked the car in the alley. He had the gall to claim she\u2019d asked to be mugged. And then he\u2019d called her stupid.</p><p>Jacqueline was still furious. How dare Reese say such things to her\u2014especially when she\u2019d been doing him a favor! Because of him, her entire day had been ruined. She\u2019d missed her nail appointment entirely, was late for lunch and so rattled she hadn\u2019t found a thing to buy on her shopping spree.</p><p>Other than unavoidable conversation, they hadn\u2019t spoken in five very long days. They wouldn\u2019t be speaking now except for the dinner party, which had been planned weeks earlier. Canceling at the last minute was not an option, so they\u2019d put their argument behind them and assumed their best behavior. Jacqueline was astonished that Tammie Lee had noticed.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Tammie Lee asked, following Jacqueline into the kitchen with an armload of china.</p><p>Anyone else would have gotten the message and dropped the subject. Not Tammie Lee.</p><p>\u201cYou can put those dishes on the counter,\u201d Jacqueline instructed. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need for you to help. Martha will be here in the morning.\u201d The housekeeper lived in the small guest house in the back. Now that she was older, she rarely had the energy for serving dinner parties. She wanted to retire but Jacqueline relied on her and so Martha stayed on.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave these dishes on the table overnight,\u201d Tammie Lee had insisted and she was right. As soon as everyone had left, Jacqueline would put everything in the dishwasher, a task she preferred to do herself.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely party,\u201d her daughter-in-law said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jacqueline bit her tongue to keep from mentioning that one day Tammie Lee would be expected to hold similar parties of her own. She could only hope that when the time came, Tammie Lee would\u2019ve learned a lesson or two from her. Somehow Jacqueline doubted it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a gracious hostess,\u201d Tammie Lee said, returning with her second load of bone china plates.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jacqueline fought the impulse to remind her daughter-in-law that each of those plates cost more than Tammie Lee\u2019s entire summer wardrobe. \u201cWhere are Reese and Paul?\u201d she asked curiously. Jacqueline was tired; the party had drained her and she was ready for bed. She wanted Paul and Tammie Lee to go home so she could finish up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the den talking.\u201d All the dishes must be in the kitchen now, because Tammie Lee sat down and propped her feet on the opposite chair. She planted her hands on her round belly and rubbed gently. It was more and more obvious now that she was pregnant. Jacqueline hadn\u2019t yet forgiven her son and his wife for keeping the news to themselves for nearly six months.</p> <p>Jacqueline wondered what Reese and Paul were discussing that could possibly take this long. She scraped off the plates and set them inside the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t mind me showing the mayor the blanket you made for our baby,\u201d Tammie Lee murmured. \u201cI think it\u2019s a perfectly lovely thing to do for your first grandchild.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline scowled but kept her head averted so Tammie Lee couldn\u2019t see her reaction. \u201cNo, that was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul and I are so thrilled you knit something for our baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded rather than respond verbally. She continued to scrape leftovers into the garbage disposal.</p> <p>When she\u2019d finished, she claimed a chair next to Tammie Lee, first pouring herself a glass of wine. If she was going to be trapped in the kitchen with her daughter-in-law, she needed fortification.</p><p>Tammie Lee studied her. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time my mama ran over the mailbox with my daddy\u2019s tractor?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline swallowed her groan. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve heard that one,\u201d she said as she swirled the wine around in her goblet.</p><p>If Tammie Lee noticed her sarcasm, she chose to ignore it. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I can remember hearing my daddy holler at Mama. My mama went rushing into the house in tears and I went, too, outraged that my daddy would raise his voice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen tend to speak their minds,\u201d Jacqueline said. She sipped her wine and let it linger on her tongue. At fifty dollars a bottle, she was taking the time to appreciate the finer qualities of this merlot.</p><p>\u201cLater Mama told me that the only reason Daddy had been hollering was because the tractor might have toppled on her. He didn\u2019t care one bit about that mailbox. It was my mama he loved, and she might have been crushed getting that close to the irrigation ditch in the tractor. His yelling was a sign of how much he loved her.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline was sure there was a point to this story, but at the moment it escaped her. She sipped the wine.</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t speak out of turn earlier,\u201d Tammie Lee said softly, her eyes wide.</p><p>Jacqueline shrugged carelessly. \u201cI believe the mayor was...amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the mayor,\u201d Tammie Lee corrected. \u201cI meant when I asked if everything was all right between you and Reese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is perfectly fine between my husband and me,\u201d Jacqueline primly informed her. She downed the rest of the merlot\u2014finer qualities be damned\u2014and set the glass on the table.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Tammie Lee said, \u201cbecause Paul and I love you so much and our baby\u2019s going to need her grandma and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Jacqueline managed a smile. \u201cSo your mother actually ran the tractor over the mailbox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwice?\u201d Perhaps it was the wine, but Jacqueline laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cDaddy wasn\u2019t any happier about it the second time, either.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline would bet not.</p><p>\u201cBut my daddy loves Mama the same way Reese loves you.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline stopped laughing. Reese hadn\u2019t truly loved her in years. Their marriage was one of convenience and comfort. She didn\u2019t complain about his Tuesday night appointments and he didn\u2019t mention the balance on their credit cards. They had a mutually agreeable relationship, but whatever real love they\u2019d once shared was dead.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee.\u201d Paul\u2019s voice rang from the dining room.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d she called, her voice high and animated.</p><p>Reese and Paul came into the kitchen, leaving the connecting door between the kitchen and the dining room swinging in their wake.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d Paul said, smiling down on her with such love it was painful to watch. \u201cAre you ready to head home?\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee nodded and Paul helped her to her feet. Then, to Jacqueline\u2019s shock, her daughter-in-law bent down and threw her arms around her neck.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tammie Lee whispered, hugging her warmly.</p><p>Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. She placed her arms carefully around Tammie Lee and hugged back. It\u2019d been so long since anyone had touched her with so much affection that she found herself close to tears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a wonderful mother-in-law,\u201d Tammie Lee told her. \u201cI think I\u2019m the most blessed woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline gazed at Reese over Tammie Lee\u2019s shoulder. She saw something powerful flickering in his eyes. Could Reese possibly still have feelings for her? Was it the reason he\u2019d been so angry about her parking the car in the alley? That apparently was the point of Tammie Lee\u2019s story.</p><p>The thought seemed almost inconceivable.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol was the first to show up for knitting class on Friday afternoon. She arrived early in order to look through the pattern book for another project.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were knitting your brother a pullover,\u201d Lydia said as Carol leafed through the section of the binder that held men\u2019s sweater patterns.</p><p>\u201cI was, but I\u2019m too upset with him to knit him anything.\u201d Carol hadn\u2019t spoken to Rick in over a week. That in itself wasn\u2019t unusual, but she\u2019d half expected him to keep in touch with her after his confession. This time, his charm wasn\u2019t going to be enough to get him out of the mess he\u2019d created. There were no easy answers.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed and when Carol glanced up, she nearly did a double-take. Alix walked in\u2014wearing jeans and a T-shirt. It was the first time Carol had seen her without the constant black leather jacket and either black pants or a ridiculously short skirt. Her hair looked...less punk. Carol opened her mouth to comment but quickly closed it again. Alix didn\u2019t like having attention directed at her, even though she blatantly strove to be different. If that wasn\u2019t a contradiction in terms, Carol didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alix said, sauntering up to the table. Her manner seemed self-conscious, and she glared at Lydia and Carol as if defying them to comment on her changed appearance. Then she sat down in one of the chairs and took her knitting out of the plastic video-store bag.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d they both responded.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the pregnancy going?\u201d Alix\u2019s voice was matter-of-fact; she seemed to consider this a perfectly normal question.</p><p>Carol saw that Lydia looked over at them warily. No one else had dared ask Carol about her condition. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still peeing blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alix raised her head.</p><p>\u201cThe test that tells me I\u2019m registering as positive for a pregnancy,\u201d Carol explained. With the fertilized embryo implanted in her womb, it wasn\u2019t getting pregnant that was difficult, it was staying pregnant. Twice now she\u2019d lost the baby before the third week. Holding on to the pregnancy this long meant there was hope, but no part of the process was certain. The first three months were the riskiest in any pregnancy. In her online support group, Carol had recently heard from one friend who\u2019d been pregnant for two and a half months only to miscarry. It had been heartbreaking, and every member had felt Susan\u2019s loss deeply.</p><p>The door opened again and Jacqueline came into the shop, bracelets jangling. She wore a tailored pantsuit Carol considered far too formal for the occasion and carried not only her Gucci purse but a leather tote in which she kept her knitting. The woman did like to make an entrance. It was as if she expected everyone to notice she\u2019d arrived and react accordingly. Actually Carol didn\u2019t mind. She\u2019d grown to like all the women in her knitting group.</p><p>She and Jacqueline were onto new projects now. The only one who hadn\u2019t finished the baby blanket was Alix, and Carol suspected it was because she couldn\u2019t afford to buy more yarn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting a new sweater,\u201d Carol said, still leafing through patterns.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d She knew Alix had especially liked the gray cashmere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of it.\u201d She glanced at Lydia and shared a conspiratorial smile with her. \u201cDo you want the yarn?\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the pattern? Do you need that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Alix shoved her knitting into the plastic bag and nearly rubbed her hands in glee. \u201cI\u2019m almost done with the blanket, and I\u2019d like to knit that sweater for a...friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Leave it to Jacqueline to ask.</p><p>\u201cA friend, like I said,\u201d Alix muttered defiantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get high and mighty with me,\u201d Jacqueline snapped. \u201cI was just interested, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline expressing interest in Alix? A few weeks ago that would\u2019ve been unimaginable. The change in attitude between them was dramatic and had begun with the near-mugging in the alley. They still sniped at each other but that seemed more out of habit than conviction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a male friend,\u201d Lydia said, smiling at Alix.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Alix said quickly, too quickly to be convincing.</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s the sweater for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jacqueline murmured, grinning. She winked at Alix, whose cheeks immediately blossomed a fetching shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, it\u2019s a guy I met at the video store,\u201d Alix said irritably. Still, Carol had the feeling that Alix wanted to tell them....</p><p>\u201cDoes he like you?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>Alix shrugged. \u201cHe did when we were in sixth grade\u2014but, well, he\u2019s a preacher and I don\u2019t exactly see the two of us sailing off into the sunset, if you catch my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lydia asked. \u201cPreachers have lives, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Alix lowered her head and concentrated on her knitting. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kisser,\u201d she said in a soft voice.</p><p>Predictably, that piqued the group\u2019s interest, and a lively discussion broke out.</p><p>\u201cReese was quite a kisser in his day,\u201d Jacqueline volunteered. \u201cI remember the first time he kissed me. Every cell in my body sprang to life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol smiled at the dreamy look on Jacqueline\u2019s face. \u201cI thought I\u2019d died and gone to heaven the first time Doug kissed me,\u201d she recalled. She noticed that Lydia was doing busy work around the shop, straightening patterns that were already straight. \u201cWhat about you, Lydia?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Lydia jerked around, almost as if she resented being included in the conversation. Then she sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt anything more than a...kiss. It was always pleasant, but nothing earth-shattering happened afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will one day,\u201d Jacqueline assured her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re placing a lot of importance on a simple kiss?\u201d Lydia asked. \u201cGood grief, we\u2019ve all been kissed, and while it\u2019s very nice most of the time, it\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline motioned toward Alix. \u201cWas it a big deal for you when this preacher kissed you?\u201d</p><p>Carol could tell Alix was uncomfortable with the question. The girl tossed her head in a nonchalant movement. \u201cYeah, I guess, but I don\u2019t think about it, you know?\u201d She looked around, and her expression said she\u2019d thought of little else.</p><p>For a moment the room was silent as each woman concentrated on her individual task. Carol wasn\u2019t sure what Jacqueline was working on these days. She\u2019d started knitting scarves using an ultra-expensive yarn and then moved on to felting hats and purses. It was hard to keep up with Jacqueline\u2019s current projects because she leaped from one to another and seemed to have several in progress at a time. Carol suspected she\u2019d become one of Lydia\u2019s best customers.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I see you come out of The Pour House last Friday?\u201d Alix suddenly asked Lydia. \u201cWith that UPS driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Lydia\u2019s cheeks flamed and she raised her hand to her chest. \u201cYes...I was meeting Brad Goetz for a drink.\u201d</p> <p>Alix let out a low whistle of approval. \u201cHe\u2019s hot stuff.\u201d</p><p>Lydia seemed to find something that needed attention in her display of knitting books. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dinner later in the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I sense a romance developing?\u201d Jacqueline asked in a friendly tone.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Carol said. She was amused at how shy Lydia was about men. Brad was the first one she\u2019d mentioned. And this young preacher of Alix\u2019s...Carol felt touched that the girl had confided in them.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come up to the condo to get the yarn one day next week?\u201d Carol asked impulsively.</p><p>Alix nodded. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. Or I can bring it to class, if you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stop by your place.\u201d</p><p>Carol had the feeling the girl didn\u2019t get many such invitations. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come for lunch on Monday? Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Despite her indifferent-sounding response, Alix couldn\u2019t hide her eagerness to accept.</p><p>Carol looked around at the others with an affectionate smile. There was Alix, of course, whose defensiveness had diminished so noticeably. And Jacqueline, who no longer tried to impress them with her social connections. Lydia had become less reserved, and her warmth and wit were more in evidence every week.</p><p>Odd how these things went, Carol mused as she continued to leaf through the pattern book. A group of mismatched personalities, four women with nothing in common, had come together and over the course of a few months, they\u2019d become real friends.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p> <p>M onday morning following her hair appointment, Jacqueline returned to the house to find that a local florist had delivered a dozen red roses. Martha, the housekeeper, had placed them in the center of the formal living room on a round coffee table.</p><p>\u201cWho sent the roses?\u201d she asked, stunned to find them.</p><p>Martha shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t read the card.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline walked into the living room and examined the red buds, gently taking one in her hand. The roses were perfect, still dewy and just ready to open. Their scent was so lovely, Jacqueline thought they must be antique roses. If so, they would\u2019ve cost a fortune. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d be sending her roses or why.</p><p>She reached for the card but didn\u2019t open the small envelope, wanting to linger over the suspense. It wasn\u2019t her birthday or her wedding anniversary. Her husband had never had much of a memory for such events, anyway. In fact, Reese hadn\u2019t sent her flowers in years. Paul was too much like his father to think of doing such a thing, especially when there was no obvious reason for it.</p><p>Unable to guess, she finally tore open the envelope, withdrew the card and read it.</p><p>Reese.</p><p>Her husband! There was no explanation, no message. Confused, Jacqueline sat down on the sofa, still holding the card. She found Martha staring at her, making no attempt to disguise her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the housekeeper asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from Reese.\u201d</p><p>Martha beamed her a broad smile. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Jacqueline smiled, too. Maybe her housekeeper knew more about her life than she did.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to start dinner for you this evening?\u201d Martha asked as she turned toward the kitchen.</p><p>Jacqueline shook her head. \u201cNo, I believe I\u2019ll cook tonight, Martha.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper didn\u2019t so much as blink, but Jacqueline could tell she was surprised. Jacqueline rarely ventured into the kitchen, and hadn\u2019t made a complete meal in years. Early in their marriage she\u2019d found a chicken curry dish that Reese had particularly enjoyed. She\u2019d torn the recipe out of a magazine. Jacqueline thought she knew where it was, although it\u2019d been quite a while since she\u2019d gone to the effort of preparing it.</p><p>\u201cMartha, do we have any curry spices in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Let me look for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there chicken in the freezer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline was only half listening. She moved past the housekeeper and into the kitchen, opening a bottom drawer where she kept her cookbooks. \u201cDo you remember a recipe I had years ago for chicken curry?\u201d</p><p>Martha frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t say I do. Are you going to be making a mess in my kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline smiled, biting back a retort that would have reminded the other woman whose kitchen this really was. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she assured Martha. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it back in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Martha nodded, but she still looked concerned.</p><p>After paging through six cookbooks, Jacqueline found the recipe in the back of Julia Child\u2019s Mastering the Art of French Cooking, together with a number of other loose recipes she\u2019d collected over the years. Sitting down at the table, she wrote out a grocery list.</p><p>By the time Reese walked into the house at six o\u2019clock, the kitchen was redolent with the scent of coconut milk, chicken, curry and yogurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Reese asked, loosening his tie.</p><p>Jacqueline hadn\u2019t heard him come in and whirled around, a wooden spoon in her hand. \u201cDinner,\u201d she announced cheerfully.</p><p>Forgetting herself, she walked over and kissed his cheek. \u201cThe roses are beautiful. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes widened just a little. \u201cI figured I owed you an apology,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI came down on you pretty hard about parking in the alley. I shouldn\u2019t have said the things I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were worried about me. It\u2019s a case of me running over the mailbox with the tractor.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline laughed and quickly retold Tammie Lee\u2019s story. \u201cThat\u2019s why her daddy hollered at her mama,\u201d she concluded. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>Reese chuckled and then to Jacqueline\u2019s amazement, he kissed her. She was sure he only meant to brush her lips with his, but when their mouths met, something wonderful and exciting took hold of them both.</p><p>The wooden spoon clattered to the floor and Jacqueline slid her arms around her husband\u2019s neck. Reese\u2019s mouth was on hers, as avid as if they were new lovers.</p><p>Jacqueline lost all sense of time and didn\u2019t know how long they remained locked in each other\u2019s arms. When they broke apart they both seemed at a loss as to what to say or do next. This was by far their most passionate kiss in years.</p><p>What astonished her most was the zeal with which she\u2019d responded to his kiss. She\u2019d assumed that after years of celibacy, the sexual part of her nature had atrophied. It was a shock to realize just how alive\u2014how sexual\u2014she was capable of feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better shower,\u201d Reese said as he backed away from her. He seemed to be in a state of shock himself.</p><p>Jacqueline didn\u2019t trust her voice enough to speak, so she merely nodded. Leaning heavily against the kitchen counter, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered to the empty room. Now that was something! Once she\u2019d stopped trembling, she retrieved two dinner plates and set them on the dining room table.</p><p>When Reese returned from the shower, his hair damp, he\u2019d donned slacks and a golf shirt. Jacqueline had just finished lighting the candles, pleased with her efforts. She could be domestic when called upon and today she\u2019d rediscovered how much she actually enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder. It was ridiculous to feel shy with her own husband of more than thirty years. She would never have expected this, but she felt as if that kiss was the first one they\u2019d ever shared\u2014as if their intimacy was completely unfamiliar. \u201cWould you pour the wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of chilled chardonnay, which he uncorked. After he\u2019d poured them each a glass, he turned on the CD player.</p><p>Singing along to the soundtrack of Les Mis\u00e9rables, Jacqueline mounded rice on their plates and ladled on generous servings of curry. She carried the plates to the table, where Reese was waiting for her. He stood behind her chair and pulled it out, a courtesy he hadn\u2019t bothered with in years.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long time since you made me chicken curry,\u201d he said when he was seated across from her. \u201cIt smells delicious\u2014thank you.\u201d He reached for his wineglass and raised it. \u201cShall I propose a toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Happiness settled over her until she was nearly giddy with it. Until now, Jacqueline had lost hope that they might recapture the love in their marriage. She felt light-headed with anticipation as she lifted her wineglass and touched the rim to his.</p><p>\u201cTo the future,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cThe future,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>After a sip of wine, Reese picked up his fork. Jacqueline held her breath while he tasted his first bite, anxiously awaiting his reaction.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d succeeded when he closed his eyes and murmured a soft sigh of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s even better than I remember.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline relaxed and took her first taste. The curry was as good as she\u2019d hoped. In retrospect, she wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d buried the recipe when she knew how much Reese enjoyed her meals\u2014and how much she used to enjoy making them. Years earlier she\u2019d done all their cooking, even for their many social events. More recently, she\u2019d had her parties catered. She\u2019d casually mentioned that in last week\u2019s knitting class when they\u2019d started talking about memorable meals. To her surprise, Alix had said she\u2019d like her own catering company one day. Alix of all people! This was a rather unexpected revelation, but it made her wonder. She owed Alix.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a small confession,\u201d Reese said, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to hear it, but before she could stop him, he continued.</p><p>\u201cYou need to thank Tammie Lee for the roses. They were her idea.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline picked up her wine. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come up with that idea on your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo Tammie Lee,\u201d Reese said, holding up his wineglass.</p><p>\u201cTo Tammie Lee,\u201d Jacqueline repeated.</p><p>The phone rang and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Reese was out of his chair before she could protest.</p><p>For once, just once, she wanted them to have a quiet dinner together. She wished now that she\u2019d taken the phone off the hook.</p> <p>Whoever was on the line certainly had Reese\u2019s attention. His brow furrowed and he frowned and then nodded curtly. Replacing the receiver, he muttered, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jacqueline asked before she would stop herself.</p><p>\u201cProblems on the job.\u201d He grabbed his car keys and was out the door. \u201cI\u2019m needed at one of the sites. Not Blossom Street\u2014the Northgate project. It appears we blew a circuit and the entire block is without electricity.\u201d</p><p>Sitting alone at the table, listening as Reese\u2019s car engine roared to life, Jacqueline felt numb.</p><p>A moment later, she flung her napkin furiously onto her plate and walked over to the sink. She grabbed the counter with both hands, biting down hard on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s needed at the site,\u201d she repeated, her voice cracking. She knew exactly who\u2019d phoned and exactly where he\u2019d gone and it wasn\u2019t to any job site.</p> <p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>S unday morning, Alix found herself standing on the same street corner she had for the last few weeks, watching as people filed through the church doors. Ordinary people, some wealthy and some not. People like those in her knitting group. People like Carol Girard and her husband.</p><p>Having lunch at Carol\u2019s high-rise condo had been an eye-opening experience. Literally! The view was incredible, unlike anything she\u2019d seen before. She might live in Seattle, but she certainly never saw it from this perspective. And Puget Sound was beyond fabulous. Alix felt as if she\u2019d stepped right onto a page in one of those fancy home decorating magazines people left behind at the Laundromat. The condo itself was spacious. The furniture was simple and classic, and there were lots of warm, appealing touches. One thing was for sure. Alix had no intention of returning the invitation. She could just imagine what Carol would think if she saw the inside of her apartment. Especially now, since Laurel had taken to being even a bigger slob than usual.</p><p>Carol had made a lovely lunch of cold tomato soup\u2014a Spanish recipe, she\u2019d said\u2014and a seafood salad. She\u2019d set the table with beautiful matching dishes, complete with linen napkins. A few weeks ago Alix would have considered details like that pointless, but these days she was taking notice. This was exactly the type of thing she needed to know if she hoped to start her own business one day. Alix had been nervous at first, afraid she might commit some social blunder by using the wrong fork. If Jacqueline had been there, she would\u2019ve been more worried, but Carol was a normal kind of person. Funny, with all that wealth, she still had her problems.</p><p>Everyone had problems, Alix now realized, even if they lived in gorgeous apartments with million-dollar views. Over lunch she and Carol covered a lot of subjects, and after a while, it felt just as if they were in the knitting group at Lydia\u2019s shop. Alix had never expected to become friends with these women but that was exactly what had happened. Even with Jacqueline...</p><p>All of them encouraged her to pursue the relationship with Jordan.</p><p>Following the roller-skating party, Alix had seen him only once. He\u2019d stopped by the video store to tell her he was going out of town. Apparently he was involved in a summer camp program and was driving some kids to eastern Washington. He\u2019d mentioned sending her a postcard, but if he\u2019d mailed one, she hadn\u2019t received it. That had been on her mind ever since he\u2019d gone away.</p> <p>As she stood on the corner across from the Free Methodist church, the music drifted out the open doors. Alix recognized the song, which she\u2019d heard several times before. For some reason she couldn\u2019t identify, she boldly marched across the street and up the steps. As she did, she glanced around, half expecting someone to stop her.</p><p>She missed Jordan, and if walking into this church was the only way she could feel close to him, then she was doing it. Anyone who questioned her was in for one hell of a fight.</p><p>An usher looked in her direction, but she scowled at him with such ferocity that he backed off. She didn\u2019t need anyone to tell her where to sit. Slipping into the last pew, she saw that people were standing and singing. She grabbed what she assumed was the hymnal and picked up a Bible instead. She wondered if anyone noticed. As casually as she could, she replaced the Bible and grabbed the red book, opening it to the number posted on a board at the front of the church.</p><p>The sanctuary was surprisingly crowded. Alix had no idea so many people actually attended services. Perhaps if her family had prayed together, they might have stayed together. Yeah, right! As a kid she\u2019d done her fair share of praying and a lot of good that had done her. A familiar bitterness welled up inside. These kids were lucky. They had parents who cared about them. By her own choice, Alix was no longer in contact with her mother and hadn\u2019t seen her father in years. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to show up when Tom died. As she thought of her brother, her hand tightened around the hymnal. All Tom had ever wanted was someone to care about him. They\u2019d both been cheated in that department; their father was more interested in drinking with his friends than he was in his children, and their mother was no better. Little wonder they\u2019d had serious problems of their own, but Alix was determined to have a better life.</p><p>She studied the words printed on the page but didn\u2019t sing. One of Alix\u2019s fears was that she wouldn\u2019t know when to stand or sit. That was the advantage of being in the back pew\u2014she simply followed what everyone else was doing.</p><p>When the song ended, the congregation sat down and the minister, an older man, stepped up to the podium. Alix figured she\u2019d leave after the sermon, afraid that if she stood up and walked out now, someone might be offended.</p><p>The minister preached from the Old Testament and the book of Nehemiah, which Alix had never heard of before. The sermon, about the ruined walls of Jerusalem and how they symbolized people\u2019s lives, interested her, although she didn\u2019t understand everything he said.</p><p>Alix was just getting ready to slip out of the pew when she saw Jordan walk to the front of the church. He was obviously back from summer camp, although he hadn\u2019t come by the video store.</p><p>She tried to ignore the disappointment and the hurt. Seeing him in church wasn\u2019t the only shock she received. Jordan wasn\u2019t alone. A blond beauty came with him. The girl eyed Jordan like he was Jesus returning to collect His saints before Armageddon.</p><p>The two of them had handheld microphones. The music started, and their voices blended as if they\u2019d been singing together their entire lives. Listening to their performance was more than Alix could bear. In an effort to exit the pew as fast as possible, she nearly stumbled over the feet of the woman next to her. Without looking back, she rushed out the door.</p><p>If she\u2019d needed proof that she was deluding herself, this was it. Reeling, she ran into an alley. She closed her eyes and called herself every ugly name she\u2019d ever heard. With her back against the brick wall, she slid down and hung her head.</p><p>Naturally Jordan would be singing in church with Miss America. And why not? He was a preacher\u2019s kid; he\u2019d been raised in the church. He\u2019d never sat in a jail cell or stood before a judge. His parents had loved him, wanted him. She could just imagine what his daddy would say if he knew Jordan was hanging with her.</p><p>Alix squatted there, caught in a misery so deep she could barely move.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alix?\u201d</p><p>A voice drifted into her awareness, and she glanced up to find Tyrone Houston, better known in the neighborhood as T-Bone, standing above her. He was a gang member and a known drug dealer. The last Alix had heard he was doing time. Apparently he was out.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin\u2019?\u201d T-Bone demanded.</p><p>\u201cTaking up space. You got a problem with that?\u201d Normally no one flashed attitude to T-Bone and she could be risking her life. For a second, she wasn\u2019t sure she cared.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You interested in a party?\u201d He gave her the once-over.</p><p>In her present frame of mind, Alix was in no mood for company.</p><p>\u201cI got the stuff,\u201d he said enticingly.</p><p>That meant he had a fresh supply of drugs. Probably meth or cocaine or any of a dozen different substances guaranteed to shut up the voices in her head.</p><p>\u201cI could be,\u201d Alix said. She\u2019d been clean a long time\u2014ever since her brother had overdosed\u2014but she hated this dark ugly feeling eating at her gut. If she could swallow something to make her feel good, she wanted it because whatever T-Bone had was better than these awful voices.</p><p>The house was a couple of blocks away. Everyone in the area knew that if you needed a hit, T-bone would supply it\u2014for a price, naturally. Alix didn\u2019t know his sources, didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>When they stepped into the house, the shades were drawn and the room was dark. Five or six guys were lounging around and the air was thick with sweet-smelling smoke. Alix buried her hands in her leather jacket as she slowly surveyed the scene.</p><p>In one corner she noticed another girl sitting with a guy. His arm was wrapped around her and he appeared to be out of it, in a drug-induced haze. Alix looked again, harder this time. The girl seemed familiar, but Alix couldn\u2019t figure out how she knew her. Working at the video store she saw a lot of people; while she might not remember names, she rarely forgot a face.</p><p>This girl hadn\u2019t been in the video store, Alix was fairly certain of that. She was young, fourteen, possibly fifteen, and trying to look older. Alix knew the signs because a few years back she\u2019d done the same thing.</p><p>Then it came to her. The girl was familiar because Alix had seen her at the roller-skating rink with Jordan. She was a church kid. The girl recognized Alix, too. She averted her gaze.</p><p>Anger surged through Alix. This kid didn\u2019t belong here with a bunch of druggie losers.</p><p>She strolled to the sofa where the girl sat with her stoned boyfriend in a tangle of arms and legs. Alix sat down on the sofa arm and glared at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded of the girl.</p><p>The teenager glared back at Alix, her eyes full of defiance. \u201cSame as you.\u201d</p><p>The guy she was with rolled his head and pointed at Alix. \u201cWho\u2019s this, Lori?\u201d</p><p>Yes, Alix remembered her now. Her name was Lori and she\u2019d come with a couple of friends. Roller skating with church kids one month, doing drugs with criminals and losers the next. Quite a contrast.</p><p>Lori stared up at Alix, her face hard and her eyes cold. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, sneering, \u201cis no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Alix said as she came to her feet. \u201cSorry, we have to go now.\u201d She grabbed Lori by the arm. The girl protested but let Alix pull her up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cGetting you outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike shit you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here any more than I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Her boyfriend was so out of it he didn\u2019t protest, which was good. T-Bone, however, wasn\u2019t pleased. He blocked the door, his arms crossed over his massive chest as he focused narrowed eyes on Alix. Fear shivered down her spine. T-Bone could slit her throat if he perceived that she was hurting his business. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate, either.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a church kid,\u201d Alix said, meeting his gaze. \u201cYou keep her here and you\u2019re gonna have a pack of little ol\u2019 ladies marching outside your door, carrying signs and bringing the heat.\u201d</p><p>T-Bone\u2019s gaze shifted from Alix to Lori, who squirmed under his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cYou want trouble, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d Alix raised both arms in a hands-off gesture.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d he said to Alix, \u201cand take her with you.\u201d</p> <p>Alix seized Lori\u2019s upper arm and dragged her out of the house.</p><p>Once outside, Lori jerked her arm free. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d Alix repeated, laughing. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing, little girl, is saving your sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to save me.\u201d</p><p>Those words were almost identical to what she\u2019d said when Jordan announced he was a youth minister. But they weren\u2019t true for Lori\u2014and maybe not for Alix, either. Lori had no idea what kind of danger she\u2019d so blithely stepped into. She didn\u2019t appreciate the risk Alix had taken by pulling her out, either. Alix\u2019s knees shook when she realized what she\u2019d done in standing up to T-Bone. It was time to make herself scarce.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Alix said.</p> <p>Lori rolled her eyes and headed back into the house, only to be stopped at the door. Alix didn\u2019t hear what was said but apparently Lori got the message and came scurrying out a moment later. She hurried down the street without a backward look.</p><p>With no place else to go, Alix returned to her apartment. Laurel was gone. In her unhappiness her roommate was eating everything in sight\u2014and leaving the mess for Alix to clean up. She wondered if Laurel still fit into her jeans. She must\u2019ve gained twenty pounds since her breakup with John. If Laurel wasn\u2019t at work, scarfing potato chips on the sly, or at home, sitting in front of the television with her face in a bowl of ice cream, Alix didn\u2019t know where she could be. But for once she was grateful to be alone.</p><p>Picking up her knitting, she heaved a sigh when she saw what she was doing and threw it down in disgust. Carol had given her the gray yarn and the pattern, as well as the work she\u2019d already done. Alix had painstakingly continued the project, knitting a sweater for Jordan. Yeah, right, like he cared. Like anyone did.</p><p>Lying on the sofa, Alix stared at the ceiling for an hour before she was scheduled to work. The video store did good business on Sunday afternoons and she was kept busy, especially when Laurel didn\u2019t bother to make an appearance, even though her name was on the schedule to work with Alix.</p><p>An hour into her shift, Jordan walked into the store. Alix\u2019s heart reacted instantly and that infuriated her. As effectively as she could, she ignored him.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d She made sure he knew it wasn\u2019t any big thing to her.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and handed two videos to the customer at the register, offering him a wide smile. When she turned her attention to Jordan, the smile was gone. \u201cShould there be?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI was hoping we could get together tonight.\u201d</p><p>She considered his invitation. Part of her was shrieking with excitement and another part, the part that insisted she get over him, was saying something else.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Miss America?\u201d she asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jordan said, blinking in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou sang with her this morning.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou were in church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to see you and Miss America smiling at each other. You seem to be very good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get some help here?\u201d the next customer at the counter asked.</p><p>Alix reached for his videos and typed in the codes before taking his money. She gave him his change and smiled sweetly in his direction. Once again she returned her attention to Jordan, making sure there was no evidence of pleasure at seeing him.</p><p>Jordan frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Pastor Sutton\u2019s seventeen-year-old daughter?\u201d</p><p>The girl was only seventeen? From the back of the church it was hard to tell. Still...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to put up with petty jealousy. If you want to be angry with me, then fine. But I\u2019ve got better things to do.\u201d</p><p>Alix was about to answer when he whirled around and left the store.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>\u201cIf you can count the number of projects you have going, you need to begin another, so you have a varied range of complexity, from the very simple \u2018mindless\u2019 ones to those that demand undivided attention.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Laura Early, lifetime knitter</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I\u2019 ve spent so much time in doctors\u2019 offices that over the years I\u2019ve come to dread even the most routine appointments. It\u2019s almost always the same. I sit in an uncomfortable chair in a waiting room full of strangers and we all avoid looking at one another. Generally, I bring my knitting or I flip through magazines that are months if not years old.</p><p>The one advantage of being in Dr. Wilson\u2019s office is that after all this time the staff have become practically as familiar as family, especially Peggy, Dr. Wilson\u2019s nurse.</p><p>Peggy was working for Dr. Wilson when I came in for my first appointment, nearly fifteen years ago. I remember when she was pregnant, not once but twice. I vividly recall wondering if I\u2019d be alive to see her second baby. The thing with cancer is that you learn to take nothing for granted. Not one day, not one season, not even a minute. At sixteen I wanted to make it to seventeen so I could attend the Junior-Senior Prom. I survived, but no one asked me to the prom.</p><p>\u201cLydia.\u201d Peggy stood in the doorway holding my chart, which must weigh twenty pounds. My medical history was filled with details, of symptoms and procedures, as well as documentation of the different medications I\u2019d taken.</p><p>When I got up, it seemed that every eye in the waiting room was on me. If I\u2019d been the type of person to grandstand, I would\u2019ve leaped to my feet and announced I was a two-time winner in the lottery of life. Having a more subdued nature, however, I calmly stuffed my knitting into my quilted bag and followed Peggy.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Peggy asked after she\u2019d weighed me and made a notation on the chart.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I stepped off the scale and sighed with relief to note that my weight was within a couple of pounds of my last visit. Peggy led me to the cubicle at the far end of the hallway, where she thrust a disposable thermometer under my tongue and reached for my wrist. She stared at her watch and quickly made a second notation on my chart. \u201cGood strong heartbeat,\u201d she said, sounding pleased.</p><p>I should hope so; my insurance company had paid plenty for the privilege of having that heartbeat. I would\u2019ve told her as much but talking wasn\u2019t an option at the moment.</p><p>Peggy was pumping the blood-pressure cuff, which she\u2019d wrapped around my upper arm. It grew uncomfortably tight before she released it. When she\u2019d finished listening, she nodded. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>At last she removed the thermometer. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Peggy smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s a sparkle in your eyes. You\u2019ve met someone, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hardly.\u201d I brushed aside her insight, but found I really did want to tell her about Brad. I didn\u2019t, because there wasn\u2019t that much to tell. Not yet, anyway. We\u2019d met for drinks twice, talked on the phone two or three times a week, sometimes for an hour or more. He came by the shop at least once during the course of a week and occasionally\u2014no, more than occasionally\u2014we kissed.</p><p>Brad and I were only beginning to know each other. We weren\u2019t serious, weren\u2019t even close to being serious. Brad was deeply involved in his son\u2019s life and I was deeply involved in my business. We were friends in the same way I was friends with Carol Girard. Okay, maybe not exactly the same way, but nevertheless friends. For now, that was comfortable for me and apparently for him, too.</p><p>\u201cHave you met someone?\u201d Peggy asked again.</p><p>I nodded hesitantly.</p><p>I thought she was ready to burst into applause. \u201cI always knew you would,\u201d she said with a smile of delight.</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Peggy, I\u2019m thirty years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing to be this transparent, especially at my age, but that\u2019s another aspect of having had cancer as a teenager. My social maturity seemed stuck where it was the day I got my driver\u2019s license. Social development is delayed for those of us who are detoured by the fight for life. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself because I\u2019m not; this is a simple fact that needs to be taken into account in relationships.</p><p>I knew the routine visits well enough to know that the next part was to stretch out my arm for Peggy to extract vial after vial of my blood. I once teased her that I should be paid for the amount she collected. Not one vial but four, two large and two small.</p><p>I barely blinked as the needle pricked my skin. In the beginning, though, I used to get dizzy with fear at the sight of a needle. Once I nearly fainted, but that was years ago. Compared to some of the procedures I\u2019ve endured, having my blood drawn is kid\u2019s play.</p><p>Peggy paused to exchange a full tube for an empty one and glanced up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you look happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d I assured her. My new happiness had come about for several reasons. Opening my shop played a big role in how I felt and so, of course, did meeting Brad. A Good Yarn was my affirmation of life and allowing myself to get involved with Brad was an additional act of faith.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased for you.\u201d Peggy repeated the process with the tubes and then wrote my name on each one. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>She walked out to the front with me and got someone else\u2019s file.</p><p>My spirits were high as I strolled out of the doctor\u2019s office. It was a glorious August afternoon and while the store was closed on Mondays, I could think of nowhere else I\u2019d rather be. I truly loved my shop. It gave me pleasure just to be there with all the yarn around me. There\u2019s something completely satisfying about standing in the middle of a store that only a few months earlier was little more than a dream.</p><p>I had on a sleeveless summer dress made of seersucker with a pretty white eyelet collar. The dress was a favorite of mine, and yes, I\u2019ll admit it, I hoped that if I ventured into my shop I might accidentally-on-purpose run into Brad. He made deliveries in the neighborhood on Mondays and he always knocked on my door if he saw I was there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Listening to the radio, I kept an eye on the windows in case he happened to drive past. Blossom Street was open to traffic now and this had dramatically increased business. Lots of people came to the neighborhood just to see the changes. The stores along both sides of the street had put out their welcome mats.</p><p>The construction directly across from me appeared to be nearly finished, although there seemed to be plenty of men in hard hats still parading around. I wasn\u2019t sure when everything was officially scheduled to be completed, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be much longer.</p><p>Just as I\u2019d hoped, Brad\u2019s dark-brown delivery truck came into view. It was all I could do not to stand like a mannequin in the window. It was even harder to resist the urge to jump up and down and wave my arms. I did neither, but I was definitely tempted. I was in just that silly, quirky frame of mind.</p><p>I saw my man-in-brown leap out of his truck with a couple of packages for the floral shop next door. I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d seen me or not until he came out with a single long-stemmed red rose. I waved despite my resolve not to and he winked at me.</p> <p>Unlocking the front door, I let him into the shop. \u201cFor me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cost ya,\u201d Brad teased.</p><p>\u201cName your price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss,\u201d he said, grinning boyishly. \u201cMaybe two.\u201d</p><p>I know it sounds ridiculous, but I blushed. He took me by the hand and led me behind a tall shelf filled with worsted yarn. At least there we had a bit of privacy.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d the doctor\u2019s visit go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even see him. It was for routine blood tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Maybe I should\u2019ve been, but the cancer had left me alone for a long time now and after a certain period you can\u2019t help growing a little confident. More than that, I felt too good to be sick again and showed none of the symptoms I had in the past other than an occasional migraine. Besides, for the first time in years, I was truly hopeful for the future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free on Saturday night.\u201d Brad was looking down at me, his eyes so intense and provocative it was nearly impossible to breathe.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about if I take you to dinner and a movie?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnyplace you want to eat, as long as it isn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I smiled again. Cody was a big fan of their cheeseburgers, and Brad was thoroughly tired of fast food.</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Anyplace but McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Then, with such ease I was barely aware of what he was doing, Brad brought me into his arms and kissed me. The earth didn\u2019t move, the sky didn\u2019t fall, but I swear I felt that kiss from the top of my head to the tips of my toes. If a man could make me feel all that with a simple kiss, I could only imagine what it would be like if\u2014when\u2014we made love. I closed my eyes, wanting to hold on to this wonderful feeling as long as I could.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling my neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my perfume.\u201d I let my head fall back and he spread small kisses along my throat. I was practically purring like Whiskers, my cat, when he lies on the windowsill, basking in the afternoon sun.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it is, just promise to wear the same one on Saturday night, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, and he kissed me again. Neither of us wanted to stop, but he was still on the clock and we knew it had to end. When he released me I felt his reluctance as keenly as my own. A girl could get mighty accustomed to Brad\u2019s kind of kisses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven on Saturday evening, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I told him.</p><p>In that moment, \u201cperfect\u201d was how I\u2019d describe my life.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>T he critical first three weeks following embryo transfer had passed and so far so good. Carol was a full five weeks pregnant now and felt every aspect of this pregnancy in a way few women ever would.</p><p>After talking to her mother in Oregon for twenty minutes, she hung up the receiver and fixed herself a healthy lunch of cottage cheese and fresh fruit. Carol had never been fond of cottage cheese, and this was her way of announcing to the universe that she was willing to suffer for the sake of her baby. No sacrifice was too great. When her child was born, she wanted to know she\u2019d done everything possible to give him or her a good start in life.</p><p>Smiling, Carol scooped cottage cheese onto a plate, then added sliced pineapple. She\u2019d heard from one of the women in her online support group that a substance in pineapple was believed to improve the chances of an embryo attaching to the uterus.</p><p>The phone rang as the fork was halfway to her mouth. She lowered it and reached for the receiver.</p><p>It was Doug. Normally he was too busy to phone from work, but he\u2019d made a habit of calling her at least once a day since the last IVF.</p><p>\u201cI just spoke with Mom,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Dad want to buy us a crib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her we already have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the heart.\u201d Three weeks after the procedure, Carol had gotten a Bon-Macy\u2019s flyer advertising baby furniture. That night she\u2019d dragged Doug to the department store and, giddy with excitement, they\u2019d purchased everything they could possibly need for a nursery.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have two cribs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be having twins.\u201d</p><p>Doug chuckled and it was the unrestrained laugh she\u2019d fallen in love with all those years ago. He so rarely laughed like that anymore, and she knew beyond a doubt that her pregnancy explained his joy.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I was thinking that if we can\u2019t use the crib, maybe she could give it to Rick.\u201d She hated to put an end to her husband\u2019s fun-loving mood, but her brother would be presenting their parents with another grandchild a few weeks before Carol was due to deliver.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from him lately?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it he hasn\u2019t mentioned anything to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can tell, but I don\u2019t dare ask about it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s not your place.\u201d</p><p>She sank back into her chair. \u201cI hope Rick does the proper thing and marries this woman.\u201d</p><p>Doug hesitated. \u201cFrom what you told me, he\u2019s already decided against that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a baby involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I also know Rick.\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed. She wondered what her parents would say when they heard about the situation. Her mother was waiting impatiently for grandchildren. She\u2019d be thrilled whether Rick was married to the woman or not, but she\u2019d prefer it if Rick gave the child his name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having cottage cheese for lunch,\u201d she told Doug. He\u2019d appreciate her sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cI hope the baby likes it,\u201d Doug teased.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes and then Carol went back to her sacrificial lunch.</p><p>She lost the baby later that afternoon.</p><p>Just when the dream had started to become a reality...Just when she\u2019d given herself permission to believe...Just when she was so sure everything had gone according to plan.</p><p>At four in the afternoon the spotting started. The instant she saw the blood, she thought she\u2019d faint. Severe cramping followed and there was no longer any doubt. She\u2019d miscarried.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, clenching her fists at her sides. \u201cPlease no...please, oh please.\u201d Her throat was thick with tears. She sat on the end of her bed and covered her eyes.</p><p>The routine should be standard by now. After phoning the doctor\u2019s office, she collected her purse. She didn\u2019t call Doug, couldn\u2019t ruin the rest of his day. She\u2019d give him the afternoon before she shattered his life with the news that there would be no baby for them.</p><p>When Dr. Ford examined her, he confirmed what she already knew. Her body had rejected the fetus. The baby was dead, expelled from her womb. Dr. Ford was sympathetic and concerned. After she\u2019d dressed, he gently squeezed her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Emotionless, Carol stared straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cWould you like one of my staff to phone Doug for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone you\u2019d like me to call?\u201d</p><p>His words sounded slurred to Carol as her mind struggled to comprehend each one. She was drowning in a sea of pain. Functioning normally was impossible just then.</p><p>\u201cI want my mother,\u201d she whispered. Her body had rejected three pregnancies now, and there wouldn\u2019t be another chance. This was the end for her and Doug. It was over.</p><p>\u201cCan I have someone phone her?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, wondering who he meant, and realized he was asking about her mother. Carol shook her head. \u201cShe lives in Oregon.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Ford said a bit more, offered his condolences and after a few minutes left her. Carol slipped off the examination table, dressed and went out the door. She didn\u2019t know where she was going, didn\u2019t care. She started walking\u2014a slow, shambling walk, without purpose\u2014and before long found herself on the waterfront near the Seattle Aquarium. Tourists crowded the sidewalk and she felt like a boulder in a stream, disrupting the flow of traffic as men, women and children darted around her.</p><p>When she was finally too tired to move, she sat down on a bench. The tears came then. Hoarse, painful sobs from the depths of her soul. She\u2019d failed again. Disappointed her husband, disappointed her parents and everyone who\u2019d believed in her.</p><p>Her cell phone rang and why she should be so angry with it, Carol didn\u2019t know. Without checking to see who might be calling her, she grabbed it from her purse and threw it into the street. She felt a sense of grim satisfaction as a city bus passed by and drove directly over it. All that was left was a flattened piece of plastic with wires protruding.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, miss?\u201d a young police officer stepped up to ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her face streaked with tears and her eyes dull with pain. \u201cNothing is right.\u201d She understood then that someone must have seen her and thought she needed help. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anything the policeman or anyone else could do for her.</p><p>\u201cShould I call someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>She stood, needing to escape. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but you can\u2019t help me. No one can.\u201d If she didn\u2019t leave now, she might end up in Emergency or even the Psych ward. Escape became key, so she started walking again. Walking and walking and walking.</p><p>It was dark when she discovered she was miles from home. Doug must be frantic by now but she couldn\u2019t face him yet, couldn\u2019t watch the look in his eyes when he learned there wasn\u2019t a baby anymore.</p><p>An hour later, Carol took a taxi home.</p><p>When she walked in the door, Doug nearly flew across the room. \u201cWhere the hell were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to be listening. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer the phone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d she sobbed, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably. \u201cI lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Doug whispered and wrapped her in his arms.</p><p>Carol was weeping again, unable to stop. The tears came from deep inside her, sobs that wrenched her soul. This was an agony that could be understood only by those who\u2019d experienced such a loss. It felt as if her beating heart had been ripped from her chest, as if she would never again know joy or happiness or anything good. Her future stretched before her, bleak and without hope.</p><p>\u201cI so badly wanted to have our child,\u201d she sobbed into her husband\u2019s arms.</p> <p>Doug held her tightly in his embrace, his head against her shoulder. Then she realized he was weeping, too. They clung to each other, neither able to offer anything to the other. Empty, bereaved, in agony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she choked out. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI tried so hard...\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of anything she might have done differently, any effort she hadn\u2019t made.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love you,\u201d Doug assured her.</p><p>Exhausted, Carol showered and went to bed and with Doug\u2019s arms around her, she fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>At three, she woke with pain heavy upon her chest and remembered there was no longer a child growing in her womb. The tears came fresh, stinging her eyes.</p><p>Slipping out of bed, she walked into the nursery and stood in the middle of the darkened room. She curled her fingers around the end of the crib and bit her lower lip hard to hold back the sobs.</p><p>It was then that she noticed the wall. She squinted, certain she was seeing things. Flicking on the light switch, she looked again. Her knees went weak and she sagged to the floor as she stared at the place where her husband\u2019s fist had gone through the wall.</p> <p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>F riday afternoon Jacqueline arrived at A Good Yarn, her usual five minutes after starting time. Being \u201cfashionably late\u201d was a habit she\u2019d picked up long ago and seemed unable to break. To her surprise, Carol was missing. Alix was slouched down in her chair with a morose look on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Carol?\u201d she asked Lydia, who stood at the end of the table, knitting needles in hand. Lydia carried her yarn and needles around with her, so her hands were constantly busy.</p><p>\u201cCarol decided to stay home this afternoon,\u201d Lydia explained. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she had bad news. She lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline had feared as much. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taking a few days to regroup, but I hope she\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded; she felt terrible for Carol. The other woman\u2019s desire for a child was so strong it verged on desperation. Jacqueline was worried about her and hoped Carol could, somehow, rebound from the loss. She recalled her own bitter disappointment over her inability to give birth to a second child, but at least she\u2019d been able to have Paul. The likelihood that Carol and Doug would get a baby through adoption was slim. Jacqueline sighed. This was a sad turn of events, and there wasn\u2019t a thing any of them could do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we might lose Carol,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\u201d Alix asked, anxiety in her voice.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything, but I think she might be returning to work. The only reason she quit was for the baby, and she told me a couple of weeks ago that the brokerage firm would like her to come back.\u201d</p><p>Alix looked, if anything, even more dejected.</p><p>Jacqueline wondered what was bothering her so much. Worry about Carol was obviously part of it, but Jacqueline sensed that something else was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Alix?\u201d Jacqueline murmured, reaching inside her bag for her knitting. She was working on a scarf for her son. It was a lovely worsted wool, the same brown shade as a pony Paul had loved as a child. Jacqueline wondered if her son would remember Brownie and make the connection.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alix murmured, keeping her head lowered.</p><p>Jacqueline looked to Lydia, who shrugged, indicating she didn\u2019t know what was wrong, either. The shop grew quiet, the silence broken only by traffic noises from outside.</p><p>Alix glanced up, and Jacqueline saw that she was no longer working on the man\u2019s sweater she\u2019d taken over from Carol. In fact, she was knitting something entirely different.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d Jacqueline asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my business.\u201d Alix\u2019s eyes flared to life as if she\u2019d welcome a verbal confrontation.</p><p>\u201cMan trouble if I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d Jacqueline announced to Lydia, who grinned slightly and nodded in agreement.</p><p>Alix\u2019s mouth thinned but she didn\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is it involves that minister you\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t dating.... We were just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPast tense?\u201d Lydia pried gently. \u201cYou aren\u2019t seeing him anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a while. He\u2019s got more than one friend, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him with someone else,\u201d Jacqueline guessed.</p><p>Alix\u2019s head was so low her chin sank into her chest when she nodded.</p><p>\u201cSomeone pretty,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cAnd blond.\u201d The girl in church.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jacqueline added. She\u2019d always imagined that Reese\u2019s mistress was blond, and regarded with suspicion any blonde who came near him. Not that she cared, she told herself, but Jacqueline had to admit she occasionally wondered what the woman looked like. At the same time, she didn\u2019t want to know. In fact, she usually tried not to think about her at all.</p><p>Jacqueline\u2019s marriage, what was left of it, had been strained since the night Reese had walked out on their dinner. She hadn\u2019t forgiven him; more than that, she\u2019d avoided him.</p><p>Reese hadn\u2019t made any effort to bridge the gap, either. Apparently, finding his roses stuffed in the garbage the next morning had been message enough.</p><p>The three of them sat knitting together in silence. Lydia had to put her own knitting aside twice to help customers, and that left Jacqueline alone with Alix.</p><p>Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure what prompted the idea, but once it took hold in her mind, it refused to leave.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a favor,\u201d she announced with some fanfare.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline was astonished that Alix had forgotten. \u201cDear girl, you might very well have saved my life.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile came and then quickly vanished. Alix shrugged as if her stepping into the alley that day and standing up to those hoodlums was just a routine incident. An ordinary, everyday event.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time I repaid your kindness,\u201d she said decisively.</p><p>Alix was plainly curious. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Jacqueline said with flair, \u201cthat we\u2019ll go for a complete makeover. My treat, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beauty treatment.\u201d</p><p>Alix frowned. \u201cWhat good\u2019s that going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might get you noticed by a certain young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of beauty treatment?\u201d Alix tried to disguise her interest, but she didn\u2019t fool Jacqueline.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d start with your hair.\u201d Jacqueline examined the purple-tinted ends with a critical eye and resisted the urge to cringe. That dreadful color had to go. Motioning with her hand, she offered a few suggestions. \u201cGet it cut and styled. Perhaps dye it a different color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I like it,\u201d the girl said warily.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny color I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason.\u201d</p><p>Alix made a careless movement with her shoulders. \u201cI suppose that would be all right.\u201d She acted as if she was doing Jacqueline a favor. Two months ago Jacqueline would have taken offense at that but now she knew it was simply posturing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you to my fashion consultant and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alix was shaking her head even before Jacqueline had finished the sentence. \u201cI don\u2019t need any advice on how to dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, but I do think we should get you a couple of new outfits.\u201d</p><p>Still Alix hesitated, but then she gave a halfhearted nod. \u201cYour treat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s okay. When do you want to do this?\u201d She asked as if her social calendar was full.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d Jacqueline set aside her knitting and retrieved her cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll call Desiree right now. She\u2019s the best hairdresser in town. It sometimes takes weeks to get an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Alix couldn\u2019t hide her eagerness now. She sat up straight, nibbling on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI need an appointment with Desiree ASAP,\u201d Jacqueline said, hoping the receptionist caught the hint of urgency in her voice. Desiree was a top beautician and the prices she charged were enough to perm Jacqueline\u2019s hair without chemicals. Still, she was worth every penny because of the miracles she performed. All the women at the country club went to her, and if they didn\u2019t, they wanted to.</p><p>Jacqueline waited impatiently while the receptionist put her on hold. It seemed forever before she returned. \u201cDesiree says she\u2019ll stay late this evening if you can be here by four-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour-thirty?\u201d She glanced at Alix, who nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Jacqueline crowed triumphantly. She turned off the cell and placed it inside her purse. She felt certain that Alix didn\u2019t realize her good fortune. Jacqueline had to book her haircuts a month in advance.</p><p>Lydia was back, and although she hadn\u2019t heard a lot of the conversation, she seemed to understand what was happening and nodded in approval. Jacqueline was on a mission now, confident that with a change in wardrobe and a decent haircut she could turn Alix into an attractive young woman. A thrill of excitement went through her. This was going to be fun.</p><p>As soon as the knitting session was over, Jacqueline took Alix to Nordstrom for a new outfit. She purchased her own designer clothes at the Seattle-based department store, where one particular sales clerk had been in charge of Jacqueline\u2019s wardrobe for years.</p><p>Victoria took one look at Alix and immediately went to work. Jacqueline accompanied the girl into the dressing room and was shocked at her lack of proper intimate apparel. She insisted on new bras and panties first, and none of those ridiculous and indecent thongs, either.</p><p>Alix made a fuss, but it didn\u2019t last long. Still, while Jacqueline might have won that battle, Alix was the undisputed victor when it came to the war. She refused to even try on the St. John knitted suit or anything else Victoria delivered.</p><p>Considering the limited time available today, Jacqueline had to be content with buying Alix good-quality underwear. Before she was through, she swore she\u2019d get her into something tasteful.</p><p>Unfortunately, the trip to the hairdresser didn\u2019t go much better. Desiree gasped at Alix\u2019s purple-tinged hair and started swearing in French. Even after years of high school and college French classes, Jacqueline couldn\u2019t understand what the woman said. But judging by the tone of her remarks, it was preferable not to attempt a translation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacqueline sat in the waiting area and sipped coffee while a verbal skirmish occurred in the background. Fortunately, most of the shop\u2019s elite clientele had already departed; otherwise, their ears would\u2019ve been assaulted by the ongoing exchange between Alix and Desiree.</p><p>Ninety minutes after they arrived, Alix flew to the front of the salon as if she\u2019d just been released from prison. Jacqueline hardly recognized her. Gone was the tar-black hair with the eggplant-purple highlights. Instead, Alix\u2019s hair was a soft shade of brown with a reddish tinge that was similar to the yarn she\u2019d chosen for Paul\u2019s scarf.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d she said, coming to her feet. Once again, Desiree had performed a miracle. Not only had she colored Alix\u2019s hair but she\u2019d styled it in a froth of curls.</p><p>\u201cI hate it,\u201d the girl cried as she ran her fingers through her hair, disarranging it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, my dear,\u201d Jacqueline said patiently, \u201cthis is a new you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment it seemed Alix was about to burst into tears. \u201cI look like...like one of the Brady Bunch,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg,\u201d she cried. \u201cI look like Greg from the Brady Bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being silly,\u201d Jacqueline said sharply.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not! Everyone\u2019s going to laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>The girl was making absolutely no sense. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you meant well, but this just isn\u2019t me.... It just isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>Without a word of gratitude, Alix stormed out of the salon, leaving Jacqueline speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you ever meet such a girl?\u201d Desiree asked, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Jacqueline murmured, discouraged now. She\u2019d wanted to do something nice for Alix, something kind to show her appreciation, and she\u2019d failed.</p> <p>When she got back to the house, she discovered Reese in the kitchen getting a beer from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked as she hurried past him to her own area of the house.</p><p>Jacqueline was surprised at his question. They hadn\u2019t spoken, other than to exchange basic household information, for days now. Another time she might have pretended not to hear, but tonight she was hurt and confused, and couldn\u2019t hide it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how her good intentions toward Alix could have gone so badly awry. Sitting down at the kitchen table, she accepted the glass of wine Reese brought her and launched into an explanation of her adventure with Alix.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what I did wrong!\u201d Jacqueline said hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cHow old is Alix?\u201d Reese asked.</p><p>Jacqueline wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cEarly twenties, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to make her into another you, Jacquie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI most certainly was not,\u201d she cried, angry that Reese was so ready to find fault with her. She should\u2019ve known better than to confide in him.</p><p>Then, at once, she realized he was right. She\u2019d taken Alix to her salesclerk and her hairdresser. She met his gaze and slowly nodded. \u201cPerhaps I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, ask Tammie Lee to give you a few suggestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee,\u201d Jacqueline repeated and automatically shook her head. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t do any better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but she\u2019s closer to Alix\u2019s age and might have a few ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could ask her,\u201d she said. Her daughter-in-law might not do better, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t do any worse than Jacqueline had.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>\u201cKnitting goes with us, it calms us.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Morgan Hicks, Sweaters by Design</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>W hen I didn\u2019t hear from Dr. Wilson\u2019s office by the end of the week, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Generally Peggy calls patients with their test results while the office is officially closed for lunch. From experience, I knew that if I needed a prescription refilled, I needed to contact Dr. Wilson\u2019s office before eleven.</p><p>When I opened the shop on Tuesday morning, it occurred to me fleetingly that I hadn\u2019t heard back from Peggy. Of course, she might have tried to reach me on Monday, but with the shop closed she would\u2019ve gotten the answering machine. I realized I hadn\u2019t given her my new phone number and the only way she had of getting hold of me was through the shop. I checked as soon as I\u2019d flipped the sign from CLOSED to OPEN, but found no messages.</p><p>I thought of it later and meant to phone the office myself, but was interrupted in the most pleasant manner possible. Brad stopped in on what he termed his coffee break.</p><p>My heart continued to do leaps of joy whenever he walked into the shop. We\u2019d gone out to dinner twice in the last week and were together for much of Sunday afternoon. Cody spent the weekend with his mother who was often away on business, and this was a rare treat for us, even though I really enjoy Cody. He\u2019s a lively little boy with a quirky sense of humor. He asked me to knit him a sweater with a dinosaur on the front, and I said I would.</p><p>\u201cHi there, handsome,\u201d I said as Brad let himself into the shop. He dazzled me with one of his smiles.</p><p>\u201cHave you got coffee made?\u201d he asked when it seemed I was capable of doing nothing but staring at him in wide-eyed adoration.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cI barely got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put on a pot.\u201d He headed for the back room, where we\u2019d escaped any number of times for a private moment.</p><p>We both knew his coffee-making ploy was just an excuse for the two of us to be alone. I followed him on the pretense of helping, but the instant I walked past the floral curtain that served as a door, Brad placed his arms around my waist and pulled me close.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful weekend,\u201d he whispered with his hands locked at the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d We\u2019d gone for a canoe ride on Lake Washington and halfway across he\u2019d brought out a guitar and attempted to serenade me. It was truly romantic and quite possibly the sweetest thing any man had ever done for me. \u201cJust promise you\u2019ll never sing to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my baritone?\u201d He jutted out his lower lip in an exaggerated pout.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I love your singing, but I\u2019m in serious danger of falling in love with you.\u201d That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d intended to say, but it seemed my heart had its own purpose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want, Lydia.\u201d He brought me closer still and kissed me with such energy and need that I was afraid I might collapse at his feet. We\u2019d explored the attraction between us quite a bit over the weekend. I recognized that we\u2019d reached a decision point in the relationship. It would be easy for this attraction to slip into the physical. Before that happened, though, I needed to be absolutely sure we shared the same values and life goals.</p><p>Margaret had warned me\u2014and my mother had spoken her piece, too\u2014about the importance of taking the relationship slow. I knew they were both right, but I felt so good in Brad\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you more and more,\u201d Brad said. \u201cYou\u2019re the first thing I think of when I wake in the morning and the last thing on my mind at night.\u201d</p><p>He was in my thoughts day and night, too, and to be honest, it frightened me. Twice before, I\u2019d been in promising relationships. The first time I\u2019d been too young to really understand what I\u2019d lost when Brian and I broke up after I was diagnosed with a brain tumor.</p><p>It was a different story with Roger, who broke my heart. I wanted to die when he walked out on me and in retrospect, I see that was exactly what I assumed would happen. Time is a great healer, as the old saying has it, and I understand now, almost six years later, why Roger left when he did. He loved me. I truly believe that. Because he loved me, he couldn\u2019t bear to watch me die. He reacted the only way he knew how\u2014by running away.</p><p>I heard that he got married just four months after we broke up. I tried not to think about him, but every now and then I felt a twinge of sadness. I didn\u2019t want any regrets with me and Brad, no matter where the relationship took us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet.\u201d He tenderly brushed the hair from my forehead as he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go slow,\u201d I said. I\u2019d told him about Brian and Roger, and just about everything else in my life there was to tell. He\u2019d already known the basic facts, the outline of my emotional history, but I\u2019d filled in the details when we were in the canoe. I\u2019d leaned against him and gazed out over the beautiful green water of Lake Washington as we drifted. Brad had his arms around me. I found it easier to talk about my lost loves when I wasn\u2019t facing him.</p><p>In turn, Brad described his marriage, and said he felt he\u2019d failed Janice, his ex-wife. That was something I couldn\u2019t understand, although I understood the impulse to assume blame. It\u2019s part of the same impulse that makes us believe we\u2019re responsible for everything that happens in a relationship or a family. But I\u2019ve learned we can\u2019t control other people\u2019s feelings....</p><p>\u201cWhat about dinner Friday night?\u201d he asked now. He kissed me before I could respond.</p><p>The phone rang and I sighed with annoyance. \u201cHold that thought,\u201d I whispered, easing myself out of his arms.</p><p>I hurried to the phone and grabbed it just before the answering machine kicked in. \u201cA Good Yarn,\u201d I said, hoping my voice didn\u2019t betray what I\u2019d been doing a moment or so earlier.</p><p>\u201cLydia, this is Peggy from Dr. Wilson\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Peggy,\u201d I said, glad to have finally heard from her. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d contact me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to call on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I was busy all day.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and perhaps I should\u2019ve caught it then, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI should have phoned,\u201d Peggy said.</p><p>By now I\u2019d detected reluctance in her voice.</p><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d If it was, I didn\u2019t want her to delay it a second longer. She\u2019d given me the weekend as a gift and instinctively I realized that without her having to put it into words.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call yesterday,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut then I remembered your shop\u2019s closed on Mondays, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave a message.\u201d The reason was obvious now. The news she had to give me couldn\u2019t be left on an answering machine.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice uneasy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, steeling myself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lydia, I\u2019m so sorry. Dr. Wilson looked over your bloodwork and he\u2019s scheduled a series of X-rays for you. He\u2019d also like to see you in his office at your earliest convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d It went without saying that the cancer was back. Another tumor was forming in my brain even as Peggy spoke. It was growing back and nothing would stop it this time, no surgery, no drugs, nothing. Had I been alone, I would have insisted Peggy tell me the worst of it then and there. But I couldn\u2019t do that with Brad in hearing distance.</p><p>\u201cCan I make you an appointment with the radiologist for tomorrow morning at eight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cDr. Wilson will want you to bring the X-rays for an appointment here at nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I was numb. I\u2019d been given this reprieve of six years and I felt cheated not to have more. I wanted so many more.</p><p>Twice now, my father had been my strength, but this time he was gone and I was alone. Mom was incapable and Margaret would be furious when she heard this. I couldn\u2019t help believing that my sister would find some way to blame me for the return of my tumor. She\u2019d say my need for sympathy had encouraged its growth. I almost groaned as I imagined her reaction.</p> <p>\u201cBad news?\u201d Brad asked when I replaced the receiver.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed he was no longer in the back room. The coffee had obviously finished brewing because he held a mug in his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. \u201cBut unfortunately I won\u2019t be able to make dinner on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d How I managed to smile I\u2019ll never know, but I did, gazing up at him with a look worthy of an acting award.</p> <p>Brad left soon afterward and if he suspected anything was wrong, he didn\u2019t let on. I\u2019d give it an hour or two, then phone him on his cell and make sure he understood that our relationship was over. I knew I was taking the coward\u2019s way out, but I didn\u2019t want to argue about it or discuss the details with him. I didn\u2019t want to hold out false hope or have it held out to me. Experience is the best teacher. I would make it easy on Brad and save him the trouble later.</p><p>Just when I\u2019d begun to feel that I had a real chance at life, it was being snatched away from me\u2014again. I knew this routine, having lived it. The tests come back with questionable results. A consultation is followed by even more tests, extensive ones that require an overnight stay in the hospital.</p><p>Then the prognosis is delivered by a grim-faced Dr. Wilson, who would squeeze my hand before he left the hospital room.</p><p>I\u2019d always wondered what that little gesture was supposed to mean. At first I thought Dr. Wilson was telling me to be brave. To fight the good fight, to give this battle my all. Now I know differently. He was telling me how sorry he was. He\u2019s only human, and there\u2019s only so much he can do.</p><p>As soon as I could, I\u2019d break all ties with Brad. Someday he\u2019d understand and while he might not thank me now, I knew he would later.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p> <p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>I t\u2019d been a week since Carol\u2019s miscarriage. Doug slept soundly beside her, but she was wide awake. Staring at the digital display on the clock radio, she saw that it was 3:27 a.m. Knowing it would be impossible to fall back asleep, she stole quietly out of bed. Walking blindly in the dark, she made her way into the silent living room.</p><p>All her lost dreams, all her and Doug\u2019s abandoned plans for the future, fell upon her like a collapsing building. There would be no baby. She wouldn\u2019t cuddle an infant in her arms or know the joy of nursing her own baby at her breast.</p><p>An entire seven days had passed since the miscarriage and, other than that first dreadful night, Carol hadn\u2019t stepped foot inside the baby\u2019s nursery. She couldn\u2019t; it was just too painful. The door had remained closed, and she was sure Doug hadn\u2019t gone in there, either.</p><p>Over dinner last evening, he\u2019d suggested they call the department store and arrange to have the baby furniture returned. They had no reason to keep it, and while she knew her husband was only being practical, it felt as if he\u2019d plunged a knife straight through her heart.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. Not to them. They were so much in love and they were good people. Everyone who knew them said they\u2019d make wonderful parents.</p><p>Carol had hoped this gut-wrenching agony would lessen with time. It\u2019d only been a week, but the ache, the emptiness inside her, hadn\u2019t even begun to dissipate. If anything, it\u2019d grown worse. The only solace she\u2019d found had been with her online support friends. They understood and had wept with her.</p><p>Leaning her head back and closing her eyes, Carol clamped her arms around her middle and started to rock in grief and pain and loss.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t right. It just wasn\u2019t right. Rick, her irresponsible, reckless, immature brother, was able to father children he didn\u2019t want with a woman he didn\u2019t love. Where was the fairness in that? Where was the justice? That poor baby...Neither parent seemed to care.</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes flew open. A tingling sensation ran up and down her arms. Rick! Carol bolted off the sofa and hurried back into the bedroom. Intent on waking her husband, she leaped onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cDoug, wake up!\u201d she cried, kneeling over him.</p><p>Her husband ignored her and rolled onto his side.</p><p>\u201cDoug!\u201d she shouted, giddy with relief and joy. Hope could be a powerful drug and at the moment she was infused with it. \u201cDoug, I have to talk to you.\u201d She shook him urgently.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d her husband protested, peering at the clock with one eye, \u201cit\u2019s the middle of the night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I know.\u201d On her knees, she bent over him and kissed his neck. \u201cYou have to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have something very important to tell you.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance marking every movement, Doug rolled onto his back and rubbed his face. He blinked and stared up at her, then frowned. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re smiling?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and leaning forward again, she hugged her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting in the living room just now.\u201d She stretched out her arm, her gestures wild with energy. \u201cI was feeling so awful and thinking how unfair life is. I was so sure we\u2019d have a baby and we didn\u2019t and...and then I realized something and I had to wake you.\u201d</p><p>Doug struggled into a sitting position so they were eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be another baby for us,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Doug shook his head. \u201cYou lost me.\u201d He frowned as he studied her. \u201cAre you talking about adoption?\u201d</p><p>This was a familiar subject and with so few infants available, they knew their chances weren\u2019t good. \u201cNot just any baby. I\u2019m talking about adopting Rick\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDo you know any other Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Lisa is. Or was it Kim? I don\u2019t remember and really it doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t you see? God meant for that baby to be ours.\u201d</p><p>Doug wasn\u2019t following her plan or if he was, he didn\u2019t feel nearly as enthusiastic. He held her gaze and said gently, \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re not thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Carol insisted. \u201cIt makes perfect sense. Can\u2019t you see? My brother has fathered a child he doesn\u2019t want. He told me he has no intention of marrying the mother. This pregnancy was a shock to Lisa, too\u2014or Kim. Whoever she is. She certainly wasn\u2019t anticipating a child as a result of their affair. Rick told me himself she was using birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it all sounds very sudden, but I honestly feel this baby was no accident. This is our baby.\u201d</p><p>Doug\u2019s sigh echoed through the bedroom. \u201cHoney...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s related to me. It won\u2019t be like adopting a stranger\u2019s child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Rick will agree to this?\u201d Clearly Doug had his doubts.</p><p>\u201cAgree?\u201d she repeated, laughing again. \u201cI think he\u2019d leap at the chance to escape child support payments. Furthermore, I want to assure him that neither one of us will ever tell Ellie that this baby is his biological child. We\u2019d give him our word on that, wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he ever gets back together with Ellie, he can rest assured that our lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the baby\u2019s mother?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe has some say in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that,\u201d Carol said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to take several weeks off work and we should be willing to compensate her for any lost wages.\u201d</p><p>Doug lifted his shoulders in a halfhearted shrug. \u201cI suppose we could make that offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go back to work to help pay for whatever she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carol protested. Already he was objecting to her plans and it was crucial that he feel as certain about all of this as she did.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back to work for just a few months and then quit again. If you do return to the brokerage, it has to be with the understanding that you only intend to work a set amount of time.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but that didn\u2019t thwart her hopes\u2014or her plans. \u201cI\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to make this adoption work. Just promise you\u2019ll support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby is ours. I can feel it in my heart.\u201d Needing to convince him, she lifted his hand and held it.</p><p>Doug closed his eyes and she couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking. He was afraid\u2014she was, too\u2014but the certainty that this was how things were meant to be overshadowed her fears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid we\u2019re setting ourselves up for disappointment, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Doug nodded. \u201cI hate to see you put yourself through this. What if it\u2019s another dead end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be worrying about that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Despite Doug\u2019s concern, she was convinced her brother would like the idea.</p><p>\u201cShould I call Rick, or do you want to do it?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>Joyfully, Carol tossed her arms around her husband\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll phone him first thing in the morning and explain everything.\u201d She still hadn\u2019t heard from Rick, not since that evening he\u2019d told her about the pregnancy. By now, he would have received from her parents the devastating report of the miscarriage. Carol realized he purposely hadn\u2019t called or written her. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say and it was easier to ignore her pain. Her brother tended to take the route of least resistance, which was something she hadn\u2019t learned about him until recently.</p><p>\u201cCan I go back to sleep now?\u201d Doug asked and without waiting for a response, he slid down and pulled the sheet and comforter up to his ears.</p><p>Carol felt herself slip from her alert, energetic state into sudden tiredness. She got under the covers, too, burying her head in the pillow. Doug was on his side and she cuddled against him spoon-fashion, draping her arm over his waist.</p><p>Tired though she was, her head swam with thoughts of this child and what the adoption would bring to their lives. The old proverb was right: God never closes a door without opening a window. That window was wide open. She\u2019d just had to stand in front of it for a few moments to feel the winds of change. She finally understood what should have been obvious all along.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix dumped her dirty T-shirts into the washing machine, added soap and inserted quarters into the proper slots. She had enough shirts from rock bands and concerts to last her a full two weeks. With the old-lady underwear Jacqueline had insisted on buying her, Alix now had the same number of panties as she did T-shirts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To save money, Alix and Laurel combined their dirty clothes and took turns hauling the bags down to the Laundromat. It was Alix\u2019s turn to deal with the laundry and she hated it, which was one reason she went there early Monday morning. She\u2019d feel like a success if one day she was rich enough to afford her own washer and dryer.</p><p>Sitting on the hard plastic chair, she reached for a magazine. The date on the issue of People was Christmas a year ago and Alix set it aside once she realized she\u2019d read it on her previous visit. In fact, she\u2019d read everything the Laundromat had to offer.</p><p>Crossing her arms, she stretched out her legs and closed her eyes. She smiled as she thought about Jacqueline. Her friend meant well, but there was no way in hell Alix was going to try on a knit dress. One look at the price tag and she\u2019d nearly passed out. That dress and sweater combination cost over a thousand bucks. A thousand bucks for a dress? That was crazy!</p><p>Her experience at the hairdresser\u2019s had been even worse. The French woman with the heavy accent refused to listen to anything Alix said. She had her own ideas of what needed to be done and simply dismissed Alix\u2019s instructions. By the time Desiree, or whatever her name was, had finished, Alix was ready to scream. To be fair, her hair did look fairly decent\u2014if she\u2019d wanted to resemble that Brady Bunch guy. Alix had needed a week to get it styled the way she liked it after Desiree had snipped off so much with those fancy scissors.</p> <p>Alix didn\u2019t mean to sound unappreciative; Jacqueline had wanted to do something nice for her, and Alix was grateful, especially since her friend was footing the bill. But Jacqueline\u2019s efforts had backfired. She just didn\u2019t understand Alix\u2019s taste, and Alix wasn\u2019t letting the other woman get that close to her again.</p><p>On a brighter note, Carol was back at A Good Yarn this past Friday and\u2014surprisingly\u2014in a great mood. Everyone had been worried about her after the news of her miscarriage. Alix wasn\u2019t sure what, if anything, to say. She wanted Carol to know she was sorry, but at the same time she didn\u2019t want to bring up a painful subject in case Carol wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it. Jacqueline and Lydia obviously felt the same way.</p><p>Then Carol had arrived for class as cheerful as ever, and Alix was stunned. Everyone was. Carol seemed convinced that she and Doug would be able to adopt a baby. Alix was full of questions, but when the others didn\u2019t ask anything, she took the hint and didn\u2019t either. Carol hadn\u2019t provided any details, so they all pretended everything was fine. Alix worried that Carol was in denial or caught up in some kind of wish-fulfillment fantasy. She tried to be encouraging, but frankly she was concerned.</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t the only one in the group Alix was concerned about. Something was definitely wrong with Lydia. She just wasn\u2019t herself, acting subdued and withdrawn, walking around in a fog. Jacqueline had noticed it, too. At first Alix assumed Lydia was on the outs with the delivery guy she\u2019d been so keen on all summer. That could be it, but she was doubtful. When questioned, Lydia claimed everything was fine, but Alix didn\u2019t need a psychic to see that things were definitely off kilter.</p><p>And Laurel...Laurel was even worse than before. Having a roommate was a mistake, but they were stuck with each other. For the past three months Laurel had been irritable and short-tempered. Thinking she was being helpful, Alix gave her a tabloid with big headlines about a miracle diet. Laurel had hurled it back at Alix, hitting her in the face. Alix had avoided her roommate ever since. It was easier now that Laurel wasn\u2019t working at the video store. She\u2019d quit the week before and taken a job at a day care center as an assistant, which meant she was basically a baby-sitter and a cleaner, wiping up spilled juice and putting away Lego blocks. She hadn\u2019t taken courses or anything. But Laurel didn\u2019t seem to like that job any better.</p> <p>The washing machine buzzed, and Alix got up from the chair and dumped the clean clothes into the plastic basket. She was ready to bring the load to the dryer, but when she turned around she nearly bumped into Jordan Turner.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Jordan since their disagreement, and after making a fool of herself she didn\u2019t expect a second chance with him. The only reason she\u2019d let Jacqueline give her a fashion makeover was in the hopes that Jordan would notice the difference, that it might give him an excuse to talk to her. She should\u2019ve known what to expect. Everything she\u2019d ever done to improve her life had ended in this same predictable way.</p><p>\u201cHi-i,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was you.\u201d He studied her hair. \u201cI like the new style. Nice color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Alix couldn\u2019t make her heart stop hammering like one of those staple guns the construction guys used. \u201cThis is my natural color. Well, almost, from what I remember.\u201d Until Jordan\u2019s comment, she\u2019d always viewed her hair as mousy brown. He made her feel beautiful, and special.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should talk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She shrugged, too nervous to speak.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She deliberately walked over to the huge wall dryer and dumped her load inside. After adding the coins, she waited a moment to be sure the dryer had started to tumble before joining him.</p><p>He sat at the table used to fold clothes. It was early in the day and the Laundromat wasn\u2019t busy yet. By ten it would fill up. Alix preferred to avoid the more crowded times, when kids ran around out of control and people squabbled over whose turn it was for the dryers.</p><p>She lowered her head, struggling to find the words to apologize.</p><p>\u201cI heard what you did,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>Alix frowned as she tried to figure out what he meant.</p><p>\u201cLori told me you got her out of a drug house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Alix had nearly forgotten that. \u201cYeah, well, she wanted out but didn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori\u2019s a troubled kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho isn\u2019t?\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to sound flippant, but it was an honest response. All teenagers seemed to go through a period when they were convinced the world was out to get them. The only defense available was to lash back. Her own rebellion had led her down several dark paths, and in retrospect, she wished there\u2019d been someone in her life who would\u2019ve taken her out of a drug house.</p><p>\u201cLori asked me to tell you she\u2019s grateful for what you did.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way Alix remembered it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful, too,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>She nodded dismissively. \u201cI knew Lori didn\u2019t belong in that house with those men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you,\u201d Jordan said, holding her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>Jordan refused to release her eyes. \u201cAre drugs a problem?\u201d</p><p>That made her angry, and she would have snapped back a retort, but she swallowed her outrage. It was a fair question, since she\u2019d voluntarily walked into a drug house. \u201cNot anymore. I\u2019ve used in the past, but these days I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking her word for it.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should apologize,\u201d she said in as offhand a manner as she could. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I was jealous.\u201d Seeing Jordan standing in the church with that perfect all-American girl had nearly tripped her up. She had no right to feel the things she did, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter. In her heart she viewed Jordan as hers. The red-hot suspicions that burned through her were too consuming to ignore, so she\u2019d reverted to a time and place she\u2019d sworn never to visit again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Lori who should be grateful, but Alix. The girl\u2019s danger had brought her back.</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d Jordan grinned at her.</p><p>Alix felt as if her heart was melting. She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d she agreed, happy and a bit melancholy at the same time. Did this mean she couldn\u2019t be more than his friend?</p><p>Jordan reached across the table and squeezed her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds, she could hardly catch her breath. He\u2019d missed her! \u201cI\u2019m knitting you a sweater,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>Alix cursed the day she\u2019d inherited this pattern from Carol. It\u2019d been causing her problems from the moment she\u2019d started. For a while she\u2019d stopped working on it, but she\u2019d begun again, hoping to feel close to Jordan. She\u2019d also supposed it might give her an excuse to contact him. She\u2019d finished the baby blanket and showed it to her social worker; now all she had to do was deliver it to the appropriate agency.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be jealous, you know.\u201d</p><p>Alix slid her gaze to his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cDo you remember the day you brought cupcakes to class for your birthday?\u201d</p><p>Alix wasn\u2019t likely to forget. Her mother wasn\u2019t much of a homemaker so Alix had made them herself. From scratch, too, not from a mix.</p><p>\u201cI baked those.\u201d She was surprised that he\u2019d remembered.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me two.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her eyes. \u201cYeah, I know. If I had a decent oven I\u2019d bake you a whole batch right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like to bake?\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded. It was her dream to attend a cooking school and be the kind of chef who prepared fancy dinners at places like the ones Jacqueline and her husband frequented. Or maybe one day she\u2019d have her own catering business. She didn\u2019t talk about this often. Over the years she\u2019d worked in a few restaurants and she loved the craziness in the kitchen. She\u2019d tried to get on at Annie\u2019s but the video store had offered her a job first.</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for Saturday night?\u201d Jordan\u2019s thumb stroked the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go to dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s Caf\u00e9?\u201d A meal there was as close to restaurant dining as she got.</p><p>\u201cNot this time. How about a real three-course dinner at a fish and steak house?\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a dress-and-panty-hose place. But the thought of turning him down didn\u2019t so much as enter her mind. Maybe, just maybe, Jacqueline would be willing to give her a second chance at a fashion makeover.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>\u201cIn knitting, as in everything else, you learn as much from your mistakes as you do from your successes.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Pam Allen, Editor, Interweave Press</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I suppose it sounds melodramatic to say I felt my life was over. Still, that\u2019s exactly what I believed as I lay in the hospital bed with the sterile scents of rubbing alcohol and antiseptic wafting around me. I\u2019ve always detested the smell of hospitals. For someone who\u2019s spent as much time in them as I have, you might think I would\u2019ve grown accustomed to it by now. I haven\u2019t, though. The X-rays revealed what I\u2019d feared most. Another tumor had formed. If there was anything to be grateful for, it was that this one was accessible through my sinus cavity, without the necessity of drilling into my skull.</p><p>The tumor was gone now and the biopsy had been completed. Unfortunately the results were inconclusive, and a tissue sample had been sent out for a second opinion. With my medical history no one was willing to take chances. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Margaret\u2019s bouquet of carnations sat on the table at my bedside and cheered me. It was the first time my sister had ever sent me flowers. Our relationship was changing, but even her gesture of support wasn\u2019t enough to get me through this.</p><p>In my heart I knew what was coming and I couldn\u2019t bear it. Not again. Everything within me wanted to scream how unfair this was. Like a little girl, I wanted to jump up and down and throw a temper tantrum.</p><p>Dad\u2019s not here to help me anymore, and the sense of abandonment I experienced was overwhelming. Irrational as it might seem, I was furious with my father for dying. I\u2019m so angry. Angry with Dad. Angry with God. Angry at the world.</p><p>Having spent most of two days drugged for the surgery, I now found the escape of sleep unavailable. Every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was Brad\u2019s face. All I heard was his voice. What kept coming to mind was the last confrontation we had, that day on the phone, when I told him I didn\u2019t want to see him again. I made it as plain as I could that I was not interested in continuing our relationship.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t understand, of course, that I was doing him a favor and seemed bent on arguing, trying to change my mind. I regret the things I said, but I couldn\u2019t tell him the truth, so I\u2019d led him to believe my interests lay elsewhere.</p><p>I knew Margaret strongly disapproved of my breaking up with Brad. However, I told her this is my life and I make my own decisions. That shut her up, but I could tell she was furious. I can deal with her displeasure, though. I have dealt with it nearly all of our lives.</p><p>I don\u2019t think she\u2019s blamed me for the return of the cancer. I\u2019ve tried to be grateful for that one small bit of compassion on my sister\u2019s part. When I told her the news, she grew very solemn and told me how sorry she was.</p><p>As if my thoughts had conjured her up, Margaret stood in the doorway to my room. \u201cI see the flowers arrived,\u201d she said, looking ill-at-ease. She glanced around warily, as if she half expected an orderly to grab her, throw her on a gurney and wheel her off for experimental surgery.</p><p>\u201cThe flowers are very nice,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt was a thoughtful thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, tentatively stepping closer to the bed. \u201cHow did the tests go?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged because there wasn\u2019t anything to say. \u201cAbout the same as last time.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s eyebrows rose in sympathy. \u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>I made a genuine effort to smile, but the best I could manage was a grimace.</p><p>\u201cMom wanted to come....\u201d</p><p>I nodded. My mother didn\u2019t know the reason I\u2019d been admitted, and I wanted to keep it that way. On reflection, if there\u2019s anything positive about my father\u2019s death, it\u2019s that he went quickly. Mom wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope with a long illness.</p> <p>I suspect Margaret\u2019s a lot like our mother, and her willingness to visit me now revealed how much our relationship had evolved over the past few months.</p><p>Once she figured it was safe to relax, Margaret pulled the visitor\u2019s chair to the side of my bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d I told her, \u201cbecause there are a few things I want to discuss.\u201d</p><p>It was as if she hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cI don\u2019t think now is a good time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The tone of my voice seemed to reach her, even if my words didn\u2019t.</p><p>Resigned, Margaret sighed heavily. \u201cAll right, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what will happen to A Good Yarn.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s expression was painful. \u201cI\u2019ve given that some thought myself. You know I don\u2019t knit, but I\u2019d be willing to step in and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d Asking my sister to take over my business hadn\u2019t occurred to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. Mom and I could trade days.\u201d</p><p>Her generosity touched me deeply, and for the first time since I\u2019d entered the hospital, I felt tears clogging my throat and filling my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d be willing to do that.\u201d</p><p>Margaret stared at me in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. I\u2019d do anything I could to help you, including...\u201d She hesitated, drew in a deep breath and looked over her shoulder. \u201cWe can talk about this later, all right? Nothing\u2019s for sure, so why don\u2019t we cross that bridge once we get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have another visitor.\u201d</p><p>I imagined one of my nieces had come with her and looked expectantly toward the door. I\u2019d wanted to settle the future of my yarn shop immediately, but it made sense to wait until Dr. Wilson delivered his verdict. I hadn\u2019t believed I\u2019d survive the second bout of cancer, and I had no illusions about the third. The fight had gone out of me and I was willing to accept my fate.</p><p>The awful truth, what I could never say aloud to Margaret or my mother, is that I preferred death over treatment. I felt I couldn\u2019t do this again, couldn\u2019t endure the agony of chemotherapy. I was an adult and capable of making my own decision. Well, I\u2019d made it. I\u2019d decided to refuse treatment and let the cancer take its course. The only person I could discuss this with was Dr. Wilson, and I wouldn\u2019t see him until he\u2019d had a chance to analyze the test results.</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment,\u201d Margaret said. She rose from the chair and disappeared into the hallway outside my room.</p><p>I was in for a shock when she returned. The visitor she brought in with her wasn\u2019t Julie or Hailey, but Brad. Everything inside me wanted to scream at him to leave and for Margaret to go with him. I couldn\u2019t stand it. One look at the tender concern on Brad\u2019s face, and I reacted like a juvenile, covering my face with both hands. Then, to my horror, I unceremoniously burst into tears.</p><p>I felt Brad\u2019s arms come around my shoulders. \u201cYou could have told me, you know.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hands and refused to look at him or speak. My fury was focused on my meddling sister. \u201cHow could you?\u201d I shouted at her. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she shouted right back. It was as though the room had developed an echo.</p><p>Brad interrupted our shouting match. He spoke in a strong, determined voice. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me what was wrong we could have talked it out, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d I turned to look him straight in the face, although my heart was breaking.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSorry, that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you drive me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d I cried, and nearly choked on the words. \u201cThere\u2019s no future with me.\u201d</p><p>Eyes soft, he reached for my hand. \u201cBut there\u2019s today and tomorrow and the next day.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my chin toward the ceiling. I didn\u2019t understand why everyone had to make this so difficult.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cWould you stop feeling so damned sorry for yourself and get a grip?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect anything different from my sister. She wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d gone through this nightmare. She wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d suffered weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. My sister acted as though my cancer was a minor inconvenience. As though I should just get over it and deal with life.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the future holds,\u201d Brad said, his gaze earnest, \u201cbut I can tell you that whatever happens, I intend to be here, for you and with you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard that before, too. Same words, different year. But after two days of being poked and prodded, I was in no state of mind for an argument. \u201cPlease, just leave...I can\u2019t deal with this now.\u201d</p><p>Margaret and Brad exchanged glances. They didn\u2019t seem to believe me. Nor did they care what I wanted or needed, because they utterly ignored my request. They gave me no option, so I slammed my hand on the bell to call the nurse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d A tinny voice rang through the intercom.</p><p>\u201cPeace,\u201d I cried. \u201cI need peace and quiet and these people refuse to leave.\u201d</p><p>Margaret pinched her lips together and slowly shook her head. And from the grim frown on Brad\u2019s face, it would take the Seventh Cavalry\u2014or one annoyed nurse\u2014to make him vacate my room. I slid down in the bed and rolled over, offering him my back.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t finished our discussion,\u201d he said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him. As far as I was concerned, I\u2019d already told him everything I intended to. Nothing he said was going to change my mind.</p><p>I heard footsteps enter the room.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d Margaret told the nurse.</p><p>I forced myself not to roll over and watch my sister and Brad walk out.</p><p>Perhaps I had a bigger problem than cancer. I\u2019d just thrown out the only two people in the world who\u2019d come to offer me their love and support.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol and Doug arrived at the fondue restaurant in the Seattle University district before Rick. They were already seated and had each ordered a glass of chardonnay while they waited for her brother and possibly Lisa.</p><p>It had taken Carol several days to reach him. Their conversation had been short. She\u2019d invited Rick to dinner and asked him to bring Lisa, too, if she was available. After setting the date and time, he\u2019d promised to see if Lisa could come.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll be with him?\u201d Carol asked, clutching her husband\u2019s arm. This night could be one of the most important in their married life.</p><p>Before Doug had an opportunity to answer, Carol saw the hostess leading her brother to the table. He was alone, but perhaps that was for the best. After talking the matter over, she and Doug had decided her brother could present their idea to Lisa. She might have found it awkward to discuss such a private matter with complete strangers.</p><p>Carol had intended to spend the evening socializing with Rick\u2014or the couple if Lisa showed up\u2014and then afterward invite them to the apartment, where they\u2019d make their suggestion. Doug would do the talking, they\u2019d agreed, and that would give Carol a chance to gauge Rick\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d Rick said. He kissed Carol\u2019s cheek before taking a seat across from them. His eyes avoided hers. \u201cMom told me about the miscarriage. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Their drinks came then, providing a distraction. Rick ordered a double whiskey. \u201cI\u2019m not flying until tomorrow night,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything in your life?\u201d Doug asked as soon as the waitress had taken their dinner order.</p><p>\u201cHunky dory,\u201d Rick said flippantly.</p><p>Carol reached for her husband\u2019s hand beneath the table. \u201cHow\u2019s Lisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I guess. I haven\u2019t talked to her in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t bothered to extend the dinner invitation, after all. Well, she supposed it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly seem to be in good spirits.\u201d Rick directed the comment at Carol. \u201cI expected you to be all depressed. Mom said you\u2019d taken the miscarriage really hard.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI did, but life goes on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His drink arrived and Rick raised the ice-filled tumbler. \u201cTo life,\u201d he said. Carol and Doug raised their glasses in response but didn\u2019t echo his words.</p><p>\u201cActually, you and Lisa have a great deal to do with the improvement in my mood,\u201d Carol ventured. Doug cast her a warning glance. She knew he was right. This wasn\u2019t the time to bring up the reason for their dinner invitation.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Her brother looked surprised.</p><p>Thankfully their server arrived with the first course of their meal, saving Carol from answering. The waitress lit the fondue burner and set a bowl filled with a hot cheese mixture on top. She added a variety of items to dip, including bread, sliced vegetables and fresh apples and pears.</p> <p>Carol\u2019s appetite had increased over the last week, but since the miscarriage she\u2019d lost enough weight that many of her clothes no longer fit properly. For that evening out, she\u2019d been forced to change her outfit three times. Everything in her closet hung on her like a tent.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking of adoption,\u201d Carol announced. She simply couldn\u2019t resist saying something, despite Doug\u2019s caution.</p><p>Rick nodded as if he approved. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought so,\u201d Carol murmured and rubbed her leg against Doug\u2019s. Rick was so dense he hadn\u2019t picked up on what should\u2019ve been obvious.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Ellie last week,\u201d her brother said.</p> <p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was cordial but I could tell that beneath all the politeness, she was pleased to hear from me. I asked her out to dinner next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve waited until I was back in Juneau. It\u2019s much harder to turn me down in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Lisa?\u201d Carol asked, hoping for information about the pregnant flight attendant.</p><p>\u201cWe decided to go our separate ways. We were never much of an item.\u201d</p> <p>Carol\u2019s heart fell. \u201cBut you do intend to keep seeing her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked up, holding a piece of bread dripping with cheese over the fondue pot. \u201cOh, sure, that\u2019s unavoidable with the two of us working the same flights. She\u2019s a sweetheart and what happened is unfortunate. I have to say she\u2019s handled it well.\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed with relief. \u201cYou know, sometimes what seems like an accident isn\u2019t one at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Rick reached for another piece of bread. \u201cDamn, this is good. Did either of you notice what kind of cheese this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I did,\u201d Doug said.</p><p>Carol noticed a sharpness in her husband\u2019s voice and glanced over to find him frowning. She wanted to ask what was wrong, but couldn\u2019t. Now that the subject of Lisa had been introduced, Carol couldn\u2019t bear to wait another moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know how dreadful it was when I miscarried,\u201d she said, studying her brother intently.</p><p>Rick sipped his drink, and then speared a slice of pear. \u201cThat was really bummer news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne night last week, just before dawn, I was sitting in the dark thinking about all of this. I felt like a complete failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d failed myself. I\u2019d failed Doug. You and I both know what a wonderful father he\u2019d be. And I knew how disappointed Mom and Dad would be. They\u2019re really looking forward to becoming grandparents. I felt as if my whole world had collapsed.\u201d</p><p>Rick glanced at her. \u201cWhy would you feel like that?\u201d</p><p>It would take too long to explain. \u201cA woman feels those kinds of emotions when she can\u2019t carry a pregnancy to term.\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s gaze slid to Doug and he winked. \u201cWomen. Can\u2019t live with \u2019em, can\u2019t understand \u2018em, but they sure as hell make life interesting, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Doug didn\u2019t bother to respond.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I bring this up now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d Doug placed his hand over hers. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy our dinner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but nearly had to bite her tongue to keep from prodding her brother with more questions about Lisa. Without the double whiskey\u2014in fact, Rick was now on his second\u2014he might have picked up on what she was trying to say.</p><p>The meal seemed to take forever. Any other night, Carol would have savored this time with her two favorite men in the world. Following the appetizer of cheese was the main course with shrimp and lobster cooked in a bubbling white wine sauce. When dessert finally arrived, strawberries and pound cake dipped in rich chocolate, Carol was so tense she couldn\u2019t wait another minute.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come to our house for a nightcap?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>Rick glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019d better not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s important,\u201d Carol blurted out. \u201cDoug and I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Rick gave her a surprised look. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Carol refused to let the evening end without broaching the subject of the adoption. \u201cDoug and I want to ask about you and Lisa.\u201d</p><p>Rick\u2019s forehead creased in a frown. \u201cI thought I told you we split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you as a couple. Doug and I\u2014\u201d she paused and looked at her husband briefly before returning her gaze to Rick \u201c\u2014we want to ask about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat baby?\u201d Her brother seemed genuinely puzzled.</p><p>Carol leaned closer to him. \u201cLisa\u2019s pregnant, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas pregnant, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt as if the chair had been yanked out from under her. \u201cShe miscarried?\u201d</p><p>Rick shook his head. \u201cShe and I talked about this, you know. We both agreed there wasn\u2019t any other option. Neither of us had planned on this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I could think was what Ellie would say if she found out, and then there\u2019s eighteen bloody years of child support. A kid isn\u2019t a responsibility I take lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had an abortion.\u201d Carol felt needles of pain move up and down her arms.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Lisa and I discussed it. It\u2019s her body, and the choice was hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you told her you didn\u2019t want the baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. I don\u2019t need that kind of complication in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Doug and I wanted to adopt the baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d Doug\u2019s gentle voice broke through the fog of dismay and disbelief. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to happen. Let go of it.\u201d</p><p>After the first jolt of shock she felt nothing. No anger, no outrage, no disappointment. Nothing. They might have been discussing the weather for all the emotion she experienced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rick said, \u201cbut even if we\u2019d known that, I don\u2019t think we would\u2019ve made any other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, I think it\u2019s time we left.\u201d Doug helped her to her feet and if she wasn\u2019t revealing any distress, he was.</p><p>\u201cYou were making a big assumption, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Rick demanded. \u201cThis is my life. It isn\u2019t up to me to solve your problems for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Doug said. \u201cThis is our problem.\u201d</p><p>Rick downed the last of his drink. \u201cNo need to get upset about it. These things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Doug\u2019s arm came around Carol.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner, you two. We\u2019ll have to get together again soon.\u201d Rick continued to sit at the table, staring blankly into space.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>J acqueline picked up Alix outside her apartment building promptly at ten on Saturday morning. During the knitting session on Friday afternoon, Alix had casually mentioned her dinner date with Jordan in a fancy restaurant. Jacqueline had leaped upon it, eager for another opportunity to prove herself.</p><p>\u201cI know what I did wrong,\u201d Jacqueline insisted. \u201cGive me a second chance and you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Alix hoped that was true. When Jacqueline\u2019s Mercedes pulled up to the curb, Alix stepped forward and opened the passenger door. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Now get in, we\u2019re on a schedule.\u201d</p><p>Three months ago if anyone had told Alix she\u2019d be friends with this society broad, Alix would have laughed outright. She and Jacqueline still sniped at each other, but now it was mostly for show. They had a reputation to live up to, and Alix wasn\u2019t going to let it slide. Apparently Jacqueline shared her feelings.</p><p>Alix sat in the car and waited, wondering why Jacqueline hadn\u2019t pulled onto the street.</p><p>\u201cSeat belt,\u201d the older woman said sternly.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, Alix reached for the seat belt and clicked it in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jacqueline snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so prissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. By the way, we\u2019re going to my daughter-in-law\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee\u2019s?\u201d This was a switch. Alix had noticed a softening in Jacqueline not only toward her, but her daughter-in-law too. When Alix had first signed up for the knitting classes, Jacqueline had nothing good to say about the woman who\u2019d married her precious son. That seemed to have changed, at least a little.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee\u2019s young and trendy. That\u2019s the look you\u2019re after, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than having you dress me like Barbara Bush.\u201d</p><p>To Alix\u2019s surprise, Jacqueline laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t put down our former First Ladies. I changed the spelling of my name in the fifth grade because of Jacqueline Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother says she spelled my name with an I on purpose,\u201d Alix confessed, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it was for any good reason. The fact is, she was probably drunk when she made out the birth certificate and accidentally misspelled it.\u201d Alix didn\u2019t know if that was true or not, but it was certainly possible.</p><p>They chatted on the ride to Tammie Lee\u2019s, mostly about which fork to use first in a fancy restaurant and other rules of etiquette Jacqueline felt it was essential Alix know. They also discussed Lydia and wondered why her sister had been in the shop so much lately. Jacqueline had phoned to ask, and Alix had stopped by a couple of times. All Margaret would say was that Lydia was under the weather. Friday\u2019s knitting session had been rather unsatisfactory without their teacher and friend, but no one complained openly. Alix just hoped Lydia would be back the following week and so did Jacqueline.</p><p>They drove for a good twenty minutes before Jacqueline pulled into the driveway of what looked like a mansion. The house was modern with a big front yard and lots of flowers. The white pillars in front reminded her of pictures she\u2019d once seen in a magazine. Super cool.</p><p>No sooner had Jacqueline turned off the engine than the front door opened and a girl who didn\u2019t seem to be any older than Alix stepped outside. Tammie Lee looked like she was ready to pop at any moment and wore shorts, a maternity top and no shoes. She had a smile as big as any Alix had ever seen and her eyes sparkled with welcome.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right on time.\u201d Tammie Lee held open the screen door. \u201cI\u2019ve been so eager for you to get here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alix loved listening to her talk. Tammie Lee had the softest, sweetest voice she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>Tammie Lee hugged Jacqueline as if it\u2019d been a year of Sundays since she\u2019d last seen her mother-in-law. \u201cAnd you must be Alix. Jacqueline didn\u2019t tell me what a beauty you are. Why, this is going to be easier than frying up griddle cakes. You must come in and let me take a good look at you.\u201d Before Alix could object, not that she would have, Tammie Lee had taken her arm and led her into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>\u201cGolfing with his daddy,\u201d Tammie Lee said and sounded surprised that her mother-in-law didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Alix noticed a flicker of something in the older woman\u2019s eyes. For an instant it looked like pain, but Alix was sure she must be wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got everything set up in the spare bedroom,\u201d Tammie Lee said. \u201cI took out a bunch of my clothes for Alix to try on. That way, when we find something she likes, we\u2019ll know where to shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Alix said, although she couldn\u2019t imagine wearing any style this southern belle would.</p><p>True to her word, Tammie Lee had laid an assortment of clothes on the bed in the guest room. At first glance Alix\u2019s heart fell. There seemed to be nothing but satin, lace and girly items.</p><p>\u201cYou sort through what\u2019s on the bed and I\u2019ll get us all some iced tea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith mint,\u201d Jacqueline added as she sat down.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Tammie Lee said as she rushed from the room.</p><p>\u201cShe adds mint to everything,\u201d Jaqueline said in a disparaging whisper.</p><p>Alix glanced at her quickly\u2014a hint of the old disapproval was back\u2014but didn\u2019t comment. Instead she checked out a full-length jean skirt. This was workable but only if she wore a T-shirt with it and a wide leather belt. She set it to one side and reached for a frothy, lacy dress, which she immediately rejected.</p><p>Tammie Lee stuck her head inside the door. \u201cWould either of you prefer a Coke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d Alix wasn\u2019t shy. She\u2019d never been a real fan of iced tea.</p> <p>\u201cWith or without peanuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith.\u201d She hadn\u2019t had breakfast and a snack sounded good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the iced tea. Do you need any help?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, no.\u201d Once again Tammie Lee disappeared, but it wasn\u2019t long before she returned.</p><p>She brought in a tray and placed it on the dresser. Jacqueline stood up to get her glass of iced tea and Alix watched as she removed the mint leaf, using her thumb and index finger as if she were picking out a dead bug.</p><p>Tammie Lee served the Coke in an old-fashioned soda glass. She\u2019d apparently forgotten the peanuts, which was fine. Not until Alix reached for her Coke did she notice the peanuts floating on top. She couldn\u2019t very well object now and took a sip. The taste was interesting, a blend of salt and sweet. This was probably one of those southern traditions Jacqueline complained about so much.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d Alix said and held up the jean skirt.</p><p>\u201cI thought you would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t wear jeans to a fancy restaurant,\u201d Jacqueline objected.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as regular jeans,\u201d Tammie Lee explained.</p><p>While they discussed what could be considered proper attire for a real restaurant, Alix drank her Coke, complete with floating peanuts.</p><p>An hour later, after she\u2019d tried on several outfits, the three of them headed to the mall in two separate cars\u2014Alix, still riding with Jacqueline. Inside one of the major department stores, Jacqueline sat and waited, while Tammie Lee carried outfit after outfit into the dressing room. Some of them Alix rejected out of hand, but a few showed real possibility. In the end, she chose a long black skirt and a white silk blouse with a swooping neckline and cuffs that buttoned at the wrist.</p><p>It was noon, and by then Alix was starved. She would\u2019ve been happy with a hamburger, but Jacqueline suggested a sit-down place inside the mall. She insisted they try the delicate finger sandwiches with ultra-thin slices of cucumber. Alix ate her sandwich in two bites and had several more. She could\u2019ve eaten out for a week on what Jacqueline paid for lunch. No wonder society women were so thin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about anyone else, but I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cI just might let you two carry on without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go home and put your feet up,\u201d Tammie Lee told her. \u201cI\u2019ll take over from here if that\u2019s okay with Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do want to see Alix when you\u2019re all finished with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you myself,\u201d Tammie Lee promised.</p><p>Left to their own devices, Tammie Lee and Alix made fast work of the remainder of their purchases, which included shoes and a silver necklace\u2014all at Jacqueline\u2019s expense. Alix would never have guessed how much she\u2019d like Jacqueline\u2019s daughter-in-law. Tammie Lee was fun and sweet and the nicest person she\u2019d met in her entire life. Frankly, she didn\u2019t know what Jacqueline found so disagreeable about her.</p><p>They stopped for a Coke at a fast-food restaurant in the food court. Because she was still hungry, Alix ordered a cheeseburger and fries to go with it.</p><p>Tammie Lee took one look at her and burst into giggles. \u201cMake that two of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to the same hairdresser.\u201d Alix wanted that understood in case Jacqueline had forgotten her previous reaction to Ms. Desiree.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Tammie Lee said in a whisper. \u201cJacqueline wanted me to make an appointment with Desiree. So I did, shortly after Paul and I were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come out looking like one of the Brady Bunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a silly grin, \u201cI looked more like Don King. Every time Paul saw me, he laughed. I thought I\u2019d die of pure mortification.\u201d</p><p>Their order was ready, and they found a table in the middle of the seating area.</p><p>\u201cTell me about you and Paul,\u201d Alix said as she unwrapped her cheeseburger.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix.\u201d Tammie Lee gave a breathy sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start. I never thought I\u2019d leave Louisiana, but it\u2019s amazing what a woman will do for love.\u201d Her expression was dreamy. \u201cI discovered it didn\u2019t matter where I lived, as long as I could be with Paul. The heart takes on a will of its own, if you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Alix did understand. The fact that she was in this mall was proof of that.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t object, I\u2019ll do your hair for you,\u201d Tammie Lee offered.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not have all the training Desiree does, but I\u2019m fairly good. All my friends let me do their hair for proms and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>When Tammie Lee drove back to the house, Paul had returned from the golf course. He sat in front of the television with an empty plate in his lap and a milk glass on the end table.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tam,\u201d he said and smiled at Alix. He jumped up from his chair and took the packages from Tammie Lee\u2019s hands, kissing his wife on the cheek. \u201cHow\u2019d the shopping go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. This is Alix, your mother\u2019s friend and now mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Alix.\u201d Paul gave her the once-over, as if he wasn\u2019t sure she was for real. \u201cYou and my mother are friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we met in the knitting class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI remember....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do Alix\u2019s hair. She\u2019s got a hot date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d His attention had already drifted back to the baseball game.</p><p>Tammie Lee was as good as her word. By the time she\u2019d finished, Alix felt like a candidate for Homecoming Queen. Staring at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, Alix had to blink in order to believe the image was her own.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Tammie Lee asked.</p><p>\u201cI...you made me pretty.\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee slowly shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re already lovely, Alix, but I have a feeling your Jordan knows that.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did a little flip-flop at the way Tammie Lee said your Jordan, as if it was understood that the two of them were a couple.</p><p>Before long, Jacqueline arrived to give Alix her nod of approval. While Alix suspected she fell far short of the designer dress and fancy hairdo her friend would\u2019ve preferred, she seemed to pass muster. Tammie Lee hadn\u2019t used anything more than a curling iron and mousse, but she\u2019d managed to arrange Alix\u2019s plain straight hair in a natural wavy style that suited her better than anything she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>After a moment, Jacqueline smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Jordan will like it?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline laughed delightedly. \u201cMy dear, he\u2019s in for a real surprise.\u201d</p><p>That evening while she waited for Jordan to pick her up at the apartment, Alix nervously paced the living room.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop pacing,\u201d Laurel snapped. She was parked in front of the television with a pint of cookie-dough ice cream, which she ate directly from the container.</p><p>The knock on the door nearly sent Alix into a panic. She closed her eyes and although she wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d prayed a lot in recent years, she found a prayer on her lips now. More than anything, she wanted Jordan to see her as beautiful.</p><p>Holding her breath, she opened the door.</p><p>Jordan stood there holding a wrist corsage in a clear plastic box. His eyes widened as he stood staring at her.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWow, Alix, is that really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Holding back a smile would have been impossible. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said and handed her the corsage.</p><p>This was the first time in her life anyone had given her flowers and nothing in the world could have pleased her more.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>\u201cWhether I am knitting for myself or someone else, my passion for knitting enables me to express my creativity and produces a feeling of accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Rita E. Greenfeder, Editor, Knit \u2019N Style Magazine</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>M argaret decided to go with me to the meeting with Dr. Wilson at his office. He had all the test results and medical reports back now, and there seemed to be some confusion about the diagnosis.</p><p>Notoriously closemouthed, he did mention casually when I was released from the hospital that he\u2019d asked a colleague to review the biopsy. That news, I suspect, was meant to encourage me. But in my heart, I knew the tumor was cancerous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a pessimist,\u201d Margaret mumbled as we sat in the waiting area. It was the last appointment of the day, another sure sign of my prognosis, but I didn\u2019t say any of this to Margaret.</p><p>Instead I leaned back and closed my eyes, wanting to block out the world. It was easy for my sister to suggest optimism. This wasn\u2019t her life, her illness, her impending death. I couldn\u2019t help wondering what her thoughts would\u2019ve been had our situations been reversed. I bit back the words to remind her that she\u2019d come running to me with her own recent scare. I was in that kind of mood right now. I could hardly keep from lashing out at the world and everyone close to me. The person who\u2019d received the brunt of my anger, sadly, was Brad, and he was the last person who deserved it. But I refused to dwell on him or the regrets I felt whenever he crossed my mind. I\u2019d done what I had for his own good. He would never know what it had cost me to send him away; I would carry the weight of that for the rest of my life, however short that might be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mother was another one I\u2019d strived to protect. Margaret had, too. So far, we\u2019d kept Mom in the dark. We\u2019d concocted a story about my hospital visit having to do with a routine check-up. My mother had been all too willing to accept the lie.</p><p>Long before I was ready to confront the inevitable, Peggy came into the waiting area. This time she wasn\u2019t holding that monstrosity of a medical file in her arms. \u201cDr. Wilson will see you now,\u201d she announced.</p><p>I didn\u2019t meet her eyes, although I heard hope and encouragement in her voice. I considered Peggy a friend, but that friendship wasn\u2019t exclusive. She was wonderful to all of Dr. Wilson\u2019s patients. I realized how difficult this must be for her, too. So often, she had to silently stand by and watch Dr. Wilson\u2019s patients lose their battles with cancer. It wasn\u2019t a position I envied.</p><p>Margaret was on her feet before I\u2019d managed to put my magazine down and pick up my purse. I was certainly in no hurry to have my deepest fears confirmed.</p> <p>Peggy led us into Dr. Wilson\u2019s private office. His framed degrees lined the walls; he displayed a few family photos, which were artfully arranged on a credenza. The mahogany desk was polished and uncluttered, with my file set to one side. I\u2019d been in his private office twice before, and each time I\u2019d been devastated by his news. I didn\u2019t expect anything different this go-round.</p><p>Dr. Wilson wasn\u2019t in the room when we arrived, but he walked in directly behind us. My sister shook hands with him after a murmured introduction.</p><p>Dr. Wilson rolled out his big, high-back leather chair and sat down. He reached for my file, which he brought to the center of the table. He paused and then....</p><p>\u201cThe cancer is back.\u201d I didn\u2019t make it a question. The tumor was gone, but I was sure there\u2019d be more, growing in areas not as accessible as this one had been.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Margaret asked and to my surprise her voice quavered slightly.</p> <p>So often in our lives, I\u2019ve wanted to prove to Margaret that I was right and she was wrong. Call it sibling rivalry. This time, however, I\u2019d have given anything to be wrong.</p><p>As I\u2019d said earlier, there was nothing to be optimistic about. The disease refused to leave my body. I opened my mouth to announce that I\u2019d refuse treatment. I had neither the will nor the strength to face a third battle. Not without my father.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your history,\u201d Dr. Wilson began, \u201cI felt it was doubly important to be certain before I made a prognosis. I had the biopsy sent to the top brain cancer specialist in the country.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath almost afraid to hope, certain the news would devastate me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Margaret asked, slipping closer to the edge of her seat.</p><p>\u201cShe agrees with me. The tumor was benign.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBenign,\u201d I repeated, wanting to be sure I\u2019d heard him correctly. The tumor was benign.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dr. Wilson smiled at me but I was too shocked to react. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right this time, Lydia. You\u2019re cancer-free.\u201d He stood up and walked over to an X-ray display panel on his wall. He removed two X-rays from inside an envelope and clipped them onto the lit panel. Taking out his pen, he pointed to the film. \u201cThis is the first X-ray we took and this is the one following the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I won\u2019t need radiation or chemotherapy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo reason for it.\u201d</p><p>I sat up straighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good news, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I was too numb to agree with him or even nod. Dr. Wilson\u2019s voice faded as the realization slowly came. My life had been given back to me.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure when I rose to my feet but suddenly I was standing. I covered my mouth and feared I was about to embarrass myself by bursting into tears. I noticed, to my astonishment, that Margaret was weeping. She rose and hugged me and started sobbing louder.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d she kept repeating. \u201cOh, Lydia, you\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Wilson was explaining a new medication he\u2019d prescribed for me and the side effects, but nothing he said made sense just then. I was too happy to care.</p><p>Margaret and I both went from open weeping to ridiculous amusement, and our reactions were almost perfectly synchronized. Our giggles must have sounded hysterical. Margaret placed the tips of her fingers against her lips and refused to look at me. She made an effort to focus on what Dr. Wilson was trying to explain. None of it mattered. All I knew was that I had my life back. My beautiful, wonderful life was my own once again.</p><p>Not until we were outside the office did I think about Brad. \u201cMargaret,\u201d I said, gripping my sister by the arm as the happiness drained out of me. We stood in front of the elevator. Margaret must have heard the distress in my voice because her smile faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad...I was so cruel to him when all he wanted to do was help.\u201d</p><p>Margaret was obviously struggling not to scream I told you so at me, but all she said was, \u201cTalk to him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d missed Brad dreadfully and I longed to call him, but I couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d attempted to visit me twice more while I was hospitalized, but I\u2019d refused to see him. He\u2019d asked the nurse to deliver a letter to me. I knew if I read it he\u2019d change my mind, so I\u2019d asked her to take it away, sight unseen.</p><p>Later the nurse returned and told me Brad had been waiting for a reply and she\u2019d been forced to tell him I wouldn\u2019t read his letter. Now it all seemed melodramatic and senseless. I might well have ruined the most promising relationship of my life.</p><p>\u201cI can try to talk to Brad, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll listen.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame him if he never wanted to see me again. My one hope was that he couldn\u2019t very well ignore me when he made deliveries to my store.</p><p>Bright and early Tuesday morning, I was back in business. I can\u2019t even begin to explain the thrill it gave me to walk into my shop and turn the CLOSED sign to read OPEN. Even the noise from the construction across the street couldn\u2019t dampen my good mood.</p><p>Reality intruded with a list of instructions from Dr. Wilson. I was apparently a good candidate for this new drug treatment to prevent the growth of future tumors.</p><p>My morning was constantly busy as customers streamed into the store, all with questions as to why I\u2019d been away for most of a week. It turns out that many of them had learned I was back\u2014one person phoned another who called a third, and so forth. I can\u2019t even describe how gratifying that was. Margaret had done her best to be helpful, keeping the store open for part of every day, but my customers were accustomed to dealing with me.</p><p>Margaret seemed to have enjoyed working at the store. As little as three months ago, I couldn\u2019t have imagined thinking warmly of my older sister. I was deeply appreciative of everything she\u2019d done for me.</p><p>At noon, when I had my first lull of the day, I glanced anxiously out the shop windows, hoping for a glimpse of Brad. When the big brown truck rolled to a stop in front of the floral shop, I nearly raced out the door. But the UPS driver wasn\u2019t Brad.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Brad?\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>The replacement glanced over his shoulder at the abruptness of my question. \u201cBrad is no longer on this route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s no longer on this route?\u201d I demanded. It felt as if the sidewalk had started to buckle beneath my feet. I couldn\u2019t believe Brad would do anything as drastic as this.</p><p>\u201cBrad\u2019s delivering in the downtown area now.\u201d</p><p>I knew what had happened. \u201cHe requested a transfer, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The UPS driver shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever see him?\u201d I asked, hoping to use the other man to relay a message.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d He was preoccupied, and I was clearly detaining him, so I returned to my store, my steps dragging.</p><p>I knew that what I\u2019d done to Brad was wrong. I\u2019d badly hurt the one person who\u2019d proved himself to me over and over. All I could do was hope it wasn\u2019t too late to make amends.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>\u201cJ acqueline.\u201d</p><p>Her name seemed to come from far away.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline.\u201d It was louder this time and she recognized Reese\u2019s voice. Her eyes flew open and she stared up in the darkness to find her husband standing over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, rubbing her eyes. Something drastic must have happened for Reese to enter her bedroom in the middle of the night</p><p>\u201cPaul just phoned\u2014Tammie Lee\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did a baby ever decide to arrive at a decent hour?\u201d</p><p>He obviously didn\u2019t expect a response and she didn\u2019t give him one. \u201cWhat did Paul say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that he\u2019s been at the hospital since ten.\u201d</p><p>A quick glance at her clock told her it was nearly five.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s close to delivery,\u201d her husband finished.</p><p>Jacqueline didn\u2019t hesitate. She tossed aside the comforter and automatically reached for her robe.</p><p>\u201cYou actually want to go to the hospital?\u201d Reese sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He could do as he damn well pleased and, as a matter of fact, had for the last twelve years of their marriage. But nothing he said would keep her away from the birth of her granddaughter. Already Jacqueline had thrust her feet into her slippers and started toward her bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, too,\u201d Reese announced as if he anticipated an argument.</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her petulant remark. \u201cDon\u2019t take long,\u201d he warned. \u201cFrom what Paul said, it could be any time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in ten minutes.\u201d In the best of circumstances, that was a stretch, but Jacqueline was determined to keep her word. Exactly thirteen minutes later, she met Reese who sat in the car waiting. He had the garage door open and the engine running, ready to go.</p><p>They were silent on the ride to the hospital and Jacqueline wondered if his thoughts were the same as hers. It\u2019d been on a night such as this that he\u2019d rushed her to the hospital to deliver Paul. Her water had broken in the middle of the night and in a panic, fearing any movement might endanger the baby, she\u2019d clung to Reese. Her one concern was to keep the cord from tangling around the baby\u2019s neck.</p><p>In true heroic fashion, Reese had swept her into his arms, carried her to the car and driven to the hospital. Fortunately, there was virtually no traffic, since he took the corners at a speed any racecar driver might have envied. Then her hero had carried her into the hospital waiting area. Reese had stayed with her until Paul entered the world. Closing her eyes, she could still hear her son\u2019s first high-pitched wail. At the time, it had been the most glorious sound she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>When they arrived at the hospital, they parked quickly. Together, walking side by side, they hurried into the lobby and were directed to the birthing center on the fifth floor.</p><p>At the reception desk, Reese gave their names to the nurse, who suggested they take a seat in the waiting room. While Jacqueline sorted through the magazines, Reese went to see if he could round them up a cup of coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He returned five minutes later with two steaming cups. \u201cIt came out of a machine,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>At this point, Jacqueline didn\u2019t care as long as it was hot and contained caffeine.</p><p>They sat two chairs apart in the deserted room and sipped their tasteless coffee. Half an hour and three magazines later, Paul appeared, wearing a light-blue hospital gown. He looked tired, but his eyes smiled when he saw them.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee\u2019s doing just great,\u201d he told them. \u201cThe baby should be here within the hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in for the actual birth?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jacqueline shook her head. This was a private moment between her son and his wife, and she didn\u2019t want to intrude. Not to mention that births were messy...</p><p>\u201cOf course. If you want,\u201d Paul said, his expression filled with excitement. \u201cTammie Lee said you were welcome to be there, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d seen her son so happy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather wait here, but you will let me know as soon as the baby\u2019s born, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and Dad will be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>Paul returned to Tammie Lee then, and it was just Jacqueline and Reese again. They ignored each other, sipping their coffee and thumbing through old magazines.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the night Paul was born?\u201d Reese asked her unexpectedly.</p><p>Jacqueline laughed. \u201cI remember it like it was yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so proud of you that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor giving you a son, you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...well, yes, I was happy to have a son, but I would\u2019ve been equally pleased with a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was, you impressed me with your courage and determination.\u201d</p><p>He sounded unaccountably serious, but Jacqueline had difficulty believing he\u2019d ever been \u201cimpressed\u201d with her. It struck her as an odd word to use.</p><p>\u201cI remember how the other women in the labor room moaned and carried on and asked for drugs, but not you. Not my Jacquie.\u201d</p><p>Dignified even in the face of unyielding labor pains\u2014that was her, all right. Jacqueline knew he intended it as a compliment and sent him a brief smile. \u201cDespite the pain, it was one of the best nights of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Paul.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline lowered her gaze. \u201cActually, no. Because of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d He gave a clipped laugh, as if he didn\u2019t quite believe her, either. She wondered when they\u2019d started to doubt each other and then she knew. It had been about the time he\u2019d begun his affair.</p><p>\u201cAs we were driving here I was remembering the night Paul was born.\u201d</p><p>Reese nodded. \u201cI was thinking about that myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you recall the way you carried me to the car? It was such a...swashbuckling thing to do. I wasn\u2019t exactly a lightweight at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hero,\u201d Reese teased.</p><p>Sadness seemed to weigh her down. \u201cYou were my hero,\u201d she whispered and to cover up how wretched she felt, she sipped the last of her coffee.</p><p>\u201cBut no more,\u201d Reese murmured.</p><p>Her lack of response was as clear as agreement would have been. She looked away, struggling with her composure. A part of her wanted to ask why he found her so lacking that he\u2019d turned to another woman, but the pain of it was too great. She feared that whatever he might tell her would hurt even more than knowing he was with someone else.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything or glance in her direction.</p><p>It occurred to her then, sitting in this hospital waiting room with Reese, that perhaps this was the very moment she should say something. Perhaps she should offer an overture, try to bridge this gap between them. She\u2019d loved Reese so much at one time. Oh damn, she might as well admit it: despite everything, she still loved him. Seeing the love Paul and Tammie Lee shared was almost painful for her because she recognized how much she\u2019d lost. To outward appearances she lived a wonderful life. She didn\u2019t need to worry about money, she had a lovely house, her friends were plentiful. Nevertheless, she was miserable and lonely.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Reese said when the distinct sound of a baby\u2019s cry traveled down the hallway.</p><p>Startled, they stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s her?\u201d Jacqueline asked, surging to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Reese was standing now, too.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should ask the nurse?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Reese took her by the elbow and they walked to the nurses\u2019 station.</p><p>\u201cWe just heard an infant cry,\u201d Reese told the woman, giving her their names.</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering if that could possibly be our granddaughter,\u201d Jacqueline added, keeping her voice hushed so she wouldn\u2019t disturb others.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check for you,\u201d she said, and disappeared into one of the birthing rooms. She was gone only a few moments; when she returned, she carried two light-blue gowns. \u201cPut these on, and you can join your family.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline didn\u2019t hesitate and neither did Reese. When they were ready, the woman led them into the birthing room. This was nothing like the room where Jacqueline had delivered Paul all those years ago. Sofa, chairs, television and even a large swirling bathtub. Goodness, if she hadn\u2019t known better, Jacqueline would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d walked into a hotel suite.</p><p>Tammie Lee was in bed, smiling over at Paul who held their baby girl. Her daughter-in-law\u2019s face was red, her hair matted with sweat, and tears glistened in her eyes, but she\u2019d never looked lovelier, Jacqueline thought.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad,\u201d Paul said, gently cradling the bundled infant in his arms. \u201cThis is Amelia Jacqueline Donovan.\u201d</p><p>All at once it felt as if Jacqueline\u2019s heart had stopped beating. She blinked back unexpected tears. \u201cYou named her after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia was my grandmother\u2019s name and we chose Jacqueline because we both love you,\u201d Tammie Lee said.</p><p>The tears rolled unrestrained down Jacqueline\u2019s cheeks as she gazed down on this precious child named in her honor.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hold your granddaughter, Mom?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Jacqueline nodded as silent tears of joy burned her face. Her son placed the baby in her arms. Unusual though it seemed, Jacqueline was sure little Amelia opened her eyes and looked directly up at her. Invisible threads linked their hearts and in that moment, she knew she was going to love this child more than life itself. She smiled at Tammie Lee through her tears. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said hoarsely. Then she glanced at Reese and noticed he had tears in his eyes, too.</p><p>Very gently, her husband bent down and kissed Amelia\u2019s forehead. After a brief pause, he kissed Jacqueline\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNow you have the daughter you always wanted,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Not until much later in the day, after Jacqueline had bought out the baby sections at three department stores, did she realize what her husband had really been saying.</p><p>Reese hadn\u2019t been talking about Amelia. He\u2019d meant Tammie Lee.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>\u201cY ou like Jordan, don\u2019t you?\u201d Laurel asked Alix early Wednesday morning. Alix was getting ready for work.</p><p>Like Jordan? That was an understatement if ever there was one. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and then shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d Quickly her suspicions rose. \u201cDo you know a reason I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you asking?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.... I guess I\u2019m hoping you learned from my mistake. You tried to tell me John was no good, but I wouldn\u2019t listen and now look at me,\u201d she muttered, her bitterness so intense it soured her words.</p><p>As for looking at Laurel, all Alix could see was a grossly overweight girl with stringy blond hair who sat on her ass in front of the TV most days. But as long as Laurel made her share of the rent payment, Alix didn\u2019t care how she spent her days. She\u2019d quit two jobs, the video store and the day care center, and was currently working at a dry cleaner. She hadn\u2019t lasted a month at the day care center and said she\u2019d hated it.</p><p>\u201cWhen you and Jordan went out on that fancy dinner date, what did you talk about?\u201d her roommate pressed.</p><p>Laurel had certainly taken an interest in Jordan all of a sudden. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she returned flippantly. \u201cStuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy all the interest?\u201d Alix was surprised she was even having a conversation with her roommate, but she wasn\u2019t really comfortable with the subject.</p><p>\u201cI mean, what do you talk about with a minister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYouth minister,\u201d she corrected. \u201cI knew him when we were in grade school, you know. He\u2019s just like everyone else.\u201d More than once he\u2019d proven he was human\u2014in temperament and in the easy passion that flared between them. So far, everything had been kept under control, but Alix knew she tempted him as much as he tempted her. Jordan might work for the church, but he was very much a man.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you talked about, okay?\u201d Laurel insisted. She seemed close to tears. Alix couldn\u2019t imagine why this was so important.</p><p>\u201cI told him I wanted to be a chef one day or have my own catering company. We talked about me getting into a good cooking school\u2014not that it\u2019s ever likely.\u201d That was only a small part of their conversation. Jordan had a gift for drawing people out and making them feel as if they were the center of the universe.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be a chef?\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. This shouldn\u2019t be any newsflash to Laurel who\u2019d lived with her for the past year. Any real cooking had been done by her; Laurel had specialized in stocking the kitchen with ice cream, toaster waffles and potato chips. But then Alix realized they\u2019d never taken the time to be more than roommates. Until recently, she\u2019d never really confided her hopes and dreams in Laurel\u2014or in anyone, she supposed. Alix had few friends, although she felt a connection with the women in her knitting class.</p><p>Ever since her breakup with the used-car salesman, Laurel had spent most of her time alone. Her self-pity had quickly irritated Alix. She didn\u2019t consider the relationship any big loss, but apparently Laurel thought otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know about your mother?\u201d Laurel asked next.</p><p>The fact that her mother was currently serving time in the Women\u2019s Correctional Center at Purdy wasn\u2019t a fact Alix willingly broadcast. \u201cI told him.\u201d There was little Jordan didn\u2019t know about her. She didn\u2019t want any unpleasant surprises in their relationship. He knew her mother had gone to prison for the attempted murder of Alix\u2019s father, too.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Alix found all these questions mildly annoying, but Laurel had been so moody lately that she wanted to encourage her to continue chatting.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d That question took some real soul-searching, but she was determined to be honest. If she was, then maybe Laurel would be honest with her. \u201cI suppose I do. I don\u2019t have any contact with her because when she writes, all she wants from me is money or cigarettes. She never asks about me or shows any interest in my life. I don\u2019t need her.\u201d She said this in a casual way, as if it was well understood that she didn\u2019t need anyone. \u201cMy only worry is that one day I\u2019ll end up just like her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Laurel said with complete confidence. \u201cYou\u2019re too strong for that.\u201d</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t see herself as strong, but it pleased her that Laurel thought so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never let anyone hurt you or use you the way John used me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGet over him,\u201d Alix said for the thousandth time. She couldn\u2019t understand why Laurel had clung to a man who\u2019d treated her so abominably. It didn\u2019t make sense, especially when she hadn\u2019t seen any sign of him in months.</p> <p>Laurel looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out more,\u201d Alix told her.</p><p>Her roommate sighed unhappily. \u201cI don\u2019t like anyone to see me when I\u2019m so fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound easy, but it isn\u2019t, you know. It\u2019s hard to stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen take a walk every day. Walk instead of taking the bus. You\u2019ll be surprised at how quickly the fat will melt away with a little exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you know anything about needing to lose weight! You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Alix hadn\u2019t realized her roommate had such a high opinion of her figure, but she was far from having a perfect body.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll marry Jordan?\u201d</p><p>Alix brushed aside the question with a short, humorless laugh. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d She grabbed her purse on the way to the door, but hesitated after twisting the knob. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll get out today. It doesn\u2019t do any good to sit around here and mope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>Alix had just stepped out when Laurel stopped her. \u201cAlix, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>The question had apparently caught Laurel off guard. \u201cFor being my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>It seemed odd for Laurel to thank her, but Alix let the comment slide as she headed for the video store. Without Laurel there to keep her company, the days dragged. She felt guilty now that she hadn\u2019t talked to her roommate lately. In her own estimation, Alix hadn\u2019t been a good friend, but then Laurel had been pretty unpleasant, so she\u2019d avoided her as much as possible. Any time Alix had tried to talk to her, which wasn\u2019t often, Laurel had put her off. Her roommate\u2019s one solace seemed to be ice cream. Alix considered her weak-willed, but now she saw how easy it was to judge. That morning\u2019s conversation was the first they\u2019d had in weeks, and she was feeling more sympathetic toward her.</p><p>During her lunch break, Alix returned to the apartment, hoping to coax Laurel out. Maybe Laurel would be inclined to exercise if Alix offered to walk with her. To her surprise, Laurel wasn\u2019t there. She didn\u2019t keep tabs on Laurel\u2019s work schedule, and her hours seemed to change from week to week. Either Laurel was at work right now or she\u2019d taken Alix\u2019s advice.</p><p>On the off-chance that Laurel was out walking, Alix started down Blossom Street, hoping to run into her. When she did find Laurel, however, she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Jordan was with her.</p> <p>They sat on a park bench in a shady area of the church grounds. Their heads were close together and they seemed engrossed in conversation.</p><p>Alix\u2019s initial reaction was anger, followed by a surge of jealousy. All those questions about Jordan had been a way of finding out about him so she could steal him away. Alix was half-tempted to march over and let it be known that she didn\u2019t appreciate her roommate butting in on her boyfriend. This was what she got for sympathizing with Laurel, for making an effort to help her.</p><p>Then she watched as her roommate broke into tears, buried her face in her hands and hunched forward. Jordan placed his hand on her back, and although Alix was too far away to hear, it looked like he was praying with her.</p><p>This was one of the qualities she loved about Jordan. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything she couldn\u2019t tell him. He genuinely cared for people and longed to comfort them. She had no right to be jealous. Nor did she have a single reason to doubt Jordan. Not once had he misled her or abused their friendship.</p><p>They\u2019d talked about the meaning of trust and after the incident with the pastor\u2019s daughter, he\u2019d asked her to trust him. It\u2019d been easy to assure him she did\u2014but at the time he wasn\u2019t touching her roommate. Determined to put her promise into action, she turned away and went back to work.</p><p>Just before closing, Jordan came to the video store. \u201cHow about a coffee when you\u2019re through?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help the burst of happiness she felt.</p><p>He suggested they meet at Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and she agreed. He was in a booth, with two cups of coffee waiting by the time Alix joined him.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. How about yours?\u201d She gave him a sharp look, despite everything she\u2019d promised herself earlier. If he\u2019d been talking to Laurel, she wanted to know why.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cDo you have something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d She tried to make a joke of it, then decided that wasn\u2019t fair. Holding her mug with both hands, she stared down at the steaming coffee. \u201cI saw you and Laurel earlier.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t offer an explanation. \u201cThat bothers you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt did at first, but then I thought...well, that\u2019s your business, not mine. I don\u2019t have any hold on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only partially right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and raised it to his lips. His mouth gently grazed the inside of her palm. \u201cYou have a very strong hold on my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d From any other man it would have sounded corny, but not Jordan. \u201cAre you going to tell me what you and Laurel were talking about?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then shook his head. \u201cNo. Are you going to trust me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him hard and long. Every instinct demanded that she find out what she could. Yet at the same time, she longed to believe him. Finally, with a smile, she nodded.</p><p>She hoped it was the right decision. Because a betrayal by Jordan would hurt more than any other betrayal she\u2019d suffered in her whole life.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>C arol stood in the doorway of what would\u2019ve been the baby\u2019s nursery, and her eyes fell on the empty crib with the mobile dangling above it. Tiny zoo animals hung from a small umbrella with a music box attachment. She didn\u2019t know why she was torturing herself like this. Nothing was going to change.</p><p>Doug came and stood behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll call and arrange for the department store to pick up the furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...don\u2019t. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made an appointment with an adoption agency.\u201d She said the words in a rush, as if to convince him that this was the logical next step.</p><p>She felt Doug tense.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give up now,\u201d she implored. She couldn\u2019t forget her need for a child. She\u2019d tried. She\u2019d had to accept the fact that there would be no biological child for her, but she couldn\u2019t entirely let go of their dream. \u201cI want so badly to be a mother. I need to be a mother. Just like you need to be a father...\u201d</p><p>Doug\u2019s shoulders sagged and he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cI have to do this,\u201d she pleaded. They\u2019d discussed adoption any number of times, but always as a last resort. Carol had held on to this last thread of hope, and yet she\u2019d feared Doug\u2019s reaction. He\u2019d been so quiet lately; she could feel him withdrawing from her emotionally and she couldn\u2019t endure it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you want me to go to an adoption agency with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course! It\u2019s important that we prove we\u2019re good candidates as adoptive parents.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s mouth thinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think having a crib and a change table is going to sway an agency to choose us as potential parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it can\u2019t hurt. I want the agency to see that we\u2019re ready, and that we could take a baby at any time.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, walked into the living room, and stood in front of the large picture window that overlooked Puget Sound.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to the interview?\u201d Carol asked as she joined her husband. They stood side by side without touching. Like Doug, she kept her gaze trained on the waterfront.</p><p>\u201cHow much is this going to cost?\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t have an answer for him. The initial interview required a five-hundred-dollar deposit and as for the actual adoption, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cIt costs as much as it costs,\u201d she said. Whatever it was, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cDo you have any idea how much we\u2019ve already invested in this quest for a child?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t and furthermore it didn\u2019t matter. As far as she was concerned, money was of little consequence. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit,\u201d Doug said starkly, \u201cand frankly I\u2019ve reached it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to work if that\u2019s what you want. The only reason I didn\u2019t suggest it earlier is because I thought the adoption agency would prefer a stay-at-home mother, and that might put us closer to the top of the list. But I\u2019ll go back to work if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>Doug turned to face her. \u201cThis is exactly what I mean,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer a couple. Everything we do revolves around a baby. We used to laugh together, go out, have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still do,\u201d she countered, but when she searched her memory, she realized he was right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been as patient with this whole process as I can stand.\u201d Anger vibrated from him. \u201cIt costs too damn much and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, money is all you\u2019re worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d allow me to finish,\u201d he said slowly, enunciating each word, \u201cyou\u2019d have heard me say that the emotional price is too damn high.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t stand seeing you go through this pain and turmoil when the procedures don\u2019t even work\u2014injections five times a day, seeing the doctor every forty-eight hours.... It\u2019s taken over your life. Our lives.\u201d</p><p>She agreed the toll on their emotions, especially in the last few months, had been extreme. One day she was filled with despair and the next, riding a wave of hope and optimism. That was when she\u2019d assumed Rick\u2019s baby might be available to them. The only avenue left open to them now was adoption. They had to try. Doug couldn\u2019t mean they should stop!</p><p>\u201cNow you want to drag us through yet another emotional quagmire and, Carol, as much as I love you, I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy is it always about you and your need for a baby?\u201d</p><p>In all the years of their marriage she\u2019d never heard Doug use this tone of voice with her. \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot more than five minutes ago, you admitted the baby was for you. It\u2019s all about your need to be a mother. You, you, you. What about me, Carol? What about my needs? What about my wants?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last...dear God, how many years has it been?

He couldn\u2019t be. He was emotionally drained. She understood, because she\u2019d hit bottom herself, but she\u2019d recovered and Doug would, too, given time.</p><p>\u201cI do mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you just told me we could go to the appointment with the agency.\u201d Carol was counting on that.</p><p>\u201cYou go. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I can already see what it\u2019s doing to you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never known Doug to be so unreasonable. \u201cWhat exactly is it doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to prove to complete strangers that we\u2019re worthy of being parents. I feel like a beggar singing and dancing, cap in hand. All so someone I don\u2019t even know will like me enough to consider me father material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a wonderful father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould have been,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>His words scored deep wounds in her heart. Would have been.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore, Carol. I\u2019m not the man you think I am. I want out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want out of the marriage?\u201d she asked through numb lips, hardly able to say the words.</p><p>\u201cNo. I vowed to love you and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound as if this is some promise you made and regret,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cWould you have married me if you\u2019d known I couldn\u2019t have children?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was just long enough to supply the answer.</p><p>Her pain was so intense that for one unbelievable moment the room went dark and she started to sway.</p><p>Doug\u2019s arms came around her, and he buried his face in her shoulder. \u201cI was crazy in love with you when we got married and I\u2019m just as crazy in love with you now. I want us to stay married, but I can\u2019t live like this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t have a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know and I accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d He might be saying it, but deep down he\u2019d always resent the fact that she couldn\u2019t give him children.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said sharply, \u201cbut I need you to accept it, too. Let go of this, Carol. Accept the fact that we just weren\u2019t meant to be parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could be someday. If we put our name in with the agency, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what? Three, four, five years from now\u2014if we\u2019re fortunate\u2014we might be chosen as worthy recipients of an infant? Do you realize I\u2019ll be forty-four in five years\u2019 time? I\u2019d be sixty-two when our child graduated from high school.\u201d</p><p>Carol hid her face against her husband\u2019s chest. Her emotions reeled with the impact of what he\u2019d said. Doug was right. It was time to surrender this need. She\u2019d never been a quitter, didn\u2019t know how to give up. Everything she\u2019d ever set her mind to, she\u2019d accomplished. Except for this...Her effort to have a child had become the focus of her life; more than that, it had become the purpose of her life. Her clenched-teeth determination was ruining their marriage.</p><p>Doug released her and walked away. Carol stood frozen and miserable, shaking with a combination of too many emotions, but mostly defeat.</p><p>The front door opened and she whirled around. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut. I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d Her eyes begged him not to leave her, but she refused to ask him to stay.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned back, hands to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe both need to think this through, Carol.\u201d</p><p>She nodded silently. The choice was clear. Either she renounced this need or she ruined her marriage and both their lives in the process.</p><p>It was nightfall before Doug returned. Carol sat in the darkened living room, curled up tight on the sofa with her arms circling her knees.</p><p>Doug came slowly into the room. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t yet, but in time she\u2019d adjust. \u201cI cancelled the appointment with the adoption agency.\u201d</p><p>He thrust his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou can deal with that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She had to accept that there would be no baby.</p><p>Doug sat down across from her and leaned forward, bracing his arms against his knees. His shoulders drooped.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor three hours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you want anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI phoned Bon-Macy\u2019s. They\u2019re coming to collect the baby furniture next week.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at the carpet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d Sorrier than he\u2019d ever know.</p><p>Doug extended his arm to her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered as her fingers clasped his. It was true. It would be true.</p><p>It had to be true.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>\u201cKnitting is a haven, a safe place where one can touch history, dance with art and create a peaceful life.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Nancy Bush, author of Folk Socks</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>A t first I was angry when I didn\u2019t hear from Brad. After all his affirmations about being there for the long haul, he\u2019d walked out on me like every other man in my life, with the exception of my father. A thousand times over, I wished I\u2019d read his letter. Finally I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer\u2014I had to know.</p><p>I turned to my sister for advice; I\u2019d come to rely on her more and more, especially in emotional matters. So on Monday, I called her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Margaret demanded immediately after I\u2019d said hello.</p><p>\u201cAt the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Monday. I thought you took Mondays off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but there are always a million things to do here and well, it\u2019s where I\u2019m most comfortable.\u201d I did all my best thinking with walls of yarn around me. I\u2019d always looked upon skeins of yarn as unfulfilled promises\u2014the way some people, writers or artists, look at a blank page. The potential is there, and it\u2019s up to us to make something with that yarn or write something on that page. It\u2019s the sense of possibility I find so exciting.</p><p>Actually, I gave a lot of thought to that analogy. My relationship with Brad held promise and because of my fears I\u2019d let him go. I didn\u2019t do anything with all those possibilities.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling about Brad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Margaret seems like a mind-reader. \u201cIf you must know...yes. Have you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What makes you think he\u2019d contact me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishful thinking, I suppose.\u201d Even over the telephone line, I could tell my sister was amused by my question.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to call him?\u201d</p><p>The idea had been swirling around inside my head all week. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you calling me?\u201d The gruffness I\u2019d experienced so often with her was back in full force.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMaybe because I was hoping you\u2019d tell me I was doing the right thing and that I wouldn\u2019t make a complete idiot of myself in the process.\u201d</p><p>Margaret hesitated for only a moment. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Hope sprang to life.</p><p>\u201cCall me back once you do, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I had to pause to be sure the warmth in her voice was directed at me. \u201cMargaret.\u201d I swallowed, finding it difficult to continue.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for being so wonderful these last few months.\u201d</p><p>My gratitude must have taken her aback, because she didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. Time seemed to be suspended and then I thought I heard a soft sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to have a sister, you know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have agreed with her more.</p><p>Once I\u2019d determined that the only thing to do was call Brad, I was on a mission. I\u2019d rehearsed several approaches before I dialed his home number later that evening.</p><p>His son answered on the second ring. \u201cHello, Cody,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He sounded unsure as if he didn\u2019t recognize my voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lydia. Remember? We met a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember! You\u2019re the lady who owns the yarn store. You said you were going to knit me a cool sweater with a green-and-yellow dinosaur on it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. \u201cI\u2019ve already started it.\u201d I\u2019d put the project aside when I went into the hospital, but with concentrated effort, I could have it finished by the end of the week. \u201cIs your dad home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. I\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d</p><p>My heart died a hundred deaths in the time it took Brad to pick up the receiver. It must\u2019ve been less than a minute but it seemed closer to an hour before I heard his familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d My mouth was so dry, my tongue refused to cooperate. \u201cIt\u2019s Lydia.\u201d His silence was nearly my undoing, but I forged ahead, simultaneously blessing and cursing Margaret for encouraging this.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cCould we meet and talk?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever it\u2019s convenient for you.\u201d I wanted to shout the sooner, the better, but it depended on his schedule and not mine.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll let you know when I can arrange it.\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to say something else and when he didn\u2019t, I had no choice but to end the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d The line went dead and I was left standing with the receiver in my hand and the dial tone in my ear.</p><p>This was much worse than I\u2019d imagined. I\u2019d secretly hoped that once Brad heard the sound of my voice, he\u2019d be so pleased that whatever pain I\u2019d caused him would evaporate. How foolish I\u2019d been not to consider his feelings.</p><p>Over the years Margaret\u2019s complaint about me had been that I was self-absorbed. I know she resented the fact that Mom and Dad focused their attention on helping me through my ordeals. I\u2019d always believed that her accusations were unfair, based on her own jealousies and insecurities, but now I began to see things differently.</p><p>How cheated she must have felt. Cheated and abandoned. For the first time, I wondered if she could be right about me. I couldn\u2019t have done anything about my cancer, but I could\u2019ve changed my reaction to it. I had the victim mentality down to an art form.</p><p>I remained standing in my kitchen, toying with the idea of calling Margaret again, when the phone rang, startling me. I grabbed the receiver. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can meet you in half an hour at The Pour House.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said as if that should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d The phone clicked as he hung up.</p><p>Within five minutes I\u2019d brushed my hair and dabbed my wrists with a lovely French perfume my dad had given me years ago\u2014the one I saved for my most special occasions. On my way out the door, I grabbed a light sweater.</p> <p>I\u2019d found a corner booth and paid for a pitcher of beer by the time Brad walked into the pub. He glanced around, saw me and then headed toward the booth. He slid in across from me.</p><p>Hard as I tried, I couldn\u2019t stop watching him. All of a sudden, my eyes started to fill with tears. I would die of mortification if he noticed. I did everything but dive head-first into my mug of beer in an effort to hide this ridiculous crying jag.</p><p>Of course he noticed.</p><p>\u201cLydia, are you crying?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and dug frantically in my purse for a tissue. \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d I sobbed, hiccuping in an effort to hold back the tears.</p> <p>\u201cFor crying?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, letting my head bob a time or two more than necessary. \u201cFor everything. I treated you terribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so afraid and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t read my letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I paused long enough to blow my nose. \u201cI couldn\u2019t, because I knew if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep you out of my life. I had to let you go, for your protection and for mine.\u201d</p> <p>Brad lifted the pitcher and refilled my mug. \u201cI prefer to make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d All my excuses sounded hollow and insincere now. \u201cMargaret thinks I\u2019m self-absorbed and she\u2019s right. I\u2019m so sorry, Brad, for...everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to tell me? Why you called and asked me to meet you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. It was what I\u2019d wanted to say, but there were other things, too. My throat seemed to close up, and the silence that fell between us felt utterly unmanageable.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Brad looked up from his beer expectantly. He wasn\u2019t making this easy, but then I didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>\u201cEver since I met you, since we started seeing each other, I\u2019ve been...happy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou could\u2019ve fooled me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know...You see, I\u2019ve realized I have a hard time handling life when everything\u2019s going smoothly. I\u2019m not used to being happy and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. So I do something stupid to mess it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured this out on your own?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMargaret helped.\u201d None too gently, either, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. My relationship with my sister was still complicated, but now I knew she cared about me.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Margaret. Little Ms. Matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right.\u201d It surprised me how defensive I felt toward her.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is\u2014and so are you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled through my tears. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep swallow of beer. \u201cOkay, now that the apology\u2019s out of the way, where does that leave us?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to tell him. \u201cWhere would you like our relationship to go?\u201d My heart was hammering so loudly, it was nearly impossible to hear my own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIn the same direction it was headed until your most recent tests.\u201d His look grew intense as he reached across the table for my hand. \u201cWhat about you, Lydia? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the entire month wiped from my memory and I want us to go back to the way things were before and...and I want us to be close again.\u201d Then, because he should know, I added, \u201cBut it\u2019s important that you understand there are no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister told me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d Then he knew. \u201cAnd you still want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you more than ever, Lydia, but I don\u2019t want you shoving me out of your life because you think I can\u2019t deal with your illness. Let me make that decision for myself.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to give him that control, but I knew he was right. He was asking more of me than he realized.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make you any promises,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I can tell you that I care for you a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a starting point, and where it leads neither of us can know.\u201d He smiled at me with those devilish blue eyes and I understood that Brad Goetz wasn\u2019t going to turn tail and run at the first sign of trouble. He was a man I could trust. A man I could lean on. A man who was my father\u2019s equal in every way.</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN</p><p>J acqueline knew she should give her son and daughter-in-law time alone with Amelia, but she couldn\u2019t make herself stay away. The baby had filled a deep emotional void in her, one she\u2019d ignored for years. But the love that blossomed in her heart refused to be ignored. Whenever she held Amelia, the ties that bound her to her granddaughter seemed to grow stronger, more constant and enduring.</p><p>Amelia was in her arms now as Jacqueline gently rocked her to sleep. She breathed in the baby\u2019s pure scent, and in a rush of nostalgia remembered holding Paul just this way.</p><p>\u201cYou look so peaceful,\u201d Tammie Lee said, coming into the nursery with a new package of disposable diapers. She set them on the dresser and turned to watch Jacqueline with Amelia.</p><p>Jacqueline glanced up. \u201cPeaceful is how I feel.\u201d She supposed she should apologize for dominating so much of Tammie Lee\u2019s time. She\u2019d been over to the house every day since Amelia had come home from the hospital, and some days she visited twice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to make a pest of myself,\u201d Jacqueline murmured, a bit embarrassed at her own behavior.</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Tammie Lee dismissed her concern with a wave of her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to give a baby too much love.\u201d She walked to the dresser and pulled out a new infant\u2019s outfit. \u201cToo many clothes, though\u2014that\u2019s something else. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll ever be able to wear everything you bought her.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline tried to hide her amusement. \u201cI did go a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul says he\u2019s never seen you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea I was going to love her so much.\u201d Jacqueline cringed whenever she thought about her long-held resentment of Tammie Lee, and her anger when she\u2019d first learned about the pregnancy. To her horror, she remembered calling Tammie Lee a \u201cbreeder,\u201d certain she was manipulating Paul. Instead, Jacqueline had finally discovered what everyone else had seen about Tammie Lee from the beginning\u2014she was a genuine and compassionate woman.</p><p>\u201cYou can love her for my mama,\u201d Tammie Lee whispered. \u201cI so wish she was well enough to travel.\u201d</p><p>The idea of sharing Amelia with another grandmother made her feel shockingly possessive, but Jacqueline couldn\u2019t begrudge Tammie Lee\u2019s mother her precious granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cMama already has five granddaughters, though. And three grandsons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bounty of riches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mama says, too. She says she\u2019s the luckiest woman in the world to be blessed with such beautiful, talented grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia\u2019s the most incredible baby in the universe,\u201d Jacqueline insisted. Tammie Lee chuckled, and Jacqueline didn\u2019t bother to explain that she wasn\u2019t joking. This was one special baby to have four sensible adults completely wrapped around her little finger. Denying this child anything was incomprehensible.</p><p>Tammie Lee sat on the end of the bed. \u201cBetween you and Paul, I swear Amelia\u2019s in someone\u2019s arms twenty hours a day.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline smiled as the infant slept contentedly. Her tiny mouth moved in a small sucking motion in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cEven Reese wants to hold her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese has been over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost every day, and he always brings her a gift. It\u2019s so sweet the way you two spoil her. Amelia\u2019s just a week old.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline pinched her lips together at this news about her husband\u2019s visits. She hadn\u2019t known that Reese was regularly dropping by, but then she knew very little about his comings and goings. Resolving not to dwell on it, she glanced at her watch. Five-thirty. Paul would be back from work soon and it was time for her to leave.</p><p>\u201cI should be heading home,\u201d she said reluctantly. The house had never felt emptier than it had in the last few weeks, nor had she experienced such bitter loneliness. Ever since the night Reese had left her so abruptly, claiming a work emergency when she\u2019d known what he was really doing...She refused to imagine Reese with that other woman.</p><p>\u201cIs Reese like his son? Does he like to have dinner precisely an hour after he gets home?\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee asked the question in a joking manner, and that was the way Jacqueline should have responded, but at the moment, her granddaughter in her arms, pretense was beyond her. She\u2019d been living a lie for so long, anyone might think it would be second nature. But she discovered, to her dismay, that she couldn\u2019t do it. It was as if holding this innocent child made anything other than the truth seem wrong.</p><p>\u201cReese doesn\u2019t come home on Tuesday nights,\u201d she said starkly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know. Does he bowl?\u201d</p><p>The question brought a brief smile. Only Tammie Lee would assume that Reese was part of a bowling team. Jacqueline shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>For a long time Jacqueline had disliked the easy way Tammie Lee had slipped into the habit of calling her \u201cMom.\u201d Now it felt like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cHe...has another commitment,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tammie Lee didn\u2019t say anything for at least a minute. Then she did something completely unexpected. She sank down on the carpet next to the rocking chair and put her hand on Jacqueline\u2019s knee. The gesture was simple and comforting, and it touched her deeply.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about my uncle Bubba and my aunt Frieda?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for Jacqueline to answer. \u201cIt seems that Bubba\u2014well, actually, that\u2019s not his name, it\u2019s really Othello, but everybody calls him Bubba. It\u2019s a southern thing. Anyway, he took a fancy to the waitress over at the Eat, Gas &amp; Go off Pecan Avenue. Started hanging out there at all hours of the day.\u201d</p><p>Six months ago, Jacqueline would have stopped her, but after hearing Tammie Lee\u2019s stories, she\u2019d grown accustomed to the folksy wisdom her daughter-in-law freely dispensed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Aunt Frieda got wind of what was happening, and she put up the biggest fuss you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she go after the waitress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Frieda? No way. She tackled my uncle Bubba. She told him she was all the woman he could handle, and if he didn\u2019t believe her, then she\u2019d just have to prove it to him. She told my mama she\u2019d married Bubba and by golly, she wasn\u2019t going to let any waitress lure him away. Next thing I knew, Uncle Bubba was walkin\u2019 around town with a grin as big as a sink hole. Far as I know, he never went near that Eat, Gas &amp; Go again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacqueline was amused by the story but she wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe that making a fuss over Reese would change anything. \u201cMore power to your aunt Frieda,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom,\u201d Tammie Lee said, staring up at her intently. \u201cThe power is yours, too. And you can use it as you wish.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter-in-law\u2019s words still rang in her mind as Jacqueline drove home. She pulled into the garage and entered the dark and silent house. Martha had left a chef\u2019s salad in the refrigerator for her dinner; she sat down at the kitchen table and nibbled at it, but she didn\u2019t have much appetite. The house seemed full of little sounds. Creaks and moans. They only emphasized the emptiness of the place, and she put on some music to distract herself.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she gave up, deciding to have a bath earlier than usual. After her bath, she generally went to bed to read\u2014and to listen for Reese. Some nights she read until the morning hours without hearing him at all. She\u2019d never acknowledged that she waited for him, but tonight the truth was like an intruder standing in the middle of her bedroom.</p> <p>Despite all her husband\u2019s years of infidelity, the pain was almost overwhelming. At this very moment, he was with another woman and she\u2019d allowed his philandering to continue, accepted it as if it were normal. Jacqueline realized she couldn\u2019t pretend any longer. She couldn\u2019t and she wouldn\u2019t!</p><p>Half-undressed, the bathwater running in the tub, she walked into the kitchen, each step filled with righteous indignation. She jerked open a drawer and reached for the country club directory. Tossing it on the kitchen counter, she searched for Allan Anderson\u2019s number. They\u2019d been good friends for years, and he was the best divorce attorney in town. Once he got his hands on this case, her husband would pay dearly for what he\u2019d done to her and to their lives.</p><p>All at once, the virtuous anger left her and she closed the directory, but her hand lingered there.</p><p>Dear God in heaven, what was she thinking? She didn\u2019t want a divorce, she wanted her husband. She wanted Reese!</p><p>Somehow, some way, she\u2019d have to win him back.</p> <p>Slowly now, lost in her thoughts, she walked into the bathroom again and turned off the water. Sitting on the edge of the tub, she pressed her fingers to her temples as she considered what to do.</p><p>The sound of the garage door closing startled her. Jacqueline stood, her heart pounding at a furious pace. It couldn\u2019t possibly be Reese. Not this early. He was rarely home before nine.</p><p>\u201cReese, is that you?\u201d she called out, then silently chastised herself. Who else could it be? A burglar wasn\u2019t likely to announce his arrival.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d her husband called back flatly.</p><p>Slipping on her robe, Jacqueline came out of the bathroom to see her husband standing at the kitchen counter, sorting through the mail. He seemed surprised to see her.</p><p>Where she found the courage, Jacqueline didn\u2019t know, but she stepped boldly forward.</p> <p>Reese casually glanced up. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. I want that understood here and now. I won\u2019t put up with this any longer.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and stared at her. Thankfully he didn\u2019t make a pretense of not knowing what she meant.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He continued to stare, his expression incredulous.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d she went on, \u201cit\u2019s demeaning to me as your wife. I\u2019ve looked the other way for the last time. I won\u2019t do it again. I tried to pretend it doesn\u2019t matter and for a while I managed to convince myself\u2014but it does. It matters very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline kept talking. If she didn\u2019t finish this now, while she had the courage, she might not have another chance. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the kind of wife to issue ultimatums or make demands, but I\u2019m doing it now. Whoever she is, get rid of her. I don\u2019t care what it costs. I want her out of your life and mine.\u201d</p> <p>Reese shook his head, apparently speechless.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow our grandchildren to grow up seeing me treated with that kind of disrespect.\u201d Here she was, having what was possibly the most important discussion of her marriage, while standing barefoot in the middle of her kitchen dressed only in a robe.</p><p>Frowning, Reese went back to sorting the mail.</p><p>Tammie Lee\u2019s story rolled through her mind and Jacqueline dragged in a fortifying breath. Since she\u2019d come this far, she might as well go for broke. \u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d she announced with as much dignity as she could muster.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stepped closer. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there\u2019s a great deal more. I happen to love you, Reese. I don\u2019t know what went wrong between us and...and whatever it was, I share the blame. But I\u2019m lonely, Reese, and I want you back in my bed.\u201d Her voice caught. For one crazy moment, Jacqueline imagined herself as Tammie Lee\u2019s Aunt Frieda. She propped one hand on her hip, jutted out her shoulder and lowered her voice to a husky whisper. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be all the woman you\u2019ll ever need.\u201d</p><p>The look in her husband\u2019s eyes was beyond description as he dropped the mail. \u201cJacquie? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>She laughed in a way she hoped sounded sexy and sensuous. \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it. Come and find out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s mouth sagged, his face so comically eager that she nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cJacquie?\u201d He reached for her then, and when his mouth covered hers, it was with the same openmouthed passion they\u2019d experienced in their twenties. In the later years of their marriage, before he\u2019d moved out of her bedroom, their lovemaking had become staid and controlled. Not now. Reese all but ruined her robe in his eagerness to undress her.</p><p>When they stumbled into the bedroom and fell onto the bed, they were giggling like teenagers. Their lovemaking was explosive, primal, thrilling. The only sounds to be heard were their moans and deep satisfied sighs.</p><p>After they\u2019d finished, Jacqueline lay cradled in her husband\u2019s arms, her eyes moist as she listened to the solid, even beat of Reese\u2019s heart. There was so much that needed to be said, but in the contentment of the moment, none of it seemed important. What mattered was savoring this time, treasuring each other. If nothing else, Jacqueline would have this one night with her husband to remind her that she was very much alive and every inch a woman.</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed,\u201d Reese whispered close to her ear. \u201cI\u2019d given up hope that we\u2019d ever share a bed again. I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you, but I didn\u2019t know how to make things different.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and kissed his bare chest. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else who wants me.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline froze. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He gave a resigned sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak of this only once and then never again. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an affair ten years ago. Which I realize you knew about. It ended quickly and badly. I felt terrible and I still can\u2019t believe I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut every Tuesday night\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cI know. I wanted you to think I was still involved. It was stupid and childish, and I\u2019m embarrassed to admit it, but I was looking for a reaction from you. Something\u2014anything\u2014that showed me you cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I made dinner for you and the phone rang and you left....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you thought, but you were wrong. It was business. We\u2019d blown a transformer. I swear to you there wasn\u2019t another woman that night or any other night in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll these years...\u201d She had trouble taking it in.</p><p>\u201cOnce I started this, I didn\u2019t know how to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both been such fools.\u201d Jacqueline wrapped her arms around his neck and wondered how she\u2019d ever survived outside her husband\u2019s embrace. All this time, the only thing that had stood between them was pride.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over you tonight, but I thank God for it,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank Tammie Lee\u2019s Aunt Frieda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She pressed her head against his shoulder and smiled. Every day, she found more reasons to be grateful to her daughter-in-law. Reese had been right about that. She finally did have her daughter, and even if Tammie Lee happened to speak with a southern drawl, she was as precious to her as any daughter could be to a mother.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix woke to the sound of smothered groans. Leaning up on one elbow, she stared into the darkness, listening intently. Oddly enough, the muffled agony seemed to be coming from the living room. As her eyes adjusted to the dark she noticed something else out of the ordinary. Laurel\u2019s bed, which was across the room from her own, was empty.</p><p>Her roommate had been a real jerk lately. After that one brief episode of friendliness, Laurel had started ignoring her again. They were barely speaking but that was Laurel\u2019s doing, not Alix\u2019s. She\u2019d done her best, tried to maintain a civil relationship. If Laurel said anything to her at all, it was rude or sarcastic.</p><p>Alix hadn\u2019t had any news lately about the fate of the apartment complex, but she suspected they\u2019d be losing their place soon. Well, Alix had a plan. Once she had the means, she\u2019d ditch her so-called friend and find a new roommate. The bogus drug bust last spring had been because of Laurel\u2019s stash, not hers. Nevertheless, Alix had paid the price.</p><p>In the beginning, Laurel had been apologetic and supportive, looking for ways to make it up to her. That had all changed. Most days she avoided Alix and even when she was around, all she did was sit in front of the television and eat. She hadn\u2019t even gone to her job at the drycleaner\u2019s all week.</p><p>Lying down again, Alix tugged the sheet up over her shoulders and closed her eyes, determined to go back to sleep. If Laurel was sick, then it was from all the ice cream she\u2019d been eating. She must\u2019ve gained fifty pounds in the last six months. None of her jeans zipped up and she looked grotesquely fat. Their relationship hadn\u2019t been helped by Laurel making a play for Jordan, either. Alix trusted Jordan, but she wasn\u2019t so sure about Laurel. She\u2019d obviously gone to him hoping for sympathy\u2014and who knew what else?</p><p>Alix never did learn what that was all about. Jordan hadn\u2019t volunteered and she hadn\u2019t asked. When she\u2019d confronted Laurel, her roommate told her to mind her own freakin\u2019 business.</p><p>Alix was determined to blot out the muffled sounds coming from the other room. If Laurel needed her, then she could come and get her. Alix wasn\u2019t about to offer her help.</p><p>Just when Alix was drifting back to sleep, she heard a loud moan, as if Laurel was in horrible pain. Although she wasn\u2019t happy about it, Alix tossed aside her sheet and climbed out of bed.</p><p>The living room was dark, and it took her a minute to locate Laurel, who was prone on the sofa with her head braced against the arm. Her knees were bent and she\u2019d draped a blanket over her legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Alix asked. She wanted it understood that she was none too pleased about having her sleep disturbed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing. Go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Alix hesitated, and then decided what the hell. Laurel wasn\u2019t willing to ask her for help. Fine, if that was how she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Alix was two steps into the bedroom when for some reason she stopped. Faintly she heard Laurel whimper what sounded like: oh God, oh God, oh God.</p><p>Walking into the room again, Alix decisively flipped on the light. She stood with her hands on her hips, feet apart. \u201cYou\u2019re not all right. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Laurel flung her head back and forth and refused to answer. Eyes shut against the light, she bit down on her lower lip and blood oozed from the sides of her mouth. Alix stared at her aghast.</p><p>\u201cLaurel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her roommate urgently stretched out her arm and when Alix took her hand, Laurel held it in a death grip. \u201cHelp me,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can\u2019t do this...I thought...oh God, it hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>Alix fell to her knees beside the sofa. All at once, everything added up, and what should\u2019ve been obvious suddenly exploded into her awareness. \u201cYou\u2019re in labor?\u201d</p><p>Laurel nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you...I couldn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes John know?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Laurel\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy do you think he dumped me? He said he didn\u2019t want the baby. Or me. He promised he\u2019d pay for an abortion, but he didn\u2019t show up with the money and I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d Some friends. Laurel had let her get arrested and yet she didn\u2019t trust Alix with the fact that she was pregnant.</p><p>Laurel closed her eyes and arched her back, moaning again.</p> <p>Alix would figure it out later. Right now, she needed to get Laurel to a hospital. \u201cI\u2019ll go out and find a phone, call for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Laurel screamed. Her hand crushed Alix\u2019s fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. It won\u2019t be long now...it can\u2019t be. I can\u2019t take the pain. I can\u2019t deal with this by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Alix had never been with anyone in labor before and had no idea how to help.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laurel gasped, panting and writhing with pain. \u201cI think the baby might be coming,\u201d she cried, all-out panic in her voice. \u201cWhat should I do? Oh God, what should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay calm,\u201d Alix said, forcing confidence into her own voice, although her heart was galloping at frightening speed. She peeled back the blanket and saw that Laurel had placed a stack of towels beneath her hips. \u201cI\u2019m going to go and wash my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Laurel was rolling her head from side to side once more, her face shiny with sweat.</p> <p>Alix berated herself for not guessing the truth earlier. But Laurel was overweight, so her pregnancy hadn\u2019t been immediately obvious. She still wore her jeans every day and they seemed to be splitting at the seams, but Alix had assumed the weight gain was from depression and her constant eating.</p><p>Alix was only away from Laurel for a moment, but her roommate grabbed her hand the instant she was back. Studying Laurel\u2019s face, Alix saw that she was in terrible pain.</p><p>\u201cLook and see,\u201d Laurel implored. \u201cIs it ready to come out yet?\u201d</p><p>Alix felt completely inadequate to deliver this child. \u201cDo you have anything for the baby?\u201d</p><p>Laurel shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurel,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWhat were you going to do with the baby?\u201d Talk about living in a dream world! Laurel had to know the infant would need clothes and blankets and bottles.</p><p>Her friend sobbed. \u201cAt first I planned to kill it.\u201d</p><p>Alix gasped. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this baby.\u201d Laurel screamed and arched her back again when the pain overtook her. Her fingers dug into the fabric of the sofa as she slammed her eyes shut and panted. She took in deep gulps of air, her shoulders heaving with the effort.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the sofa, Alix saw that the crown of the baby\u2019s head had appeared, thick with matted blond hair. With the next contraction, Alix carefully placed her hands beneath the tiny skull. Laurel drew in a deep breath and tried to look down at the baby but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be much longer now,\u201d Alix promised. She felt frightened and helpless and she hoped she was telling the truth.</p><p>No more than a minute later, Laurel grunted and started panting again. Suddenly, the infant slipped free. He seemed to glide directly into Alix\u2019s hands. With him came a gush of water and blood.</p><p>Tears filled Alix\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d she told Laurel. He didn\u2019t cry right away and Alix\u2019s heart leapt in panic. Acting on instinct, she placed her finger inside his mouth, swabbing it clean. Then she turned him over on his belly and patted his back. Instantly he let out a fierce, belligerent cry. Joy surged through Alix and she stared up at her friend. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, awed by the wonder of this moment. A new life had just entered the world.</p><p>Laurel refused to look at him and turned her face away. \u201cCut the cord,\u201d she instructed without emotion.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think I should...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Laurel demanded. \u201cOr I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Alix found a knife in the kitchen and, afraid she might infect either her friend or the baby, put it in a pan full of water, which she set on the stove to boil. She dashed back into the living room just in time to deliver the afterbirth.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d cut the cord, Alix took the baby into the bathroom and cleaned him off. Then she wrapped him in the blanket she\u2019d knit in class. Certain Laurel would have a change of heart now that the birth was over, Alix carried the newborn into the living room, hoping to coax her roommate into at least glancing at her son.</p><p>\u201cJust look at him once,\u201d Alix pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect, Laurel.\u201d</p><p>Laurel refused again with a shake of her head. \u201cGet rid of it.\u201d</p><p>Alix couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so coldhearted. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give it to me and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill...what will you do?\u201d Alix protectively cradled the infant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it to some Dumpster and leave it there.\u201d</p><p>Laurel didn\u2019t even seem to consider this infant a child. She referred to him as \u201cit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really mean that, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said in a horrified voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to say it?\u201d Laurel shouted. \u201cGet rid of that thing.\u201d</p><p>With one arm around the newborn, Alix controlled her racing thoughts. If Laurel didn\u2019t want this baby, she knew someone who did. \u201cSign something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Laurel stared up at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cI need a statement from you that says you\u2019re giving up this baby of your own free will.\u201d</p><p>Laurel frowned. \u201cWho am I giving this baby to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a couple for adoption.\u201d Alix took a deep breath. \u201cI know someone who desperately wants and needs a child. I want her and her husband to raise this baby boy. You might not love him, but I know Carol will. I brought him into this world. I feel personally responsible for him now. Like you said, you want me to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then as if to prove her point, she grabbed the knife and raised her arm as if she meant to kill the infant on the spot. \u201cI want it dead or out of my life, understand? What more do I have to say to prove it? Just get rid of it! I don\u2019t care what you do as long as you get it out of here.\u201d</p><p>As she held the screaming infant in her arms, Alix grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen, then handed them to her friend. \u201cWrite it down.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, Laurel quickly scribbled a few lines and signed her name. Alix read them over, then returned to the bedroom. She set the baby on her bed and jerked on clothes as fast as her shaking hands would allow. The infant gazed up at her and Alix bent down and kissed his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d had a warmer welcome to the world, little boy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I know someone who\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p><p>Without another word to Laurel, Alix threw her purse over her shoulder and walked out of the apartment. It was early Friday morning and the streets were dark and eerie. Moving as fast as she could with the baby held against her chest, Alix stepped into the foyer of Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9 where there was a pay phone. She searched for fifty cents and then pulled out the piece of paper Jordan had given her with his phone number.</p><p>She inserted the coins and pressed the receiver to her ear as she punched in the numbers. \u201cOh please, be there,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t answer until the fifth ring, just when Alix was about to hang up in frustration and despair.</p><p>\u201cThis better be good,\u201d he muttered into the phone.</p><p>\u201cJordan, it\u2019s me.\u201d She was so glad to hear his voice she nearly wept for joy. \u201cRemember you said I could phone if I ever needed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to answer him. \u201cI\u2019m at Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9.... Can you come and get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and please hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d He didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t so much as pause. If ever Alix had doubted her feelings for him, she didn\u2019t anymore. She knew with certainty that there was one person in her life she could turn to anytime, night or day, and that was Jordan.</p><p>Alix bounced the baby gently in her arms. She cooed and comforted him as she waited inside the lighted foyer of Annie\u2019s Caf\u00e9 for Jordan\u2019s car. When she saw him turn the corner, she pushed through the glass door and walked to the curb.</p><p>Jordan eased to a stop and leaned over to throw open the passenger door.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cIs that...a baby?\u201d His voice was hoarse with sleep and shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Laurel\u2019s and that creep John\u2019s.... I just delivered him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s...\u201d He broke off for a moment. \u201cShe talked to me not long ago, said she was in some kind of trouble, but wouldn\u2019t tell me what.\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded. She understood it all now.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to take the baby to the hospital?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Because her heart was full and because she knew what had to be done, she bent to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cAlix...you can\u2019t keep this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI delivered him. I\u2019ll be the one to find him a home.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know someone who needs this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who. Now, either you drive or I\u2019ll catch a cab.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t legal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a signed statement from Laurel.

Doug rolled over and glanced at the clock, and Carol saw that it was barely past four. She didn\u2019t know anyone who\u2019d be calling this early unless it was an emergency. Her mind went numb with the possibilities.</p> <p>On the third ring, her husband reached for the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d he said groggily.</p><p>Carol could hear only one end of the conversation and at first she assumed it was a wrong number. To her surprise, Doug said, \u201cYes, she\u2019s here. Who did you say this is?\u201d</p><p>A moment later he placed his hand over the mouthpiece. \u201cDo you know a girl by the name of Alix Townsend?\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded. \u201cDid she say what she wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only that she has to see you right away.\u201d</p><p>Carol hesitated.</p><p>\u201cShould I buzz her up?\u201d Doug asked.</p><p>If Alix had come to her in the middle of the night, there had to be a good reason. \u201cYes,\u201d she told her husband. \u201cLet her come up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably wants to talk,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cAt this time of the morning?\u201d</p><p>Carol kissed his temple. \u201cYes, darling.\u201d</p><p>Throwing aside the blankets, Carol reached for her robe at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to get up.\u201d She supposed that Alix had come to her as one friend to another, presumably to ask for advice about some urgent crisis in her life. In her current frame of mind, Carol wasn\u2019t convinced she\u2019d be much help. Then again, maybe she would....</p><p>As she walked out of the bedroom, Carol passed the nursery across the hallway. Bon-Macy\u2019s was coming that very morning to pick up the furniture. With the crib, changer and chest of drawers would go her dreams of a family. After everything she\u2019d endured, after the frustration and disappointment and heartache, Carol thought it should\u2019ve been easier to let go. This futile quest for a child was killing their marriage, and Doug was right\u2014this had to end. Still it hurt and the pain would linger.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Barefoot, Carol crossed the tiled entry to unfasten the security lock. She opened the door and gasped when she saw Alix standing there, cradling a baby in her arms.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, holding the infant out to Carol. \u201cThis baby boy needs a mother.\u201d</p><p>Carol stared down at the newborn thrust into her arms. Speechless, she raised her eyes to meet Alix\u2019s, unsure what to think. What to say was even more of a puzzle.</p><p>\u201cI delivered him,\u201d Alix explained.</p><p>\u201cWhose...?\u201d She did manage to get out the one word.</p><p>\u201cMy roommate told me to get rid of him. She said she planned to throw him in a Dumpster if I didn\u2019t take him. He needs a mother and a father\u2014he needs someone who\u2019ll love him.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t seem real, didn\u2019t seem possible. The only thing Carol could think to do was cry out for her husband, but her voice was hardly a croak. Although she thought he couldn\u2019t have heard her, Doug came roaring out of the bedroom, bare-chested, wearing only his pajama bottoms.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alix said, sounding so unlike herself that Carol glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m Alix. You let me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix brought us a baby,\u201d Carol said, tears glistening in her eyes.</p><p>Doug looked from one to the other. Like her, he didn\u2019t seem to know how to react. But thankfully, he gathered his wits in record time. \u201cI think we\u2019d better all sit down and talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s legal,\u201d Alix assured them. \u201cI got Laurel to write everything out on a piece of paper.\u201d She dug into her pocket and passed the folded sheet to Doug. \u201cLaurel needs to go to the hospital and once she does the police will be notified, but I figured you could deal with that. Possession is nine-tenths of the law, isn\u2019t it? And you\u2019ve got the baby now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should put on a pot of coffee,\u201d Carol suggested. Her mind was spinning and it was difficult to grasp what was going on. All she knew was that she was standing here holding a newborn baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start the coffee,\u201d Doug said. Carol nodded gratefully. She looked down at the sleeping infant and her heart contracted painfully. To think that his mother had been willing to toss him in a Dumpster like a piece of garbage! How anyone could even imagine such a thing was beyond her comprehension.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any clothes,\u201d Alix said. \u201cI washed him off and wrapped him in the blanket but I didn\u2019t have a diaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dress him,\u201d Carol said. This seemed more like a dream than reality. She carried him into the nursery, placing him on the dresser and carefully removing the blanket. With one hand on the infant, she reached down for a disposable diaper.</p><p>That very morning, in just a few hours, she was supposed to empty these drawers so the department store could take everything away. Thank God that hadn\u2019t happened yet! She gently cleaned his bottom and secured the diaper. The tiny T-shirt came next. When she\u2019d finished, she bundled him in the thick, soft folds of a flannel receiving blanket.</p><p>He made a small mewling sound and she picked up a baby bottle, clean and sterilized, ready for formula. She dared not allow herself to think this was her child, her son. Alix had come to her for help and Carol was the logical person to contact.</p><p>\u201cExactly how old is he?\u201d she asked when she returned to the living room.</p><p>Alix glanced at her wrist, but apparently hadn\u2019t remembered to put on her watch. \u201cAbout an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan. He dropped me off, and now he\u2019s on his way back to the apartment to take Laurel to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>With Alix following her, Carol joined Doug in the kitchen, and they waited for the coffee to drip into the pot. \u201cHe needs to be fed,\u201d Carol announced as though she were an authority on the subject of newborns. Without asking, she handed the baby to Doug, then found a can of formula in one of the cupboards.</p><p>She filled the four-ounce bottle and set it inside the microwave just long enough to warm it. After shaking the formula on her wrist to test the temperature, she picked up the baby. He took immediately to the nipple, nestling in her arms as if...as if she was his mother.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Time to talk,\u201d Doug said. He gestured Carol and Alix into the living room and carried in the coffee tray. Carol sat in the recliner, touching the baby\u2019s tiny wisps of hair. She almost burst into tears when the infant wrapped his hand around her little finger. He\u2019s mine, she wanted to cry out. She felt both a profound, soul-deep satisfaction\u2014and greater fear than she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cI brought him into the world,\u201d Alix said proudly. \u201cLaurel doesn\u2019t want him and I told her I knew someone who\u2019d love him.\u201d She paused, clearly waiting for Carol to respond.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be legal,\u201d Doug said, answering for her, sounding uncertain and confused. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the baby, don\u2019t you?\u201d Alix said. \u201cHe\u2019s yours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe signed a paper saying she didn\u2019t want him.\u201d For the first time, Alix looked unsure of what she\u2019d done. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Carol cried. Doug had concerns and so did she, but this baby filled her arms, filled the emptiness inside her. God help her, she wasn\u2019t letting him go! She refused to give in to the fear that she might lose this child, too. \u201cDoug?\u201d She turned to her husband, her eyes entreating him to do whatever was necessary.</p><p>Doug leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this baby or not?\u201d Carol demanded. \u201cBecause I do. I\u2019ll take him, no questions asked. I\u2019ll love him, I\u2019ll raise him, but I need to know that you will, too.\u201d</p><p>Her husband met her eyes, and Carol saw his apprehension. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to keep him, Carol. Like I said, this can\u2019t be legal. A woman can\u2019t just give her baby to complete strangers.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t care what it cost, what sacrifices were required, she was willing to fight to make this child her own. Just when she\u2019d given up all hope, a miracle had happened. She was going to accept that miracle, whatever it took.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing we do is talk to an attorney.\u201d It was clear that Doug had reached a decision. \u201cAs Alix said, with Laurel in the hospital, the police will be notified. We have to make it look like she intended for us to adopt him from the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>Carol saw in him a resolve that made her want to weep with joy. \u201cWe have a son,\u201d she whispered through her tears.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, we don\u2019t,\u201d Doug said, \u201cbut we will soon enough.\u201d Taking charge now, he stood. \u201cGive me a few minutes to dress and make a couple of phone calls. Then, Alix, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into the bedroom.</p><p>Carol put the baby bottle aside and held the infant against her shoulder. \u201cHow can I thank you?\u201d she said as she patted his back.</p><p>Alix pointed at the tray, which held the coffeepot and three mugs. \u201cI could really use a cup of that coffee. Do you mind if I help myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course...sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want one?\u201d</p><p>Carol shook her head as Alix poured a mug of coffee and added cream. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured. She took a sip of her coffee. \u201cAbout Laurel,\u201d she said, obviously caught up in her own thoughts. \u201cIt just never occurred to me that she could be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s hand rubbed the infant\u2019s back protectively. With her he would be secure and loved and very much wanted.</p><p>\u201cLaurel was overweight before, and then she just seemed to be getting fatter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA used-car salesman. He rented XXX-rated videos. I was never keen on him, but he was kind of good-looking, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Laurel?\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s all right, I guess. Just mixed up and angry at the world. I thought that once the baby was born she\u2019d change her mind, but she didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doug appeared then. \u201cTo which hospital did your friend take the mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwedish,\u201d Alix told him. \u201cDo you still want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>Doug nodded. \u201cI called Larry,\u201d he said, mentioning the name of a good family friend. Larry was an attorney who worked for the insurance company that employed Doug. \u201cHe said I should go to the mother and call him from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Carol wanted to know.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, stay here. Look after the baby. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Carol didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d have the opportunity to nurture and guard this child, but she intended to treasure each moment.</p><p>Minutes later, Doug and Alix hurried out the door. Carol moved into the nursery, this room she\u2019d decorated with such anticipation and care. Each item, each piece of furniture, had been an affirmation of hope and joy...and had become a symbol of her pain.</p><p>Sinking down in the cushioned rocker, she cradled the sleeping infant and sang him a lullaby. His entry into the world had been abrupt and frightening, but he was safe now. And he\u2019d always be safe if she and Doug could possibly arrange it.</p><p>Carol lost all track of time as she cradled the baby, rocking gently back and forth. She might\u2019ve been there an hour, possibly two. It didn\u2019t matter. The happiness that stole over her was complete.</p> <p>The baby woke, cried huskily and after Carol had changed his diaper, she fed him a second bottle. He returned to sleep and she settled him in the crib, then stood over him, one hand pressed to his tiny back.</p><p>Doug came home shortly after eight but without Alix. When he found Carol in the nursery\u2014the first place he looked\u2014he stood beside her, his gaze on the sleeping baby. Then he drew Carol into his arms, and hugged her so close she could hardly breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes were bright with unshed tears and his voice trembled. \u201cWe have to take him to the hospital and have him checked out, but it looks like we have a son. Laurel was more than agreeable to letting us adopt him. She insisted to the authorities that it\u2019d been her plan all along.\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded her eyes as they clung to each other, weeping with happiness. A baby. A miracle of life, a gift that had come from the most unlikely of places at the most unbelievable of times.</p><p>She\u2019d known from the first day she\u2019d walked into the yarn store. The fact that they were knitting baby blankets had been a sign from God\u2014and He had kept His promise.</p> <p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>JACQUELINE DONOVAN The Next Year</p><p>J acqueline could hardly contain her excitement as she drove toward Paul and Tammie Lee\u2019s house. She\u2019d been on a cruise with Reese for the last three weeks and was badly in need of what she called a \u201cgrandbaby fix.\u201d Little Amelia was almost walking now and Jacqueline considered her granddaughter the cutest, smartest baby in the entire universe. Not that she was biased or anything...</p><p>First she\u2019d collect the requisite hugs and kisses from Amelia, and then her next stop would be Lydia\u2019s store. She\u2019d found the loveliest yarn in a tiny shop in one of the Greek islands during their Mediterranean cruise, and she was eager to show it to her.</p><p>Tammie Lee was watering the flower beds and Amelia, balanced against her hip, waved her chubby arms at a passing butterfly when Jacqueline pulled into the driveway. The back seat was loaded with gifts she and Reese had purchased on their trip, but none of that was important just now. The sooner she held her granddaughter, the better.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, Amelia, Grandma\u2019s home.\u201d Jacqueline slid out of her car and held her arms open to her baby girl.</p><p>Amelia squealed with delight and reached for Jacqueline. It didn\u2019t matter that the child was teething and slobber ran freely down her chin and onto her designer bib. All Jacqueline cared about was holding this beautiful baby once again.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Tammie Lee said with a wide smile. She bent down to turn off the water and dragged the hose back to the side of the house. \u201cWhat time did you and Dad get in last night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLate.\u201d Had it been a decent hour, Jacqueline would\u2019ve raced over to kiss Amelia good-night, but Reese had convinced her everyone would be asleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still adjusting to the time change,\u201d she said, hugging her daughter-in-law. The love she felt for Tammie Lee was genuine now. Jacqueline had gradually grown close to her. Tammie Lee\u2019s natural, unforced kindness, her generosity and willingness to assume the best, had transformed Jacqueline\u2019s rigid view of life, and in the process brought the entire family together. Her practical wisdom had opened Jacqueline\u2019s eyes to what she was doing to Reese and to herself. Without Tammie Lee, Jacqueline wondered how long her marriage could possibly have lasted.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you both something fierce,\u201d Tammie Lee said, taking Amelia from Jacqueline as she led the way into the house. The nine-month-old was on a mission to explore every cupboard and corner she could find.</p><p>Tammie Lee headed into the kitchen, where she settled Amelia in her high chair and brought out a pitcher of iced tea and two glasses.</p><p>Amelia banged her fists against the tray and gurgled in apparent approval. From the beginning she\u2019d been a happy, cheerful child, just like her mother. Jacqueline walked over to the cookie jar for a graham cracker and broke it into manageable chunks. Amelia immediately grabbed one, gleefully shoving it into her mouth and gumming it with such an expression of delight, it might have been the world\u2019s finest delicacy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to be home.\u201d Jacqueline sighed as she accepted the glass of tea, complete with a sprig of mint.</p><p>\u201cSit down, and tell me all about exploring the Greek Isles,\u201d Tammie Lee insisted. \u201cI declare, this is the most romantic trip I\u2019ve ever heard of. I just hope Paul and I are as much in love thirty-three years down the road as you and Dad. It sounded just like a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter-in-law was closer to the truth than she\u2019d ever know. Jacqueline\u2019s marriage was vastly different since the night she\u2019d confronted Reese about his Tuesday-night-mistress-who-wasn\u2019t. From that moment on, everything had changed for the better. The very next day he\u2019d moved back into the master bedroom with her. Together they explored the delights of married love and gradually, over the next few months, they\u2019d worked on rebuilding what they\u2019d been so ready to destroy.</p><p>\u201cI just hope Paul\u2019s as romantic as his father,\u201d Jacqueline murmured, playing with Amelia. \u201cOh, I swear she\u2019s grown so much these last three weeks.\u201d</p><p>Accepting her right to be the center of attention, Amelia Jacqueline Donovan grinned a toothy radiant smile, her cheeks smeared with mushed-up graham cracker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a cutie pie,\u201d Jacqueline cooed. The love she felt for this child was unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced. Amelia and her mother had changed Jacqueline\u2019s life in ways she could never have predicted.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Jacqueline had emptied the back seat of her car. She hugged Tammie Lee goodbye and covered Amelia\u2019s now-clean face with grandma kisses, then reluctantly drove off.</p><p>She went to A Good Yarn next. Luck was with her, and she slid into a vacant parking spot directly in front of the store. The Blossom Street renovation project was completed now. The brick apartment building where Alix had once lived had been turned into swanky, updated condominiums; they sold for prices that shocked even Jacqueline. Alix, however, liked her new home better, as well she should, seeing that she was living in the guest house formerly occupied by Martha, who had retired. Who would\u2019ve believed when they first met that Alix would become as close as family?</p><p>\u201cJacqueline,\u201d Lydia cried as the bell chimed above the door. \u201cWelcome back! How was the cruise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. Reese and I loved every minute of it.\u201d She opened the shopping bag and pulled out a skein of the Greek yarn, a wool-cashmere blend in a soft shade of mauve with flecks of white. \u201cLook what I found.\u201d</p><p>Lydia examined the yarn, weaving it between her fingers, then letting it run through her fingers. She handed it to Margaret. \u201cFeel this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought enough to knit a sweater. I didn\u2019t have a clue how much I\u2019d need, so I bought everything they had. You can have whatever I\u2019ve got left over.\u201d</p><p>After Margaret had exclaimed over the yarn, Lydia handled it again. \u201cWhere did you ever find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn an island. I can\u2019t remember the name right now. Reese went with me from store to store in my search for yarn. His memory\u2019s better than mine\u2014I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese helped you search for yarn?\u201d Lydia shook her head laughingly. \u201cMost husbands would consider that above and beyond the call of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do everything together these days,\u201d Jacqueline confessed and although she would\u2019ve objected had anyone pointed it out, she blushed. This trip with Reese was the second honeymoon every couple should have at least once in their marriage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappier,\u201d Jacqueline finished for her. She\u2019d heard that over and over again from family and friends. She had no intention of denying it; she was happy.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going to say you\u2019re looking tanned,\u201d Lydia said with a mischievous smile.</p><p>Jacqueline extended both her arms. \u201cOh, that. Reese had me out on every golf course in the Mediterranean.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got a wicked slice if I do say so myself, and I\u2019m a formidable putter.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to scoot. I\u2019m meeting Reese at the country club in an hour\u2014we\u2019re having drinks with some old friends. I need to run over to the house first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to have you back,\u201d Lydia said, hugging her. \u201cWill you be here on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Jacqueline waved away her question as if the answer should be understood. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>With that she was off, eager to join her husband\u2014the man she loved.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>CAROL GIRARD</p><p>\u201cC ameron Douglas Girard, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Cameron gazed up from the carpet where he sat sorting through his daddy\u2019s sock drawer. The nine-month-old grinned up at her guilelessly as Carol stood with her hands on her hips, trying hard to look stern while struggling not to laugh. \u201cCome here,\u201d she said, lifting her baby boy into her arms. Raising him high, she pressed her mouth against his bare belly and made a loud smooching noise. Cameron let out a squeal of pleasure. When she lowered him, he buried his face in her shoulder, gripping her hair with both hands, gurgling and chattering.</p><p>In this past year, Carol had learned about a whole new facet of love\u2014about how much one person could love another and how much a mother could love her child. Cameron might not have come from her womb, but he was her son in every way that counted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for our walk,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Cameron knew what that meant and squirmed, wanting her to put him down. She did, quickly returning Doug\u2019s socks to the bottom drawer of their chest of drawers. Then she carried Cam to his room, where she dressed him in tiny jeans and a hand-knit sweater. The pants were a gift from her brother, who\u2019d sent them, plus a matching jacket, shortly after the adoption was completed. Released again, Cameron crawled rapidly toward the stroller. Once he reached it, he pulled himself into a standing position, then looked over his shoulder to be sure she\u2019d noticed his feat and appreciated his skill. Cameron loved their walks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re visiting the yarn store this afternoon,\u201d Carol told him as she buckled him in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see Miss Lydia.\u201d</p><p>Draping her purse over her shoulder, Carol left the condo and pushed the stroller into the hallway and then into the waiting elevator. They took the same route almost every afternoon, stopping at a park two blocks from their building to chat with other young mothers.</p><p>Carol\u2019s circle of friends had broadened dramatically since she\u2019d left work and Cameron had come into their lives. The other mothers she\u2019d met at the park had formed a casual group, meeting once a week for coffee. They shared advice and experiences, traded parenting books and magazines, passed on toys and clothing their own children no longer needed. Carol was the oldest member of the group, but that had never bothered her.</p><p>After their park visit, Carol steered Cameron into the yarn store. \u201cCarol,\u201d Lydia called out cheerfully. \u201cHello.\u201d She squatted down so she was eye level with Cameron. \u201cYou, too, Cam.\u201d</p> <p>The baby grabbed for a skein of bright purple yarn but Carol was too quick for him and automatically rolled the stroller backward and away from the tempting yarn.</p><p>\u201cI need another ball of that Paton worsted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe olive-green, right?\u201d Lydia had an uncanny ability to remember who\u2019d bought what yarn for which project. Carol had so many projects going now, it was hard to keep track of them all. Lydia, however, had no such difficulty.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline was by earlier this afternoon,\u201d Lydia said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith a gorgeous tan, too. She looks so happy,\u201d Lydia said with a contented smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Alix?\u201d The fourth member of their knitting group wasn\u2019t always available on Fridays. It had been hit-and-miss with her because of culinary school commitments.</p><p>Lydia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to make it.\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed. \u201cI miss her when she can\u2019t be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Lydia admitted. \u201cRemember what we thought when she first signed up for the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was convinced Jacqueline and Alix would go for each other\u2019s throats within the first five minutes.\u201d Carol laughed. \u201cThey were impossible, always sniping at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like third grade all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d Carol marveled anew at how the relationship between those two had turned out.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline was ready to drop out more than once,\u201d Lydia said, reminiscing.</p><p>Carol nodded. \u201cI understood why she wanted to, but I\u2019m so grateful she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. And if Alix hadn\u2019t stayed...\u201d</p><p>They could never have guessed how one defiant, angry young woman would influence all their lives.</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever hear from Laurel?\u201d Lydia asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a word. Not since the day Cameron was born. She went into court on her own, signed the paperwork and walked out the door without a word to either Doug or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Alix? They used to be roommates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s heard from Laurel, she\u2019s never mentioned it to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jordan?\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed. \u201cI understand he hooked her up with a counselor and got her housing when the apartment building was sold.\u201d The urge to take Cameron in her arms and hold him protectively against her was nearly overwhelming, but Carol resisted. \u201cShe was a sad, confused young woman with a lot of problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did one thing right in her life, and that was to give you and Doug her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish her well,\u201d Carol murmured, and she meant it.</p><p>At some point, years from now, Cameron might be curious about his birth parents; he might even want to search for them. That decision would be his, but for now, during these formative years, this baby boy was hers and Doug\u2019s. It was their love and their values that would shape him.</p><p>Lydia brought the yarn to the counter and rang it up. After Carol had paid for it, she tucked the plastic bag in the basket behind the stroller and headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Lydia gave her a final wave and Carol wheeled the stroller down the sidewalk, past the florist and the caf\u00e9 and toward the hill to the waterfront area and the condo.</p><p>She\u2019d only been home a few minutes when Doug arrived. He kissed Carol, then reached down for Cameron, lifting him up and hugging him close. Carol was always profoundly moved when she saw her husband with his son. Cameron\u2019s face lit with joy at the sight of his daddy and he squealed and clapped his hands.</p><p>The moment was poignant and real. They\u2019d waited so long for this. They\u2019d suffered and sacrificed but none of that seemed important now. They had their son. They had their family. Carol closed her eyes, holding on to this moment, experiencing it as fully as possible.</p><p>Doug sat on the floor and played with Cameron and together father and son stacked blocks while Carol looked on, tears moistening her eyes. She knew that in the years to come, everything might not be as perfect as it was today. It didn\u2019t matter. She felt content and happy, and the emptiness that had nearly destroyed her was gone.</p><p>She was complete.</p><p>CHAPTER 50</p><p>ALIX TOWNSEND</p><p>A lix put the finishing touches on her cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and stepped back to give her instructor a chance to grade her work. Mr. Diamont moved forward and studied it with a discerning eye, then tapped the burnt sugar crust. He tasted the creamy custard beneath and nodded approvingly. He turned in her direction. \u201cNice job, Alix. You may go.\u201d</p><p>Alix stared at her teacher, certain that she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. She didn\u2019t wait long, however, but removed her hat and apron and hurried out of the class. Praise from Diamont was as rare as discretionary cash.</p><p>Her budget was tight and would be for the next year of the two-year program. Alix had lived on far less. The lack of money didn\u2019t bother her because she was doing something she loved. Cooking. For years she\u2019d dreamed of attending cooking school, but the tuition costs were as high as a college education. It would\u2019ve continued to be far beyond her means if not for her friends Jacqueline and Reese Donovan.</p><p>Alix had met Reese shortly after Carol and Doug adopted Laurel\u2019s baby. Reese had lots of prominent friends; through his connections he was able to steer her toward a scholarship program offered by a local service club. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Jacqueline had insisted Alix live in their guest house while she attended school. Their housekeeper had recently retired and now Alix had a house-cleaning job that supplied her with enough money to pay for her basic needs.</p><p>All of this seemed too good to believe. Every now and then, Alix had to pinch herself to prove this was real. To make sure it was happening to her, Alix Townsend.</p><p>Once she\u2019d changed out of her uniform, Alix called Jordan\u2019s cell from the pay phone in the locker room.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said when he answered.</p><p>\u201cFinished for the day?\u201d He seemed to have been waiting for her call.</p><p>\u201cMr. Diamont said I could go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready? You must\u2019ve done all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have,\u201d she said, biting her lip to keep from bragging. There\u2019d be plenty of time for that when she was out of earshot of the other students.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what it would take to bribe you into making cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for me,\u201d he said playfully. \u201cIt is my favorite dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll bet I could think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you could, too. Should I pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d His days were busy, and it was a lot to ask of him. Normally she wouldn\u2019t phone but she\u2019d been worried about this test and he\u2019d asked her to let him know how she\u2019d done. \u201cI can always take the bus,\u201d she said now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>She waited outside the Seattle Cooking Academy for about ten minutes before Jordan\u2019s car approached. They\u2019d been dating nearly a year now, and she\u2019d grown accustomed to having him in her life\u2014accustomed to a lot of things. He\u2019d even managed to talk her into attending church on a regular basis. For the first time she felt like a normal person who lived a normal life with people around her who cared and wanted her to succeed. She figured Jordan was right. God hadn\u2019t given up on her.</p><p>Jordan parked at the curb, and leaned across the seat to open the passenger door. Alix slid inside and they kissed briefly. Jordan checked his rearview mirror, then merged with the traffic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you remember what today is?\u201d he asked nonchalantly.</p><p>Alix wracked her brain but could think of nothing. \u201cIs May sixth supposed to have some significance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t to you?\u201d He tossed her a hurt-little-boy look.</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>Jordan grinned and pretended to be absorbed by the flow of downtown Seattle traffic. \u201cThat was the first day you flashed your baby blues at me at the video store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are brown!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said in the same flippant voice she\u2019d so often used with him. \u201cYou honestly don\u2019t remember? It was May sixth when I saw you standing outside the video store, smoking. I was minding my own business, going in to rent a video, when you interrupted me with some weak excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set aside a video for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were making eyes at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking eyes at you?\u201d she snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming.\u201d She looked at him with mock scorn, but it pleased her beyond measure that he\u2019d recalled such a minute detail of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cSo I figure today is something of an anniversary for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, is it?\u201d she asked, loving every second of this banter between them.</p><p>\u201cYou are my girlfriend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as if it was of little consequence. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, you might want to check out the little box in my glove compartment.\u201d</p><p>All at once it felt as if they were flying instead of driving. \u201cA box in the glove compartment for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>Her hand trembled as she opened the compartment. Sure enough, a small black jeweler\u2019s case with a bright red bow was nestled in among the owner\u2019s manual and the car registration papers. She pulled it out and held it in the palm of her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d she asked. She couldn\u2019t help it; she sounded breathless.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and see,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>The banter was gone, and the car seemed to grow suddenly warm and airless.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately comply, he prodded her. \u201cWell? What\u2019s holding you back? Open the box!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very pretty box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but what\u2019s inside is even prettier.\u201d</p><p>Alix removed the bow and then with exaggerated care lifted the lid. Inside was a lovely ring with a ruby and two small diamonds, one on either side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJordan.\u201d She said his name on a single lengthy breath. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just remind you it\u2019s been a year since we linked up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know, but...\u201d If he made her cry Alix didn\u2019t think she\u2019d forgive him.</p><p>\u201cTry it on.\u201d</p><p>She slipped it out and placed it on her finger.

Knitting is a hobby. Breathe, relax and have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Donna Druchunas, SheeptoShawl.com</p><p>LYDIA HOFFMAN</p><p>I t\u2019s hard to believe that A Good Yarn\u2019s been open for a year. I\u2019ve decided to hold my first\u2014and, I hope, annual\u2014yarn sale. Margaret, who works part-time for me now, created the flyers and the signs. My sister has an artistic bent, although she\u2019s quick to deny it.</p><p>This has certainly been an eventful year. My business has prospered and I\u2019ve achieved every goal I set for my first year, plus some. My class list has grown. My original three class members are still with me and we share a deep bond. We\u2019re friends. Our Friday afternoon sessions are an ongoing social event\u2014with knitting. I\u2019m holding other classes, too. My inventory doubled in the last twelve months and continues to grow, although space is becoming a problem. Brad has been wonderful and together with Matt, my brother-in-law, has constructed shelves to hold the newer yarns I\u2019ve made available to my customers.</p><p>One morning this week, I was sitting at my desk, dealing with long-overdue paperwork. I glanced into the shop where Margaret was busy tending an early customer; just seeing her made me treasure my business all the more. I\u2019m so grateful I took this giant step in faith. A Good Yarn is everything I dreamed it would be. I hardly think of it as coming to work because it\u2019s such a joy to do what I love and to be able to share my passion for knitting with others.</p><p>My father is the one I thank for giving me the courage to move forward with my life. His death taught me such valuable lessons. I suppose the irony is that his death taught me about life. I\u2019d come to depend on him, but in this last year I\u2019ve learned to draw upon the inner strength he instilled in me. I suppose it\u2019s fanciful to think he\u2019s smiling down on me, but I do.</p><p>That smile of my father\u2019s would include Margaret. My sister and I have come a long way in repairing our relationship. We\u2019ve grown steadily closer, first as sisters and then as friends. A year ago, if anyone had told me that my sister and I would be working side by side in my yarn store, I would\u2019ve keeled over in a dead faint. Margaret and me\u2014oh, hardly. And yet that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Margaret started filling in for me while I was going through my most recent scare with cancer last year. Dr. Wilson wasn\u2019t giving the cancer a chance to recur, and while the treatment wasn\u2019t as aggressive as the chemotherapy and radiation I\u2019d endured in the past, it was aggressive enough. It was often necessary for me to take a day off, so Margaret, with her limited experience, helped me out. How grateful I am to my sister. She was more familiar with crocheting than knitting when she started, but in recent months, she\u2019s mastered knitting, too. Now she\u2019s as much a part of the store as I am, and the customers have warmed to her. Margaret will never be a spontaneous sort of person, but she\u2019s excellent at sales and I\u2019m proud to have her as an employee. Mom is pleased with our new relationship, too.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest change in my life, however, is Brad and Cody. We\u2019re together as much as our schedules will allow, and I\u2019ve fallen deeply in love with this special man and with his son.</p><p>\u201cThe flyers are back from the printer,\u201d Margaret said, stepping into my tiny office and interrupting my thoughts. \u201cWhen would you like me to get them to the mailing service?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my desk. \u201cToday if possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I wanted her to know how much I appreciated everything she did for me. \u201cI owe you so much, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>She shook off my praise, as I knew she would. My gratitude seemed to embarrass her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to the Mariners game tonight?\u201d At times, although they were increasingly rare, Margaret fell into that protective older-sister mode.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d I said, letting her know I was capable of judging my own limits. In any case, I had no intention of disappointing Brad and Cody. We\u2019d had tickets for this game against the San Diego Padres for weeks.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Matt, Mom and the girls? You\u2019ll be there, too, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Margaret\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re up to it,\u201d I teased.</p><p>She ignored that and craned her neck to look out the front windows. \u201cOur favorite UPS delivery man just pulled up.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, Brad entered the shop, whistling as he rolled in the stack of boxes, filled with my latest shipment of yarn.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, Margaret,\u201d he said as he handed her the clipboard.</p><p>My sister signed her name and Brad came to the back to see me.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I always blush when Brad talks to me like that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to his love. I\u2019m the luckiest woman alive. Brad and I have talked about marriage, but I\u2019m the one dragging my feet. I had to be sure first\u2014not about loving him, because I do. No, I had to be sure about the cancer. I\u2019m safe for now, and the future\u2019s like a blank page waiting for a story to be written on it. Or a ball of yarn waiting to be knit...</p><p>I love Brad and Cody. I\u2019ve worked hard to establish a good relationship with Brad\u2019s son. His mother and I have talked a number of times; she loves her son, but she\u2019s concentrating on her own needs just now. The funny part is, she seems grateful to me for stepping in.</p><p>Still, life doesn\u2019t hold any guarantees. Brad and I have talked about this often, and I\u2019m ready to accept his proposal. I know that\u2019s what I want.</p><p>Brad tucked his arms around my waist. \u201cYou\u2019re looking mighty kissable this morning.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and kissed him, letting my mouth linger on his. I didn\u2019t often let our kisses get this involved, especially during business hours. Yet there are moments when it\u2019s easy to forget where we are.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this?\u201d he asked in a husky whisper close to my ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just because I love you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I gave his backside a friendly pat. \u201cSee you tonight\u2014and don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re buying the hot dogs and peanuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He left the shop and I stood next to Margaret as I watched him walk away. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good guys,\u201d my sister said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to marry him?\u201d</p><p>I eyed Margaret, wondering what she\u2019d say when she learned I\u2019d made my decision. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a wide smile. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I figure it is. I love him. And you know what the real bonus is? Brad and I can laugh together.\u201d</p><p>My sister was still grinning. \u201cLife sure has a way of keeping you in stitches.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think she meant the pun, but I couldn\u2019t help agreeing. </p> </body></html>"]
