He raged at the bonds that held him trapped in this nightmare while his sweet Cyn wept, her tears warm against the skin of his chest, shredding what was left of his heart. The merciless sun forced him to lie dormant while he howled in silence, the voices of his dead children demanding vengeance against those who had destroyed them.</p><p>Five centuries old and the most powerful vampire on earth . . . and still he could only wait.</p> <p>The hours ticked by, and then the minutes.</p><p>The sun was still a molten smear on the horizon when he shattered the chains of daylight that held him prisoner. He sat up, his arms circling Cyn, holding her close, pulling her onto his lap and murmuring meaningless words of reassurance. He reached out to his vampires, those still asleep and those just waking, but especially to Duncan who was near enough and strong enough to have felt the biting edge of Raphael\u2019s nightmare. A nightmare that was all too real.</p><p>Cyn jerked her head up, studying him in the lamplight, her eyes red and swollen, her lovely face streaked with tears. He kissed them away, knowing his own face was wet with blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou were in pain, Raphael. You\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTears, lubimaya, only tears. Two of mine have died, their lives stolen\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Across the room his cell phone rang. Cyn jolted, twisting in his arms to stare at the intrusive device as if she\u2019d never seen it before. \u201cWho?\u201d she asked fearfully.</p><p>\u201cThat will be Duncan,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cI need to speak with him. Come.\u201d He stood, still holding her tightly, sensing her fear for him, wanting to reassure her, but also needing the comfort for himself of having her pressed to his side, her heart beating strong and sure . . . and alive.</p><p>He crossed the room swiftly, one arm still holding onto Cyn as he picked up the cell on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cDuncan. Marco and Preston are gone. Contact the Seattle compound and tell them we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>North of Seattle, Washington</p> <p>Colin Murphy downshifted as he made the turn onto the narrow driveway. New gravel had been laid here a couple years back, but the rains had washed away much of it by now, leaving potholes big enough to swallow small animals. The truck dipped hard to one side and he gripped the wheel, his tires sliding on the uneven surface before the heavy 4X4 dug in and forged ahead. Say what you will about American-made cars, he thought to himself, but no one made a better truck. He gave the dashboard an affectionate pat as he leaned forward, squinting through the rain-spattered windshield.</p><p>Lillian Fremont had called to say she\u2019d heard gunshots over here. Colin wasn\u2019t really a police officer\u2014more like an overqualified private security guy\u2014but the good people of Cooper\u2019s Rest paid him to deal with incidents just like this one, so he\u2019d geared up and headed out. He didn\u2019t really know what to expect, though. Mrs. Fremont had been adamant about what she\u2019d heard, but the woman was more than ninety years old and her house was a good two miles away. Granted, sound was a weird thing, and situated as she was on the opposite side of a shallow dip in the forest floor, it was just possible she could hear quite well over there. Especially if what she\u2019d told him was true.</p><p>Of course, in his experience most people didn\u2019t know what real gunfire sounded like, expecting it to be like what they heard in movies and on television. But this wasn\u2019t the big city, either. Most people up here had guns of their own and knew firsthand about gunfire.</p><p>And screams pretty much sounded the same everywhere.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s house came into view, a newer ranch style, single story with high ceilings and a fire-retardant shingled roof. The blinds were drawn behind the few windows, but then he\u2019d expected that. Jeremy was a vampire, after all, so sunlight was hardly a priority. On the other hand, Jeremy\u2019s significant other, Mariane, was human, and Colin had seen her in town often enough during daytime to know that she didn\u2019t always sleep away the days with her lover.</p><p>Colin pulled up in front of the house, his eyes scanning the area as his fingers automatically switched off the ignition. He was getting a bad feeling about this. And if he\u2019d learned one thing in twelve years as a Navy SEAL, it was to trust his feelings. Especially the bad ones.</p><p>He opened his door quietly and stepped outside, standing perfectly still for a moment to listen. There was no sound. None at all, except the patter of the ever-present rain.</p><p>He backed toward the rear of his vehicle, his gaze never leaving the silent house in front of him. He grabbed his Sig Sauer P228 from where it rode in a holster on his right hip and ejected the magazine, dropping his eyes just long enough to check it carefully before slapping it back in with the ease of long practice. Popping the hatch on his Tahoe, he leaned into the cargo area and brought out a Benelli M4 S90 shotgun, a combat shotgun designed to kill humans. Or vampires.</p> <p>Colin pulled the cargo door down, leaning his weight against it so it closed with a muted click. And still not a sound from the house.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like this. Didn\u2019t like it at all. It had to be nearly sundown. It was difficult to tell sometimes with the heavy cloud cover, and he hadn\u2019t exactly checked his Farmer\u2019s Almanac this morning to find out the precise time of sunset. But it had to be close, and he sure as hell didn\u2019t want to be snooping around Jeremy\u2019s house when the vampire rose for the night, hungry and probably pissed if he found Colin lurking about uninvited.</p><p>But, he couldn\u2019t walk away, either. Not with those screams Mrs. Fremont had reported.</p><p>Shaking his head, Colin racked the shotgun and rounded his truck, circling slightly to the left of the house. Finding nothing amiss, he crossed to the right and maneuvered through crowded trees around to the back. The rear of the house came into view and his stomach muscles clenched as adrenaline flooded his system.</p><p>Goddamn if Mrs. Fremont wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>The back door, what was left of it, stood wide open, looking like someone had taken an ax to it. There was no other explanation. It was made from heavy, solid core construction without even a decorative window\u2014or it had been. Nothing but shards and splinters of wood were left, hanging crookedly from those heavy duty hinges. Jeremy was serious about his security; all the vamps were. Someone else had known that and come prepared. But whoever it was, Colin was pretty sure they were long gone. There wasn\u2019t a sound coming from inside the house.</p><p>He approached carefully anyway, moving along the house\u2019s back wall, well below the high, narrow windows. When he reached the wooden porch, he darted his head out for a fast, oblique look inside before stepping up. A triangular pane high above the door had been destroyed, scattering glass all around. It crunched beneath his boots and he paused, waiting for a reaction. But there was none. Shotgun at the ready, he stepped quickly into the house and out of the doorway. A scan of the kitchen showed even more destruction\u2014cabinets trashed, probably with the same ax, dishes broken, refrigerator hanging open and blood spattered over the floor in front of it. Seeing that blood sucked the air out of his lungs until he realized it was Jeremy\u2019s food supply, that among the litter were plastic donor bags, ripped and torn.</p><p>Did Jeremy need blood beyond what Mariane could provide? Apparently, he did. Or maybe it was for guests. Who the fuck knew?</p><p>Colin took a cautious step toward the archway on the other side of the kitchen, mindful of the slippery goo covering the floor. The next room was much bigger, with a high, angled ceiling and lots of furniture. A huge entertainment center took up one entire wall, now blasted to bits like everything else. Colin cleared the room carefully, aware of a sick feeling building in his gut. Where was Mariane?</p><p>He entered the back hallway. There were only three doors here, two of them open. One was a bathroom, obviously empty, but he cleared it anyway. The second was an office of some sort, the equipment trashed, files overturned in what was by now a familiar pattern of destruction. The trashed equipment in this room alone was worth thousands, which made him think this wasn\u2019t a simple case of breaking and entering. Either that or they\u2019d been after something other than easily pawned electronics.</p><p>Colin stepped back and eyed the final door. \u201cDammit,\u201d he mouthed soundlessly and made his way down the hall.</p><p>The door was pulled closed, but not latched. Colin paused for a moment, listening and hearing nothing. He stood back against the wall and pushed the door open with the fingers of one hand. A quick look showed more of the same, an almost random trashing of the room and everything in it. He stepped through the doorway and immediately put a wall at his back.</p><p>\u201cAh, shit,\u201d he swore softly.</p><p>Mariane lay in the middle of a big bed, blood soaking the sheets beneath her. Colin closed his eyes briefly, letting a wash of grief sweep over him before steeling himself for what had to be done. Every human instinct he possessed told him to rush to her side. Instead, he cleared the room, stepping into both the walk-in closet and attached bath before crossing to the bed and propping the shotgun within reach.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you, baby girl?\u201d he murmured. She\u2019d been beaten, tortured it appeared, her arms and legs covered with shallow knife cuts, designed to hurt like hell without killing the victim. None of the individual cuts would have been fatal, but the cumulative effect of so many . . . They\u2019d left her lying naked, her legs spread wide. The blood and bruises on her thighs and vaginal area told him she\u2019d been raped, and Colin gritted his teeth against a wave of anger so strong it nearly brought him to his knees.</p><p>If she was breathing, he couldn\u2019t see it, but he leaned over and placed two fingers against her neck, expecting to find nothing but confirmation of what he already believed to be true. Instead, he felt a weak pulse\u2014barely there, but she was alive!</p><p>He straightened immediately, pulled the cell phone from his belt and speed dialed 911. The closest trauma center was a good sixty miles away, and most of that was twisting mountain roads, but he didn\u2019t know what else to do, who else to call. He knew battlefield medicine, had spent hundreds of hours in training sessions. He\u2019d dealt with bodies torn apart by guns and explosives, but this . . . He forced himself to think clinically, to ignore the brutal nature of the attack. Okay. Shock was probably her greatest enemy right now. He cast about for something with which to cover her. He needed to raise her body temp and keep her warm. But all he could see were blankets as bloody as she was. Towels. He ran back into the bathroom as he waited for the 911 operator to come on the line. It would probably play hell with any forensic\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNine-one-one, what is your\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of her spiel was lost as the roar of an angry vampire filled the house.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Colin backed two quick steps away from the bedside, grabbing up the shotgun as he went. In the blink of an eye, Jeremy was in the room, fangs fully distended, eyes flashing red fire as he confronted the invader.</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d Colin said evenly. \u201cYou know me. You know I didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>The vampire stalked across the bedroom, his movements eerily graceful, gliding forward like a big hunting cat. He growled softly, threateningly, but his gaze kept flicking to Mariane, anguish replacing the rage on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling nine one one, Jeremy. Let me get some help for her.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s head snapped around at that, his gaze deadly cold despite the fires burning there. \u201cYou touch her and I\u2019ll kill you, human. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p> <p>Faster than Colin could follow, Jeremy was at the bedside, lifting Mariane in his arms, bloody tears rolling down his face as he saw what they\u2019d done to her. A low keening rose from his throat, rising in volume until it became a furious howl.</p><p>\u201cThere will be justice for this,\u201d he snarled, his gaze once again pinning Colin in place. \u201cMark my words, human. This will not go unavenged.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, nothing more than a blur of movement and a slam of noise as the front door hit the wall in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d Colin whispered. He lowered his head and just breathed, letting his body recover from an adrenaline rush that dwarfed whatever he\u2019d been feeling when he\u2019d first entered the house.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ.\u201d He sucked in a last deep breath and called 911 again, canceling the earlier call. Then he walked out to his truck and grabbed his gear. Jeremy might not want his help, but he was going to get it anyway. This was a crime scene and Colin was the closest thing they had to a police department in Cooper\u2019s Rest. Not that he was a real police officer. Legally, he was no more than private security, which meant this case fell under the jurisdiction of the County Sheriff. But the people around here didn\u2019t want the Sheriff or anyone else poking into their affairs, and that went double for the vampires who\u2019d elevated privacy to a fine art. That\u2019s why the self-appointed town council had hired him in the first place. He hadn\u2019t been to any police academy; the nearest he\u2019d come were a few criminology classes at the college down in the city. But he was qualified to handle just about every weapon that existed and could put a man, or a woman, on the ground in nothing flat, regardless of weight or training. He also had the ability to size up a situation and the confidence to deal with it. Which was what he intended to do with this one.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s Rest was his home now, the place he\u2019d somehow ended up in after leaving the Navy. This tiny village in northern Washington state was about as far from where he\u2019d grown up as it was possible to be, but it was a quiet, peaceful place, full of mostly good people who wanted to be left alone. And it suited him just fine.</p> <p>But now someone had invaded this peaceful place, had invaded his home, and Colin wasn\u2019t the kind of man to sit back and wait for someone else to see justice done. He was going to find whoever had done this. And when he did, he wasn\u2019t going worry about reading anyone their Miranda rights.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Vancouver, British Columbia</p><p>Sophia gripped the edges of the armrests, her nails gouging holes into the fine leather. She hated flying. She especially hated flying through the daylight hours, hated trusting her life to humans. She might be nearly three hundred years old, but that didn\u2019t mean she lived in the past. She watched CNN, went online and read the newspapers. She knew how often these planes fell out of the sky, right along with their human pilots and, maybe, vampire passengers.</p><p>It was possible, she mused, that a vampire could survive such a crash. Possible, but not certain. It was definitely not a theory she wished to test, nor did she want to learn whether a vampire could breathe underwater for however long it would take to reach land if the plane went down in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>Not that that particular outcome was a problem at this point. The ocean was no longer beneath her. Nor was the sun shining on the other side of the airplane\u2019s thin skin as it had been for much of the previous leg of her journey, which had taken her from her home in Rio de Janeiro to a stop in Toronto. She thanked whatever gods smiled on vampires that she at least had the resources to travel by private aircraft, one with a suitable sleep compartment for her daylight needs.</p><p>Of course, it would have been even more convenient if she\u2019d been able to fly to Texas, or even Mexico, from Rio and gone on from there to Vancouver. She could have limited her flying time to the hours of darkness. But the North American vampires, unlike those in most of South America, were obsessively territorial. She couldn\u2019t even pass through one of their stupid airports without getting permission, something she wasn\u2019t willing to do. Not for this trip.</p><p>There were too many unknowns this time. She didn\u2019t know what her Sire, Lucien, wanted. Didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d issued such an urgent summons and then disappeared on her before she could even get ahold of him. But there\u2019d been an undeniable note of desperation to his mental call, a desperation reinforced by the fact that he\u2019d contacted her at all. Lucien was her Sire, and her loyalty was his alone, but she hadn\u2019t even spoken to him in half a century. And now this. Whatever this was.</p> <p>The ground rushed up to meet the plane and she closed her eyes, feeling every bump and skid as it finally came to rest. Sophia breathed a deep sigh of relief and whispered a superstitious prayer of thanks to the God of her childhood that she\u2019d survived once again.</p><p>She only hoped she\u2019d also survive whatever Lucien had waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d Sophia demanded darkly.</p><p>\u201cDo we need a translator? Is that the problem, Sophia? I don\u2019t fucking know where he is, okay? He doesn\u2019t exactly check in with me.\u201d</p><p>Sophia leveled a flat stare at the vampire sitting across from her. Darren Yamanaka was Lucien\u2019s lieutenant. In name only, she thought viciously. She could squish him like a bug. She\u2019d probably quite enjoy it, in fact. Her eyes narrowed appraisingly, but Darren met her gaze without flinching. He wasn\u2019t as powerful as she was, but he wasn\u2019t weak either. And he had courage. She\u2019d give him that. What he didn\u2019t have was even the slightest clue as to the whereabouts of their mutual Sire.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see him?\u201d she asked with forced patience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, and no matter how many times you ask, the answer will be the same. Lucien walked out that very door eight days ago.\u201d He pointed dramatically across the big conference room and through the open double doors to the heavy front door of Lucien\u2019s Vancouver headquarters. \u201cHe said he was off to meet another of his women. You, of all people, should remember how fond Lucien is of his women.\u201d</p><p>Sophia held back the snarl rising from her throat, forcing herself to remain calm. She hadn\u2019t flown halfway around the world, risking her long immortal life, to lose her temper with this pipsqueak of a male. Everybody knew Lucien loved women. Hell, Lucien loved men, too. But the fact that Sophia had once been his lover, and that he\u2019d made her Vampire because he\u2019d been unwilling to lose her to human age and frailty . . . that was not something everyone knew. Although, Darren clearly did. Lucien had been telling tales before he\u2019d disappeared, the bastard.</p><p>\u201cWas he alone when he left? Not even a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darren admitted reluctantly. \u201cHe usually took someone with him, but not this time. He claimed the woman was someone he\u2019d known a long time, that it was safe. And that he could defend himself if it came to it. I argued with him. But . . . you know Lucien.\u201d</p><p>She did know Lucien. He was handsome, brilliant, utterly charming, and sometimes a complete idiot. Especially if a woman was involved.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he called me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no fucking idea. I don\u2019t even know if he really did. It\u2019s awfully convenient that Lucien disappears and now you show up. How long\u2019s it been, Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long enough, Darren,\u201d she said with saccharine sweetness, before her voice hardened. \u201cBut if you\u2019re suggesting I have in any way harmed our Sire, you should say good-bye to whoever is foolish enough to care for you because I will kill you where you stand.\u201d</p><p>He stood, leaning across the table, his eyes gleaming yellow. \u201cYou can try, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Sophia felt his power pressing against her, felt her own surging to meet his. She also stood, matching his aggressive stance, and pushed back just enough for him to feel the weight of it.</p><p>Darren\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, and he froze for a full minute before he slowly sank back into his chair. His gaze was riveted on her, like an animal that has just discovered a predator hiding in its nest.</p><p>Sophia smiled pleasantly and sat back down, satisfied for now. She didn\u2019t want to kill Darren. Not if she could avoid it. What she wanted was to find Lucien and discover what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cHave you looked for him?\u201d she asked in a mild voice.</p><p>Darren blinked, then said, \u201cOf course I have. We all have. He\u2019s alive, but you know that already. It\u2019s odd, though\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cOdd? What\u2019s odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you searched for him since you\u2019ve been in the city?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, puzzled. \u201cI haven\u2019t, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry. Then tell me what you find.\u201d</p><p>Sophia regarded the other vampire silently. Obviously, she couldn\u2019t trust him, but his concern for Lucien seemed real enough. And there was definitely something weird about all of this.</p><p>\u201cIs there somewhere secure?\u201d she asked abruptly. A thorough search for her Sire would require a level of consciousness that was almost a meditation. She would be vulnerable to attack, especially in this house.</p><p>Darren nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia waited until Darren had left, then shot the lock on the door and set her own barrier of power to secure it. She waited even longer, until the other vampire\u2019s footsteps had faded and she could no longer sense him nearby. Then she turned to regard what was clearly Lucien\u2019s private retreat. The sense of him was everywhere in here, and she was struck by a longing so sudden and so strong that it was a physical pain, as if her heart had stopped beating for a moment. What if the impossible had happened? What if someone had somehow taken down the powerful vampire lord who was her Sire? Was he dying even now, wasting away as she stood here squandering what little time he had left? She shook herself slightly and crossed the room, pulling open the French doors to the balcony beyond.</p><p>Bracing herself against the cold and wind, she stepped onto a balcony high above the city. Lucien\u2019s study was on the third floor of his manse, which was itself at the top of one of the steepest hills surrounding Vancouver. The skies were dark overhead, only the occasional star or glimpse of moon breaking the overcast. She longed for the warmth of her southern home, for the familiar pulse of life and vitality. She took in the lights twinkling down below. Although, she thought, Vancouver had a pulse of its own. Different, but no less alive.</p><p>Her gaze scanned the horizon. She had to give it to Darren. This was the perfect location from which to search for their master. Whatever the other vampire\u2019s feelings for her, he seemed genuine in his desire to help her find Lucien. Perhaps he loved their Sire as much as she did after all.</p> <p>Drawing a deep breath, Sophia closed her eyes and set aside her dislike of Darren, set aside the cold and the wind, the strange scents and sounds of this foreign city. From somewhere deep inside herself, she touched the invisible, unbreakable bond she shared with Lucien. He was her Sire, the vampire who had ended her life three centuries ago and given it back to her as something more, something eternal and strong and beautiful. Sophia loved being Vampire, delighted in the power it gave her, in the exquisite heightening of her senses until she could hear the soft fall of an orchid\u2019s blossom on a dark night. Certainly she missed the feel of the sun against her face, the smell of her skin after a day at the beach. But it was a small price to pay for what she\u2019d gained. And it was all because of Lucien who was missing and perhaps in trouble.</p><p>She stretched out her senses, drawing on all of her considerable power, and cast a net over the city</p><p>Hours later, she opened her eyes, exhaustion seeping through her pores, weakening every muscle in her body. She had searched through the night, had followed every trail, no matter how faint. And there were so many trails\u2014the traces of Lucien were everywhere in this city. This had been his home, his lair for hundreds of years. If there was a single street or alley where he had not walked, she hadn\u2019t found it. But the very pervasiveness of his scent was somehow wrong. He was alive. She was certain of that. But it was almost as if he\u2019d intentionally spread himself thin, so thin he barely existed in his own city anymore.</p><p>She shoved herself to her feet, shaking out legs gone almost numb from sitting in the same position for so long. Sunrise wasn\u2019t far off. She could feel it in the sluggishness of her blood, the dullness of her nerve endings. The time shift imposed by her rapid journey from South America only made it worse. Her body was telling her the sun had already risen, while her brain knew she still had an hour or so to get someplace safe and dark. Jet lag was hell on vampires, too.</p><p>She wondered if Darren was still about, or if she\u2019d have to find her own lodgings somewhere in this massive house. It had been much smaller when she\u2019d been here last, but she suspected some things hadn\u2019t changed. Either way, it hardly mattered. She\u2019d been providing her own safe havens for hundreds of years; this morning would be no different.</p> <p>She walked wearily back into Lucien\u2019s study, just in time to hear a timid knock on the door. She eyed the closed panel speculatively. It was a vampire; she knew that much. And it certainly wasn\u2019t Darren tapping so softly. She used power to release her personal shield and unlock the door. \u201cCome,\u201d she called out as she sank into one of Lucien\u2019s chairs.</p><p>The vampire who entered was tiny but most definitely adult, her breasts amply displayed by a tight-bodiced gown which gave lie to her childlike stature. She had to be very old, harkening back to a time and place when her diminutive height would have been the norm among women. But whatever her age, she had little or no power. Sophia wondered what it would be like to live that long as Vampire, but to be so weak that she was forever frozen on the bottom rungs of power.</p><p>The vampire smiled gently, as if she knew what Sophia was thinking. \u201cLady Sophia, I am Larissa, Lord Lucien\u2019s secretary.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way she said the word secretary told Sophia, she meant it in the old way, an assistant and a confidante. Sophia had never met her before, so she\u2019d probably come from one of Lucien\u2019s other cities sometime in the last hundred years, which was how long it had been since Sophia had been to Vancouver. But if Larissa had been close to Lucien, she just might know more about what went on with him than anyone else in the house.</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t offer to shake hands. Judging by her manner and dress, Larissa would not be one of those who embraced the modern custom. \u201cLarissa,\u201d she said, nodding, \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Larissa again gave her that knowing smile. \u201cYou are kind, my lady, but I am here to assist you. You will want a place to rest, yes?\u201d</p> <p>Sophia breathed a tired sigh. \u201cI will, thank you. And is there blood in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Lucien still maintain the guest cottages? If so, is the smallest available, the one in the gardens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire is already lit, my lady. Lucien was well familiar with your preferences. Shall I send the blood to the cottage, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be most appreciated. Thank you, Larissa.\u201d She stood and started to turn away, but then frowned as the meaning of Larissa\u2019s words penetrated her tired brain.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she called out. \u201cLucien told you I was coming to Vancouver?\u201d</p><p>Larissa nodded. \u201cSome weeks ago,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe told me you would be coming, my lady, and he left something for you. Only for you, he said.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stared at the tiny female. It had been days since Lucien had summoned her home, not weeks. \u201cWhat . . .\u201d She swallowed hard, suddenly certain that she didn\u2019t want to know the answer. \u201cWhat did he leave for me?\u201d she made herself ask anyway.</p> <p>Larissa crossed to a bookshelf, pulling aside several volumes to reveal a hidden wall safe. It was the older kind with a numbered dial rather than a keypad. She spun the dial several times and pulled open the door, reaching in to withdraw a fine, white envelope. Setting it on the shelf, she carefully closed the safe and replaced the books before turning to face Sophia once again and holding the envelope out to her.</p><p>Sophia met and held the other vampire\u2019s gaze for several minutes, searching for any sign of betrayal or malice. Finding none, she accepted the envelope, glancing down to see her name written in Lucien\u2019s extravagant script. Judging by the weight and heft, it held several sheets of folded paper. She stared at it a moment, then asked, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of it, but enough.\u201d</p><p>Sophia caught the note of sorrow in Larissa\u2019s voice and looked up, surprised and worried\u2014very worried\u2014to see the sheen of tears in her eyes. \u201cLarissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead what\u2019s there, Sophia,\u201d she whispered. She backed away and turned to leave, pausing by the door to say, \u201cIf you need anything, my lady, you have only to ask. I\u2019m here . . . in this house. Always.\u201d She pulled open the door and was gone, leaving Sophia to fear that Lucien had gotten himself into a mess that even he could not get himself out of. She could only hope it was nothing more than that.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>North of Seattle, Washington</p><p>The sleek, black limo glided through the sturdy gates of the new Seattle compound. They still called it that, although, in truth, it was no longer in Seattle. That city, once a haven for those seeking to get away from the crowds and congestion of places like L.A. and San Francisco, had become the very thing they\u2019d tried to escape.</p><p>For Raphael\u2019s vampires, that meant their old compound, which had once been located on ten acres of isolated countryside, had found itself in the middle of a crowded suburb. It had taken some time, but his people had finally located a suitable new site in the hills some distance from Seattle. They\u2019d bought up adjoining parcels this time, until they had a hundred acres as a hedge against future expansion. The new compound had taken nearly as long to build as it had to find the site. There were no humans Raphael would trust with such a commission, and those few vampires who were both trustworthy and sufficiently skilled were in great demand. Of course, they were also his own children, which gave him a certain priority in requesting their services, but above everything else, Raphael was a businessman. He wasn\u2019t about to demand that any of his vampires sacrifice their businesses just to save him a bit of time. Not unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>The limo took the final curve of the driveway and the main building came into view from behind the trees. Wei Chen, head of the Seattle nest, emerged onto the steps along with several others, standing under the gray, concrete overhang, waiting to greet him.</p><p>Cyn sat next to him in the limo, her long leg warm against his, their fingers laced together. She\u2019d been extra vigilant since his nightmare, almost obsessive about his security. She was armed, as always\u2014a .9 mm Glock in a shoulder rig beneath her jacket\u2014but she was also wearing a second identical weapon tucked against her lower back, into the waistband of her slacks. She hadn\u2019t even tried to hide it from him and had made clear her preference that he remain in the car until she\u2019d checked out who and what waited for them. His woman, his very human mate, thought it appropriate to put herself in danger for his protection. As if the phalanx of vampire guards deployed around them weren\u2019t enough, as if he wasn\u2019t visiting one of his own nests where every vampire present was pledged to him personally . . . or as if he wasn\u2019t fully capable of protecting himself and her, as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A wisp of pain tugged at his awareness and he stared out the rain-darkened window at the new compound\u2019s stark gray concrete and redwood construction, at the solemn faces of his assembled vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cyn asked abruptly.</p><p>He turned his head to meet her gaze, her green eyes boring into his with a sure knowledge of his moods.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSomething . . .\u201d His voice trailed away as he tried to capture whatever it was that had caught his attention. But there was so much emotion among the vampires in that building\u2014fear and grief, as well as pain at the terrible loss they\u2019d suffered. Surely that was it, that two of their number had been wiped from the earth as if they\u2019d never existed, their flames extinguished in seconds as their shocked cries bit into his soul. But that wasn\u2019t it. Or that wasn\u2019t everything. His gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he commanded. His driver hit the brakes, bringing the limo to a full stop before his conscious mind was aware of what he was doing. Raphael was only vaguely cognizant of the alarm spreading through the ranks of his security, of Cyn\u2019s voice calling his name as he opened the car door and stepped out into the wet night.</p><p>Wei Chen and the others hurried toward him, their faces creased with concern.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Raphael\u2019s lieutenant, Duncan, appeared at his side, while his Security Chief, Juro, calmly deployed various personnel to accommodate this new development. There was very little that could rattle Juro; it was why Raphael had chosen him.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Wei Chen was out of breath from the dash through the rain, testimony to his lack of any kind of routine physical activity.</p> <p>Raphael lifted his head, his gaze searching the elegant face of the building, his heart aching at the pain he felt there. \u201cJeremy,\u201d he realized suddenly. He turned an inquiring gaze upon Wei Chen, his black eyes beginning to gleam silver with anger. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Wei Chen? Where\u2019s Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>The nest leader met Raphael\u2019s regard without flinching. \u201cHis house was attacked earlier, my lord. His mate, Mariane\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael had stopped listening. He was already moving, heading for the main entrance, following a trail of pain that was as clear as if it were painted on the ground before him.</p><p>Wei Chen hurried to keep up with him. \u201cJeremy is in the infirmary with her, Sire. He\u2019s sharing his blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not be enough,\u201d Raphael said, knowing it was true. He pushed through the heavy glass doors, heedless of everything but the need of his child pulling him down the hall. One turn and another, and he was striding into what passed for an infirmary on the vampire compound.</p><p>It was a smallish room. Vampires rarely required more than a donor\u2019s blood and a few hours rest, and only the youngest vampires or the most serious injuries demanded even that. But in the far corner, beneath the dim glow of a wall lamp, a young woman lay in a bed that seemed too big for her delicate frame. Her face was nearly as pale as the sheets she lay upon, the white bindings upon her legs and arms still soaked with her life\u2019s blood.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy.\u201d</p><p>The vampire looked up at the sound of his Sire\u2019s voice, his face a mask of grief, streaked with the dried blood of his tears. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said brokenly, falling to his knees. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. My blood . . . It\u2019s not enough.\u201d His voice cracked as he began to sob, great wracking sounds that tore at Raphael\u2019s soul.</p><p>He went to the broken vampire, holding him as he would a child, his child, reborn as Vampire less than thirty years ago. Jeremy buried his face against his Sire\u2019s hip and Raphael stroked his head in comfort, examining the woman, Mariane, as he did so. He noted the shallow rise and fall of her chest, the sluggish beat of her heart, which was barely managing to push the blood through her body. The flesh of her fingers was already pale and cold, as her body shut down her extremities in favor of saving what vital organs it could.</p><p>\u201cIt is not too late, Jeremy,\u201d Raphael said for his vampire\u2019s ears only. \u201cLet me help her.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s head came up, hope warring with possessiveness for a brief moment before he nodded. \u201cI would beg you, my lord, if it would help her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head chidingly. \u201cYou are my own, blood of my blood. And Mariane is yours.\u201d</p><p>He gently disengaged from Jeremy and shrugged out of his suit jacket, letting the expensive garment fall heedlessly. He was aware of Cyn standing close behind him, aware of her hands catching the jacket as it fell, handing it off to someone else as he walked around to the opposite side of the bed. She followed, staying close by his side, and his heart wrenched at the thought of her lying in this sterile bed instead of poor Mariane.</p><p>Without pausing, he rolled up his sleeve and used his fangs to slice through the skin of his wrist and open a vein. Sitting on the bed and bending over the young woman, he placed his wrist over her mouth, letting the first few drops fall through her open lips. Jeremy hovered across from him, holding his mate\u2019s hand, whispering in her ear of his love for her, encouraging her to drink, to live for him.</p> <p>Mariane\u2019s throat moved spasmodically, her body forcing her to swallow before the blood choked her. Something stirred behind her closed eyelids and she swallowed again, and then again, before her thin, pale hands came up to hold Raphael\u2019s life-giving wrist to her mouth. She began to suck greedily at the bounty that was his blood\u2014the blood of a vampire lord, more powerful than anything produced in centuries of human medical research.</p><p>She was suckling like a hungry child, and Jeremy\u2019s avid gaze was fixed on the physical connection between his Sire and his mate. His stress over that contact was growing with every second. Vampires were possessive creatures, even one so new as Jeremy. Raphael pulled his wrist away carefully, letting Jeremy take the woman\u2019s hands when she would have grabbed for more. She mewed unhappily at the loss, and Jeremy covered her lips with a kiss, licking the blood from her mouth and feeding it back to her as their tongues twined.</p><p>Duncan handed Raphael a warm, wet towel to clean the blood from his arm. He remained seated on the bed, absently wiping the towel over his wrist as he watched Jeremy kiss Mariane\u2019s hungry mouth. He handed the towel back to Duncan and held out his hand to Cyn. She came to him, placing her hand on his shoulder, dropping her cheek briefly to brush against his head.</p><p>\u201cJeremy.\u201d</p><p>The other vampire looked up, his eyes wary, his fingers tightening anxiously on Mariane\u2019s pale hands.</p><p>Raphael rolled down his shirt sleeve casually, the self-inflicted wound already healing. He stood, taking Cyn\u2019s hand and pulling her into the circle of light. \u201cMy mate,\u201d he said for Jeremy\u2019s benefit. He lifted Cyn\u2019s fingers to his lips. \u201cCynthia.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s entire body relaxed at those words. If Raphael had a mate of his own, he could not be interested in stealing Mariane. Raphael understood. \u201cShe will be well, Jeremy. And if you need me further, I am here.\u201d</p><p>As Raphael prepared to leave, Jeremy fell to his knees, taking his Sire\u2019s hand and kissing it in gratitude. \u201cMy lord . . .\u201d His voice broke with emotion. \u201cSire. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael disengaged his hand lightly, resting it instead on Jeremy\u2019s bent head. \u201cYou are my child,\u201d he murmured. There was nothing else that needed saying.</p><p>He looked up and met his lieutenant\u2019s eyes, letting a little bit of his anger show for the first time since arriving. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Duncan turned and began hustling the gathered vampires from the room, murmuring orders via a throat mike to Juro and the others. Cynthia held out Raphael\u2019s jacket, holding it as he slipped it over his arms and up onto his shoulders, her hands smoothing it across his back before he turned to face her. Unshed tears filled her eyes and he smiled. His Cyn wore a mask of toughness, a shield against a world that had shown her little love for most of her life. But there was a soft spot that only he could touch. He pulled her close, kissing her gently.</p><p>\u201cLubimaya,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her warm fingers lingered on his jaw, then slipped behind his neck to tug him closer and press her forehead against his. \u201cWhen do we go after the bastards who did this?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He pulled back to meet her fierce gaze with one of his own. \u201cVery soon, my Cyn.\u201d He urged her out of the room, his hand resting low on her back. \u201cWe will hunt them to the ends of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Raphael allowed Wei Chen to lead the way from the infirmary. He\u2019d seen enough blueprints of this new compound that he didn\u2019t need a guide, but this was the first time he\u2019d been here since its completion. A visit had been planned for the near future, albeit under very different circumstances. Who could have foreseen the murder of two of his own, the attempted murder of a third and . . . His jaw tightened at what had been done to Mariane. She had been defenseless against them. She wasn\u2019t a warrior, not like his Cyn. But he was all too aware that even Cyn could be overwhelmed when faced with that sort of brutality.</p><p>He pulled her closer with the slight pressure of his fingers. She obliged, but glanced up at him, questioning. He gave her a faint smile meant to be reassuring, although he knew it didn\u2019t succeed. It would have been easier, he thought, if he\u2019d fallen in love with a stupid woman, or at least one willing to ignore the more troublesome aspects of life. Cyn was none of those things. She was smart and intuitive, especially, it seemed, when it came to him, and her preferred method of dealing with trouble was to confront it head on. It was precisely those qualities that had drawn him to her in the first place\u2014the first time they\u2019d met, when she\u2019d been smart enough to fear him, but too stubborn to give in to that fear.</p><p>He admired that about her. But it also terrified him when he thought about all the things in the world that could rip through that stubbornness and tear her apart. Like they had Mariane.</p><p>Their group moved into the gathering room of the compound\u2019s main building, a spacious living space with high ceilings and a wall of glass granting a spectacular view down the hillside, across the city far below and on to the distant bay. It was early enough that the city was still full of light, but the ocean was a black, empty space, too remote for the tiny running lights from the boats anchored there to be seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room was furnished casually, with leather couches and armchairs scattered about in an almost random pattern. Since only vampires lived here, the heavy furniture was moved about to suit whoever was using the room at any given time.</p><p>Taking Cyn with him, he made his way to a collection of several large armchairs positioned directly in front of the window, but facing inward. His security people spread throughout the room, with a couple stationed behind him, between his chair and the empty window. The windows were bulletproof, of course, and the possibility of an attack negligible within the compound, but it was a risk Juro would not be willing to take.</p><p>He sat down, nodding for Wei Chen and the others to sit with him. Duncan took up his usual station to his master\u2019s left, while Cyn slouched on the wide arm of the chair to his right, leaning in to rest her arm on his near shoulder. She still wore her weapons, despite the fact they were now safely within not just the compound, but the building itself with its formidable security. She and Duncan had joined forces in urging him not to make this trip, saying it was too dangerous. What if it was a trap? What if the humans were killing his vampires one by one to lure in the biggest prize of all\u2014not just a vampire, but a vampire lord? He forced back a growl at the memory of their arguments, all of which he\u2019d rejected. He had to be here. These were his vampires who were dying.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael was jerked out of his thoughts by Wei Chen\u2019s soft voice. He speared the nest leader with a fierce gaze. \u201cI want details, Wei Chen. Everything you\u2019ve discovered about these murders and who\u2019s behind them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d He gestured at a vampire sitting next to him. \u201cLoren is our security\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of who Loren is,\u201d Raphael interrupted coldly.</p><p>Wei Chen\u2019s lips trembled slightly. \u201cForgive me, my lord. Would you prefer Loren to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who gives the report, as long as someone starts talking.\u201d</p><p>The nest leader paled so badly that Raphael feared he would topple over where he sat. As a vampire, Wei Chen\u2019s power was greater than any other vampire in the nest, although not nearly as strong as most of Raphael\u2019s closest security staff. However, Wei Chen was not a fighter, which was why he lived here. The Seattle compound reflected its environs. This had never been a high risk area before the recent murders. The vampires here maintained a fairly low profile. They were mostly professionals, many of them computer experts of one sort or another\u2014vampire geeks Cyn called them in private. Most worked exclusively via computer or phone, rarely if ever meeting in person with their clients and/or human counterparts. Wei Chen was a financial consultant, chosen to lead the compound because of his corporate mentality and a natural ability to manage others.</p><p>\u201cLoren, perhaps you could give us the specific details of what has happened thus far,\u201d Duncan, ever the diplomat, said, easing the tension which had been sucking the air out of the room.</p><p>Loren glanced at Duncan, then met Raphael\u2019s gaze and gave a self-assured nod. He opened a folder on his lap and began speaking. \u201cSire, as you know there have been two previous attacks, three now, after this vicious assault on Jeremy\u2019s mate. I think it probable that the target of this latest atrocity was, in fact, Jeremy himself, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d They all looked up as Jeremy walked slowly into the room, his exhaustion obvious, but his face full of determination. \u201cThey tortured Mariane, trying to force her to reveal my location. She refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d Raphael acknowledged. \u201cYour mate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is well, my lord, thanks to you. I bless whatever chance of fate brought you here this evening. A human doctor from your retinue is examining her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter Saephan,\u201d Raphael confirmed. \u201cHe is an excellent healer, and I have trusted him with the life of my own mate on more than one occasion.\u201d He twisted his mouth in a wry smile, acknowledging to himself if to no one else, the reality that repeatedly drew Cyn into situations requiring Dr. Saephan\u2019s skilled care.</p><p>\u201cI will tell Mariane. Thank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded a silent acknowledgment, but Jeremy lingered, his thin frame vibrating with the effort of maintaining his dignity in the face of tonight\u2019s terrible trauma. He seemed to be warring with himself over some internal debate, until finally he approached Raphael and dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI was with her, my lord,\u201d Jeremy whispered. \u201cI was there.\u201d His eyes, when they met Raphael\u2019s, were full of guilt. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t reach her. I tried,\u201d he said desperately, more to convince himself, Raphael thought, than anyone else.</p><p>Jeremy drew a deep breath and seemed to gather himself. His back stiffened and when he spoke next, his voice with firm with resolve, \u201cI am not a soldier, my lord. I know this. But I wish to join you in bringing down these animals. The blood of my mate has earned me a place in the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Raphael heard the unvoiced desperation in his plea. Jeremy\u2019s blood had not been enough to save Mariane\u2019s life. That it was Raphael\u2019s blood which saved her lessened the pain of his failure, because Raphael was master to every vampire in this compound, his power so far beyond theirs that it transcended description. But still, his failure to save his mate himself would sting. He could, however, avenge this attack on her.</p><p>\u201cYour assistance will be invaluable, Jeremy. You know the area and you know the people. And through you, your mate can tell us much about these creatures who dared attack her. On my word, Jeremy, they will pay the ultimate price.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy\u2019s head fell to his chest, his long, dark hair covering his face before he raised eyes now brimming with gratitude. \u201cThank you, Sire.\u201d</p><p>Raphael studied his child carefully, noting the tension in his stiff gait as he climbed to his feet and took a chair nearby. He ached for Jeremy and would rather have spared him the retelling of the night\u2019s awful events, but it was necessary. And far better that Jeremy tell him, than ask Mariane to relive it.</p><p>Loren moved to sit next to Jeremy and began a low-voiced conversation. Cyn took the opportunity to lean close to Raphael\u2019s ear and whisper, \u201cWill he know what happened?\u201d Her question was voiced softly enough that, even in a room full of vampires, it was for him only.</p><p>Raphael responded in kind, saying, \u201cJeremy is young, but they\u2019ve been mated a few years. His connection to her should be strong enough for him to have seen most of what happened. It will be enough.\u201d He felt Cyn breathe out a sigh of relief next to him.</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d Raphael said more loudly.</p><p>The vampire immediately cut off whatever he\u2019d been saying to Loren and faced Raphael.</p><p>\u201cMy mate, Cynthia, will begin the questioning. She is a trained and experienced investigator, quite skilled in these matters, especially when it comes to humans. Her insight will be particularly helpful.\u201d</p><p>Cyn sat up straight, leaving a cool spot on his arm as she withdrew the warmth of her body. Raphael glanced up at her and caught a frown of concentration, followed by a gentle smile for Jeremy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with some questions about the events of that afternoon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be painful for you, and I\u2019m sorry. I wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary, please believe that. But every detail matters. You never know what might be the one thing that gives them away.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy nodded, swallowing nervously.</p><p>Cyn leaned forward, her posture and gaze intent. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start with the basics. Was Mariane home when these guys broke into the house?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his gaze haunted. \u201cShe was out. Our house is very secure, but they smashed through the back door with an ax. They must have hidden their vehicles and waited for her to return. I knew when she arrived home, I felt her presence\u2014she always enters through the front door\u2014and then I felt her terror. They grabbed her before she even realized they were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mariane normally awake during the day?\u201d Cyn asked. \u201cForgive me if this is private, but . . . she doesn\u2019t sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost days she does, yes. But on some days, she remains awake to run errands. She shops in Cooper\u2019s Rest, which is the small town near here, and on rare occasions she drives down to the city below. She buys food for herself and does whatever else needs doing. There\u2019s the mail to be picked up, of course. And sometimes . . . sometimes Mariane simply wants to enjoy the sunlight.\u201d</p><p>Cyn nodded, and Raphael knew she would understand Mariane\u2019s need for sunlight. It was the same reason Cyn kept her condo just down the beach from his estate. She didn\u2019t live there anymore, but she still spent time there on occasion, sitting in the sunlight, walking along the water in the warm sand.</p><p>Cyn spoke again, drawing Raphael out of his reverie. \u201cDoes she follow a routine? Maybe certain days of the week, every other Monday or something?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy frowned, concentrating. \u201cPerhaps. Not specific days, but she does go into town at least twice a month. Usually in the morning. And when she comes home, she remains awake\u2014cleaning, making phone calls, sometimes sitting on the porch if the weather is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would know about this besides you?\u201d Cyn asked. \u201cDoes she have any friends here? Maybe someone she meets for coffee? Does she go anyplace in particular?\u201d</p><p>Raphael saw Jeremy\u2019s brow lower in a troubled frown. He was a very young vampire and his relationship with Mariane even newer. The suggestion that she could be meeting anyone, possibly even another male, while Jeremy slept would rouse his possessive instincts. And unlike Raphael, who was old enough and powerful enough to sense whatever Cyn was doing at all times, Jeremy would not usually have a link strong enough to follow his mate through a normal, uneventful few hours. It was only the traumatic nature of the attack that had forced their link into full-blown awareness for the duration. That and the fact that, while Jeremy had probably been sleeping in a vault below ground, he would not have been far from where Mariane was being brutally assaulted.</p><p>\u201cShe goes to the post office,\u201d Jeremy was repeating. \u201cAnd the grocery store. I\u2019ve never gone with her. I don\u2019t generally go into town at all. My business is at home, mostly via computer or phone. The truth is, unless they\u2019re Vampire, I very rarely meet anyone in person, not even my clients.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is your business?\u201d she asked. Raphael had seen her do this before, using routine questions to relax the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an accountant, a CPA. I do taxes mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well did you know Marco? Or Preston?\u201d Cyn asked, naming the two dead vampires.</p> <p>Jeremy shook his head. \u201cI knew them, naturally. We\u2019d met a handful of times, I suppose, here at the compound. I didn\u2019t do their taxes or anything, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. They did their own. Computer geeks, you know,\u201d he gave a half smile. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a program for everything.\u201d His smile fled. \u201cOr they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cyn was still sitting next to him, close enough that Raphael felt her draw a fortifying breath before continuing. She was no more eager to hear the details of this outrage than Jeremy was to tell them, but she would do what needed to be done. He rested his hand lightly against her back, offering his support.</p><p>\u201cI need you to tell me what happened during the attack, Jeremy. I\u2019m going to ask that you leave nothing out, no matter how ugly, no matter how painful. I\u2019ll try not to interrupt you with questions; I\u2019ll save those for later. Just take your time.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy glanced from Cyn to Raphael and back, then nodded and began talking.</p><p>By the time the story had been told in full, with Jeremy\u2019s voice breaking over and over again as he was forced to remember his mate\u2019s agony, the anger of Raphael\u2019s vampires was a sharp, bitter tide of emotion in the room. He scanned them slowly, sharing their outrage, but mindful, too, of the potential for disaster. Their anger would be useful once they began hunting their prey, but that would not happen tonight. He was aware of Duncan standing next to him, hyperalert and as watchful as Raphael himself. From across the room, Juro met his gaze silently, shifting slightly to block the closed doors.</p> <p>And sitting beside him, tears overflowing her eyes as she listened to the story, her hands fisted in a frustrated anger of her own, was his Cyn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d recognize their voices,\u201d Jeremy was saying, his voice all but a whisper now. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see any of their faces. They kept those black ski masks on the whole time. And when I woke at last, they were gone. When I saw her . . . I was nearly mad with grief. The only thing keeping me sane was the need to get help for her. I knew she was alive, barely, but alive. Colin was trying to help when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cyn straightened abruptly. \u201cColin?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWho\u2019s Colin?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy blinked. \u201cHe\u2019s, I guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin Murphy,\u201d Loren provided. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of the police in Cooper\u2019s Rest.\u201d</p><p>Cyn scowled. \u201cSort of? How can someone be sort of the police? I thought you guys were under the County Sheriff\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are,\u201d the security chief agreed reluctantly. \u201cBut we\u2019re a long way from the nearest Sheriff\u2019s station. They\u2019re not eager to drive all the way out here, and frankly, we\u2019re not that eager to call them. And it\u2019s not just us either,\u201d he added, indicating his fellow vampires. \u201cThe human locals here about tend to be loners for the most part. There\u2019s probably more than a few survivalists among them, although not all will admit to it.</p><p>\u201cColin Murphy\u2019s a former Navy SEAL. He did more than ten years before he decided to get out while he still had a few bones intact. The stories he tells . . .\u201d Loren shook his head admiringly, before looking around and cleaning his throat. \u201cThat is, he\u2019s a skillful guy. Knows weapons, martial arts, tactics, and a bunch of other stuff I\u2019m sure he can\u2019t talk about. He came here with a buddy when he got out, a guy named Garry McWaters. McWaters grew up here, but he didn\u2019t stay long. His family were all dead or moved away, and he couldn\u2019t take the weather anymore.</p><p>\u201cBut for some reason, Colin stuck. He\u2019s a good guy. Takes care of nuisance calls, checks on the old ladies, hustles the drunks out of town, that sort of thing. If someone suspected something bad was going on over at Jeremy\u2019s that day, Colin would be the one they\u2019d call.\u201d</p><p>Cyn returned her attention to Jeremy. \u201cSo this Colin was there when you woke up?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy nodded. \u201cI think he was calling an ambulance or something. He had his phone out, and I knew even then that he was trying to help, but . . . I kind of went off on him anyway.\u201d He looked away uncomfortably, still young enough to be embarrassed by what he saw as a loss of control.</p><p>\u201cYour mate was under attack,\u201d Raphael reassured him. \u201cYou lay there for hours, knowing what was happening, and unable to come to her aid. And then you woke to find a human with his hands on her.\u201d He shook his head slightly. \u201cThis Colin Murphy is lucky to be alive. I don\u2019t know if I could have shown such restraint.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy flushed with pleasure at Raphael\u2019s praise, then drew a breath and continued more strongly. \u201cColin backed away as soon as he saw me. I picked up Mariane and brought her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should talk to him,\u201d Cyn said, turning to Raphael. It was more of a statement than a suggestion, but Raphael hesitated. \u201cI need to know what he found when he got there, Raphael,\u201d she added in a low, urgent voice. \u201cIt\u2019s possible he arrived soon after the attackers left. He might have seen something more, something Jeremy didn\u2019t notice because he was so focused on Mariane. Besides, if he\u2019s the law in town, it might be useful to have him on board with our investigation. If nothing else, he knows the people and that gives our own hunt the imprimatur of the local authorities, such as they are.\u201d</p> <p>Loren was watching Raphael, waiting for his decision.</p><p>\u201cArrange a meeting for tomorrow night,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Loren said immediately.</p><p>Raphael stood and everyone stood with him. \u201cThank you, Jeremy. I know this was painful. Return to your mate, now. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy bowed briefly. \u201cThank you, Sire.\u201d The vampire was visibly exhausted. Even with Raphael\u2019s assistance, the depletion of Jeremy\u2019s strength would be severe, his mate\u2019s need a constant drain. He paused for a few seconds, long enough to steady himself before walking slowly out of the room.</p><p>Raphael raked his gaze over the remaining vampires. \u201cAn outrage has been perpetrated on us, and it will not stand. No one . . . no one touches what is mine and lives. Prepare yourselves, gentlemen. Tomorrow, we hunt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Vancouver, British Columbia</p><p>True to Larissa\u2019s word, the cottage was already warm by the time Sophia made her way through the garden. Given the size of Lucien\u2019s manse, she was certain there were plenty of guest rooms in its basement. But she preferred the privacy of these old cottages, and this one in particular. Although spacious enough for comfort, it was nonetheless the smallest of the three guest houses and the farthest from the main building. But it was also the most secure. Like all the others, the windows were for show only, completely blocked by sealed metal shutters inside. That alone made it safe enough for most vampires. But this particular cottage also had a basement level, accessed through a hidden door beneath the floor of the generous closet. Decades ago, Lucien had shown it to her, the last time she\u2019d visited him here in Vancouver.</p><p>Sophia opened her suitcase and began hanging up the few clothes she\u2019d brought with her, delaying the inevitable moment when she\u2019d have to open Lucien\u2019s envelope. She held up a wrinkled silk blouse, wondered if it was worth getting the thing cleaned and pressed, when there was a knock on the cottage door. She listened carefully first, then reached out with her vampiric senses. It was a human male, probably one of the servants with her blood.</p><p>She dropped the blouse and crossed the room, verifying before opening the door that no one but the single human waited on the other side. The cottage\u2019s low light cast a yellow square of illumination on the man who stood on the narrow porch step. He was taller than she was\u2014most men were anymore\u2014although this one was not by much. She judged him to be in his late twenties, pretty, slender and boyish in the way she liked her men to be these days. His dark good looks and soft brown eyes reminded her of the lovely young men so common to the cafes and clubs she frequented in Rio de Janeiro. She eyed him appreciatively, up and down, frowning when she saw that his hands were empty. Maybe this wasn\u2019t her blood delivery, after all.</p><p>\u201cMistress,\u201d he whispered, those big eyes lingering briefly on her face before dropping submissively.</p><p>Sophia barely managed to hide her grimace of distaste. She\u2019d forgotten Lucien\u2019s penchant for blood slaves, which meant he rarely had bagged blood on hand. Not that his slaves weren\u2019t willing donors\u2014Lucien didn\u2019t keep any other kind. And it wasn\u2019t that she objected to taking blood from the vein. Quite the contrary. All of her young men in Rio were very much aware of what she was and more than willing to spend a night, or longer, with her. It was a rare thing that she resorted to bagged blood anymore.</p><p>But none of her lovers were blood slaves, either, those men and women who existed solely to be used by their vampire masters, humans who hungered for the sexual release that such use provided. It was an addiction every bit as powerful as the drugs sold in dark alleys all over the world. And like any addiction, it could be used as a weapon against the addict, forcing them to perform unspeakable acts, to endure horrific treatment that too frequently crossed the line into torture.</p><p>Lucien\u2019s slaves were all well cared for, however. She gave him that much. Abuse was never tolerated, not in this house. Even so, his slaves were so . . . pathetically eager. With an emphasis on the pathetic.</p><p>She sighed. It was too late to arrange for something less personal, so it was either this lovely young man or she\u2019d have to wait until tomorrow night. She suspected tomorrow would be even worse than today because the one thing she knew, there would be nothing good in that elegant envelope of Lucien\u2019s.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cCome in, gato.\u201d</p><p>The slave was certainly skilled. Sophia wondered if Lucien had perhaps trained this one himself. Her Sire was quite the hedonist when it came to his lovers, choosing men and women equally. And always the pretty ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aurelio\u2014probably not his real name, but one chosen to appeal to her\u2014moaned softly as she pulled him away from her naked breast, fisting a hand in his dark hair and tugging lazily. He twisted his head away obediently, baring his neck in a fine, taut line of golden skin. There wasn\u2019t time for a true seduction, but she had played with him a bit, letting him earn his pleasure, building the anticipation. She might not keep any blood slaves of her own, but she understood them, understood their need to earn their reward. An odd sort of reward in her mind, but, as the French were wont to say, chacun ses go\u00fbts. Although she was fairly certain that not even the most esoteric of gourmands had actual blood drinking in mind.</p><p>Pretty Aurelio whimpered when she teased him, rolling him over until he was beneath her, licking a long line down his neck and breathing against it softly, smiling when the skin prickled with goose bumps. Her fangs punctured the soft velvet of his vein without warning. He groaned, a guttural sound of pure pleasure as his already stiff cock hardened even further against her thigh. Sophia drank deeply, relishing that first hot rush of blood down her throat, feeling it spread throughout her body, replenishing tissues dehydrated by the long flight and the stress of everything that had happened since. She was suddenly glad Lucien kept his stable of blood slaves. She\u2019d needed this; no bagged blood could have nourished her so completely.</p><p>One more long draught and she began to slow, careful to take only what she needed, only what the human male could afford. A few more delicate sips, savoring the bouquet of his blood, untainted as it was by alcohol or drugs, and she withdrew her fangs slowly, pausing to nip playfully as his flesh before licking his skin clean and closing the small wounds.</p> <p>Sophia closed her eyes, sated and ready to rest, the long journey catching up with her at last. But there was Aurelio to tend to. He lay perfectly still beneath her, so careful to make no demand for his own completion, but she could feel his heart pounding, could hear the heated thrumming of his blood as it headed in a single direction. Toward that ever hardening shaft between his legs.</p><p>Sophia let her gaze travel along his sweat-sheened body, always willing to admire a beautiful male form. She trailed her hand slowly over the curve of his collarbones, down past the flat, hairless planes of his solid chest until she encountered the silky line of hair arrowing straight to his groin. She purred quietly in approval as her fingers closed around his straining erection, feeling him tremble beneath her as he struggled to remain still.</p><p>She stroked him slowly at first, admiring his discipline, admiring even more the fine piece of flesh she held in her hand. As hard as marble, it was satiny smooth and elegantly shaped. Long and thick with a well-formed head, the narrow scar of his circumcision so exquisitely sensitive that he shivered every time she touched it, which she did again, delighting in his moan of entreaty, begging her wordlessly to release him.</p><p>\u201cSssshh, Aurelito,\u201d she bent to murmur against his ear. \u201cAre you ready to come for me?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fluttered, his cock jumping in her hand. \u201cYes, please, mistress,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Sophia tightened her hold on him, squeezing and releasing as she played her fingers over the warm, golden skin. \u201cThen, come for me, gato. Come now.\u201d</p><p>Aurelio\u2019s eyes flew open, rolling back in his skull until only the whites were visible, grunting low in his throat as he thrust uncontrollably against her hand, his long-delayed orgasm spurting between her fingers, onto his thighs and belly until he was spent.</p><p>Sophia remained still, giving him time to recover, letting his heart and breathing slow to something approaching normal. She waited as long as she could, but the sun was very close now and she wanted to be underground before it arrived.</p><p>\u201cAurelio,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>His eyes opened, cheeks flaming red with embarrassment. \u201cForgive me, my lady,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe calm. You served me well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d he said fervently. He grabbed the loose, linen pants he\u2019d worn to the door and wiped himself quickly before standing and pulling the now sticky garment up his legs and tightening the drawstring closure.</p><p>Sophia eyed his tight ass appreciatively as he did so, wishing she\u2019d had longer to play tonight.</p><p>But it was not to be.</p><p>She stood, barefoot, but still fully dressed, except for her shirt, which gaped open, her breasts displayed, the nipples flushed and hard after Aurelio\u2019s dedicated attention. The blood slave cast surreptitious glances at her, but Sophia made no move to cover herself. She took pleasure in the knowledge of her body\u2019s appeal to males, whether human or vampire.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aurelio,\u201d she said, opening the door to the garden. \u201cI am very pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, mistress. It was my honor.\u201d</p><p>Sophia watched him hurry into the cold night, shivering in sympathy of the few clothes he wore. Perhaps one became used to these temperatures if one lived here long enough. Closing the door quickly, she locked and bolted it, then turned and stared at Lucien\u2019s envelope where it sat on a charming antique bureau.</p><p>Sighing impatiently, she shook off a curious sense of foreboding and crossed immediately to the bureau. She picked up the letter, taking it with her as she hurried to the closet and its secret entrance. Taking the few steep stairs downward, she closed and locked the door behind her, then sank onto the thick mattress which served as a bed in the tight quarters.</p> <p>Legs crossed beneath her, she slid a scarlet fingernail beneath the seal and sliced it open, withdrawing a single, folded sheet of paper. A photograph tumbled to the floor and she bent over to pick it up, frowning at the three people pictured there. Two men and a woman. None of whom she knew.</p><p>Laying the photograph aside, she unfolded the piece of heavy linen writing paper and found it covered in Lucien\u2019s handwriting. Sophia\u2019s heart sank as she began to read.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Raphael sighed as the vault door closed behind him and he listened as Cyn locked them in with a series of muted thuds. This room was below ground, accessed by a private elevator and reserved for his exclusive use when visiting the Seattle compound. All of his vampires here slept their days underground, secure in a state-of-the-art vault like this one, which, once closed, could be opened only from the inside, except by Raphael or the nest\u2019s leader or security chief. Within the larger vault, each vampire had a private sleeping chamber. Raphael\u2019s private room was in a separate wing, more spacious and better appointed, but it was no more or less secure than those of the other vampires in the compound.</p><p>Cyn threw her leather jacket over a chair, slipped off the shoulder holster and popped the magazine from her Glock before coming close enough to lean into him and wrap her arms around his waist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Marco and Preston,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were with you a long time.\u201d</p><p>Raphael circled her slender shoulders and pulled her against his chest, taking comfort from her presence. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she teased gently. \u201cBesides, after that last New Mexico trip of yours, I swore I\u2019d never let you leave me behind again. I was miserable the whole time you were gone.\u201d</p><p>Raphael smiled into her sweet-smelling hair and let himself be distracted from the horrible night. \u201cWere you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She jabbed him in the side. \u201cLike you weren\u2019t. Besides, who will take care of you if I\u2019m not here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan? Juro, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObtuse. I suppose that\u2019s better than your usual epithet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one would that be?\u201d</p><p>Raphael snorted dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m hardly going to provide ammunition for my own execution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he murmured, gliding his hands down over her back to cup her ass. \u201cNot what I had in mind, no.\u201d</p><p>Cyn pressed herself closer, rising up onto her toes to reach his mouth. \u201cHow long before sunrise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than an hour, sweet Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hurry then.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed, and it felt good. He swept her up in his arms, crossed to the bed in a few strides and dropped her onto its wide expanse. \u201cClothes, lubimaya,\u201d he said. \u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic,\u201d she murmured as she kicked off her boots, then lay back on the bed to unbutton and unzip her slacks, shimmying them under her sweet ass and down her legs in a way that had his cock growing heavy against his thighs. He tore off his own clothing, tossing it to one side as he watched Cyn tug her sweater over her head, leaving her in nothing but a sheer bra that enticed more than it covered and a matching bit of lace between her legs.</p><p>Raphael eyed that bit of lace and growled as he shed the last of his own clothing, prowling over to the bed and tugging her closer, until her hips rode the very edge. \u201cOff,\u201d he repeated with a snarl. He snapped the two thin bits of satin holding the triangle of lace in place and tossed it over his shoulder. He reached for the bra, but Cyn was already there, freeing her beautiful breasts as he spread her legs around his hips and slipped his hands beneath her ass, holding her open to him.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Scenting her arousal, he plunged into her tight sheath without warning, pushing himself in as deep as he could go. She was ready for him, as he\u2019d known she would be, and she hummed with pleasure as his penetration stretched her open around his cock, her muscles straining against his thickness. She shivered with desire, growing wetter, slicker and hotter, warming his cock, welcoming him home.</p><p>He wanted to fuck her, to slam his cock over and over into the human heat of her until he forgot everything but the sheer sensuous pleasure of her luscious body pulsing around him. Until he was coated in her creamy juices as she screamed his name.</p><p>She looked up, her green eyes narrow and sparking with desire, her gaze never leaving his as she deliberately began caressing her own breasts, cupping them provocatively, squeezing and releasing. She took a nipple between her thumb and fingers, rolling until it was hard and full, and then moved to the other breast. She raised her fingers to her mouth and licked them thoroughly, until they glistened with moisture. Raphael watched, his cock throbbing as he began to move slowly, in and out of her silken body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cyn blinked lazily, rubbing those wet fingers over her breasts, trailing down the flat span of her belly to slip between the plump folds of her sex. Holding herself open, she began to circle her clit, her breath catching as he thrust harder, faster, his arms stretched taut and stiff to either side of her, so he could watch her play with herself, watch her sensitive pearl swell with desire, flushing pink with blood as it responded eagerly to the stimulation of her fingers.</p><p>Cyn\u2019s breath shuddered from her lungs and she leaned back, eyes closed, face gleaming with sweat as she fought her orgasm.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, sweet Cyn. Let me feel you shudder around my cock.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a small moan, trembling as she whispered, \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>He stretched forward and took her breast into his mouth, sucking hard, letting his teeth graze along the soft flesh and lapping up the small trickle of blood. Cyn\u2019s breath grew fast and shallow, her fingers tangled in his hair now, holding him close, urging him to grant her other breast the same treatment. He obliged willingly, swirling his tongue over the engorged nipple and sucking hard, biting just enough to release a taste of her succulent blood.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, God. Raphael, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what, my Cyn?\u201d he crooned, laving her breast and driving himself deeper into her body, feeling her growing even hotter and slicker with every new thrust.</p><p>Her eyes flashed open, her nails scraping down his back as she nearly screamed her demand. \u201cRaphael!\u201d</p> <p>He bit her nipple, eliciting a fresh sob of pleasure as he licked his way between her breasts and over her tender collarbone, closing his teeth on the taut tendons of her shoulder before moving up to rub his lips over the swell of her jugular. He inhaled deeply, smelling the delicious scent of her blood, the tantalizing aroma of her arousal.</p><p>Cyn moaned, tightening her arms around his shoulders, crushing his chest against the hard mounds of her nipples, the heavy fullness of her breasts. Her hips were moving in time with his now, shoving against him, the muscles of her stomach clenching as her womb convulsed, sending tremors rippling along his cock deep inside her.</p><p>He licked her neck one last time, blowing on the wet skin, feeling her shiver. \u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he whispered against her heated flesh. As he sank his teeth into her jugular, her body arched beneath him, the orgasm seizing her hard and tumbling her into ecstasy. She gasped his name, her breath stolen away, tears streaming down her cheeks as pleasure overwhelmed her and she convulsed helplessly in climax.</p><p>Raphael let the sweet flow of her blood fill his mouth and roll down his throat like warm honey, hardening his cock until he groaned with the need to come. He threw his head back and roared as he found his own orgasm, pumping his release deep into his mate\u2019s trembling body, feeling her legs tighten around him, holding him, caressing him, draining him dry.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Lucien\u2019s words were still with Sophia when she woke the next night, sitting like a weight on her chest. She threw aside the many down-filled blankets, suddenly feeling suffocated instead of warmed by their presence. A small exertion of her will and candles flared, lighting the dreary little dungeon where she\u2019d spent the day.</p> <p>She folded the letter carefully, touching the single pink tear staining one corner, evidence of Lucien\u2019s regret. Then, slipping the sheet of paper back into its envelope, she picked up the photograph of three vampires she\u2019d never known and now never would. All three of them were dead, destroyed by human hatred and Lucien\u2019s foolishness. But now his stupidity had reached out to touch others. Dangerous others whom he somehow expected her to placate and what? Save his worthless hide while he hid in safety? Typical Lucien, she thought angrily. Never thinking of anyone but himself\u2014his pleasure, his curiosity, his damnable sexuality.</p><p>Dashing away the remnants of her own tears\u2014not for Lucien, but for the innocent vampires he\u2019d given over to death\u2014Sophia stood, shivering as the cold air hit her bare breasts. She had a momentary flashback of the lovely Aurelio, with his long, sleek body, and then she set it aside. She might enjoy her sensual interludes, but she was at heart a woman of discipline and purpose. Yet another thing she and her Sire had always disagreed upon.</p><p>Taking the few steps to the trap door, she paused long enough to ascertain the emptiness of the room above her before pushing upward and climbing into the cottage proper. A quick glance assured her nothing had changed in her absence, that no one had been there while she\u2019d slept defenseless beneath their feet. She shivered again, with an entirely different sort of chill, hating the circumstances which had forced her to be here, hating Lucien for his persistent self-indulgence which would one day get him killed.</p><p>She crossed to the bureau, picked up the old-fashioned telephone and waited for someone to answer. It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d a smooth male voice responded.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to Larissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I send her, my lady, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone will be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne moment only.\u201d</p><p>It was more like ten seconds before she heard Larissa\u2019s delicate voice. \u201cLady Sophia, how may I serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to contact Lord Raphael\u2019s office, Larissa. Do you have a number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady. Do you wish to speak with him personally, or shall I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sophia interrupted quickly. \u201cSomeone from his staff will do. I just need some information from them.\u201d Possibly the last person she wanted to speak to directly at this point was Raphael. The news she had to deliver was bad. Very bad. Far better to talk to whoever was heading up his Seattle nest these days.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps his lieutenant, Duncan, then?\u201d Larissa prompted her.</p><p>Duncan, Sophia thought glumly. She\u2019d never met either the vampire lord or his lieutenant, but Duncan was reputed to be as powerful as any member of the Vampire Council, excepting only Raphael himself. She snorted softly. Only Raphael could hold a vampire as strong as Duncan as his number two.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Larissa inquired.</p><p>\u201cWhoever answers the phone will probably suffice, Larissa. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia hung up the phone and waited, her gaze returning once again to the photograph. It was a casual shot, taken with a personal camera. The three of them sat close together, the woman in the middle with the men\u2019s arms entwined around her in easy affection. The woman was smiling, her head tilted against the shoulder of one male, her hand resting on the thigh of the other. But there was wariness in her eyes as she looked at the camera, a distrustfulness that told Sophia this woman was probably an older vampire, one used to living in the shadows and not quite comfortable having her photo taken. The men had no such reservations, their expressions were wide open and laughing happily, an evening spent among friends.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart clenched. Gone. They were all gone. How old had they been, how many years had they walked the earth, and what had they witnessed in those years?</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Lucien,\u201d she whispered again. The phone rang and she snatched it up, wanting to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d a cool, male voice said. \u201cI am Duncan. How may we help you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze. Duncan? Why would Raphael\u2019s formidable lieutenant be the one to take her call? She was nobody. Powerful, yes, but nobody knew about her. She\u2019d never been to a Council meeting, had never even been seen at Lucien\u2019s side outside of Canada, and that was decades ago.</p><p>So why would Duncan pick up the phone when she called out of the blue?</p><p>Maybe because Raphael already suspected what Lucien had done, and now Sophia was going to be the one to suffer for it.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>North of Seattle, Washington</p><p>Raphael woke, filled with a cold and deadly intent. Yesterday had been for grieving. Tonight was for vengeance. Cyn stirred slightly beside him, and he looked down at her where she still slept, curled against him. His arm tightened over her hip. He\u2019d exhausted her last night. More correctly, they\u2019d exhausted each other in the ages-old remedy when confronted with the face of death. A reaffirmation of life, even if their joining would never produce anything but mutual joy.</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her softly awake. Her eyes flashed open, a smile lighting their mossy depths even as her expression firmed with purpose. \u201cWe have work to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>Raphael grinned viciously. They were well matched, he and his mate.</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shower is big enough for two.\u201d</p><p>Cyn sat up, running her fingers through her tangled hair, causing her breasts to push forward eagerly. He gave a low growl of appreciation. Her eyes, when she met his gaze, were filled with heat. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big believer in multi-tasking,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Raphael found Wei Chen and Loren waiting for him upstairs, deep in conversation with Duncan and Juro. Duncan crossed the room as soon as Raphael and Cyn entered.</p><p>\u201cMy lord. Cynthia,\u201d he said in greeting. \u201cWe received an unusual request just moments ago. The call was forwarded from Malibu, and I do not believe the caller realizes you are here in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Raphael gave him an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cOne of Lucien\u2019s children, Sophia . . .\u201d Duncan\u2019s voice trailed off and he shook his head. \u201cHer formal name is quite lengthy, one of those aristocratic, lineage-revealing titles from old Spain. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve met her before, my lord. I have not.\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned thoughtfully, paging back through the thousands of vampires he\u2019d met over his long life, some only briefly, others he\u2019d spent decades or more with. He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t cross paths with Lucien that often, other than our annual Council meetings. But his lieutenant is male, so this Sophia holds no formal position with him that I know of. What does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has requested permission to enter your territory from Vancouver. In point of fact, to journey here to the Seattle area and secure guest privileges at the compound.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned and beckoned to Juro.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Cyn said flatly, as Juro joined them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All three vampires looked at her with carefully blank faces.</p><p>\u201cOh, cut the inscrutable vampire crap, you guys. Someone\u2019s killing vamps, and now suddenly this chick shows up from nowhere and wants to drop in for a visit? You don\u2019t find that even slightly suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than slightly, I would say,\u201d Duncan agreed. \u201cBut knowing what she wants could be helpful, whether she means ill or not. She claims to be on an errand for Lucien, so perhaps they\u2019ve had similar problems in Canada.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen would she like to arrive?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cThis evening, my lord. She is already at the border. If we grant permission, she is prepared to cross immediately, which speaks to a certain urgency on her part.\u201d</p><p>Cyn stirred unhappily, but Raphael said, \u201cLet her come, Duncan. Juro, arrange for two of our people to meet her with transportation. I want her here as soon as possible, but she enters alone, on my terms, or not at all. I will guarantee her safety, but no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Juro nodded. \u201cA team was dispatched as soon as she called, my lord, to save time in the event you granted her passage. I will advise them of your permission and arrange a rendezvous with Sophia.\u201d He pulled out his cell phone and was already punching in a number as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cHow long before she arrives?\u201d Raphael asked.</p> <p>\u201cI would think an hour or two, my lord. If Sophia crosses the border and meets our team partway . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s only the mountain roads that will slow them somewhat.\u201d</p><p>Raphael considered this. Vampires had superior reflexes and far better night sight than humans. The roads wouldn\u2019t slow them much.</p><p>\u201cVery well. When she arrives, I will speak with her myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cyn spoke up immediately. \u201cRaphael, what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand to stop the predictable objection. \u201cWe will take all necessary precautions, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, but her eyes were full of rebellion when they met his. \u201cIs there coffee around somewhere, Duncan?\u201d she asked, not bothering to hide her irritation.</p> <p>Duncan glanced at Raphael before saying, \u201cThere is a dining room across the way. Wei Chen houses a full shift of daylight guards on the compound, and there are one or two vampire mates who live here as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said to Duncan, then shifted her attention to Raphael. \u201cSince I\u2019m not needed here, I\u2019m going to get some caffeine. And then I\u2019d like to ask Wei Chen and others a few questions . . . if that\u2019s all right with you, my lord,\u201d she added sarcastically. And with that, she spun on her heel and left.</p><p>Raphael watched her go, enjoying the sway of her hips, even though she was irritated with him. He turned back to Duncan with a wry twist of his mouth. \u201cI think she worries even more than you do, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grinned. \u201cImpossible, my lord,\u201d he commented, adding, \u201cShe loves you deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, if you permit this Sophia to meet with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael blinked slowly and gave his lieutenant a patient look.</p><p>\u201cAh, that is, when you meet with her, my lord, I believe you should permit Juro and myself to greet her first. I\u2019d like a better sense of her purpose before we admit her to the building, at least, and certainly before she is permitted into your presence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. And for somewhat the same reasons.\u201d</p><p>Raphael arched an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cI did say somewhat,\u201d Duncan said dryly.</p><p>Raphael flashed a quick grin, sobering almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Raphael heard Cyn\u2019s footsteps and looked over his shoulder to see her heading for their private quarters. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have a word with my mate.\u201d</p><p>Cyn was coming out the large bathroom when Raphael entered their suite. She had a towel in her hands and her face was still damp from a recent wash. She didn\u2019t say anything, just tossed the towel onto a rack, then walked over to the side table and began refastening her shoulder holster, her back to him once more.</p><p>Raphael crossed the room silently, taking selfish pleasure from her gasp of surprise as his hand snatched the gun from her fingers before she could slide it into the holster. Sliding the weapon across the table out of her reach, he spun her around to face him. Not that she was cowed by his show of strength. The look she gave him all but dared him to try anything.</p><p>\u201cSweet, sweet Cyn,\u201d he said silkily. He felt her grow perfectly still, saw her eyes flare in alarm as she recognized the danger simmering beneath his quiet voice. The stubbornness fled, replaced by a wary watchfulness. He growled soft and low in his chest. \u201cYou are angry because I value your life too much to hide behind you? You are human, my Cyn, and I am Vampire. Which of us do you think more likely to survive an attack by my enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you very much, oh great one. I won\u2019t trouble you with my useless human efforts on your behalf any longer.\u201d</p><p>Raphael tightened his grip, pulling her closer, forcing her up onto her toes. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to protect me,\u201d he insisted, only inches away from her face. \u201cI have hundreds of vampires specifically trained to do that. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about all the others?\u201d she snapped back at him, raising her hands between them and pushing ineffectively at his chest. \u201cThe thousands of vampires who depend on you for their lives, the thousands who will die if anything happens to you. What about me? How would I live without you?\u201d Her voice cracked with emotion as she fisted one hand and punched his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re irreplaceable, damn you!\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, loosening his hold until he could run gentle hands up and down her arms. \u201cAnd do you think you\u2019re not?\u201d he asked, his impatience replaced by stunned disbelief. \u201cDo you think I could go on if something happened to you? Do you think I would want to?\u201d</p><p>Cyn looked away, a flush of embarrassment staining her lovely cheeks.</p><p>\u201cSweet Cyn,\u201d he murmured, pulling her into his arms. \u201cLubimaya,\u201d he whispered against her fragrant hair. \u201cI would sooner die at your side than live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too\u201d she whispered, tears filling her voice.</p><p>\u201cThen there is nothing for it. We shall both have to live, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>He placed a finger under her chin and raised her face to his, kissing her long and slowly, savoring the luscious, warm taste of her mouth, lingering to twine his tongue around hers until she softened against him at last, her arms snaking beneath his jacket and around his back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he said, breaking away from the kiss and holding her close. \u201cAnd I need you always. Never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto, fang boy,\u201d she muttered against his chest.</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cPut on your gun, then. We\u2019ll have a visitor to question soon.</p><p>\u201cSophia can\u2019t be here already.\u201d She dashed back into the bathroom, checking her face in the mirror and splashing it with cool water to erase the signs of her tears.</p><p>He followed her, leaning against the door frame and watching her in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Juro\u2019s team won\u2019t take long. Vampires drive fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we wait, I want to clear up a few things with Wei Chen, and there are the reports from Juro\u2019s team on the two crime scenes. They went out there the first night and secured the houses.\u201d</p><p>She crossed to the table and snapped her gun into the shoulder rig, then slipped on her jacket, concealing the gun from casual inspection. A vampire wouldn\u2019t need to see the weapon, of course. The scent alone would betray its presence. Cyn knew this, but she\u2019d carried her gun in this fashion for years, she\u2019d told him, and saw no reason to change. She looked over her shoulder, meeting his gaze with eyes filled with anticipation. \u201cSo, we meet this chick from Canada, and then we can start tracking these guys, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo eager, lubimaya. I approve.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a dismissive breath and he grabbed her, swinging her around and claiming her mouth in a hard kiss. Then he raised his head and said, \u201cSoon, my Cyn, very soon we hunt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Sophia surveyed the Seattle compound as the big gate rolled shut behind her, nearly silent despite its obvious heft. She was reluctantly impressed by the Western vampires\u2019 security, from the careful scrutiny of the two who\u2019d been dispatched to escort her, to the watchful gaze of the guards as she was passed through the gate and into the compound proper. Lucien had nothing like this in his territory, not even in his own lair, which she\u2019d found almost alarmingly unguarded. Of course, that might be because Lucien himself was not in residence. Surely, if their lord had been present, his guards would have been more alert? On the other hand, if they\u2019d been doing their job properly, he never would have gone missing in the first place.</p><p>Although, having read his letter, it now seemed more likely he was in hiding, rather than missing.</p><p>The truck\u2014and regardless of what the makers called it, this behemoth vehicle could be considered nothing but a truck\u2014drove into the compound, winding through more of the ever-present trees as they rounded the curved driveway and headed for a quite elegant concrete and steel structure. There was a surprisingly strong hum of power coming from the building, and Sophia wondered just how many vampires were inside. It had to be considerable to produce that strong a power signature.</p><p>The truck came to a halt and she remained still, waiting for some sort of signal from her escort. The big Asian vampire driving hadn\u2019t said a word the entire journey, so she looked to the other, a dark-skinned male whose Caribbean accent flowed cheerfully over her ears. She could hear him murmuring from his seat in front and realized he was wearing a communication device on his wrist of the type used by high-level security personnel around the world. Even more impressive, she thought. If they observed this much caution for a visit to the local compound, imagine the gauntlet one would have to run for a visit with Raphael himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two vampires emerged from the building and made their way down the stairs, clearly heading her way. Between the light cast from the building\u2019s interior and the generously lit landscaping, she could see their faces clearly and at first glance didn\u2019t recognize either of them. But that wasn\u2019t a surprise. Vampires tended not to mingle, and especially not across territorial boundaries. Larissa had produced a file on the Seattle compound which had contained a few photographs, but beyond that, Sophia had little information on whom to expect here. Darren, who\u2019d attended years of Council meetings with Lucien, would have been able to describe the Council members themselves, and perhaps their vampire lieutenants, but Sophia didn\u2019t expect to run into any of them here in Seattle, so she hadn\u2019t bothered to ask him.</p><p>She studied the two males as they approached the vehicle. The first was an eerily accurate match for her humongous driver. He was at least a brother, if not a twin, which was fascinating\u2014she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen the like. The other Seattle vampire was a good-looking male, tall and well-built, with long blond hair tied back into a neat queue. He said something to the twin, who walked over to the truck and opened her door.</p><p>\u201cStep out, please,\u201d the giant said in a deep, rumbling voice that matched his impressive stature perfectly.</p><p>Sophia swung her legs through the open door and scooted forward. The male held out a huge paw, offering his assistance, and she took it gratefully, noting as she did so the deep hum of power beneath his skin. It wasn\u2019t a deliberate show on his part. If he\u2019d wanted to test her, he would have been far more blatant about it. This was simply the power that lived inside him, and it was considerable. Sophia knew he was receiving a similar trace of her own power, which was just as firmly banked. They were all being very carefully polite this evening.</p> <p>She reached the ground and disengaged her hand, watching from the corner of her eye as the blond vampire approached.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d he said in a cool, uninflected tone. \u201cWelcome to Seattle. I am Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze and fought not to show it. This was Duncan? When she\u2019d spoken with him earlier, she\u2019d assumed he was in Malibu. But, of course, her call could have been forwarded anywhere. Clearly it had been forwarded right here to Seattle. But if Duncan was in Seattle\u2014</p><p>Suddenly everything made terrible sense. The security, the impossibly strong power signature. Aware of the knowing brown eyes watching her ever so closely, Sophia forced herself to take a step forward, to accept the hand Duncan was offering. Many of the older vampires didn\u2019t shake hands, especially those who eschewed human contact. Sophia was not one of those. Her life in Rio was filled with far more humans than vampires.</p><p>\u201cThe inestimable Duncan,\u201d she acknowledged. She shook his hand firmly, surprised that he, at least, hadn\u2019t tested her power with that handshake. Many vampires in his position would have. But then, if what she\u2019d heard about him was true, he probably didn\u2019t feel the need to. But at the same time, she wondered how much they had discovered about her in the short time since that phone call. Not much, probably. She\u2019d kept an intentionally low profile down in South America, and before that she\u2019d been just one more of Lucien\u2019s playmates, not worthy of any notice at all.</p> <p>Duncan smiled slightly. \u201cJust Duncan will do. And this is Juro,\u201d he added, indicating the giant vampire next to him. \u201cWhat brings you to Seattle, Sophia?\u201d</p><p>Well, she thought, at least they didn\u2019t waste any time on chitchat. \u201cAs we discussed on the phone, I\u2019m here on behalf of my Sire,\u201d she said smoothly. It was close enough to the truth that it would pass, and, besides, she had more than enough power of her own to conceal her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m searching for someone, a vampire who has gone missing. The trail led me here, where I hoped to secure permission to continue my search and a safe haven for the duration.\u201d</p><p>Duncan regarded her steadily, giving away nothing of his thoughts. \u201cFor whom do you search?\u201d</p><p>Sophia met his cool stare, her expression calm despite her exquisite awareness of the building behind him, and far more importantly, of who she now knew had to be waiting inside that building. She sent out a thin thread of inquiry and snapped it back almost painfully, very nearly singed by the raw, unimaginable depth of power that could only be Raphael. A shiver of dread crept along her spine and she steeled herself against it. She could not afford to show weakness. Not anymore, not with Raphael here in Seattle and her own Sire mysteriously absent. Was it possible that Raphael had something to do with Lucien\u2019s disappearance? Or, meu Deus, might her Sire be Raphael\u2019s prisoner? Maybe right here in this compound?</p><p>Duncan was regarding her patiently, seeming willing to stand in the cold damp of a Pacific Northwest night for as long as it took to get a response to his query. She frowned and drew a deep fortifying breath. \u201cI am looking for Lucien,\u201d she said at last, knowing she\u2019d never get past the front door otherwise. \u201cI have reason to believe he\u2019s nearby. I had even thought he might be visiting here, but I now think that unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Is he here? Do you know where he is? She choked back the questions she was desperate to ask.</p> <p>Duncan raised one eyebrow quizzically, the most reaction she\u2019d seen from him so far. He went very still and she knew he was mentally speaking to someone inside. Raphael, probably. He would take direction from no one else.</p><p>He smiled at her then, just a slight upward curve of his lips as he turned and gestured with one hand toward the warmly lit building. \u201cMy Sire will speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing no alternative, Sophia started up the concrete stairway toward the front door, irritated by the awkwardness of the individual steps, too long and too shallow, so that she felt like an overgrown child scurrying along a giant\u2019s staircase. But even as she swallowed her irritation, she recognized it for what it was\u2014a distraction from the fear pooling in her belly, something she hadn\u2019t felt in longer than she could remember. Not since her earliest nights alone, after Lucien had cast her out of his nest and forced her to find a home of her own.</p><p>Duncan strode along next to her, with Juro slightly ahead of them. Neither of the two said anything, but Duncan at least seemed friendly in a reserved sort of way. Not terribly forthcoming, but not hostile either. More curious than anything else, she thought.</p><p>Juro pulled open the heavy, glass front door and went through first. Duncan caught the door and held it for her, with a slight bow. She acknowledged the courtesy with a smile, nodding her head as she stepped through. All of that courtesy didn\u2019t keep her from noticing the heavy steel shutters hanging over her head, however. Shutters she had no doubt were lowered every day before sunrise and could probably be dropped at the touch of a button, if necessary. Just beyond the front doors was a \u201cgreat room.\u201d Rooms like this were used for many things in modern houses, but this one was a large, casual sitting room, with a pair of long, heavy couches facing each other across a thick glass coffee table. A pair of matching chairs stood to either end, making a square seating area, with an enormous area rug framing the entire thing. The ceiling was high, two stories at least, with windows on the far wall that nearly met the roof line. And like the door, automatic shutters framed every window. This building had been constructed for vampires. The door was the only real vulnerability and by the time an intruder reached it, the shutters would be deployed and it, too, would be pretty much impregnable.</p><p>Halfway across the great room, Duncan quickened his pace, stepping out in front of her and heading straight for a pair of tall wooden doors. At the same time, Juro slowed to flank her, even as his twin and the Jamaican closed in behind, herding her in Duncan\u2019s wake as he opened the doors and disappeared into the room beyond.</p><p>Juro slowed further, glancing once at his twin before pausing in front of the open doors and indicating with a sweep of his broad palm that she should enter ahead of him.</p><p>Sophia met his flat stare, then tossed her long hair over her shoulder and entered the lion\u2019s den.</p> <p>She took two steps into the room, her gaze sweeping quickly from side to side, taking note of the small group of vampires. The Seattle nest leader, Wei Chen, was there. He was one of those she recognized from a photo the efficient Larissa had included in her file. There were three others, none of whom she knew, but all of them, including Wei Chen were watching her closely, their power simmering just below the point of challenge, ready to defend their Sire. Letting her gaze travel farther, she saw Duncan crossing to the far side of the room, toward a huge bank of glass overlooking the valley below. As she entered, he turned to take up a position next to a vampire who could only be Raphael.</p><p>Sophia couldn\u2019t help it. She sucked in a breath, her gaze riveted on the big vampire sitting in the place of honor. Why had no one warned her of his sheer presence? He fairly vibrated with power. It distorted the air around him and zinged painfully along her nerve endings as she fought to keep up a cool front. She\u2019d thought her master Lucien was powerful, and he was. But he\u2019d never had power like this, had never sought to hone his strength to anything beyond what it took for the loose governance of his territory, spending most of his time and energy on pleasure and foolish games. Sophia wasted a few precious seconds regretting her own foolishness in spending so many years dancing through the hot, humid streets of Rio, instead of cultivating her power. And she cursed Lucien yet again for encouraging his children to do nothing but play during their long lives.</p><p>Raphael, she knew instantly, did not play at life. He was power in its truest form, power whetted to the finest edge and knowing no equal.</p><p>But while the vampire part of her took note of his power\u2014and kept her own carefully tamped down to avoid even a breath of offense\u2014the woman she still was took note of his beauty. Even as a human, he must have been formidable, well over six feet and broad of shoulder, with short cut black hair and unusual black eyes. There was the slightest flicker of silver in those eyes, evidence of his ready power. As if he\u2019d need it, surrounded as he was by so many of his own powerful children.</p><p>Sophia was abruptly thankful she\u2019d taken care with her appearance. Knowing her figure-hugging sweater and black leggings highlighted what were very feminine curves, and that the knee-high boots with their stiletto heels added attractive length to her legs. She swept her long coat behind her and dropped into the graceful curtsey she\u2019d learned hundreds of years ago at her nanny\u2019s knee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLord Raphael,\u201d she said, pitching her voice deliberately into a low, sensuous purr. \u201cSophia Micaela Angelina de Sandoval y Rojas, in loyal service to my Sire, Lucien Guiscard, Lord of the Canadian Territories.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, meeting his gaze intentionally. \u201cBut between us, my lord,\u201d she said. \u201cSophia will suffice.\u201d</p><p>Raphael eyed her dispassionately, giving no indication that he considered her anything but a nuisance. The skinny human woman draped over his shoulder was another matter. She was studying Sophia with undisguised dislike, her right hand dipping briefly beneath her short leather jacket where . . . Meu Deus, the woman was carrying a weapon! Sophia shifted her gaze back to Raphael, who had clearly noticed the human\u2019s reaction and would no doubt chastise her for it.</p> <p>But instead, the vampire lord slid his hand off the chair arm and onto the woman\u2019s leg in a clear signal that was not lost on Sophia. Nor was the smug look in the human\u2019s green gaze or her tiny smile of victory. Bitch.</p><p>Sophia shifted her attention away from the human, meeting Raphael\u2019s eyes and letting her own register a polite disappointment, even as she bowed her head in respect.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lucien, Sophia?\u201d Raphael asked, his voice a burr of velvet-sheathed power against her skin.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s head came up, her gaze meeting his once again. \u201cMy lord, I had hoped to find him here.\u201d</p><p>She saw Duncan shift slightly, heard the intake of breath from the vampires behind her, and knew with cold certainty that her Sire was not in Seattle. Or if he was, none of them knew about it.</p> <p>Raphael continued to study her, his expression devoid of any emotion. Of them all, only he had shown no reaction to her response and the information it conveyed\u2014not the tiniest bit, not surprise, not puzzlement, and certainly not alarm.</p><p>\u201cLucien has not entered my territory,\u201d he said bluntly, clearly having no doubts and feeling no need to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you expect to find him here?\u201d Duncan asked from his position to Raphael\u2019s left.</p><p>Abruptly aware she was still bent into the uncomfortable curtsey, Sophia rose to her full, modest height. She shifted her gaze from Duncan to Raphael and back again. How much should she tell them? Lucien\u2019s letter had sent her here, but had he meant for her to confide to anyone the details of the Vancouver deaths?</p><p>In general, the vampire lords did not share information\u2014or anything else\u2014with each other. They were viciously territorial and quite openly hostile, at least in North America. It wasn\u2019t unheard of for a stronger lord to push the territorial boundaries in an attempt to enrich his own power at the expense of another, and frequent disputes erupted, sometimes violently. Lucien\u2019s Canadian territory was vast, but largely unsettled, both in terms of people and vampires, and rarely the object of any other lord\u2019s ambition. This was a good thing for Lucien since, as he\u2019d told her many times, he was a lover not a fighter. Sophia wasn\u2019t aware of any open conflict between her Sire and Raphael, or any of the other North American lords, for that matter. But then, she\u2019d been gone so long, and had paid so little attention.</p><p>An unwelcome thought sent tendrils of nausea twisting into her gut. Had Lucien known Raphael would be here when he\u2019d sent her on this errand? Or if not known, had he at least suspected it? Could there be a connection between the Vancouver deaths and whatever business had drawn the Western vampire lord away from Malibu and up to this concrete and steel compound?</p> <p>Sophia sighed and turned her unwilling gaze on Raphael, who blinked lazily, letting his eyelids drop slowly over the silvery sheen of power. She almost laughed. What was she thinking? He didn\u2019t need to ask for the information he wanted; he could rip her mind open like a tin can and simply take it.</p><p>\u201cLucien summoned me home several days ago,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cIt was our first contact in years.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDecades,\u201d she amended. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in Brazil. The lords down there are lax in their enforcement, to say the least. As long as a vampire observes a few basic rules, they don\u2019t care who sired you or whom you call master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Lucien contact you?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>Sophia glanced at Raphael before answering, but the vampire lord seemed content to let his lieutenant take the lead. \u201cDirectly,\u201d she said simply. \u201cHe spoke in my mind just as I woke for the evening. He gave me no reason, simply summoned me home to him with an indication of urgency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head, letting some of her frustration show. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI only arrived in Vancouver yesterday evening. I went straight to his main estate above the city, expecting to find him waiting, but he wasn\u2019t there. And no one I spoke with knows where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you think you\u2019d find him here in Seattle, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter. He left me a letter with details of certain recent and very troubling events. And then he told me to come here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat events?\u201d Raphael spoke at last, the question a whiplash of power demanding an answer.</p><p>Sophia drew a deep breath and forged ahead. Lucien had left this matter to her. She had only her instincts to guide her, and those instincts were telling her to come clean with what she knew. Any other path would only lead to more killing.</p><p>\u201cDeath, my lord,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cThree vampires in Vancouver have been destroyed. I do not know how or by whose hand, but the killers may now be in your territory, and . . . I believe Lucien is somehow at the heart of this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Thinking of his own dead, Raphael felt a renewed surge of rage. Next to him, Cyn shifted, resting her fingers against the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWho died?\u201d he demanded of Sophia.</p><p>He saw her blink in reaction as his anger washed outward, felt her power push back briefly. She had surprising strength for one of Lucien\u2019s children. Perhaps that was why she\u2019d been the one Lucien had called when he got into trouble over his head.</p><p>\u201cI have their images, my lord,\u201d she said with admirable calm. \u201cAnd their names, although I\u2019ve never met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Raphael insisted.</p><p>\u201cGiselle,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Wei Chen gasped audibly when she said the name. Sophia shot him a quick glance over her shoulder before turning back to Raphael. \u201cAlong with Damon and Benjamin,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is my understanding the three lived together and died on the same night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Wei Chen started to say, but Raphael raised his hand for silence. Giselle wasn\u2019t one of his, but he\u2019d known her. She was old and canny, but with very little power. And because of that, she\u2019d chosen to live in Vancouver after Lucien and Raphael had matched the boundaries of their two territories to the international border between the U.S. and Canada. She\u2019d wanted a quiet life and had trusted the easygoing Lucien to give her that. Unwisely, it turned out.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know these three are dead?\u201d Raphael asked Sophia.</p><p>\u201cTheir names were in Lucien\u2019s letter, along with a photograph. I have both of those with me, my lord, if you\u2019d like to see them.\u201d</p><p>Raphael signaled Duncan who stepped forward to accept a folded envelope Sophia drew out of her coat pocket. Duncan opened the letter slowly, shaking out the photograph and studying it carefully before handing both photo and letter to Raphael.</p><p>Raphael only glanced at the photograph, handing it off to Cyn almost immediately. He turned his attention instead to Lucien\u2019s letter. If he\u2019d had any doubts before about what Sophia had told him, he had them no longer. The handwriting was Lucien\u2019s, but more than that, the vampire lord\u2019s power was imbued in the parchment itself, the regret and sadness he\u2019d experienced while writing it was as vivid as the tear drop staining the fine linen paper. But rather than sympathy, Raphael was revolted by the words of his fellow vampire lord.</p><p>Lucien and Raphael were nearly the same age, but the other vampire had set himself up in America decades before Raphael arrived in the New World. At first, Lucien had confined himself to the eastern provinces of what would become Canada. When he decided to expand westward, he and Raphael had easily agreed on a territorial line, moving it as events warranted and the humans expanded their settlements. Lucien had always been a poor protector of his people and a lax guardian of his territory, but he\u2019d been just powerful enough to hold onto it, especially given the lack of any serious takeover bids.</p><p>But the current situation was a new low, even for Lucien. His people were dead, murdered as they slept, and he was gone, leaving nothing but an urgent summons to Sophia and this pathetic letter in which Lucien confessed his own complicity in leading the killers right to Giselle\u2019s door.</p><p>And now, the animals who\u2019d murdered Giselle and her lovers clearly had moved southward into Raphael\u2019s territory to continue their killing spree. Was it coincidence that Lucien had directed Sophia to follow in their wake? That his letter connected the two sets of murders? Raphael didn\u2019t believe in coincidence, especially not when it came wrapped in Lucien\u2019s words of self-pity.</p><p>But Raphael was not Lucien. He would not cower in hiding while his people died. He would find these killers and eliminate the threat once and for all.</p><p>And after that . . . perhaps it was time to find a new lord for the Canadian Territories.</p><p>Sophia stood silently, watching Raphael read Lucien\u2019s letter. She knew how incriminating it was, knew her own anger upon reading it. She could only imagine Raphael\u2019s rage. It was his vampires whom Lucien had put at risk by hiding instead of dealing with the tragedy he created.</p><p>She jumped when Raphael suddenly barked out an order.</p><p>\u201cWei Chen,\u201d he said. \u201cHave someone show Sophia to the guest quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my lord\u2014\u201d Sophia\u2019s protest died on her lips when the powerful lord turned his black gaze upon her. She felt her heartbeat speed up, felt her own power trying to rise to the surface as every defensive instinct she possessed screamed to the fore all at once. She squelched the reaction brutally, nearly passing out with the effort, but knowing she would be dead in seconds if Raphael willed it. And he was in a temper. She didn\u2019t need to know him to see that. His rage was like a separate entity in the room, a creature of heat and fury. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dropped to her knees, willing to beg for what she wanted, what she needed\u2014to be a part of the hunt for these killers. Because there had to be more than one of them. Probably a whole murderous pack. No single human could have taken down three vampires and sent Lucien scurrying for cover. She wanted to see these humans brought to justice\u2014Vampire justice. For reasons she couldn\u2019t explain, it mattered more to her than anything had in centuries\u2014with one exception, and that was something, someone, she never permitted herself to think about.</p><p>\u201cLord Raphael,\u201d she said, trying to keep the pleading out of her voice. \u201cPermit me to be a part of this. These were Lucien\u2019s children who were murdered, and yes, it was at least partly his fault,\u201d she hurried to add. \u201cBut my Sire is alive, my lord. I know this.\u201d</p><p>Her voice died, her throat suddenly dry as a desert as Raphael\u2019s already chilly expression turned absolutely frigid. Sophia knew in that moment that Lucien\u2019s remaining nights would be counted on one finger if Raphael found him alive.</p> <p>Hot tears pressed against the back of her eyes, a wrenching grief that squeezed her heart painfully. She loved Lucien. In spite of his many faults, he\u2019d given her the greatest gift of life when he\u2019d turned her, and they\u2019d shared so much joy together. It would hurt her if he died, even if he had brought it on himself.</p><p>She bowed her head, unwilling to let Raphael or any of the others witness her pain. Clenching her jaw and forcing her sorrow aside, she raised her eyes to meet his once again. \u201cI know you don\u2019t need my help, Lord Raphael, but I beg you to let me offer it. For the sake of Lucien\u2019s people, who do not deserve to suffer for his misdeeds.\u201d</p><p>Raphael just stared at her with no expression. \u201cWei Chen, have someone see Sophia to her room,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d the Seattle nest leader said from behind her.</p><p>Sophia came gracefully to her feet, turning in time to see a slender, young vampire conferring with Wei Chen, who looked up and caught her gaze. \u201cSophia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Lukas. He\u2019ll show you to the room you\u2019ll be using during your stay.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia nodded, then dared to turn back to face Raphael once more. \u201cMy lord?\u201d she asked. He still said nothing, regarding her with a flat expression that gave no clue as to what he was thinking. She drew a deep breath and made her way toward the waiting Lukas, aware of everyone watching her as she wound through the cluster of furniture and across the echoing space.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t sent her back home immediately. That was something. And if he tried . . . she had power of her own. Far more than she let on. It wasn\u2019t enough to take on Raphael, but it was enough to challenge anyone who thought they could set her aside like an unwelcome puppy. She would hunt for the killers. With Raphael\u2019s help or without it.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Duncan said once the doors had closed securely behind their visitor.</p><p>\u201cWhat she knows of it,\u201d Wei Chen clarified, taking his seat again. \u201cI had our people do some checking. Like she said, she\u2019s been living down in South and Central America for nearly a century, most recently in Rio. For all purposes, she\u2019s been without a master, flying under the radar. You know how relaxed they are about those things down there.\u201d</p><p>Raphael sat back, content to let his people talk it out.</p> <p>\u201cShe flew in yesterday, my lord,\u201d Juro provided. \u201cIt was a private flight, but the distance necessitated several stops and took some time. At least part of her travel was in daylight, however, which lends credence to her claim of urgency.\u201d</p><p>It was Cyn who asked the question they were all thinking. \u201cSo where is this Lucien guy? Is he dead?\u201d</p><p>All of Raphael\u2019s people looked to him for the answer. He thought about it, his fingers stroking Cyn\u2019s leg absently. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not. Lucien was never the most powerful among us, but his strength was still considerable. His death would certainly have been detectable to you here in Seattle, Wei Chen, and probably even to most of us in Malibu. Particularly if the death was unexpected. Even he was taken out by one of his own in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, there would have been at least some losses among his children, and that many deaths would definitely have been felt. Unless Lucien has a child we don\u2019t know about. Someone strong enough to eliminate his Sire and seize power without a ripple.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted softly, circling around to take the chair next to Cyn. \u201cHighly unlikely, my lord. Lucien has always chosen playmates as his children, not players.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia could do it,\u201d Wei Chen observed. \u201cShe\u2019s hiding her power, but it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably could,\u201d Duncan agreed thoughtfully. \u201cBut she\u2019s spent the last hundred years following in her Sire\u2019s hedonist footsteps, so her strength remains mostly potential. And if she\u2019d eliminated him, she\u2019d hardly risk coming here on a pretense of looking for him. There would be no point. Plus, she seems to genuinely care for Lucien, which makes her an unlikely candidate to have killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Wei Chen conceded. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he continued, turning to Raphael. \u201cWould it be possible for Lucien to mask his signature well enough that he couldn\u2019t be found?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cNot from me. He is not within my territory, but he is alive and I will find him.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn moved restlessly. \u201cBut finding him isn\u2019t our first priority, is it? If he\u2019s not here, he doesn\u2019t matter, except that now we know the killers started up there and traveled here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Wei Chen asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know. And how did they decide on who their targets would be? Jeremy,\u201d he said, turning to the vampire sitting quietly next to him. \u201cDid you know Giselle or her nest mates? Did you do any work for them, by chance?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy shook his head right away. \u201cAll of my clients are U.S. based. And I didn\u2019t do any work for Marco or Preston, so that can\u2019t be the link.\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cSo, why them? How did they come to the attention of these killers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t,\u201d Cyn said suddenly. She leaned forward intently. \u201cI\u2019m betting the humans never saw any of their vampire targets before the day they hit them.\u201d</p><p>The Seattle vampires were staring at her with matched expressions of doubt. Despite what Raphael had told them earlier, they\u2019d expected his Cyn to be nothing more than arm candy. Duncan and Juro knew better and were regarding her with thoughtful expressions, but Cyn ignored all of them.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to that local guy,\u201d she said, halfway to herself, before shifting her gaze to Loren. \u201cColin Murphy.\u201d</p><p>Loren nodded. \u201cI figured we wouldn\u2019t have time tonight. He\u2019ll be here an hour after sunset tomorrow. But why is that important? Surely those of us in this room are better qualified to find and destroy these people. Frankly, the last thing we need is the interference of human authorities who will only get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cyn conceded with little conviction. \u201cBut consider this. We know Lucien betrayed his peoples\u2019 location to the killers. I\u2019m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he didn\u2019t do it knowing what would happen to them. But that means whoever he told was someone he knew and trusted. Probably not the killers, but someone working with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Loren asked.</p><p>\u201cLucien\u2019s a vampire lord. Even if he isn\u2019t the strongest one around, he has at least enough juice to read humans. Wouldn\u2019t he know if the person he was talking to hated him enough to commit murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming he bothered to look for it,\u201d Duncan observed. \u201cIf it was someone he trusted, someone he\u2019d known for years . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe might never have noticed a shift in sympathies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, that\u2019s why we need the cooperation of this guy Colin. I don\u2019t know the humans around here. I don\u2019t know who might hate vampires enough to want them gone, or who has the stomach and the organization to commit multiple murders. Do you?\u201d she asked Loren.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, then closed it and frowned, clearly considering Cyn\u2019s question. He shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, and you\u2019re right, I should. But if this started in Vancouver, there might not be anyone local involved, either.\u201d</p><p>Cyn shrugged. \u201cThat brings us back to how they knew where Marco and Preston lived. Jeremy, too, but especially Marco and Preston. Mariane went into town. Anyone could have followed her home and she never would have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a possibility would never have occurred to her, and why should it?\u201d Jeremy said, somewhat defensively.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Cyn agreed. \u201cAnd no one\u2019s blaming Mariane. My point is it would have been easy to know where you lived, Jeremy, but not Marco and Preston. They didn\u2019t get out much and when they did it was mostly with other vampires. And it\u2019s not like you live in the suburbs here. Their houses were miles from the highway. If you didn\u2019t know to look for them, you wouldn\u2019t have known they were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut most of us live within the compound now, even the ones who lived separately before,\u201d Loren objected. \u201cHow would someone know the few of us who live outside and where to find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Cyn said. \u201cDo you have a database somewhere, addresses, phone numbers, that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe maintain a database, of course. But it doesn\u2019t include the details of their security arrangements. I\u2019m not certain I would have known if someone had asked me what Marco or Preston\u2019s private quarters looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut both of them lived in this area before you built this compound, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did, yes. It was Marco who suggested we move here to Cooper\u2019s Rest in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Cyn considered that, her mouth twisting as she bit the inside of her lower lip. \u201cHow many vampires do you have living outside?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wei Chen raised his eyes to Raphael\u2019s in silent query. Cyn caught the exchange and scowled, but Raphael rested his hand against her lower back, rubbing gently. He nodded his permission to the Seattle nest leader.</p><p>\u201cWe have a total of forty-seven vampires affiliated with what we call the Seattle nest, although there are only a few still living in the city itself. Most live here on this estate. It\u2019s safer and, frankly, more comfortable to be around our own. Fewer than ten maintain separate residences, including those who still live in the city, although most of those spend at least some time here on a regular basis. Marco and Preston were among those who lived apart, and they were the ones who\u2019d been in this area longest. Jeremy lived in the Seattle nest until he bonded with Mariane and they built their own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted a place of our own,\u201d Jeremy confirmed softly. \u201cWe bought up here to be close to the new compound.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn tapped her fingers restlessly against her thigh, and Raphael knew what her next question would be. He also knew why she hesitated to ask it.</p><p>\u201cWhat were your daytime sleeping arrangements, Jeremy?\u201d Raphael asked for her.</p><p>Jeremy looked briefly surprised at the question, but since it came from his Sire, he answered quickly enough. \u201cA vault, my lord. Like what we have here. Much smaller, of course, but just as secure.\u201d</p><p>Cyn leaned forward. \u201cYou built your house from scratch then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn rocked herself slightly and nodded. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cThey knew where you lived, but they didn\u2019t know about the extra security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeremy said bitterly. \u201cSo, they tortured Mariane instead.\u201d</p><p>Raphael felt Cyn freeze, heard her sharp intake of breath at the implicit suggestion that she was somehow ignoring what had happened to Mariane. Which she surely had not intended. His Cyn was many things, but insensitive, especially to another\u2019s pain, she was not.</p><p>\u201cMy mate and I,\u201d Raphael said emphatically, \u201care wholly focused on finding justice for those who died, and those who lived, Jeremy. Especially Mariane. Cyn\u2019s methods may seem abrupt to you, but she is far more skilled than either of us at uncovering human criminals of this sort.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy flushed at his Sire\u2019s gentle reprimand. \u201cMy apologies, my lord. It is difficult to think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Cyn?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned back hard against his comforting hand. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said on a deep breath. \u201cWe know Lucien gave away Giselle and her nest, but he couldn\u2019t have revealed where Marco or Preston lived. Or Jeremy and Mariane, either. So, who gave them away? I know you guys, and I know Raphael\u2019s security. You don\u2019t exactly take out ads in the yellow pages advertising your presence. And yet, somehow the killers knew not only where the other two lived, but where they slept, because I\u2019m assuming it wasn\u2019t in a back bedroom with blackout shades. Marco and Preston had survived a long time. They must have had some sort of hideaway they thought was secure. Someplace in or near their houses, but hard to find, am I right?\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen gave Cyn an uncomfortable look, clearly unwilling to give out those kinds of details. Cyn huffed impatiently. \u201cThey\u2019re dead, Wei Chen. Whatever arrangements they had didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. I apologize. It\u2019s an automatic response. Marco and Preston each had a safe room beneath his home. Not as secure as what we have here, but certainly safe enough, we thought. The entrances were concealed and the rooms heavily reinforced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the killers get inside?\u201d She turned to look over her shoulder at Raphael. \u201cI really need to examine their houses. In daytime, when I can see what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned, unhappy at the idea of her running around unprotected while a gang of human vigilantes ran free, especially given what they\u2019d already done to Mariane. But Cyn didn\u2019t see his frown; she\u2019d already turned back to address Loren.</p><p>\u201cI want to meet up with Colin Murphy during the day tomorrow. If you give me his number, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s head whipped around and she stared at Raphael.</p> <p>\u201cI will meet this human tomorrow night and decide then what course we will follow.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened irritably, but again he knew she would not argue with him in front of his vampires. Besides which, she was shrewd enough to know when he would not be budged, and he would not change his mind on this one point. Until he met this local policeman, he was not trusting Cyn alone with him. For that matter, he wouldn\u2019t trust the man even then. If his mate felt it necessary to pursue some part of her investigation during the daylight hours, he would detail a bodyguard to go with her. One of his own, someone he trusted absolutely.</p><p>He stood, sliding his hand up to Cyn\u2019s shoulder, then down her arm, linking his fingers with hers and pulling her to her feet while cursing the still short Spring nights. \u201cThe sun is near. We will meet again tomorrow evening and determine how to proceed. Duncan, get Maxime here from Malibu. I want to know if our security has been breached electronically or otherwise. Wei Chen, I want all of my vampires within the walls of this compound by next sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Loren said quickly. \u201cWe sent out a warning as soon as Marco and Preston were slain. Most of our people have already come in, but some have lovers outside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Raphael stated. \u201cNo exceptions or they answer to me.\u201d</p><p>Cyn was out of the elevator almost before the doors were fully open, discarding her jacket on a chair and getting rid of her shoulder rig with jerky, agitated movements. Raphael watched her through half-lidded eyes. She hated being told what she couldn\u2019t do. She\u2019d been on her own for too long. Even as a child, when her only supervision had been hired nannies who cared mostly that she entertain herself and not bother them. He shrugged inwardly. He didn\u2019t care if his restrictions chafed her overdeveloped sense of freedom. He\u2019d much rather deal with her anger than her death. She checked her weapon, ejecting the magazine and working the slide to verify its status\u2014something she never neglected to do, no matter how angry she was.</p><p>Raphael slipped out of his clothes, taking the time to hang them in the closet. These quarters were nothing like those in his Malibu estate, just a single large room, which served as both bedroom and sitting area, with a generous-sized bath. They were, however, completely private and secure, which was what mattered. The elevator had a coded lockout, which engaged automatically every morning, and no one had the code except for Cyn and himself. And neither of them would have a reason to go out during daytime while visiting. An opinion he was certain Cyn would disagree with.</p><p>Finished with her nightly gun routine, Cyn strode over to the closet and began undressing, still avoiding him, not meeting his eyes as she kicked off her boots and stripped off her clothes, brushing against him only inadvertently when she leaned over to snatch up her jacket and hang it up. Raphael\u2019s cock hardened at the sight of all that lovely skin, tightened further as she opened the front closure on her bra and removed it, then bent over to strip away the lacy bit of underwear she wore. Making no effort to conceal the reaction of his now naked body, he let his eyes roam along her curves, pausing to admire her delicious breasts with their rosy tips already swelling beneath his gaze. He growled hungrily and looked up to find her watching him, hands resting on slender hips, eyes sparking. She looked quite irresistibly seductive, although he doubted that was the effect she was going for. He suppressed the smile trying to curve his lips and met her gaze, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou trust her?\u201d she asked suddenly.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyebrows rose in surprise. \u201cSophia?\u201d he verified.</p><p>\u201cOf course Sophia,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWas there some other fat Spaniard chick in that room tonight?\u201d</p><p>Raphael almost choked trying not to laugh, and he had the brief thought that it was a good thing she\u2019d unloaded her weapon already. \u201cWhy Spaniard?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe flew here from Brazil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I spent a summer in Paris when I was eighteen. Doesn\u2019t make me French. She was spitting all over the carpet when she reeled off that list of names. Trust me, her first language is Castilian Spanish.\u201d Her eyes narrowed, studying his response. \u201cAnd she sure as hell liked you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged his dismissal. \u201cShe\u2019s an attractive woman who\u2019s used to manipulating men with her looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have gone down on her knees and sucked you off in front of everyone if you\u2019d crooked a finger,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>Raphael lost the effort not to laugh, capturing her in his arms before she could explode. He pushed her up against the wall, trapping her there with his greater bulk, letting his erection play between her silky thighs. \u201cAn exaggeration, my Cyn. Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, fang boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams,\u201d he purred next to her ear. \u201cThere is no one between my legs but you, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart move since I\u2019m the one lying next to you while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, sweet Cyn, or I\u2019d give you a demonstration of my dreams,\u201d he said, pretending exhaustion, leaning heavily against her, maneuvering them both away from the wall until they tumbled onto the bed. And then, with a quick, sure move, he looped a big hand over her hip and snugged her beneath him, leaning down to nuzzle her soft neck.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were tired,\u201d she murmured, as his fingers found their way over the smooth skin of her flat belly and pushed her thighs open to delve into the velvet folds between them.</p><p>\u201cI seem to have caught a second wind,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Her heart was pounding against his chest, her breath warm puffs of air as she gripped his shoulders and her nails dug into his flesh. \u201cRaphael,\u201d she gasped, arching up against him as he slipped one finger, then two, deep inside her. She lifted her hips, thrusting against his hand and spreading her legs wider, urging him deeper into her sweet, hot center, smooth as satin and soaking wet\u2014eager for his touch, for his invasion. He groaned, knowing there was, in truth, too little time, though his cock strained painfully, eager to bury itself in the volcanic heat of her luscious body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cyn mewed softly, wanting more, rubbing herself against his hand, tightening her fingers in his hair and holding his mouth against her neck in invitation. Raphael pressed his tongue against the juicy swell of her jugular, but didn\u2019t take her, not yet. Grinning at her groan of frustration, he licked his way downward, dipping into the arch of her collar bone and down further until he captured her nipple in his mouth, biting gently. She cried out, hooking her leg around his hip, fucking herself against his fingers. Without warning, he slid a third finger inside her and began plunging in and out, mimicking the action his cock was hungry for, taking pleasure in the slick heat of her, in the trembling of her muscles, the small, hungry noises she was making as her hips pumped up and down, her breath coming in gasps as she whispered his name over and over again, a prayer for release.</p><p>And still he waited, waited until she was all but screaming his name, until she was clenched so tight around his fingers that he could barely move his hand. He scraped his thumb lightly across her clit, circling it once, twice and a third time before caressing it fully, rubbing back and forth until her entire body spasmed beneath him, her silken walls convulsing, her nipples so hard he could feel them like warm, smooth stones against his chest. She sucked in a keening breath, the air trapped in her lungs by the sheer magnitude of her orgasm. He lifted his head and sank his fangs into her neck, the rush of warm, sweet blood filling his mouth as she climaxed again and her scream of passion filled his ears. He held her tightly, reveling in the taste of her as she shuddered beneath him, her inner muscles trembling around his fingers as he stroked her over and over again, her body jolting as if shocked every time his thumb caressed her swollen clit.</p><p>When at last she lay limp, her arms clinging to him weakly, he retracted his fangs and licked the small wound closed. Crooning wordless sounds of comfort, he pulled his fingers gently from within the still trembling depths of her body, the juices of her orgasm coating his fingers and trailing across her abdomen as he wrapped his hand around her bare hip and tucked her closer in the safety of his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI owe you a blow job,\u201d she murmured, already half asleep as she curled into his embrace. His arms closed around her, her bare breasts pressed against his chest, the thudding of her heart a comforting metronome as he drifted closer to his daytime sleep.</p><p>As the sun\u2019s glow lit the horizon, he smiled, thinking his next awakening would be a sweet one. His final thought as the sun crept fully into the morning sky and stole away both his smile and his consciousness was that the night had ended all too easily. And Cyn hadn\u2019t said a word about his forbidding her to go into town without him.</p><p>Raphael knew when Cyn slipped out of the bed they shared. He watched in his dreams as she dressed quickly and donned her weapon before kneeling on the bed next to him. She leaned over and touched her lips to his in a good-bye kiss. Raphael raged at her, their connection through the mate bond strong enough that her eyes widened when his anger struck hard at her consciousness. For a moment he thought he read indecision on her face. But then, she drew a breath and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>Colin sat in front of his office, the cheap plastic chair tilted back on two legs, a weathered, wooden overhang protecting him from a drizzle that threatened to turn into rain as he leaned against the wall and contemplated his town. The office wasn\u2019t much. A single room with a small holding cell and piss poor insulation that left it icy cold most of the time. The only exception was the rare occasion when the sun managed to come out from behind the clouds long enough to warm the place up a bit. Most days he didn\u2019t even bother to come in here unless he had a drunk or two locked up overnight, something that didn\u2019t happen all that often. Most of the drunks he collared winding through town had more or less sober friends who were happy to take the offender off his hands rather than travel back for him, or her, the next day.</p><p>But this morning he\u2019d made a point of showing his face in the few establishments sprinkled around town. People had heard about Mariane. It was inevitable, really. The smaller the town the more active the gossip mill, and Mrs. Fremont had no doubt primed the pump on this particular story. His cell phone had been ringing almost nonstop since the attack. Some were worried about their own safety or the safety of their women. Others just wanted the news firsthand. And still others had the facts all wrong and were calling him nearly hysterical with fear about some vampire invasion.</p><p>Not that the latter was completely off base. Colin hadn\u2019t missed the parade of big, black SUVs that had zipped down the highway the other night with a limo snug between them. They\u2019d driven right past him on his way home from Jeremy\u2019s. And then this morning, there\u2019d been a message waiting for him from Loren. Apparently, some big honcho had arrived and wanted to meet what passed for the local law. Colin could hardly wait.</p><p>He frowned, rocking the chair against the wall behind him. He could understand Jeremy\u2019s anger. Hell, he shared it, although he was smart enough to know that no matter how angry he might be, it couldn\u2019t come close to what the vampire was feeling. But why would a single attack\u2014as vicious as it had been\u2014bring out the big guns like this? And how had they managed to arrive so quickly, virtually on the heels of the crime itself?</p><p>His attention was drawn down the block as one of the SUVs he\u2019d just been thinking about pulled to a stop in front of Emma\u2019s, the local answer to Seattle\u2019s coffee shops. Colin let the chair drop to all fours and leaned forward, forearms resting on his thighs as he studied the new arrival. The truck\u2019s windows were all but blacked out, so he couldn\u2019t see anyone inside, but the meager sun still rode the sky somewhere behind the thick clouds, so he knew whoever it was had to be human, at least. And human he could deal with.</p><p>The truck door opened and Colin stood. A black clad leg emerged wearing thick-soled combat-style boots. He took a half step forward and tripped to a halt when the leg turned out to be that of a tall, slender woman. Closing the truck door behind her, she stood for a moment surveying downtown Cooper\u2019s Rest. It wasn\u2019t much, he admitted, and she seemed to agree, if the frown on her face was any indication.</p> <p>Her gaze fell on him where he stood under the porch overhang, then lifted to read the sign identifying the office as the local police station. Eyeing him once more, she gave a small shrug and headed his way.</p><p>Colin watched her approach. She was wearing clothes that very nearly matched his own outfit\u2014black combat pants tucked into sensible, lace-up boots, and a black t-shirt, although she wore hers considerably better than he did. His smile of appreciation didn\u2019t last long as he registered the existence of a shoulder rig beneath her short, all-weather jacket, its presence in stark contrast to her graceful walk and the way she filled out that t-shirt. He took a step forward when she reached the stairs in front of him, stretching to his full six-foot-four height, his hands grabbing the overhang before dropping to rest on his hips.</p><p>She smiled slightly, as if acknowledging his dominance display, before climbing the three stairs to stand on a level with him. \u201cColin Murphy?\u201d she asked, tall enough that she very nearly met his eyes without raising her head.</p><p>Colin tipped his head. \u201cThe very same, darlin\u2019\u201d he responded, enjoying a bit of satisfaction when her mouth tightened at the endearment.</p><p>\u201cMy name,\u201d she said. \u201cIs Cynthia Leighton. Cyn, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to make your acquaintance, Ms. Leighton,\u201d he drawled, letting every ounce of his Georgian upbringing play with the syllables. He found most Northerners assumed anyone with a drawl was dimwitted, and he wasn\u2019t above using it to his advantage.</p><p>The Leighton woman\u2019s mouth curved up slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, Murphy,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends in the South. Good friends. And besides, I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked her up and down, narrowing his eyes. She probably played that killer body the same way he played his accent, and to a hell of a lot better effect, too. So who the hell was she? \u201cWhat can I do for you, Leighton?\u201d he asked bluntly, his accent still present, but considerably less so.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a private investigator. Very private. In fact, I have only one client, and he\u2019s sleeping at a compound not far from here.\u201d</p><p>Colin let his surprise show on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re with the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And I\u2019m sure you know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a whole bunch of trucks drove through this town two nights ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were there when Mariane was attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward,\u201d he amended sharply. \u201cBy the time I arrived, whoever had attacked her was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d she said, and seemed to mean it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply anything. Wei Chen and Loren have both vouched for you and your honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mariane okay? I wanted to call an ambulance, but Jeremy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariane\u2019s doing well, considering. Jeremy taking her to the compound really was the best course, Mister Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d he said. \u201cNo need for formality between us, is there?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, the first honest, uncalculated thing she\u2019d done so far. \u201cFormalities aside, then. I\u2019m here because I need to see the crime scenes\u2014all three of them\u2014in daylight.\u201d</p><p>Colin frowned. \u201cCrime scenes?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head at him. \u201cI thought we\u2019d moved past this, Murphy.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, puzzled. \u201cNo, I mean, I understand you want to see Jeremy\u2019s place. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been back there since it happened, but, crime scenes, as in plural?\u201d</p><p>She studied him intently. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, making it a statement not a question.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cAbout Marco and Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco? What about Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew him? Why are you talking in past tense? Has something happened to Marco?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He saw a flash of sympathy in her eyes. \u201cMarco\u2019s dead,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd so\u2019s Preston. Both of them murdered, presumably by the same people who attacked Mariane the other night.\u201d</p><p>Colin felt a hard stab of grief, his jaw tightening as he stared at her. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days before Mariane was attacked. Both Marco and Preston on the same night. I\u2019m sorry. I thought you knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He inhaled deeply, looking away from her too perceptive gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou were friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Marco, not Preston. He had horses and my dad\u2019s a trainer back in Georgia. Marco ordered some equipment from a tack shop a while back, and I saw him loading the stuff into his truck. We rode together sometimes.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDammit. Are you sure he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d she said, nodding once. \u201cThere\u2019s no mistaking something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Preston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know him,\u201d he repeated. \u201cMarco mentioned him once or twice, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know where they lived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco, for sure. Like I said, we rode together\u2014his horses, I don\u2019t have any here. Wait, what happened to the horses? He loved those animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been taken care of. They were sent to a ranch in Wyoming,\u201d she added at his skeptical look. \u201cVampires have no interest in horse flesh or blood.\u201d</p><p>Colin shrugged unapologetically. \u201cWhat I know about vampires wouldn\u2019t fill a single page, Leighton.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a half smile. \u201cMy knowledge is somewhat more extensive. I\u2019d like to see all three crime scenes. Can you take me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve got a roster inside. Let me look up Preston\u2019s address and we\u2019ll get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA roster? It lists everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone I know of,\u201d he said over his shoulder as he strode into the small office.</p><p>\u201cWho has access to something like that?\u201d</p><p>Colin stopped and looked at her. \u201cNo one but me, I guess. It\u2019s on a computer, a laptop I take home with me every night. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Jeremy\u2019s said, the two of them were pretty open about where they lived. They were new to the area, and Mariane even shopped here in town. But Marco and Preston shouldn\u2019t have been that easy to find. If someone got hold of your roster there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, this is a small town. Everyone knows everything,\u201d he muttered, not looking at her as he brought up the file on his computer.</p> <p>\u201cApparently not, stud, since you didn\u2019t even know Marco and Preston were dead.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked up, his eyes narrowing in irritation. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed finally. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about the darlin. It\u2019s a habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Truce. We\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry anyway.\u201d</p><p>Colin stood and grabbed his windbreaker from the back of the chair. \u201cDamn right. There\u2019s something going on in this town, and I intend to find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>They took his Tahoe and headed for Jeremy\u2019s place first. It was closest to town and they passed right by Colin\u2019s house on the way, which meant he had the chance to stop and grab some more firepower.</p><p>\u201cPlanning to invade a small country there, Murphy?\u201d Leighton asked, eyeing the Benelli as he laid it on the backseat. He\u2019d invited her into his house, but she\u2019d chosen to wait by the car, muttering something about \u201cthrowing fuel on the fire.\u201d Whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, Leighton.\u201d He closed the back door of the truck and opened the front. \u201cBut when I\u2019m dealing with vamps, I like to go armed for bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument from me,\u201d she said easily. \u201cAlthough my personal choice of weapon focuses more on the load rather than the delivery system.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look as he slid back into the driver\u2019s seat and turned the ignition key. \u201cI thought you worked with these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d He whipped into a fast 180 turn and headed up his driveway to the main road.</p><p>She gave him a sideways smile. \u201cNot all vampires are created equal, Murphy. There are all different kinds, just like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Colin shrugged and turned onto the highway toward Jeremy\u2019s. \u201cMakes sense, I suppose, since they all started the same way as the rest of us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very enlightened of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I do what I can, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said with an exaggerated drawl.</p><p>She laughed, but sobered almost immediately, fingers tapping nervously on the door frame next to her. \u201cVamps didn\u2019t do this, though,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cIt happened in daylight, for beginners. You have any idea which of your fellow citizens might be a little less enlightened than you are?\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head, frowning. \u201cWhen this thing with Mariane happened, I figured it had to be someone from outside. We get a lot of people passing through\u2014tourists, people looking to commune with nature, loggers. This is a small town and it just doesn\u2019t sit right that someone I know could have done what was done to that little girl. Besides, judging by what I saw in that house and . . . well, Mariane\u2019s condition, I\u2019m pretty sure there was more than one of them there that day. To my way of thinking, that makes it even less likely that it was locals. People around here know Mariane and they like her.\u201d He slowed slightly, making the turn onto Jeremy\u2019s drive. \u201cBut now you tell me that Marco and this other guy Preston were killed, and it makes me wonder how well I really know the folks I live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a pretty wild area,\u201d Leighton offered. \u201cCould be all sorts of people hanging around in the woods and you\u2019d never know it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sharp look as he pulled up in front of Jeremy\u2019s house. \u201cYou know something I don\u2019t?</p><p>She scoffed lightly and gave him a toothy grin. \u201cProbably all sorts of things.\u201d She showed him both hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to check my weapon. Don\u2019t panic, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to scoff as she pulled a Glock 17 from her shoulder rig, checked the magazine and worked the slide before securing it back beneath her jacket.</p><p>\u201cPanic isn\u2019t a word in my vocabulary, dar\u2019 ... Leighton,\u201d he said with a shit-eating grin of his own.</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d she said, opening her door. \u201cThat might come in handy in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Walking around to the back of the house, he saw that someone had boarded up the broken windows and replaced the shattered door with a makeshift replacement and a heavy padlock. Leighton produced a key to the lock, which told him it was probably Jeremy who\u2019d arranged the temporary repairs, or at least someone who cared about him and Mariane.</p><p>Inside, she barely looked at the room where Mariane had been savaged, heading instead for Jeremy\u2019s office, where she looked around, carefully examining what to his eye was the utter destruction left behind. Furniture had been tossed or tipped over, computers smashed and paper was strewn everywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for something in particular?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>She gave him an absent look. \u201cHmm? No, just looking. More curiosity than anything else.\u201d She turned her hands over, scowling at the grime clinging to them. \u201cLet me wash my hands, and then I\u2019m done here, if you are.\u201d</p><p>Colin watched as she washed at the kitchen sink. \u201cJeremy\u2019s daytime hiding place, right?\u201d</p><p>She turned off the water and grabbed some paper towels before turning to give him a careful look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled knowingly. \u201cWhoever did this tore the house apart. There was equipment they could have fenced for good money, but instead they trashed everything. And Mariane\u2014\u201d His lip curled. \u201cI found her, Leighton. She wasn\u2019t just raped; she was tortured. They wanted something from her, and I\u2019m guessing that something was Jeremy. They didn\u2019t find him, even though he was close enough to scare the shit out of me within minutes of sundown. Now, we\u2019re either working together, or we\u2019re not. I\u2019m not asking for any deep vampire secrets, but I like to know I can trust the person I\u2019m working with.\u201d</p><p>Leighton stared at him for a long minute, then drew a thoughtful breath and exhaled noisily. \u201cYou have a point,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cSo, yes, Jeremy\u2019s daytime resting place is under that floor. I\u2019m guessing the vamps who boarded up the house moved some stuff around to conceal its location, since the house isn\u2019t really secure anymore. But, truthfully, even knowing where it was, I can\u2019t get inside. Which is why Jeremy\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marco?\u201d he asked, as they locked the door once again and headed for his truck.</p><p>\u201cHe and Preston both built their houses a while ago, and I\u2019m betting neither one of them had updated their security.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head, then stopped, eyeing the ground around his truck. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a lot of vehicles here recently. Your guys?\u201d</p><p>Leighton nodded. \u201cLord Raphael\u2019s security team was out here night before last, and some others came out last night to pick up some things for Jeremy. They\u2019re also the ones who boarded the place up,\u201d she added, gesturing toward the house.</p><p>\u201cLord Raphael?\u201d he repeated, not bothering to hide his skepticism.</p><p>She gave him a sidelong glance. \u201cYou better believe it. In the vampire world, he controls all of the U.S. west of the Rockies, plus a big chunk of the mountains themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean, controls? I\u2019ve never ever heard of him. How powerful can he be?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, unconcerned. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not a vampire. If you were, believe me, you\u2019d know about him, because, living here, he\u2019d be the only thing between you and instant death.\u201d</p><p>Colin frowned.</p><p>\u201cTrust me on this one. He\u2019s scary powerful. But you can judge for yourself tonight. You\u2019ve got that meeting at the compound. He\u2019ll be there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d he muttered, as they climbed back into the truck.</p><p>Neither of them said much on the way to Marco\u2019s. For his part, Colin was not looking forward to seeing the place with Marco gone. Not that they\u2019d been close, not like his friends from back home, and sure as hell nothing like his buddies from the SEAL teams. But they\u2019d both loved horses\u2014not just riding them, but the simple beauty of the animal. Marco had been so pleased to find someone he could talk to, someone who understood the fine points of horse breeding and training the way Colin did. Colin may not have taken up his father\u2019s business, but he\u2019d been raised on the family\u2019s ranch, had worked in the barns almost from the day he took his first step until he\u2019d walked away and joined the Navy. He\u2019d gone into the service partly because it was the last thing anyone expected of a boy from Georgia who\u2019d been nothing but trouble all through high school. But he\u2019d also done it to escape his father\u2019s determination to control every aspect of his youngest son\u2019s life.</p><p>It had been a surprise for Colin to discover he could still enjoy talking about the family business and he would miss those conversations with Marco.</p> <p>\u201cYou said a security team was out at Jeremy\u2019s,\u201d he said, breaking the silence. They visit Marco\u2019s place too?</p><p>She nodded. \u201cNight before last, same as Jeremy\u2019s and Preston\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see for myself in daylight so I can tell what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. Made sense to him. Although, to be honest, he still didn\u2019t know what to make of Leighton. She seemed to be just what she claimed, a private investigator hired by the vamps to look into these crimes. She didn\u2019t swarm all over his crime scene like some sort of drama queen pretender, and she didn\u2019t wave her gun around like an amateur. Neither one of her guns. He\u2019d noted the backup piece in the small of her back before they\u2019d left town.</p> <p>And his confusion wasn\u2019t just because she was a woman, either. He\u2019d served with plenty of females in the military, some good, some not, just like the men. But none of them had looked like a fucking fashion model or wore a diamond wedding ring that even his untutored eye knew was worth more than most people\u2019s annual salary. Not to mention showing up and claiming to work as a private investigator for vampires. How did one get a gig like that anyway?</p><p>He drove around the final curve to Marco\u2019s house, tree branches skimming the roof of his truck. Marco had valued his privacy. He\u2019d never bothered to make his house anymore approachable than absolutely necessary.</p><p>Colin stopped the truck and switched off the key, staring through the windshield. The place looked abandoned already. The paddock was empty, the doors open on the small barn\u2019s vacant stalls. Even the house looked diminished somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure the horses are safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He drew a deep breath and shoved open the truck door. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p> <p>A few minutes later, they were in the basement of Marco\u2019s house\u2014a basement Colin hadn\u2019t even known existed until Leighton had led him to it. All the times he\u2019d been in Marco\u2019s place and he\u2019d never noticed the door concealed by the den\u2019s paneling. But then, why would he?</p><p>Leighton had cruised the walls, running her hands along the joints, as if she knew what to look for. And clearly she did, because she\u2019d given a satisfied grunt and popped the door right open to reveal a rough stairway under the house. A chain pull had turned on the overhead light, but Leighton had augmented it with a couple of halogen lamps from the duffle bag she\u2019d thrown in the back of his Tahoe. It was bright as daylight in the basement now, which made what they were looking at even more of a surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Navy SEAL, right, Murphy?\u201d Leighton asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cRetired, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cThat makes you the expert as far as I\u2019m concerned. What do you think happened here?\u201d</p><p>Someone had blown a hell of a hole in Marco\u2019s basement wall, that\u2019s what had happened. Or not precisely in the wall. The target had been the reinforced door which now lay halfway on its side, warped and hanging from a single lower hinge, exposing a small insulated room beyond.</p><p>Apparently, this was Marco\u2019s daylight place, and it wasn\u2019t anything like they showed in movies. There was no coffin filled with dirt, no wax-draped wall sconces with cobwebbed candles. It was a modern, pleasant and simple bedroom with a queen-size bed and a single nightstand with a reading lamp. Or it had been before someone had trashed the place. Presumably after murdering Marco.</p><p>\u201cMurphy?\u201d she jogged him out of his thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. The door was heavy enough, and it had interior hinges, but it was old, and these walls . . .\u201d He slapped one of the crumbling structures. \u201c. . . are older than dirt and breaking up. There was probably just enough of a seam to shove some plastic explosive\u2014I can\u2019t say what kind without chem tests\u2014into the gap. Set the fuse and scurry back upstairs until it goes boom. A controlled explosion, blow the door off its hinges and . . . that\u2019s it.\u201d He sucked a breath through his nose and surveyed the damage. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Marco was pretty much helpless since they came at him during the day, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. And he lived out here all alone, so there was no one to defend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Who around here had the knowledge to do something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people. But, yeah, to answer your real question. Anyone with my kind of training sure as hell could have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny former military besides you live in Cooper\u2019s Rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot active, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows, questioning.</p><p>\u201cMy buddy grew up in Coop\u2019s. It\u2019s how I ended up here, but he left a while back. He\u2019s living down in San Diego and making big bucks working for a private contractor to the Pentagon. We\u2019ve got a couple of older guys who were in Vietnam back in the day. I suppose it\u2019s possible they\u2019d have the skills for this, but I\u2019m pretty sure they were regular infantry. Plus they stick to themselves and, from what I\u2019ve heard, they\u2019re both more concerned with getting stoned than killing anyone. Whoever did this wasn\u2019t stoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhoever did this was very focused and knew exactly what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, then checked her watch, which was an expensive but unshowy sports model. The lights caught her wedding ring again, and he tried unsuccessfully to imagine letting his wife work for vampires. Even as he thought it, he knew it wasn\u2019t a terribly modern attitude to have. Somehow, he didn\u2019t think Leighton cared much about what her husband let her do.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else you want to see here,\u201d she said, already moving toward the first halogen lamp. \u201cI\u2019d like to get over to Preston\u2019s before heading back to town.\u201d She doused the light without waiting for his answer, sending half the basement into deep shadow. The second lamp quickly followed until there was only the weak gleam of the overhead bulb, turning the wreckage of Marco\u2019s hideaway into nothing more than a black chasm of darkness beyond the dim, yellow glow.</p><p>Colin took a last look around the place where Marco had died and pulled the chain on the overhead, dropping the basement into darkness once again.</p><p>A short drive took them to Preston\u2019s house, which was more of the same. Different on the outside, there was no paddock or barn, but the basement could have been Marco\u2019s, right down to the method used to destroy the nearly identical safe room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the same guy built both places,\u201d Colin remarked, as they walked around to the back of his truck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did,\u201d Leighton said. She watched while he opened the cargo hatch, then hoisted her duffle inside. \u201cThe two of them moved up here at pretty much the same time. They never lived together, the way some vamps do, but they were friends. So, it\u2019s very possible they had the same contractor build their daylight rooms. Probably a vampire, since they wouldn\u2019t trust a human with that kind of knowledge. Either that or they killed the human as soon as he finished.\u201d</p><p>Colin stopped with his hand still on the open hatch overhead. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if that makes you feel better.\u201d She stepped back, so he could close the cargo door.</p><p>He studied her narrowly, trying to figure out if she was serious.</p><p>She saw him watching her and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Murphy. It was probably a vamp builder, anyway. Come on, I need to get back to town and pick up my car.\u201d</p><p>Colin walked down his side of the truck and slid behind the wheel. \u201cYou gonna be at the big meeting tonight with this guy Raphael?\u201d he asked as Leighton settled into the passenger\u2019s seat and reached for her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be too happy with me, though.\u201d She clicked the seat belt home. \u201cOr you, either.\u201d</p><p>Colin paused in the act of turning the ignition to stare at her. What the hell did that mean?</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Raphael woke to the scent of Cyn, warm and fresh from the shower, still smelling of soap and water and the light scent of her shampoo. Her skin was satiny smooth as she curved her body around his, her soft, full breasts a delightful weight against his bare chest, and her legs caressing his. She lay on top of him, kissing his closed eyes, her mouth lingering on his lips in invitation.</p><p>He stroked his fingers through her silky hair and down over her back. She hummed with pleasure, arching against his touch. Without warning, he tightened his hold and reversed their positions, so she was beneath him.</p><p>She smiled, raising her eyes to meet his . . . and sucked in a breath, freezing to stillness at the anger he knew she had found there.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d he asked with a deceptive calm.</p><p>Her expression flashed through a series of emotions\u2014surprise, guilt, even defeat briefly\u2014before finally settling on her usual angry defiance. \u201cI needed to see for myself, dammit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed away from her and rolled off the bed, heading toward the shower.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she called after him, her tone conveying both disbelief and outrage.</p><p>He spun around at the bathroom door, his eyes flashing silver sparks in the darkened room. \u201cDoes it ever occur to you that I have good reasons for what I ask of you, Cyn? That perhaps I understand certain dangers better, that there might be enemies who would use you against me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. There is always a but, isn\u2019t there? Always an excuse to do what you want, regardless of my wishes.\u201d</p><p>She jumped out of bed and strode across the room to confront him. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your vampires, Raphael. I don\u2019t have to follow your rules. Besides, I\u2019m fully capable of defending myself, and I wasn\u2019t alone. That local police guy, Colin Murphy, was with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better? To know that my mate is spending the day with another male while I sleep alone? As you would say, fan-fucking-tastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be childish. You know perfectly well\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildish? Perhaps you should look up the definition.\u201d He took a step back into the bathroom and closed the door, securing it with a small jolt of his power to keep her from trying to continue their argument in the shower. Her body was far too appealing and he didn\u2019t feel like being coaxed out of his temper tonight.</p><p>Raphael lingered in the shower longer than usual, just to make her wait. Even through the closed door, he could hear her muttering dire threats against him the entire time. He found it amusing overall and returned her angry glare with a bland smile when he finally surrendered the bathroom. He dressed while she showered and was knotting his tie when she finally came out, wrapped in a modestly big towel, as if she hadn\u2019t been naked in bed with him less than an hour before.</p><p>\u201cThe towel\u2019s a good look for you,\u201d he commented. She flipped him the finger over her shoulder and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He crossed to the bedside and picked up his watch, fastening it over his wrist as he watched her across the width of the bed. \u201cHow much longer will I be forced to endure these little power plays of yours, Cyn?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow much longer before you no longer feel the need to set yourself apart from me, to prove that you can do without me?\u201d</p><p>She spun around, and he could read the truth in her eyes before she drew a breath to deny it.</p> <p>\u201cBe honest with yourself, if not with me, lubimaya. I\u2019ll see you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was waiting for him when he emerged from the private corridor, standing with his back to Raphael, his attention seemingly on Wei Chen who was deep in conversation with a human woman near the front doors. Juro was looming over the pair, looking very unhappy and increasingly impatient. The woman\u2019s presence violated one of the basic rules for Raphael\u2019s security on this trip\u2014no humans were permitted within the compound after sunset unless they were mated to one of the vampires, or their presence was specifically cleared by Juro or Duncan.</p><p>As Raphael came up to Duncan, the woman glanced up, said something to Wei Chen and departed, shouldering a backpack not unlike what Cyn frequently carried.</p><p>Duncan spun around smoothly and greeted him. \u201cGood evening, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d Raphael said absently, frowning at the trio near the door. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works for Wei Chen, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared at the woman\u2019s departing back as Juro and two of his vampires escorted her down the outside stairs and toward the parking area.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the status on the security system check?\u201d he asked, turning his attention back to Duncan.</p> <p>\u201cMaxime is already on the ground, my lord,\u201d Duncan replied, referring to Raphael\u2019s computer security specialist. \u201cShe left L.A. just before dawn and daylighted on the tarmac in Seattle.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cShe\u2019s too young to be awake yet, but soon. The extra guards you requested flew in with her. By the end of tonight, we\u2019ll have tripled Wei Chen\u2019s human and vampire guard presence around the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElke is with them?\u201d As the only female member of Raphael\u2019s personal security team, Elke was frequently assigned to guard Cyn, and he wanted her here as an added precaution.</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cUnder protest, of course. You know how she feels about flying during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can protest all she wants. I want her here.\u201d He paused briefly at the sound of the elevator coming up. The hallway doors opened behind him and Cyn stomped across the room toward the dining hall without a word. He smiled grimly at Duncan\u2019s look of surprise. \u201cCynthia went exploring earlier today,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Duncan raised his eyebrows expressively. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Apparently, she rendezvoused with the local police force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Raphael saw Wei Chen approaching over Duncan\u2019s shoulder and nodded for him to join them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sire,\u201d Wei Chen said in his quiet voice. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know that all of our people will be within the compound shortly. The last few from Seattle are leaving their homes as we speak. Once your presence was known, everyone came immediately. It was only the distance that kept the Seattle people holding until this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is this police person due to arrive?\u201d he asked Wei Chen.</p><p>\u201cAt any moment, my lord. Loren told him\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan interrupted Wei Chen\u2019s account by nodding and holding a hand to his earpiece to indicate someone was calling him. Raphael watched expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHe just arrived at the gate, my lord,\u201d Duncan murmured, still listening to the voice in his ear. \u201cJuro will escort him in.\u201d</p><p>Raphael bared his teeth in a shark\u2019s grin. \u201cExcellent. Invite Sophia to join us, but give us a few moments with Mister Murphy first. I\u2019m eager to meet the man who spent the entire day alone with my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Colin lowered his window and eyed the hulking security guards who rushed to surround the truck. These weren\u2019t the usual compound guards. He didn\u2019t know the regular guys personally, but he\u2019d been here a time or two and this wasn\u2019t them. In fact, he didn\u2019t recognize a single face. The guard at his window\u2014vampire, obviously, given the bright red gleam of his eyes in the reflected glow of the gate lights\u2014studied his license photo carefully, checking it more than once as the others flashed lights into the backseat of his truck and lifted the cargo hatch door. Under any other circumstances, Colin would have objected to the search. But not tonight. These boys were deadly serious and he had a feeling they wouldn\u2019t bother with fine distinctions if it came right down to it.</p><p>The vamp at his window barked something in a language other than English and two of the others dropped out of sight as they checked his undercarriage. They were all using dim flashlights with a yellowish glow like a fog light, and they covered the lenses with their fingers, so only the tiniest sliver of light leaked out. Night sight, he realized. He knew vamps were supposed to have unparalleled night vision\u2014in fact, Leighton had said something about it earlier\u2014but he\u2019d never seen it used like this before.</p><p>The two vamps checking his undercarriage popped back into sight and snapped something in that same language. The guard at his window shoved his ID back at him and told him in heavily accented English to pull through the gate and park, indicating a small paved area a ways up the driveway and to the right.</p><p>Colin took his time, sliding his license into his wallet and his wallet into the zippered inside pocket of his windbreaker. He nodded politely, put the truck in gear and rolled slowly through the gate. Usually, he drove right up to the main building and parked there. But apparently there were new security measures for the big honcho\u2019s visit. So he pulled into the designated area, noting as he did so that his was the only vehicle there. So, not a lot of visitors. Or maybe it was just not a lot of human visitors, because he could see the main building from here and there was plenty of activity inside. Every light seemed to be lit and there were quite a few people moving around behind the big glass doors. Even the upstairs windows showed movement, the people there little more than shadow shapes behind the heavily frosted glass.</p><p>Turning off the engine, he grabbed the keys and opened the truck door, assuming someone would\u2014</p><p>\u201cMister Murphy.\u201d</p><p>Colin considered himself a big man. At six, four and two-hundred thirty pounds, he outclassed most people he encountered, even in the military. But the giant standing in front of him was huge. Sumo wrestler huge, but without the flab, and wearing a three thousand dollar suit. Seven feet of hard muscle and black, unflinching eyes which held a faint golden glow as they regarded Colin.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Colin answered, although it hadn\u2019t been a question.</p><p>\u201cAre you armed?\u201d the Japanese vampire rumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. I\u2019m a licensed security consultant for the town of Cooper\u2019s Rest and, as such, authorized to carry at all times.\u201d</p><p>He thought he saw a slight softening of the giant\u2019s mouth, as if something Colin said was amusing. \u201cThat may be, Mister Murphy. But you are no longer in Cooper\u2019s Rest and you will not be permitted to carry a weapon into my master\u2019s presence.\u201d</p><p>Colin kept his face carefully blank. Master? Neither Loren nor Wei Chen had ever called anyone \u201cmaster.\u201d He seriously considered\u2014for about two seconds\u2014throwing his hands up on the whole deal and walking away. He didn\u2019t need this shit. He certainly didn\u2019t need to walk into a building full of vampires without even his sidearm for protection. But he really wanted to know who was behind the attack on Mariane, and he honestly doubted that, whoever this \u201cmaster\u201d was, he intended to serve Colin up as a light supper.</p><p>Colin sighed. \u201cCan I leave it in my truck then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Holding up his empty hands, he slowly pushed his windbreaker off his right hip, unsnapped his holster and gun from his belt and, opening the truck door, leaned in and deposited it in the console compartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo other weapons?\u201d The giant vamp asked, eyeing him up and down with that remarkable night vision. \u201cNo backup piece?\u201d he added.</p><p>Colin jolted a bit at the colloquialism coming out of the Sumo wrestler\u2019s mouth, but he shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d need one,\u201d he said, waiting calmly beneath the vamp\u2019s scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Follow me.\u201d</p> <p>As they started up the curved driveway, the vampire spoke into a throat mike that Colin hadn\u2019t noticed before. He didn\u2019t catch the words, but he didn\u2019t have to. The giant had just told someone inside that they were on their way.</p><p>Loren was waiting for them just inside the door. He stepped forward immediately and shook Colin\u2019s hand. \u201cColin, good of you to come.\u201d</p><p>Colin gave the security chief a bemused smile. \u201cI could hardly refuse, could I? Besides, I\u2019m sure we all want the same thing. To stop whoever\u2019s doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice you\u2019ve got a lot more security out there tonight. Have there been more attacks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that,\u201d Loren assured him, glancing at the vampire hulking behind Colin. \u201cJust a precaution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeighton told me about Marco, Loren. And Preston. I was kind of surprised no one thought to let me know. Especially about Marco.\u201d</p><p>Loren had the grace to look uncomfortable. He\u2019d known that Colin and Marco were friends. \u201cMy apologies, Colin. We weren\u2019t certain what was happening and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A cool voice interrupted. \u201cLoren was told not to share that information, Mister Murphy.\u201d</p><p>Loren stiffened to attention like a sailor fresh out of RTC, twitching visibly as he spun around to face the speaker. \u201cDuncan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin Murphy,\u201d Colin interrupted, holding out a hand, even as he studied the newcomer\u2014Duncan\u2014curiously. He was broad-shouldered, but shorter than Colin, an even six feet, maybe six-one, and he wore the same sort of tailored suit the Sumo wrestler was wearing. Obviously a uniform of sorts.</p> <p>The vampire noticed Colin\u2019s open appraisal and smiled crookedly, his brown eyes lighting up with a very human warmth. But he was definitely a vampire for all that. And judging by Loren\u2019s reaction, not just any vampire either. This guy Duncan was somebody.</p><p>He gave Colin\u2019s hand a friendly shake, using enough pressure to make it felt, but not enough to intimidate. Careful, calculated, Colin thought.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Duncan,\u201d the blond vamp said unnecessarily.</p><p>No last name, no title, Colin noted and shrugged inwardly.</p><p>Duncan turned slightly and gestured across the great room to where he saw Cynthia Leighton disappearing between a huge set of open double doors.</p><p>\u201cLord Raphael is waiting for us,\u201d Duncan explained.</p><p>Well, okay. Apparently, Colin was about to meet the head honcho. What was it Leighton had said this afternoon? That this guy ruled most of the Western United States? Including part of the Rockies. Mustn\u2019t forget the Rockies. He frowned when he remembered what else she\u2019d said. That the big honcho wasn\u2019t going to be happy with her . . . or with Colin either.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>Raphael sat in the same chair as the night before, well aware of the dramatic setting created by the panoramic wall of glass behind him. The moon was full tonight and for once in this perpetually rainy place, the clouds were only scattered, so the moon\u2019s silver glow lit the sky, making it seem more blue than black.</p><p>With his own people securing the gate and grounds, there was no need for additional security inside the room, so there was nothing between him and the wall of glass but empty space.</p><p>He settled back into the big chair, watching as Cyn entered and remained standing against the far wall, regarding him narrowly. He met her gaze and raised a single eyebrow in question. She rolled her eyes in response, but pushed away from the wall and strode across the room, standing in her usual place to his right, but far enough away that he couldn\u2019t touch her easily.</p><p>She held her position, stiff and unyielding, for a few minutes, then sighed audibly and sidled nearer, speaking in a voice meant only for his ears. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know about Marco and Preston until I told him. He said he and Marco were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it a moment, then said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my Cyn,\u201d he murmured and stroked one finger down the back of her thigh, closer now that she\u2019d shifted in order to talk with him.</p><p>The muscle beneath his finger tightened and she huffed out a disgusted breath. But she didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>He bit back a smile, looking up when he heard footsteps approaching the room. His smile had disappeared altogether by the time Duncan appeared between the doors with Colin Murphy in tow.</p><p>Colin followed Duncan into a really large and nearly empty room. The far wall was nothing but glass with a million dollar view down across the valley and probably all the way to the bay. It was spectacular, but his gaze quickly fell instead to the black-haired vampire sitting in a big chair in front of the window. Every nerve in his body jolted straight into the classic fight or flight reaction. Years of training, of experience on the deadliest battlegrounds in the world, were screaming at him to defend himself, to draw the fucking gun he didn\u2019t have, put a wall at his back and get the hell gone. Forget the big Sumo wrestler behind him, forget Cynthia Leighton with her guns and Duncan with his watchful, human eyes. Lord Raphael, and it had to be him, gave off a vibe so strong it crushed against Colin\u2019s chest like three hundred pounds of iron on a bench press. Some instinct deep inside his hindbrain, maybe something left over from his primitive ancestors who\u2019d looked to the gods for protection from the natural world, wanted him to drop to his knees and pledge undying fealty.</p><p>But Colin Murphy didn\u2019t kneel to anyone, and he\u2019d pledged his loyalty to his country and his team long ago. It was everything he could do to hold that cold, black stare, but he did it, forcing himself to stay cool. No problem here. Just a meeting with the local vamps. Like hell.</p><p>The pressure dropped away and Colin breathed what he hoped was a subtle sigh of relief. The damn vampire was regarding him with veiled amusement and Colin knew it could have been much, much worse. He felt a surge of anger at the knowledge he\u2019d been toyed with, but gritted his teeth and said nothing. That was another lesson he\u2019d learned in the military. There were times when you just had to grin and bear it.</p><p>Like when you were facing down a vampire who could squash you like a bug. Come to think of it, now that the games were over, that was pretty much the look Raphael was giving him, like he was something unpleasant that had ended up smashed against his windshield.</p><p>With the pressure more or less off, Colin took the opportunity to check out the surroundings, which was what he should have been doing instead of staring at the view. Lord Raphael was sitting in a huge chair placed right in front of that spectacular wall of glass. Was it arrogance that put him there where a good sniper\u2019s bullet could take him out? Hell, maybe bullets couldn\u2019t touch this guy. But bulletproof or not, Colin was going with arrogance, because this guy had it in spades. Colin had faced down some tough assholes in his time\u2014drug dealers, tribal leaders, hell, even a terrorist or two. But none of them held a candle to the vampire sitting in front of him.</p><p>He gave the rest of the room a quick scan. There were clusters of furniture scattered throughout, but only the area directly around Raphael was occupied. Wei Chen sat on a short, leather couch to Colin\u2019s left, along with Loren. Jeremy was present, too, sitting on one of three matching chairs to the right. The other two chairs were empty.</p><p>Colin nodded at Jeremy. \u201cJeremy, how\u2019s Mariane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s recovering,\u201d the vampire said stiffly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Colin shifted his gaze back to Raphael. Duncan had taken up a position to the big guy\u2019s left; Cynthia Leighton stood on his right, close enough that her leg brushed up against the chair arm where . . . Ah shit. No wonder Leighton had said Raphael wouldn\u2019t be happy with him. They were an item. Hell, no, he thought, remembering the ring on her finger. Not just an item. They were fucking married or whatever it was vampires did. And Colin had spent the whole day alone with her.</p><p>He raised his eyes to meet Raphael\u2019s again. The vampire lord curled his lips into a smug smile, clearly having noticed Colin\u2019s ah shit moment. Raphael blinked lazily and said, \u201cMy Cyn tells me you knew Marco.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t miss the possessive pronoun. A potted plant wouldn\u2019t have missed the fucking possessive pronoun.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends,\u201d he said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. An interesting man, Marco. His family was Spanish aristocracy, you know. A direct lineage to Queen Isabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery interesting,\u201d Colin agreed, \u201csince Marco was Italian and his family were merchants. He had a genealogical chart hanging in his living room, said it reminded him of where he came from.\u201d</p><p>The smile was more genuine this time. \u201cYou were right, my Cyn,\u201d Raphael said to Leighton, although he never stopped looking at Colin. \u201cHave a seat, Mister Murphy.\u201d He indicated the empty chair next to Jeremy. \u201cLoren, ask Sophia to join us.\u201d</p><p>Colin headed for the chair closest to the door, leaving the one between him and Jeremy vacant. It was a classic guy move, but that wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d done it. It was just good tactics to get as far away from Raphael and as close to the door as possible.</p><p>His ass had just hit the chair when the doors opened and Loren returned, followed by a dark-haired woman. She was short and curvy, her dark head turned toward Juro, murmuring her thanks as he held the door open until she was through, then pulled it closed behind her. She took a graceful step into the room, her gaze going left, skimming over Wei Chen and Loren, before turning large brown eyes toward Colin where they widened into a disbelieving stare.</p><p>Colin stood, his heart slamming against his chest wall.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Sophia stared at Colin Murphy, the last man she\u2019d ever expected to see again. He was her one and only regret, the only human she\u2019d truly loved through her centuries as a vampire. And what the hell was he doing here? He was from the South somewhere. She couldn\u2019t remember where exactly, but she did remember that slow, lazy drawl in his deep voice, the way he whispered delicious things to her as his hands did . . . She snapped herself back to the present, shocked at her reaction after all this time. She was aware of everyone in the room watching them, could feel Raphael\u2019s stare all but drilling a hole in her head. This was the last thing she needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cColin,\u201d she managed. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her, anger replacing disbelief, darkening those striking blue eyes of his. She remembered that, too. The way his eyes darkened with emotion as he thrust deep inside her, filling more than just her body, filling her soul, making her feel so alive, so treasured, so . . . loved. Meu Deus, she couldn\u2019t do this now. She tore her gaze away from him, taking the two steps forward that would take him out of her sight, out of temptation. She bowed from the waist to Lord Raphael, feeling too unsteady to achieve anything close to the grace required for a curtsey.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Raphael was studying her with shrewd eyes that saw everything. He had already been suspicious of her, wary that she\u2019d shown up out of nowhere claiming to be searching for Lucien. And now there was Colin, who was apparently the local sheriff they\u2019d been talking about. This could only make Raphael suspect her even more. She met his gaze evenly, having nothing to hide. He tilted his head toward her in silent query.</p><p>\u201cColin . . . that is Mister Murphy and I knew each other several years ago, my lord. In another country. I didn\u2019t know he was living in this area now.\u201d Or, Lucien be damned, I never would have come here, she thought to herself.</p><p>Raphael watched her a silent moment longer, then said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Vancouver tonight, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked in surprise, taken aback enough that all thoughts of the man standing behind her fled. Raphael was going to Vancouver? Crossing into Lucien\u2019s territory without invitation? Her back stiffened in outrage. Who the hell did he think he was? She glared at him, not bothering to conceal her anger, but fighting against the instinctive desire to lash out with her power, to slap him down for such an insult to her master. Because to do so would have been suicide, and Sophia was not ready to die. Not for this, and not before she knew what had happened to Lucien.</p><p>And not before she had a chance to talk to Colin.</p> <p>She bowed her head slightly to Raphael. \u201cI will accompany you, my lord,\u201d she said, as if he hadn\u2019t pretty much ordered her to do so.</p><p>A smile played around his lips. \u201cExcellent. We leave in half an hour. First, however\u2014\u201d He paused as Duncan leaned down and whispered something in his ear. \u201cA minor change of plans. We\u2019ll leave for Vancouver as planned. For the rest, however . . . please excuse us, Mister Murphy. Some business has arisen which I must take care of. We do appreciate your cooperation in this investigation, however. Cyn will contact you later regarding our mutual efforts to locate the killers.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood, gesturing to the human woman who, Sophia had discovered, was far more than the vampire lord\u2019s arm candy; she was his mate. Vampires frequently took mates, but it was unusual for a vampire lord to do so. Or maybe that was just her experience with Lucien.</p><p>Everyone had risen when Raphael did, and now there was a general movement in the direction of the doors. Sophia looked around quickly and saw that Colin was already gone. She held back until Raphael had cleared the doors, then shoved her way past Loren and Jeremy, emerging into the great room in time to see Colin slam open the big glass door and head down the outside stairs. Rushing after him, she waited until she too was outside before calling his name.</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d His shoulders tensed, but he kept going. \u201cColin!\u201d she repeated and put on a burst of vampire speed to catch up with him. She considered grabbing his arm, but circled him instead, planting herself in his path.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said again, meeting his furious gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry?\u201d he growled. \u201cSorry, Sophie? Is that the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cI know. It was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessary? What was fucking necessary about it? It\u2019s not like I put any demands on you. We weren\u2019t married. Hell, for all I know I wasn\u2019t even the only guy you were doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she protested, letting her pain show, even though she knew she had no right.</p><p>\u201cThen why, Sophie? I went through hell, thinking I\u2019d left you there to die. I\u2019d like to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a vampire! Don\u2019t you understand? What was I supposed to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so simple. What would you have said, Colin? What would you have done if I\u2019d told you all those years ago that I was Vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know, will we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was impossible, what we had. Human and vampire. It would never have worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to stop your friend Raphael in there.\u201d</p><p>Sophia laughed bitterly. \u201cHe\u2019s not my friend. He\u2019s . . . Ai Jesus, he\u2019s the most powerful vampire I\u2019ve ever met. If he wanted you dead, your heart would be nothing but pulp in his fist before you ever saw him move. Don\u2019t take him lightly, Colin. Or his mate either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped her and started to leave, but Sophia put herself in front of him once more. \u201cColin.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cYeah, whatever. I\u2019ll see you around, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Sophia watched him walk away and knew it was the right thing to do. Again. She\u2019d survived this long by not caring about anyone, a lesson learned from Lucien. They were two of a kind, she and her Sire. Dancing their way through life, never caring too much about anyone or anything, no strings to bind them, no untidy emotions to tug at their hearts and hold them in any one place for too long.</p><p>Colin was the only one who\u2019d ever tempted her, with his deep voice and warm hands, his big body wrapped around her against the night\u2019s chill. He was a warrior born. It was in his bones and blood, every instinct he had drove him to protect those he cared about. And he\u2019d cared about her. He\u2019d loved her. And she\u2019d loved him back. She\u2019d gone to that caf\u00e9 to save him. And she\u2019d lost him instead.</p><p>She rubbed her hands up and down arms gone suddenly cold and sighed, turning back toward the main building. That long ago night was history, where it belonged. She had problems enough with Lucien and his infernal games. And apparently she was going back to Vancouver tonight. Raphael had decided it would be, and so it would. He didn\u2019t need her to cross the border, but her presence would give him the appearance of propriety. Lucien might still be alive, but he\u2019d pretty much ceded control of his territory to her for the duration. If she invited Raphael across the border, it would serve well enough. And who was there to protest it, in any event? Not Lucien, curse his black soul.</p><p>She shivered again and hurried up the stairs, telling herself it was the damp night air making her feel so cold. It had nothing to do with the ice around her heart. Ice that had begun to crack the moment she\u2019d seen Colin Murphy again.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Raphael and his people followed Loren through a nondescript metal door and down an unadorned stairway, with its flat painted walls and ordinary metal pipe handrail. The compound had an extensive basement which included the vampires\u2019 sleeping quarters, but this particular stairway had only one destination, and that was a state-of-the-art computer room, which was also the heart and soul of the security network. Raphael kept Cyn just ahead of him, with Juro between her and Loren. Duncan was behind him, just over his left shoulder, as always. The rest of his security team remained upstairs.</p><p>Maxime, his computer specialist and the vampire who had designed this particular system, had arrived from L.A. earlier and begun her assessment immediately, searching for possible breaches. Raphael wanted a minimal audience for this particular briefing, just in case.</p><p>Loren reached the bottom of the stairs and turned right down a truncated hallway. \u201cThis way, my lord,\u201d he directed.</p><p>Not that Raphael needed direction. There was nowhere else to go down here. He touched Cyn\u2019s shoulder, more for the sake of touching her than for guidance. She would be very unhappy with him again later. He\u2019d put plans into motion to ensure her safety and he doubted she\u2019d go along with it easily. But he wasn\u2019t going to change his mind, and he would not apologize for wanting her safe.</p><p>Ahead of him, Loren entered a nine digit code and pressed his thumb against a biometric scanner. The locking device buzzed loudly and opened with the thunk of retracting bolts. Maxime was already there, her spiky blond head bent, as always, over a keyboard, her gaze riveted to the lines of computer code rolling down the screen in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMaxime,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>She finished whatever she was typing and spun around with a somewhat dazed look, blinking rapidly before managing an awkward smile. \u201cPardon, my lord. I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201d He pulled out a chair from the long table running the length of the room and offered it to Cyn, before seating himself on the one next to it.</p><p>Maxime grabbed a pad of paper covered with notes and rolled her chair up to the table backwards, spinning it around at the last moment to face them. \u201cMy lord. A primer on the nature of this system first, if I may?\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded his permission.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d she indicated the banks of computers, monitors and security video displays around her, \u201c\u2014is the heart of the compound. Its main function is security, but to that end, it controls every aspect of the environmental system, from lights to air quality. Every lock on every door or window can be monitored from here, as well as the various stations on the perimeter. With a single key stroke, the entire compound can be locked down if desired. It is, and this is vital, my lord, a closed system. There is no, and I mean absolutely no, contact with the outside world. No Internet access, no outgoing line of any kind. There is a separate server, maintained in a separate office, which provides Internet access for the residents here, but there is nothing else on that server. All information of a sensitive nature, and that is defined in the broadest terms, is stored here in this room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich means what?\u201d Raphael asked, urging her along. Maxime loved her work. It was what made her so good at it, that and a truly brilliant mind. But she would go on a bit if not nudged in the right direction.</p><p>\u201cIt means no one can access the information stored here from outside the compound, or even from outside this room. It also means,\u201d she hurried on, \u201cthe database on our vampires, including names and addresses, could not be accessed by anyone who did not have authorization to enter here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone who got into this room, whether authorized or not,\u201d Cyn qualified.</p> <p>Maxime stared at Cyn blankly for a few seconds, as if trying to compute what she\u2019d just heard. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBut the security here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs not infallible, Max. No one\u2019s is,\u201d Cyn interrupted.</p><p>Maxime frowned. \u201cTheoretically, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve checked for unauthorized access, of course,\u201d Raphael said, bringing them back to the purpose of their briefing.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. There has been none. No one not authorized entered this room. I have digital video if you would like to see it, archived for the last year, which covers virtually the entire period this compound has been functional.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a record of who accessed the database, even if they were authorized?\u201d Cyn asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And I\u2019ve checked it, as well. But I\u2019m running a deeper scan now. It is possible, again theoretically, for a highly skilled operator, to cover his or her tracks. But not completely. If someone has illegally invaded this system, I will know within twenty-four hours. However, at this time, I would say there has been no breach of security. Your leak is somewhere else. I have the data, my lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head as Maxime spun back to her computer station, retrieved a thick stack of papers covered with data and spun around again, offering them to him. \u201cNo, thank you, Maxime. I trust your skills completely.\u201d</p><p>Maxime gave Cyn a triumphant look that had Cyn turning to meet his eyes with an expression of supreme annoyance. Raphael winked at her and stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you to it, Maxime. Advise Duncan the moment you have anything new.\u201d</p><p>The stairs up from the basement security center left them on the first floor in a back hallway of the main building. As they headed toward the great room once again, Raphael turned to Duncan.</p><p>\u201cMake sure Sophia is ready. And find out what you can about her history with Colin Murphy. I suspect the answer will lie in his background, not hers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a former SEAL,\u201d Cyn said, turning around and walking slowly backwards. \u201cHis records will be hard to come by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Duncan said with a grin.</p><p>Cyn shook her head, smiling at Raphael\u2019s lieutenant. \u201cAre there no secrets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>Cyn spun around at the familiar voice, staring at Elke who was waiting for them at the end of the hallway. She was dressed in the typical uniform of his security forces, her pale hair and even paler skin a sharp contrast to the dark charcoal suit.</p><p>\u201cElke?\u201d Cyn said in obvious surprise. \u201cWhen did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d the female vampire said, obviously disgruntled. \u201cI only know the sun was shining, which means I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Cyn shot Raphael a suspicious glance over her shoulder, clearly anticipating the reason for Elke\u2019s sudden appearance. \u201cWell,\u201d Cyn said to Elke. \u201cWelcome to Seattle. Have fun.\u201d She strode away quickly without looking back.</p> <p>Elke watched her go, before turning to Raphael with a puzzled expression. \u201cWas I not supposed to be here, my lord? Duncan said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are where you belong, Elke. Duncan, find Sophia and get someone started on tracing her history with Colin Murphy. I\u2019ll return shortly.\u201d</p><p>Raphael strode across the great room and down the corridor, stopping the elevator doors from closing when he was still several steps away. It took only a small exertion of his will, holding them back until he entered. He released the doors and they closed immediately. Cyn was leaning against the far wall, both hands behind her. She waited until the elevator was moving before saying quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She frowned in confusion. \u201cBut Elke\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doors opened on their darkened suite, the vault door standing open for the night. Raphael gestured for Cyn to go ahead of him. She did so, but not without a distrustful, sideways glance as she passed in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo why send for Elke specifically?\u201d she asked, stopping halfway across the room to confront him.</p><p>\u201cI asked Duncan to reinforce the security on the compound with some of our own people. Not that I don\u2019t trust Wei Chen or his guards, but mine are better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Elke\u2019s just part of that?\u201d</p><p>Raphael closed the distance between them, brushing her body with his and cupping her face in both hands. He whispered a kiss against her forehead, her eyes, traced the soft fullness of her lips with his tongue before claiming her mouth with a long, slow kiss. She responded automatically, lifting herself onto her toes to meet him, her arms sliding beneath his jacket and curling around his back.</p><p>He gave up her mouth reluctantly, swirling his tongue over her lips and dropping several gentle, swift kisses on her mouth. \u201cI love you, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were bright with emotion when they met his. \u201cI love you, too. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, suddenly recognizing she should be worried. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>He smiled to reassure her. \u201cNo but, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lubimaya me, you sneaky bastard. I know a \u2018but\u2019 when I hear one.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cAbout your need to move about more freely while we uncover whoever\u2019s behind these murders. I brought you here, after all, not just because I wanted you with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cyn scoffed noisily and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI would miss you, my Cyn,\u201d he chided.</p><p>\u201cUh huh. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also brought you with me to make use of your investigative skills. Skills which you cannot employ fully if you\u2019re pinned to my side all night and day.\u201d</p><p>She was listening to every word, clearly trying to find the catch. And there was a catch, Raphael knew. He just hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014because your safety is far more important to me than your investigative skills\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to hide out here in the basement while you and everyone else get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought in the appropriate personnel,\u201d Raphael continued, talking over her protest, \u201cto serve as your bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him open-mouthed. \u201cFuck that! That\u2019s the real reason Elke\u2019s here, isn\u2019t it? You lied to me. She is my babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is one of your bodyguards, just as Juro and the others are mine. You\u2019re the one who insists I need protecting. Surely one could argue the same of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. You\u2019re the damn vampire lord! Everyone wants to take you out. No one up here even knows who I am. They\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do.\u201d Raphael\u2019s temper finally snapped. \u201cThree minutes after you walked down that poor excuse for a main street, every soul in this misbegotten village knew exactly who you were and what you were doing here. You\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being unreasonable? Fine. Elke can sit and watch me read all fucking night long, then. I\u2019ll just wait until the sun comes up and then go about my business. Unless you\u2019re planning on chaining me to your bed every morning, too?\u201d</p><p>Raphael fought for patience. If any of his vampires had spoken to him thus, they\u2019d have been groveling on the floor by now, begging for their foolish lives. But, as she pointed out to him over and over again, Cyn was not one of his vampires. And the last thing he wanted was to see her hurt. Which was why they were having this damn argument in the first place.</p><p>\u201cI would not require anything so crude as chains to keep you here if I chose,\u201d he said at last. \u201cHowever, when you leave the compound in daylight, a human guard will accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You go ahead, assign your little watchdog. I\u2019ll just ditch him,\u201d she retorted childishly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, lubimaya. I know you far too well to trust your cooperation. If you ditch your assigned guard, there will be a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>Raphael gave her a slow, satisfied smile. She saw it and gasped softly. \u201cWhat?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a price, my Cyn, but you will not be the one to pay it. Your human bodyguard will. And I think we both know the price I would exact for a failure of this nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rules, Raphael. You can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but, my Cyn, I am Vampire. I don\u2019t follow your rules.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, hearing her earlier words thrown back at her. \u201cFine,\u201d she snapped, ripping off her jacket and starting on her shoulder harness. \u201cHave fun in Vancouver. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cShould you decide to go out later this evening, Elke will be waiting for you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her toward him as she slipped out of her shoulder holster, drawing her in for an entirely different sort of kiss, this one hard and proprietary. She kissed him back, giving as good as she got, and finally bit his lower lip until he laughed and stepped away. He watched her lick his blood from her mouth, seeing the flush it brought to her cheeks, and felt his groin grow heavy in response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He met her gaze, which was half angry and half aroused. \u201cBe safe, lubimaya,\u201d he said and left her there, not looking back until he was inside the elevator and the doors were almost closed. He met her eyes at the last moment and saw her lips move almost silently.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p> <p>Raphael came out of the elevator, locking it behind him. It wouldn\u2019t lock Cyn in, but it would keep anyone else out. Elke was waiting for him, standing in the open doors between the elevator hallway and the great room where she could see anyone coming or going from either area.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t go anywhere alone,\u201d he ordered. \u201cNowhere, Elke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met her eyes with a flat stare, emphasizing the seriousness of his order. He knew all too well Cyn\u2019s ability to talk people into things they wouldn\u2019t do otherwise, and she and Elke were friends of a sort. But he was Elke\u2019s Sire and his will would trump or heads would roll.</p> <p>He put all of this into a single glance that had Elke stiffening to attention. \u201cI will protect her, my lord. On my life.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded and turned his attention to Duncan, who\u2019d crossed to his side. \u201cSophia is waiting outside, Sire. And our people are working on ferreting out Colin Murphy\u2019s record. Maxime insisted on doing it herself. She seemed to feel cracking the Defense Department\u2019s records would be an enjoyable exercise of her skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather she focus on the possible breach of security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said as much to her, but she indicated the diagnostics will run without her intervention for several hours, while the records search on Murphy would take, in her words, a fun few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her to keep in touch, Duncan. This little trip to Vancouver will probably take up most of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already instructed her to call as soon as she has anything.\u201d</p> <p>Their conversation had taken them across the great room to where Juro waited near the entrance. At a nod from Raphael, the big vampire opened one of the heavy glass doors to admit a blast of wet, cold air.</p><p>\u201cLovely weather,\u201d Raphael commented.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan agreed. \u201cPerhaps we should consider relocating from the Malibu estate.\u201d</p><p>Raphael grunted and climbed through the open door of the waiting SUV, sliding across the bench seat to make room for Duncan. \u201cI shall give the idea all due consideration,\u201d Raphael replied.</p><p>The journey to the border was surprisingly quick. The three SUVs slowed as they neared the boundary between the U.S. and Canada, and Raphael waited to feel the press of Lucien\u2019s power against his own. It struck him that he should have sensed the first trickles of the other vampire lord\u2019s power long ago, leaking across their territorial lines. He knew with certainty that Lucien could detect his power from well inside the Canadian side of the border, even within his own lair. Try as they might to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty, power was not something that could be cut with a knife. There was always leakage.</p><p>But tonight, there was nothing of Lucien to be felt, not even within the border checkpoint, where they waited while the Canadian agents verified their identification. Sophia\u2019s Brazilian passport caused a small delay, but only because it was unexpected. Raphael and his people were all perfectly legal citizens of the U.S. and carried valid passports to prove it. Vampires might not consider themselves subject to human law, but neither did they flaunt it unnecessarily.</p><p>As they waited, Raphael sent out feelers, searching for Lucien, but he still felt nothing at all. He frowned, concentrating harder as they crossed the territorial line and headed toward the lights of nearby Vancouver.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Lucien\u2019s headquarters, Juro,\u201d he said, suddenly. \u201cHave Sophia call ahead to prepare his staff. I don\u2019t want any pointless shows of defiance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Juro said and gave directions over the radio to the SUV in front of them.</p><p>Raphael paid little attention to the city as they sped through. The clouds had closed in again, cloaking everything in darkness, but the general impression was one of a typical big city, with its brightly lit business and residential towers marching right up to the water\u2019s edge. Streets and highways were full of cars and trucks, and even at this hour, they had to slow several times for traffic. There were occasional flashes of the bay, but that too was crowded, with fishing boats and warehouses.</p><p>Raphael was certain the humans who lived here were fond of their city, and he knew it had a deserved reputation for sophistication and charm. He also knew that Los Angeles was a far more crowded city. But then, he rarely had to deal with L.A.\u2019s suburban sprawl or its packed freeways. When he thought of L.A., it was only of his estate in Malibu with the endless, empty sea stretching beyond the cliffs below his home.</p><p>As they neared the city center, Raphael finally felt the first stirring of power, so faint he would never have credited it as coming from the Canadian lord if he didn\u2019t know better. Sitting quietly in the backseat, he tried to reach out, to grab hold of the weak tendril and follow it to its origin, but it was gone, lost in a wash of general vampiric power. Most of Lucien\u2019s Canadian vampires lived here in Vancouver, and most were concentrated in the downtown area. There was a large contingent in Toronto and a smaller one in Montreal, with the rest scattered throughout the vast Canadian territory. But none of those equaled the Vancouver nest in size, simply because this was the city where Lucien spent most of his time.</p><p>Even so, it shouldn\u2019t have been possible for a vampire lord\u2019s signature to be lost among those of his subjects. Something was seriously wrong with Lucien, and Raphael was beginning to suspect he knew what it was. But first, he would have to deal with Lucien\u2019s people, who would not welcome his intrusion into their master\u2019s domain.</p><p>Raphael studied Lucien\u2019s Vancouver headquarters when it came into view. It was a stately home, perched in the hills high above the city. Almost Victorian in appearance, it had been built just after World War I to Lucien\u2019s specifications, and it boasted balconies and gables at every turn of its three stories. Every window and door was blazing with light when the SUVs pulled up in front, as if Lucien\u2019s people were shining a beacon to guide their Sire home.</p><p>The passenger door on the front SUV popped open as soon as they came to a stop, and Sophia jumped out, hurrying through the gate and up the long walkway. The front door opened before she reached it, white light pouring out briefly before the door filled to overflowing with vampires who surged out onto the porch and down the stairs. One of the males stepped ahead of the rest, stalking toward Sophia angrily.</p><p>\u201cDarren Yamanaka, my lord,\u201d Duncan provided. \u201cLucien\u2019s lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>Raphael watched the two of them arguing. Yamanaka was only average in height, but he was thickly built and trying to use his size to his advantage. Not that it seemed to be working, since Sophia didn\u2019t appear the least bit intimidated by the larger male. But then her power exceeded Yamanaka\u2019s by a considerable margin, which was all that really mattered. Raphael let the argument continue for a few moments, then shifted irritably.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he said. Reaching to his left, he yanked the latch and shoved the truck door open on his side. Rounding the front of the truck, he pushed through the gate and came up behind Sophia in time to hear Yamanaka accusing her of betraying their master, of inviting the enemy into the heart of his territory, that enemy being Raphael himself, of course.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Raphael said quietly, putting sufficient power into it that every vampire present heard him and obeyed.</p><p>Darren shot Sophia a killing glare before turning it on Raphael. \u201cWe will not surrender without a fight, my lord. You may kill us all, but you will pay some price at least for the theft of our Sire\u2019s life and sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Raphael studied Darren, admiring the vampire\u2019s courage, even as he disdained the foolishness of it. \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, Yamanaka. If I wanted your master\u2019s territory, you\u2019d be dead already.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s eyes flared briefly, but as he was not, in truth, suicidal, he turned his anger on Sophia, instead. \u201cIs this how you help our Sire, Sophia? You bring his enemy to his doorstep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Darren,\u201d Sophia hissed. \u201cI slapped you down once, and I can do it again. If you read Lucien\u2019s letter, you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter?\u201d Darren asked, his anger disappearing.</p><p>Sophia opened her mouth to respond, but Raphael intervened. \u201cPerhaps we should take this inside,\u201d he suggested. \u201cOr is it your intent to entertain the neighbors?\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked smug, but Yamanaka jolted at his words, darting glances at the other houses up and down the street. Granted none was closer than a hundred yards, but sound carried unexpectedly in hills like these.</p><p>\u201cWe will use Lucien\u2019s study,\u201d Sophia announced serenely and gestured toward the house in invitation.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Raphael agreed. He started up the walkway, his security forming a tight cordon around him, effectively brushing aside any last ditch objections by Lucien\u2019s people. Yamanaka watched broodingly as they passed and Raphael was aware of Lucien\u2019s lieutenant falling in behind as they reached the stairs.</p><p>He felt a brush of Sophia\u2019s power and heard her chide the other vampire, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Darren.\u201d</p><p>Raphael smiled grimly without looking back. He hadn\u2019t come here looking for conquest, but if Lucien was truly gone, it might not hurt to winnow the field of contenders before he left. After all, Raphael didn\u2019t want a fool sitting on his northern border.</p><p>Once inside, Sophia directed them to a narrow staircase and up to the third floor. She strode around Raphael and his security at that point, leading the way down a short hallway to a pair of closed doors. Like everything else in the house, they were old and much narrower than those found in more modern homes. But they were also well cared for and carved in beautiful detail. Sophia pushed the doors open and crossed the room, pulling aside a pair of heavy curtains to reveal the lights of Vancouver behind a set of French doors leading to the balcony beyond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room itself was large and filled with Lucien\u2019s papers and possessions, as well as a strong sense of the vampire lord\u2019s powerful presence. Drinking in that essence, as if Lucien himself stood in the room, Raphael went directly to the glass doors on the opposite wall and stepped out onto the balcony. Walking right up to the blackened iron railing, he gripped the cold metal and opened his senses to the unique signature that was Lucien.</p><p>What he found didn\u2019t surprise him. He\u2019d suspected as much from the moment he\u2019d crossed the border with its weakened defenses. But the expectation did nothing to lessen the concern that confirmation brought. He\u2019d known Lucien wasn\u2019t dead, but this might be worse.</p><p>He felt Duncan\u2019s presence behind him. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Duncan moved up next to him and shook his head slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, my lord. I feel a definite presence, but it\u2019s . . . weakened somehow. I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cI doubt you\u2019d recognize it. I myself have experienced it only once before, hundreds of years and thousands of miles from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sophia\u2019s voice came from the doorway behind them.</p><p>\u201cFading,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Raphael spun around to face her. \u201cLucien is dying.\u201d</p><p>Sophia heard Raphael\u2019s words and saw the absolute certainty in his black eyes. And she felt her heart squeeze nearly dry in her chest. Lucien couldn\u2019t die. She wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cYou will find him, then,\u201d she said, not asking but telling. \u201cIf you can feel him dying, you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pushing her back inside by the simple expedient of walking forward himself. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Lucien does not want to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, he wants to be found. My Sire would never accept death that easily. He loves life far too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit it\u2019s unlike him,\u201d Raphael agreed with an irritating calm. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s overcome with guilt.\u201d</p> <p>He was moving around Lucien\u2019s study, picking up objects and studying them before putting them back down in the precise position he\u2019d found them. Sophia watched him roam about as if measuring the place for new furniture\u2014his furniture\u2014and suddenly regretted letting him in here at all. Maybe Darren had been right.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Sophia,\u201d Raphael said, turning that emotionless gaze on her. \u201cWhy do you suppose Lucien sent for you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia stared at him, not expecting the question, but keeping her own gaze every bit as flat as his. \u201cI would assume he wanted me to find whoever had done this and avenge his people.\u201d It sounded weak, even as she said it.</p><p>Raphael gave her a patronizing smile. \u201cWhy you? Why not Darren? He is Lucien\u2019s lieutenant, after all, and he\u2019s already here. He knows the city better than you, and probably the people, as well. For that matter, he\u2019s far more likely to have contacts among my own vampires, something Lucien would have known to be useful. So why you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia bristled with anger that he persisted in quizzing her, as if he knew some secret that she didn\u2019t. Or maybe she was just angry at being forced to confront the truth. No longer. She drew herself up and met his gaze directly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more powerful than Darren,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cTo my knowledge, I\u2019m the strongest of Lucien\u2019s children.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cIs that significant here?\u201d</p><p>Sophia glared at Raphael with something close to hatred. Only a strong sense of self-preservation kept her from lashing out at him as she snarled, \u201cLucien intended me to be his successor. If he dies, I need to be here.\u201d</p> <p>That smug smile of his grew, but there was no humor in his voice when he pinned her with those silver-struck eyes and said, \u201cThen I suggest you act. Lucien\u2019s fading is already weakening his borders. Before long, you\u2019ll have contenders from across the continent descending to fill the vacuum left by his absence. You are fortunate in your neighbors for now. I have no desire to expand my territory and Rajmund in the Northeast is still consolidating his power. He has no energy to spare for anyone else. But that won\u2019t last forever. And as the vulnerability grows, the signs of it will spread.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the room, as if surveying the territory\u2019s invisible boundaries. \u201cSomeone needs to reinforce Lucien\u2019s defenses before it\u2019s too late. For now, several of you can work together, if you can get along well enough. But eventually, one person will have to step into the breach. If it is not to be you, it will certainly be someone from outside, because Darren Yamanaka is not up to the task. He\u2019ll fall to the first contender.\u201d</p><p>Raphael signaled his security people and headed for the doors to the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sophia demanded. She wanted answers from the big vampire lord, not lectures.</p><p>He stopped just inside the room, turning back to regard her with one eyebrow raised at her preemptory command.</p><p>\u201cCould Lucien be a prisoner? Could someone be starving him, holding him captive?\u201d</p><p>Raphael tilted his head to one side, as if considering her question. \u201cIt is possible,\u201d he conceded. \u201cLucien was ever too trusting.\u201d</p><p>Sophia expelled a long breath, part relief that Lucien might yet live, and part agony that her Sire could be starving, tortured by his captors.</p><p>\u201cWill you be returning with us?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>Sophia stared blindly for a moment, her mind struggling to take in his question on top of everything else she\u2019d just had dumped on her. She blinked and swallowed hard, then nodded once.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key to finding Lucien lies in solving these crimes.\u201d</p><p>Raphael signaled to someone. \u201cOne of my vehicles will wait, so that you may confer with your fellow house members before you leave.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sank into the chair behind Lucien\u2019s desk as Raphael strode from the room, her head sinking into her hands. She didn\u2019t want this. Not the mysterious deaths of Giselle and the others, not Lucien\u2019s cryptic letter or his sudden disappearance, and sure as hell not the almost certain battle with Darren over control of Lucien\u2019s territory. She gasped out loud as the thought made itself known. There would be no battle for control, because Lucien was not dead, and he wasn\u2019t going to be. She didn\u2019t for one minute believe he was trying to kill himself over some ridiculous sense of guilt. The idea was laughable. Lucien had clearly been saddened by the deaths of Giselle and her young men. His letter was proof of that. But the greatest portion of his sadness was probably reserved for himself, that he had to suffer their loss and deal with the consequences.</p><p>No, she would find whoever was doing this, and she would find Lucien, too. He might need her help for a few months, maybe even a year, while he regained his strength. But then things would return to normal.</p><p>At the same time, she was forced to admit that Raphael had a point. If her Sire was to have a territory to come back to, something would have to be done right now to secure it. Somehow she and Darren\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Darren\u2019s unwelcome voice announced his presence, as if he\u2019d known she was thinking about him.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t here very long,\u201d he said, frowning as he noticed she was sitting behind Lucien\u2019s desk . . . on Lucien\u2019s chair. \u201cWhat\u2019d he do here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you and I haven\u2019t tried already, but he did it with greater success,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s not much of a surprise, given who he is.\u201d</p><p>Darren came around the desk, choosing to perch on its edge next to her, rather than take any of the chairs in the supplicant position in front of it. \u201cWhat does that mean, greater success? Did he find Lucien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, unfortunately.\u201d She proceeded to tell Darren pretty much word for word what Raphael had explained to her.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d he exploded, standing up and pacing over to a book shelf and back again. \u201cLucien would never do anything to hurt himself. I know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Sophia said, relieved to hear someone else say it out loud. \u201cBut what Raphael said about the territorial borders is true. I felt it when we came over here tonight. At first, I thought it was just because Raphael was in the vehicle right behind me, but it was more than that. And if we don\u2019t want a bunch of vultures moving in, you and I need to figure out a way to hold things together until Lucien gets back. Either that, or fight them off one by one.\u201d</p><p>Darren stopped pacing and stared at her. She could see him sizing her up, trying to decide if their earlier spur-of-the-moment contest truly reflected their relative power, or if he could take her in a straight up fight. She knew he would never have challenged Lucien. Even if their Sire came out of this greatly weakened, Darren would never go against him.</p><p>But the possibility that Lucien might die . . . that changed everything. Darren was loyal to Lucien, but he was also Vampire. And vampires were, at their core, territorial and aggressive. And if Lucien died, there was absolutely no reason to honor his preference for Sophia as successor.</p><p>Sophia stood, favoring her fellow vampire with a cool look. \u201cI won\u2019t fight you over this, Darren.\u201d His eyes blazed with triumph and Sophia chuckled. \u201cNot now,\u201d she added deliberately. \u201cI believe Lucien is coming back. But if he doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She let her own power swell, let it spill into her eyes until their glow drowned out the dim lighting.</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t,\u201d she repeated softly, meeting Darren\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cI will fight you to the death before I let you have this territory.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The SUVs rolled through the now deserted night, the streets quiet, but for the occasional vehicle sharing the road with them. In the distance, Raphael could hear a far away foghorn bellowing its desolate warning over and over again.</p><p>His mind was quiet, too, mulling over the night\u2019s events, but without any particular urgency. Lucien\u2019s situation was intriguing, but it no longer seemed relevant to his own hunt. There remained a simmering fury against the Canadian lord, lurking just below the surface of his thoughts. But that was for later\u2014after he\u2019d tracked down the killers Lucien had left on his doorstep, after their blood had fed his soldiers and their bones been reduced to ash and ground into dirt. Lucien could wait until then. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Next to him, Duncan lifted a hand to his earpiece as up front Juro did the same. Raphael glanced at Duncan, who turned to him and said quietly, \u201cSophia is an hour behind us, my lord. They are traveling quickly and should catch up by the time we reach the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them not to bother with speed limits, Duncan. I want all of my people inside and safe.\u201d And he was confident that if by chance they were stopped by the human authorities, his vampires had the skill to persuade the officer to look the other way. The ability was a requirement for every vampire included in his personal security detail.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your orders regarding Lucien, my lord?\u201d Duncan asked carefully. What he really wanted to know, Raphael thought, was what Raphael intended to do next.</p> <p>\u201cLucien will wait, Duncan,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst we avenge our own.\u201d</p><p>They met no policemen on their way home, and very few other travelers, either. The lights of the compound soon came into view, a bright spot in the otherwise dark forest.</p><p>Raphael spent a few moments conferring with Duncan and the others, but the night was already fleeing and he wanted some time alone with Cyn before sunrise.</p><p>She was asleep when he finally made it to their bed. He\u2019d spoken to Elke before coming downstairs. She\u2019d reported that Cyn had kept her word, that she had indeed spent the night in their quarters, not even emerging for something to eat. Raphael would have been relieved if he hadn\u2019t known her as well as he did. She\u2019d probably been online the entire time, searching out ways to endanger herself during the day tomorrow.</p><p>He sighed as he stripped out of his suit and tie, unbuttoning his fine Egyptian cotton shirt and tossing them all into the hamper for dirty clothes. He wouldn\u2019t be wearing any of these things for the rest of this journey. Until the killers were caught and punished, his plans would not involve anything as tidy as a proper suit and tie.</p> <p>Cyn had left a soft light burning on the bureau top. She\u2019d left it for him, even though she knew he didn\u2019t need it. It had more to do with her heart than her head, which was the same reason he left it on when he secured the vault and headed for their bed. He might not need the light tonight, but she would in the morning. There was no natural light in their underground suite, no windows to announce the rising sun. But he didn\u2019t need that either. He knew the sun\u2019s progress across the sky better than any astronomer.</p><p>He approached the big bed, smiling when he saw that she slept clothed, rather than naked as they usually did. Although she was not wearing clothes so much as underwear\u2014a tank top which clung to her breasts, outlining them in exquisite detail, and a pair of tiny panties that only served to heighten his desire. If she\u2019d intended these things to repel his advances, she\u2019d failed miserably.</p><p>Raphael slipped beneath the covers, wrapping an arm around her slender body and pulling her close, curling himself around her sleepy, human warmth. She murmured softly, too deeply asleep to remember her anger, and too accustomed to his presence to wake because of it. Grinning, he slid one hand along her silky skin, beneath the stretchy tank top, filling his hand with a full breast and his fingers with a plump nipple. Cyn smiled in her sleep, pushing her pretty ass into his groin and rubbing gently against his rapidly hardening cock. He growled low in his throat as his hunger for her surged along with his erection. It had been a long night and they had not parted on the best of terms. He wanted to bury himself inside her, wanted to mark her as his, to replace their anger with possession. He was Vampire and she was his mate.</p><p>Bending his head, he kissed her temple, her jaw, but softly so as not to wake her. Not yet. She stirred slightly, but only to cuddle deeper into his embrace. Raphael bared his teeth, his fangs already splitting his gums as the scent of her blood, flowing beneath her fragile skin, hit him like an anvil. She was his. She would always be his and no other\u2019s.</p><p>He sank his teeth into the satin flesh of her neck, reveling in the fleeting resistance of her vein as it popped beneath his fangs, in the first taste of her blood flowing down his throat.</p><p>Finally awakened by the rush of euphoric released into her bloodstream along with his fangs, Cyn moaned softly, whispering his name. \u201cRaphael.\u201d She reached back to caress him, holding his head against her neck as he fed.</p> <p>He rolled her nipple between his thumb and forefinger, palming her breast in a gentle embrace before stroking his hand down across her flat belly to the velvety smooth skin between her legs. The tiny bit of lace she\u2019d worn in a halfhearted attempt to dissuade him tore easily and he shoved it out of his way, pushing it down to lay tangled against one thigh. He changed his attack then, slipping his fingers into her from behind, feeling the shiver race along her skin as he slid them in and out until she was wet and ready for him.</p><p>But Cyn didn\u2019t wait for him to take the initiative. She lifted her thigh forward in invitation, spreading her legs and pressing her ass against him, eager for the feel of his cock inside her. She whispered his name again, but full of need this time, a demand rather than a caress, her slender fingers reaching back to grasp his cock, rousing him to an even greater hunger.</p><p>Raphael brushed her hand aside, taking hold of his shaft and positioning it at the very entrance to her plush, heated core, sliding forward until he was just inside her, feeling the grip of her inner walls as she flexed against him, trying to draw him deeper.</p><p>Cyn groaned a protest, stirring fitfully within his arms, trying to force the pace of their lovemaking.</p><p>Raphael chuckled deep in his chest, the vibration traveling along his fangs, still buried in her neck, and making her shudder with renewed desire. He took his time, no longer drawing on her blood, but holding her motionless with his bite, placing his hand over her abdomen and holding her still there as well, as he teased her, sliding his cock an inch into her wetness and then out again, never leaving her completely, but never filling her either.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, please,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He lifted his head and growled in response, plunging into her with a long, powerful thrust, slamming deep inside her and out again, only to do it once more. Her inner walls clenched around him so tightly it was almost difficult to force his way through when she climaxed, her cries filling his ears with sweet sound, her fingers tightening in his hair and holding him close. Her orgasm finally diminished, becoming no more than a trembling of her limbs, the random convulsions of her womb rippling down and around his cock as he continued to pound into her, knowing the ecstasy of his bite was still raging in her body and she would not rest for long.</p><p>He slid his fingers over her abdomen and deep into her slick folds once more, spreading the swollen lips of her pussy and baring the eager nub of her clit, suffused with blood and hard as a pearl. He began circling it, gliding over its sensitive surface and away until she was thrusting against his hand in time with his cock, making soft, mewling noises as she sought her release yet again.</p> <p>His fingers closed on her clit, squeezing softly, rubbing his thumb where it swelled eagerly begging for attention. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d she whispered. Her abdomen clenched first, and then her entire body spasmed against him. He held her tightly as the second orgasm took her and she screamed his name.</p><p>Deep inside her, his cock surged in response to her orgasm, his release boiling from his balls, racing down his cock and splashing out to fill her, marking her, claiming her as his, inside and out.</p><p>\u201cYou cheat,\u201d she muttered, when she had finally stopping shaking, when he\u2019d covered her sweat cooled body with the blankets and kissed away the tears of her overwrought emotions.</p><p>\u201cI was hungry,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You were horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cBut only for you, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>She breathed deeply, snuggling back against him and holding his hand between her breasts, burrowing deeper into his embrace. \u201cI love you, you know,\u201d she murmured, already half asleep.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, feeling the sun\u2019s burning heat emerge over the horizon. \u201cI love you, too, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>He fought as the sun began its journey into the morning sky, wanting to warn her of what he\u2019d learned in Vancouver. To remind her that the killers had been set on their path by Lucien, that they were targeting those most important to Raphael. And no one was more important to Raphael than Cyn. But the sunrise stole his words and fear chased him into sleep.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>2000, Central America</p><p>Colin strolled down the dark, narrow street, the cobbles hard and uneven beneath the sandals he wore to blend in. The sun had set hours ago, and they weren\u2019t much on street lights in these parts. The brilliant colors of the walls rising around him were mostly muted by the darkness, with the occasional ribbon of color in the light of a doorway or window. People crowded the streets around him, taking advantage of the slightly cooler evening air. The daytime temperatures were intense around here. Even he found it hot and he\u2019d grown up in south Georgia where if the heat didn\u2019t kill you, the humidity would.</p><p>But he was feeling good tonight. Better than good, he felt great. Young, strong and healthy, an alpha male in his prime on his way to meet the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever met. But Sophie wasn\u2019t just beautiful, she was sexy and mysterious and smart, too. Just about everything Colin had ever wanted in a woman wrapped up in a delicious package that curved and swelled in all the right places. He picked up his pace, eager to get to the caf\u00e9 where he knew she was waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cYo, Murphy.\u201d His buddy, Garry McWaters, grabbed his arm. \u201cSlow it down there, stud. The lady will wait. Let\u2019s not call attention, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Colin said, somewhat sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s these hot nights. They always get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReminds you of high school, huh? All those sweet, little Southern girls just dying to drop their panties for the football hero?\u201d</p><p>Colin laughed. He was only six years younger than Garry, but in the SEALS that made a world of difference.</p><p>\u201cNot as many panties dropped as you think, Mac,\u201d he said, using McWaters nickname. \u201cMost of the girls in my hometown were holding out for a ring, just like their mommas taught them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou keep talking, Murphy. Somebody\u2019ll buy it. Here we go.\u201d</p><p>They rounded the last corner, bringing the caf\u00e9 into sight across the public square. Despite the open space, the weekly marketplace was set up and if anything, the crowds were thicker here. He and Mac slowed even further. No one hurried in this town, and, like Mac said, they didn\u2019t want to call attention to themselves. They weren\u2019t supposed to be here. Hell, they weren\u2019t here. Not officially. Only a couple more days and they\u2019d be gone for real. Back to the States. For awhile anyway.</p><p>Which was why it was so important he talk to Sophie tonight. He didn\u2019t want to lose her just because he was going home. It might take a few weeks, or even months, but he\u2019d arrange an American visa for her, a tourist visa or whatever else he could get. She\u2019d love it in California, where he was based with the SEALs. He knew she would.</p> <p>They finally broke through enough to see the caf\u00e9, still halfway across the square. He searched the patio and balconies, looking for Sophie. Sometimes she waited for him there, waving through the crowds when he came into sight. But not tonight. Tonight\u2014</p><p>He stopped, frowning. \u201cMac?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Next to him, his buddy edged away slightly, giving them each plenty of room to draw the weapons tucked into their waistbands in back. \u201cYeah. Looks kinda empty, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Colin swore softly. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get in there, Mac. If Sophie\u2019s wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of his sentence was lost as the world exploded around them. Burning debris was everywhere, flying through the air like shrapnel, landing on the tables of the merchants, starting new fires among the wares displayed there. Flames were shooting out of the small caf\u00e9, reminding him of a Roman candle on 4th of July.</p> <p>And the screams. People racing around the square almost mindlessly, like pinballs in an arcade game, knowing only that they had to escape, but not knowing how to get there. Others running from the burning building, from the torched merchandise tables, some of them on fire, some chased by friends trying desperately to help.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re outta here, buddy.\u201d Mac grabbed Colin\u2019s arm, tugging him back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>He allowed himself to be pulled a few feet, staring in disbelief, before reality crashed in on him. \u201cSophie!\u201d he roared. He yanked his arm away from Mac and raced toward the burning building, jumping over injured people on the ground, their faces and limbs bloodied and burned, their clothing little more than blackened shreds.</p><p>\u201cSophie!\u201d he shouted again, feeling the heat of the flames before he\u2019d gotten within thirty yards of the cafe, sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cMurphy!\u201d Mac\u2019s voice was right behind him, the snap of command slowing Colin\u2019s headlong charge, but not stopping it. Not when the woman he loved\u2014ah, Jesus, he loved her. Colin bent over his knees, the pain in his chest so great he thought he\u2019d die from it. He lifted his face to the conflagration and knew no one was alive in there. Had she been inside? Had she arrived ahead of him like she always did?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gone.\u201d Mac\u2019s voice was hard, no room for discussion, no arguments. He grabbed Colin by the back of the neck, bending over to talk into his ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, bud, but we\u2019re leaving. Right now.\u201d</p> <p>He tugged Colin upright, turning him with brute force until they joined the rest of the people streaming out of the square. Slinging an arm over Colin\u2019s shoulders, he pulled him along, just one more walking wounded from what had surely been some drug cartel payback, a hit on someone or a message to someone else, and who cared how many innocent civilians died in the process?</p><p>Sophie! Colin dug in his heels. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta check, Mac. I gotta know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta do nothin\u2019 except keep walking. You\u2019ll call her later, check to see if she\u2019s okay, say all those sweet, Southern things. But right now, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Colin kept walking, putting one foot in the front of the other, Mac\u2019s presence the only thing that kept him moving. They reached another street finally, a narrow alley that led who knew where. But it was dark and cool, a welcome relief from the overwhelming heat behind them. Mac would have hustled him into its safety, but Colin turned at the last minute and saw the flames, saw someone stagger out of the building, a black corpse of a figure, screaming when rescuers rushed to help. He stopped and stared. Was that Sophie? Was she somewhere in that flaming wreckage waiting for him to save her, waiting for\u2014</p><p>The phone rang, jarring Colin out of the nightmare he hadn\u2019t had in years. He wiped a hand over his face and found it soaked with sweat, just like the rest of him. He grimaced, shoved aside the damp sheets and climbed out of bed, naked as the day he was born. And the damn phone kept ringing. Who the hell was calling him so early? He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face, trying to wake up, listening to the phone ring, and in between the rings\u2014</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He spat the word out with feeling. That damn hound dog of Art Collard\u2019s was barking again. It drove the neighbors nuts, which was probably why his phone was ringing. Art went down into the city every once in a while and the dog didn\u2019t like being left alone. And every time it happened, his phone rang off the hook with complaints.</p><p>Oh, right, ma\u2019am, sir. I\u2019ll get right on that. Let\u2019s slit the dog\u2019s throat and barbeque it for dinner, how\u2019s that? No more barking then, huh?</p><p>Colin smiled in spite of himself, imagining the look on the neighbors\u2019 faces if he actually said that to any of them. They all had dogs of their own. Everybody up here did. But somehow the only barking that ever bothered anyone was that big blue tick hound of Art\u2019s. Although, Colin had to admit that old John Henry\u2019s deep bellow did sound like the voice of doom.</p> <p>He found his jacket lying on a chair in the living room where he\u2019d left it and dug his cell phone out of the pocket, catching it just before it went to voice mail. \u201cMurphy,\u201d he droned, checking his watch where it lay on the table. Okay, so it wasn\u2019t actually that early in the day, after all.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon to you, too, Murphy.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the phone away from his ear and checked caller ID. Cynthia Leighton. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Leighton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, you\u2019re in a mood. I thought maybe you\u2019d like to help me investigate a couple of murders here roundabouts, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the damn sheriff, and what do you need me for anyway? I\u2019m sure all your super vampires can handle it just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop sulking, Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over, so put some clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d But she was gone already. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he swore loudly, catching himself at the last minute from throwing the damn phone against the wall. It was a nice phone, and besides, it was a pain in the ass to replace those things.</p><p>He dropped the phone on the bar next to his watch and stood, hands on his hips, looking around his house. He\u2019d put a lot of work into this place. The air still had that fresh wood scent from when he\u2019d installed new kitchen cabinets just a month ago. Granted, there was a lot more to be done, but it was coming along. He liked it here. He wanted to stay here. Which meant he probably had to play along with that damn Leighton and do what he could to solve these murders. Not that he didn\u2019t want to find whoever had done in Marco and make him pay. He just didn\u2019t want to do it with vampires looking over his shoulder.</p><p>Or maybe it was one particular vampire he wanted to avoid. One who came in a curvy package with big brown eyes.</p><p>Yeah, he definitely should avoid that damn compound altogether until this was done.</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d he answered his own accusation and went to take a shower.</p><p>Colin pulled a black t-shirt over his head and slicked back his wet hair, grabbing a towel when water dripped down his back. He told himself he should get a haircut, but he\u2019d gotten used to having it longer, especially during his last years in the Navy when they\u2019d been out of the country more than not, and in places where a man with short hair and a bare face stood out. He\u2019d shaved the beard as soon as he got back, but the hair was convenient.</p><p>A knock on the door drew his thoughts away from his hair. Thank God. Maybe he\u2019d been lost in the woods up here just a bit too long if that\u2019s all he had to think about.</p><p>He tucked his shirt into his camos, his combat boots making a racket as he crossed the hardwood floor to his front door. He saw the black SUV outside and pulled open the door.</p><p>\u201cLeighton,\u201d he said and looked over her shoulder where a big black guy was giving him an appraising look right back. \u201cWho\u2019s the muscle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRobbie Shields, meet Colin Murphy,\u201d she said briefly, pushing her way into his house. Apparently she was no longer worried about appearances now that her fucking vampire husband had sent someone along to bodyguard her. \u201cYou two have a lot in common,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Colin asked, eyeing the bodyguard. Robbie was an inch or two shorter than Colin, but made up for it in sheer muscle mass. The guy\u2019s muscles had muscles.</p><p>Leighton spoke without turning, too busy scoping out his house. \u201cSpecial Forces, rah, rah, all that shit. Robbie was a Ranger. Robbie the Ranger.\u201d</p><p>Colin shared a long-suffering look with his fellow warrior and gestured for the man to come in. \u201cRangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man,\u201d Robbie said. He took two steps inside and they shook hands.</p><p>\u201cI worked with a lot of Rangers during my time in. Good men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeading the way,\u201d Robbie said with a big grin. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta clear the field for you Navy pussies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this nice?\u201d They both turned to regard Leighton who was eyeing them sourly. \u201cBonding over our bullets?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d Robbie said. \u201cShe\u2019s just pissed \u2018cuz the big man won\u2019t let her roam around and get killed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs if,\u201d she dismissed. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of hours in the field when it comes to police work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You gonna read your vamp killer his Miranda rights?\u201d Colin asked, \u201cBecause I hadn\u2019t planned to.\u201d</p><p>She winked at him. \u201cI knew there was a reason I liked you, Murphy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, why\u2019d you quit the LAPD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Googled me. I\u2019m touched,\u201d she said absently, wandering into his kitchen and looking around. \u201cPolice work is too much of a boy\u2019s club, despite all the equal opportunity crap. Being a P.I. suited me better, let me work on my own. I\u2019m not much of a team player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Robbie muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou be nice, Robbie, or I\u2019ll report you to Irina,\u201d Leighton said, coming back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019ll work. Irina had nothin\u2019 but sympathy for me when she heard about this assignment.\u201d</p> <p>Leighton grinned and punched him in the arm, not lightly.</p><p>Colin grimaced. \u201cSpeaking of significant others, Leighton, Raphael\u2019s your husband?\u201d</p><p>Her smile disappeared. \u201cStrictly speaking, he\u2019s my mate. It\u2019s a vampire thing. Kind of like a husband, though. Bossy like one, anyway. But I like to think of him as my boyfriend. It sounds cuter.\u201d</p><p>Her smile returned in full force, but Robbie started choking suddenly, covering it with a cough while Leighton pounded him on the back helpfully. Colin figured poor Robbie would have plenty of bruises to show for his bodyguard effort today. He also noticed Leighton had switched out the expensive diamond ring on her finger for a simple platinum band. Maybe she really did have some field experience, after all.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she continued, brushing her hands together and propping them on her hips. \u201cI like a person\u2019s first impression of me to be of me, not him. So . . . I\u2019ve been thinking about how someone\u2014someone human, that is\u2014could find out where Marco and the others lived. They didn\u2019t exactly advertise their whereabouts and you\u2019re all pretty spread out here. It\u2019s not like a person could just drive down streets until they found a house. You can\u2019t even see most of these places from the main highway and half the roads go nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Coop\u2019s just one of several unincorporated towns up here. There\u2019s a few thousand people spread out over a couple hundred thousand square miles of territory. But property records are public in Washington state. Anyone with online access or a lot of time to kill could search to their heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p> <p>Leighton nodded. \u201cBut that would only tell them the owner of record, not who actually lives there. Plus\u2014and I\u2019m trusting you to be discreet with this, Murphy\u2014most vamps own their property under an alias, or even several different ones. When you live a few hundred years, it\u2019s sometimes necessary to make it look like the property\u2019s been sold, or the owner\u2019s died and the heirs have taken over or whatever. If nothing else, these recent murders prove the wisdom of that kind of subterfuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Colin agreed. \u201cBut if we scratch property records, I don\u2019t need to tell you that means there\u2019s most likely a leak somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Raphael\u2019s got someone following up on that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll share what you find,\u201d Colin said, giving her a flat look.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll share,\u201d she assured him. \u201cRaphael\u2019s not big on Miranda rights, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame him. Not in this case, anyway. On a separate track,\u201d Colin continued, \u201cLoren gave me a list of things missing from Marco and Preston\u2019s places. Electronics mostly. Jeremy says nothing was taken from their place, but I figure that\u2019s because they trashed everything looking for him, and then it got too late and they ran before the sun went down. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d been gone all that long when I showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPawn shops?\u201d Leighton asked.</p><p>\u201cNot here in town, but I\u2019ve already got feelers out down in the city. A couple of guys on the force down there are former military. We get together once in a while, play poker, talk about old times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Nobody ever invites me to play poker.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Robbie crooned sympathetically. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite you to our game, won\u2019t we, Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Colin said thoughtfully. \u201cDoes she cheat?\u201d</p><p>Leighton grinned. \u201cOnly when I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about hate groups?\u201d Leighton said, picking up the previous conversation thread. \u201cYou guys have any homegrown Nazis around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking maybe they\u2019ve added vampires to their list of Untermenschen,\u201d Colin commented. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly possible. Mostly, they\u2019re over the state line, but we\u2019re close enough to get a few outliers.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and picked up his Sig, checking the chamber and magazine before snapping it onto his belt. \u201cLet\u2019s go talk to some people, shall we?\u201d</p><p>They took Colin\u2019s Tahoe. It was a familiar enough vehicle that the man they were going out to visit wouldn\u2019t disappear at the sight of it. Everyone in Coop\u2019s knew there was a big contingent of vampires in town. If someone involved in these killings saw that big, black SUV of Leighton\u2019s pull up, they\u2019d either take off into the woods or start shooting. Either way, it wouldn\u2019t get Colin the answers he was looking for.</p><p>Hugh Pulaski\u2019s place was buttoned up as tight as a drum when they finally maneuvered their way past the several gates he\u2019d installed to block traffic along his mile and a half of private road. None of the gates were locked. That would have been pretty pointless, since a determined visitor could simply walk around. But they were an inconvenience, requiring a driver, or a passenger if he had one, to get out of the vehicle at every gate and find something to prop it open, since they were spring-loaded to close automatically. Hugh liked people to believe he had motion sensors and cameras all over the place, too. But Colin had firsthand knowledge of those kinds of devices, and he was pretty sure they only existed in Hugh\u2019s survivalist fantasies.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like anyone\u2019s home,\u201d Robbie commented from the back seat. He\u2019d been the one who\u2019d gotten out at each of the four gates, complaining that he felt like he had a bull\u2019s eye painted on his back after each one.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s home,\u201d Colin said, jerking his head at a beat-up old pickup off to one side.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d Leighton said, disbelieving. \u201cI thought you good ol\u2019 boys took care of your trucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Colin agreed, pulling up next to the pickup. \u201cBut Hugh isn\u2019t exactly a good ol\u2019 boy. He\u2019s a trust fund baby\u2014or old man now\u2014with a BS in chemistry from Harvard. You might be wondering if we have ourselves another Ted Kaczynski, but I don\u2019t think Hugh graduated anywhere near the top of his class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHugh\u2019s not a danger by himself, but he is clued into the white supremacist movement. Hangs around the fringes mostly. Anything else would take too much effort. If something\u2019s going on, he\u2019ll probably know about it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll talk to us?\u201d Leighton asked, climbing out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cI think he can hardly wait,\u201d Colin said, lifting his chin in the direction of the house where he could already hear the rattle of multiple locks sliding open. As they came closer, the heavy door swung inward to reveal a skinny figure in khakis and a flannel shirt, both of which were brand new and a size too big. But what caught Colin\u2019s eye was not Hugh\u2019s version of woodsman apparel, but the shotgun he was aiming straight at the three of them through the screen door.</p><p>Leighton stopped in her tracks, snarling at Robbie when he stepped in front of her, placing himself between the shotgun and his primary, just like he was supposed to do.</p><p>\u201cPut the damn gun down, Hugh,\u201d Colin said, letting his impatience show, even as his hand drifted over to the Sig Sauer .9 mm on his right hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here, Murphy? And who the hell are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the gun down,\u201d Colin repeated. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Hugh lowered the gun, but didn\u2019t put it down. Staring at Leighton and Robbie, he pushed open the screen and stepped out of his house, taking the two steps down to the ground, which still left several feet between him and his visitors. \u201cDon\u2019t want those people in my house,\u201d he said, spitting to one side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crushed,\u201d Leighton muttered, coming out from behind Robbie. She would have stepped closer to Hugh, but the bodyguard touched her arm in warning. She frowned, but took his advice.</p><p>Hugh couldn\u2019t have heard what she said, as far away as he was, but he narrowed his eyes at her anyway, before addressing Colin. \u201cI\u2019m asking you again, Murphy, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Colin eyed the other man. Hugh was mostly posture and bluff, pretending he was some sort of survivalist living out here in the woods with his rickety truck. The truth was his so-called rustic cabin boasted every amenity modern life could offer and the trust fund checks just kept coming.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about the murders.\u201d Colin made it a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cA\u2018course,\u201d Hugh responded, puffing his chest out a bit. \u201cGood riddance to bad trash if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Leighton didn\u2019t like that. She stiffened, one hand easing aside her jacket to give clear access to her own weapon. Colin held out his hand toward her, low and open, in a placating gesture.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say something like that?\u201d he asked Pulaski. \u201cWhat\u2019d Marco or Preston ever do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d the old man said slowly, dragging out the word. \u201cThey\u2019re vampires, ain\u2019t they? Unnatural. Can\u2019t even walk under God\u2019s good sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do a lot sunbathing, Mister Pulaski?\u201d Leighton asked, eyeing him up and down. \u201cLooking a little pale to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cuz I\u2019m a white person, missy. Not like that gorilla you\u2019re hiding behind there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Hugh,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re all very impressed by your bullshit attitude and what a tough guy you are. Now, answer a couple of questions for me, and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk then. Can\u2019t get rid of you soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>Leighton turned her head to give Colin a disgusted look. He just shrugged and looked back at Pulaski. \u201cWord is you\u2019re familiar with any white supremacist groups operating in these parts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA\u2018course,\u201d Pulaski said again. \u201cAin\u2019t much I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know if they had anything to do with these murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d tell you if they did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you, Mister Pulaski,\u201d Leighton snapped suddenly. \u201cThis is a murder investigation. You might not care for vampires, but they\u2019ve got rights whether you like it or not. And if you know something about what happened out there and don\u2019t tell us, that\u2019s called conspiracy after the fact . . . or maybe you did a little conspiring before the fact? Maybe Murphy here should snap some handcuffs on those skinny, white wrists of yours and haul you into town. Shouldn\u2019t take too long for the County boys to arrive, make a proper arrest. A\u2018course,\u201d she said, mimicking him, \u201c . . . it might take a bit more than a day, don\u2019t you think? Might get dark in the meantime, and I don\u2019t think that jail I saw at Murphy\u2019s office would do much to keep the vampires out. What do you think, Robbie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHard to say, Miz Cynthia,\u201d Robbie drawled. \u201cBut them vampires are hellacious strong. Why I\u2019ve seen \u2018em rip iron bars like that right out the walls. Hell, they probably won\u2019t bother with the bars a\u2019tall. Probably just bust right through them walls.\u201d He paused, as if thinking about it. \u201cYep, that\u2019s what they\u2019d do, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it gonna be, Mister Pulaski? You want to answer a few questions for us? Or wait until after dark?\u201d She regarded him lazily, a smug smile playing around her mouth. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m hoping you wait.\u201d</p><p>Pulaski gave her a hate-filled glare, but not before Colin caught the flash of fear on his face.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what you know, Hugh,\u201d Colin said patiently. \u201cIt\u2019ll go no further than the four of us here.\u201d</p><p>Hugh shifted his gaze to Colin, back to Leighton and over to Colin again. He took a step back and away from Leighton, his fingers tightening on the gun at his side. Robbie saw it, too. \u201cCyn,\u201d he said sharply, touching her arm and stepping in front of her again.</p><p>The bodyguard\u2019s reaction pleased Hugh and he had a sly smile on his face when he looked back at Colin. \u201cThe ones doing this aren\u2019t from around here,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cOutsiders barging in and taking over like they belong. Shoved aside those of us who\u2019ve lived here all our lives like we were nothing. Brought lots of money and guns, all kinds of equipment and shit I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize anyone? Why would they choose Cooper\u2019s Rest, if they\u2019re not from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t tell you if I did know \u2018em. But I didn\u2019t. As for why Coop\u2019s? Hell, Murphy, it\u2019s \u2018cuz of those damn vampires moving in with their big, fancy house and their fucking fancy whores.\u201d He looked at Leighton when he said those last words, giving her a sneering up and down appraisal. \u201cYou be careful there, missy,\u201d he said. \u201cA looker like you whoring yourself out, those righteous men might just do to you what they did to Mariane. Woman\u2019ll take it from a vampire, she\u2019ll take it from just about anyone.\u201d</p><p>Leighton didn\u2019t even flinch. She just met old Hugh\u2019s gaze and bared her teeth, her eyes going cold and flat. Colin had seen that look on a lot of faces before, but never from a woman.</p><p>Not trusting what might happen next, he said, \u201cFine, we\u2019re outta here. You watch who you keep company with, Hugh. This is gonna go badly for anyone involved with what went down out there.\u201d</p><p>Robbie was already hustling Leighton back to the truck, opening the door to the backseat and urging her inside. He slammed the door and waited until Colin was behind the wheel before holstering his weapon and sliding into the truck himself. \u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Colin reversed out of the clearing in front of Hugh\u2019s house, not willing to take his eyes off the old man until they had some distance between them. Once he hit the narrow private road, he backed off the road enough to get some turn around room, then headed out toward the highway.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d white boy back there know about Mariane?\u201d Leighton said. She had scooted to the edge of the back bench and was leaning between the two front seats.</p><p>\u201cThis is a small town,\u201d Colin said, turning off Hugh\u2019s drive and onto the highway. \u201cEveryone knew everything there was to know about the attack on Mariane and Jeremy within hours. Maybe not every little detail, but a rough idea of what had happened and who was involved. What\u2019s more curious is that Hugh didn\u2019t even flinch when I mentioned Marco and Preston. He already knew they were dead, but I didn\u2019t even know it until you told me yesterday and I\u2019ve told no one else. He might not be directly involved in these crimes, but he knows what they\u2019re doing. Maybe\u2014probably\u2014he\u2019s just sitting at a table in the shadows and eavesdropping.\u201d</p> <p>She made an exasperated noise and pushed herself back against the seat behind her. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got some white supremacists operating in your back yard. But how the hell does that tie in to what happened up in Vancouver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in Vancouver?\u201d</p><p>Leighton just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Leighton,\u201d he said, eyeing her in the rear view mirror. \u201cYou want cooperation from me, it\u2019s a two-way street. What happened in Vancouver?\u201d</p><p>She met his reflected gaze. \u201cYour girlfriend Sophia didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>Colin gave her a cold stare. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re avoiding the question.\u201d</p><p>Leighton shrugged, stretching out her legs before answering. \u201cThree more vampires were killed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Sophia\u2019s here. She thinks, and I tend to agree, that whoever killed the vamps up there has decided to spread the joy southward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. You\u2019ve never seen what happens when a vampire gets really pissed, Colin. I have. They don\u2019t believe in trial by jury and they don\u2019t give second chances. These killers, whoever they are, sealed their fates the minute they decided to cross into Raphael\u2019s territory. This isn\u2019t going to be pretty, no matter how you look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I\u2019ll tell you how I look at it, Leighton. I saw what they did to Mariane. So, as long as the only ones getting bloodied are the animals who did that, I say let the bloodletting begin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Sophia checked herself in the mirror critically, using both hands to pull her hair out of the high-necked sweater she\u2019d chosen for tonight\u2019s hunt. It seemed foolish to think of it as a hunt, especially in this day and age, but she didn\u2019t have any other word for it. Raphael\u2019s vampires were going to hunt down the humans who\u2019d crossed the line of civility and started the killing. It seemed clear, to Sophia at least, that the motive for these crimes was simple hatred. The things they\u2019d done to that child Mariane were proof of that, if any further proof was necessary. She thought Raphael agreed with her, although it was difficult to know for sure since she was still frozen out of any serious discussions.</p><p>The western vampire lord didn\u2019t trust her, not even after last night when she\u2019d shown her own trust by admitting him not just to Lucien\u2019s territory, but to the heart of his nest. Trust came hard to vampires. She had to remind herself of that now that she was back in Vancouver. She\u2019d spent too many years down in Brazil, a country ruled by a vampire lord so laid back he barely qualified for the title.</p><p>She should have remembered, though. Should have remembered that village in Central America and the night she\u2019d been given a choice\u2014leave now or swear loyalty to a new master. That region\u2019s vampire lord hadn\u2019t been laid back. He\u2019d been unwilling to tolerate her presence in his territory as long as she was sworn to Lucien. And Sophia had had no intention of forsaking her Sire, not when there were so many other places in the world she could live peacefully.</p><p>Of course, leaving the hostile vampire lord\u2019s territory had meant leaving Colin, too. She\u2019d rationalized the decision in her head a million times over the years. That he was human, that he wouldn\u2019t understand, that he wouldn\u2019t want her if he knew what she was. Or that he\u2019d have left her soon, anyway, called away by his own masters in the United States military. But every one of those excuses still left a bad taste in her mouth. She could have handled it differently. Should have handled it differently. But when the fire had struck, it had seemed like a gift, a sign from the Fates that this was the right path for her to take.</p><p>But then, she\u2019d never expected to see him again, never expected to feel that punch in the gut when she\u2019d walked into the room upstairs and seen those blue eyes accusing her.</p><p>She turned away from the mirror, no longer willing to see the accusation in her own reflection. Maybe she should talk to him again. Try to make him understand. She snorted delicately. As if Colin hadn\u2019t made his own feelings on the subject perfectly clear already.</p><p>Heavy footsteps sounded in the hallway outside, reminding her of the night\u2019s coming festivities. She ran her hands over her hips, pulling the sweater into place. Thank God she\u2019d thought to pick up some clothes in Vancouver last night. She\u2019d never planned on being in Raphael\u2019s territory this long, but it looked as if she\u2019d be staying here at least a couple more nights. She didn\u2019t think they could wrap this up before then, not even with Raphael\u2019s power and resources on their side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d worn casual clothes tonight\u2014jeans, flat-soled boots and a thick sweater. The hunt was likely to involve a lot of tramping through the woods, especially since there wasn\u2019t much other than woods around here. The clothes made her look much younger\u2014something she usually avoided in her never-ending quest to be taken seriously in the male dominated world of vampires.</p><p>And it was definitely male dominated. Witness the thumping footsteps outside her door just a moment ago. For centuries vampire lords had chosen their minions with physical defense in mind, which meant the bigger the better, and that equaled male. Modern times made that less necessary, but the tradition continued, because the vampire lords controlled who got turned and the lords were mostly old traditionalists. Raphael\u2019s people were a very good example of the testosterone-laden ranks of Vampire. Sophia had seen only one female among all the vampires he\u2019d brought with him from California.</p><p>For her part, Sophia was more powerful than most of the vampires she met, but female still equaled weak in most vampires\u2019 eyes. She could have gone the route of Raphael\u2019s lone female, Elke, who appeared to be every bit as muscled as the males she worked with. But Sophia had grown up in a culture where beauty was a woman\u2019s best, and sometimes only, weapon. And she knew she was beautiful, just like she knew it fed the males\u2019 misperception of her weakness. But then her beauty was something she\u2019d learned to wield long before she\u2019d ever become Vampire. And she\u2019d never enjoyed lifting weights.</p> <p>But tonight, she\u2019d forgone appearances in favor of practicality. She had no intention of trudging through the underbrush in four inch heels and a silk blouse. Her only concession was her hair, which she\u2019d left hanging down her back instead of the more practical braid she usually adopted in such situations. She told herself it had nothing to do with the possibility that Colin would be around, that he\u2019d remember how much he\u2019d loved her long hair when they were together.</p><p>She was usually very good at lying when it served her purposes. But she\u2019d never been very good at lying to herself. She soothed her vanity with a final glance in the mirror, then opened her door to an empty hallway. Apparently Raphael\u2019s vampires were all upstairs already.</p><p>Climbing the steep stairs from the basement level, Sophia admired again the degree of security in the compound and the comfort afforded even a visiting vampire like herself. Raphael took good care of his people. That was his reputation, so she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. But the reality had exceeded even the reputation. She was impressed in spite of herself and feeling slightly disloyal to Lucien because of it.</p><p>She heard laughter as she came around the corner, the sound chased into the building on a wash of cold air. Recognizing Colin\u2019s deep voice, she looked up eagerly . . . and frowned. Colin was there all right, but he was with Raphael\u2019s woman, the two of them laughing and talking like old friends, as if they hadn\u2019t just met two days ago. Sophia\u2019s eyes narrowed in displeasure, but she quickly erased the expression. If Colin wanted to waste his time on Raphael\u2019s woman, that was his choice.</p><p>Listening carefully, while pretending not to, Sophia heard the woman Cynthia bid Colin a good night and head across the wide expanse of the great room, accompanied by another one of Raphael\u2019s hulking bodyguards, this one human. They were met by the pale, blond Elke, who was dressed in a suit just like the males wore. Sophia watched somewhat enviously as Cynthia and the black bodyguard greeted Elke, spending a few minutes more in cheerful conversation. Did she have any friends like that? Sophia wondered. Or even acquaintances? Anyone with whom she could exchange a few moments of lighthearted conversation? The answer was no. Not in Vancouver, not even in Rio which had been her home for years. She had no one. What startled her was that she had never noticed the lack until now.</p> <p>She studied the small grouping. Raphael\u2019s mate was beautiful. Sophia had never minded acknowledging beauty in other women. She had her own beauty, after all, and so recognized it in others. But this Cynthia used her beauty differently than Sophia did, less consciously, perhaps, but she used it all the same. It gave her a breezy confidence that made others accept her more readily, that let her take chances a less self-assured person would never have dared.</p><p>Sophia glanced around, noting the number of eyes watching the exchange. Eyes which included Colin\u2019s. She frowned, feeling the jagged edge of jealousy scrape across her gut, something she rarely experienced. As if aware of her reaction, Colin glanced over, his gaze meeting hers for a long moment. Sophia started toward him with a smile, but before she\u2019d taken two steps, he shook his head in disgust and spun away from her, pushing through the doors and admitting another gust of cold, damp air to swirl around the sparsely furnished room.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s mouth tightened in irritation. So he could spend an entire day with this Cynthia, who was clearly off limits, but he couldn\u2019t spare a moment\u2019s greeting for Sophia? As Raphael\u2019s Cynthia had been heard to say . . . Fuck that!</p><p>She scanned the great room and spied Wei Chen heading toward the winding stairs up to the second floor. With a burst of speed, she cut him off before he reached the first step.</p><p>He recoiled a bit at her abrupt appearance, but then acknowledged her politely enough. \u201cSophia,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there something you require?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car,\u201d she said simply. \u201cNot one of those enormous trucks, but a simple sedan will do.\u201d</p> <p>The Seattle compound leader seemed confused. \u201cIt was my impression you would be accompanying the others on the hunt tonight. The trucks are unwieldy but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI need to run an errand first. Your Sheriff Murphy and I are old acquaintances.\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He couldn\u2019t have missed the obvious tension between her and Colin the other night. No doubt, he\u2019d already had his people searching out every detail of her history and relationships, as well as Colin\u2019s. By now he, and by extension Raphael, knew more about her former lover than she did.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Wei Chen said amiably, recovering from his surprise. \u201cWould you like someone to drive you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. The last thing she needed was more witnesses. \u201cAlthough, I am unfamiliar with the roads here. If you have a car with a GPS device, that would be helpful, and perhaps someone to program the relevant addresses?\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen\u2019s already small mouth pursed tightly. \u201cYou do know how to drive?\u201d</p><p>Sophia gave him a flat stare. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said in as patronizing a tone as she could muster. \u201cWe do have cars in Brazil.\u201d Not that she actually drove them, but he didn\u2019t need to know that, the supercilious little prig. In truth, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d driven a car. But there wasn\u2019t that much traffic here in the woods and the darkness would be no impediment. How hard could it be?</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Wei Chen took a cell phone out of his pocket and spoke rapid Chinese for several minutes before hanging up. \u201cOne of my people will have a car waiting for you on the ground level of the garages just outside to the left. He\u2019ll program Mister Murphy\u2019s address, as well as that of this compound for your return. You have a cell phone, of course, so if you get lost, give us a call and someone will guide you in.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia narrowed her gaze, feeling a streak of familiar resentment. Wei Chen was an officious little bastard. Probably very good at what he did, but his attitude was typical in its paternalism. She kept her face carefully blank, while imagining all the ways she could make the little prick pay. Not the least of which would be to seduce him and then leave him with a handful of hard dick. She smiled at the thought, letting him see it. He blushed as red as a schoolgirl, which made her feel far better than it should have. He was her host, after all. So, she thanked him prettily and headed for the garages.</p><p>Colin Murphy might think he could avoid her. But Sophia hadn\u2019t survived this long by letting others dictate to her. Not prissy, little Wei Chen and not Colin Murphy either.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Raphael felt Cyn\u2019s arrival back in the compound, knew when she entered the building and when she lingered outside the elevator upstairs speaking with Elke and the others. He was egotistical enough\u2014and he knew it was ego\u2014that it irritated him to have her gone when he woke for the night, to have her chatting upstairs rather than coming down directly to greet him. His mouth quirked in a half smile as he considered her probable reaction to his irritation.</p><p>The elevator doors opened behind him. He didn\u2019t turn around, but continued dressing, pulling a black long-sleeved t-shirt over his head. Her arms around his waist kept him from pulling it down further, her hands still chilled from outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here when you woke up,\u201d she said, kissing his bare back. \u201cA big rig truck jackknifed, blocking the road. We eventually went off-road and around, but it took time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t involved in the accident?\u201d he said, eyeing the ruffle of her dark hair over his shoulder, which was all he could see in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, looking around to meet his reflected gaze. \u201cIt happened before we got there.\u201d</p><p>He turned and kissed the top of her head, pulling his shirt down and tucking it into his denims before buttoning the fly. She made a small, exasperated noise at his cool greeting, then flopped down in a chair, watching as he sat on the bed to pull on his boots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing clothes?\u201d she asked, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cDuncan and I met with the others earlier. Maxime continues to examine the records on the local server, though she\u2019s found nothing and I suspect she won\u2019t. I\u2019m breaking my people into three teams and letting them hunt in the old way for now. Each team will begin at one of the crime scenes and circle out, ending with the town itself. We can cover far more territory far more effectively than any human search team. My vampires are getting restless with this interminable waiting, and angry because of it. This search will give them something to do. I don\u2019t suppose you and your friend Colin discovered anything useful?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up and caught her eyeing him warily. He met her gaze with a questioning look, eyebrows raised, but she just rolled her eyes briefly and said, \u201cMurphy\u2019s put out feelers on the stolen electronics. That might turn up something. In the meantime, though, we questioned a few locals. It was pretty boring. I felt bad for Robbie, having to hang around. But it did give me some ideas to follow up on the computer tonight. You\u2019re going out with the hunts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should let Elke go with you. I\u2019ll just get in the way out there, so I\u2019ll stay here and work. There\u2019s a lot of ordinance and equipment coming into this area. That\u2019s going to show up somewhere. I just have to find the right thread and tug it.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael stood, stomping his feet lightly to seat his boots. \u201cI don\u2019t expect much from tonight. The real hunt will begin when we have something more to go on, perhaps from Maxime\u2019s work, or yours. But until then, we\u2019ll hunt the only way we can.\u201d He donned his long, leather coat and started toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she protested from behind him.</p><p>He turned to regard her, noting the brightness of her eyes even in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you even going to kiss me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He studied her silently, then held out a hand. He nearly smiled at the flash of stubbornness that crossed her face. But he kept his amusement to himself, waiting for her to come to him.</p> <p>She did so, sighing heavily. \u201cWhy I ever fell in love with a damned arrogant vampire lord, I will never know,\u201d she muttered, coming into his arms.</p><p>He hugged her, smiling against her silky hair. \u201cI have often asked myself the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough, my own question is somewhat different than yours.\u201d</p><p>She slapped him lightly and raised her face to his for the long-delayed kiss.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, lubimaya,\u201d he said, then pulled her into a long, simmering kiss, putting just enough power into it to forcibly remind her of their lovemaking. Her nipples had hardened against his chest and her heart was pounding as she pressed her long, lean body against his.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she whispered when he lifted his lips from hers. \u201cThat\u2019s just mean.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cIt was you who asked for a kiss, my Cyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow late will you be?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cThat will depend on many things.\u201d He took her hand and headed for the elevator again. \u201cTraffic accidents and such,\u201d he added blandly.</p><p>Elke was at her post in the hallway outside the elevator when he and Cyn emerged. He knew Cyn was right, that Elke would rather have joined the hunt tonight, but regardless of what Cyn might say about her intentions to remain tied to the computer, he didn\u2019t trust her. If something caught her fancy, if her computer search turned up something intriguing, she\u2019d be gone into the night without a thought for her own safety or her promises to him.</p><p>He saw Duncan and the others waiting across the great room. Before he could head that way, however, Robbie Fields, the human bodyguard he\u2019d entrusted with Cyn\u2019s daytime safety, signaled him from near the dining room door. Raphael left Cyn to her teasing of Elke\u2014she was engaging the female vampire in a serious discussion of which board game they should occupy their time with this evening\u2014and joined Robbie, who had ducked into the dining room out of sight.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Robbie said as soon as he saw him.</p><p>\u201cRobbie,\u201d Raphael greeted him. \u201cCyn tells me you had an uneventful day.\u201d</p><p>The human\u2019s surprise was obvious and all too predictable. \u201cNot exactly, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So, tell me then, what exactly did happen?\u201d</p> <p>A short, but informative conversation later, Raphael left the dining room and headed straight to the couches where Cyn sat talking to Elke and some of the others. He\u2019d already assured Robbie that he\u2019d done the right thing, both in the performance of his duty and in reporting the details to Raphael. Not that there\u2019d been any question of that last. Raphael had made it clear that he wanted a full report on Cyn\u2019s activities, knowing well her tendency to gloss over the fine points. She claimed it was to avoiding upsetting him unnecessarily, but even she no longer believed he fell for that excuse.</p><p>\u201cA moment, my Cyn,\u201d he said, taking her hand and pulling her off the couch and back down the hall to the elevator. Vampire hearing was excellent and he didn\u2019t want the entire compound to hear the coming conversation.</p><p>She spun around as soon as they were downstairs, her mouth tight with irritation. \u201cRobbie finked, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinked? Robbie did his duty, which is first to protect you, but second to inform me of any danger incurred during his watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did I have to hear it from him instead of you? White supremacists? Vampire hate groups? You didn\u2019t think this was relevant? And what about the clear threat to you made by a man with enough connections to know the men who savaged Mariane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d freak out like this,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He looked down at her impatiently. \u201cI am tempted to lock you in this room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, as you so often remind me, you are who you are. So I will content myself with warning my security people to be extra vigilant.\u201d He turned on his heel and entered the elevator once again, eyeing her dispassionately from within its depths.</p><p>\u201cI am disappointed, my Cyn.\u201d The doors closed seconds before he heard something hard hit their surface. He laughed loud enough for her to hear as the elevator started upward.</p><p>He was still grinning when he emerged upstairs, meeting Duncan halfway across the nearly empty great room.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Duncan said somewhat warily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking a short detour this evening, Duncan. Let the others go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. Juro will accompany us, of course. Will you want anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo others. We\u2019ll join the hunt later.\u201d</p><p>Raphael strode out into the wet night, for once not noticing the weather. It was time these humans learned there was a price to pay for threatening that which was Raphael\u2019s. And he intended to begin their instruction tonight.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Sophia drove slowly down the narrow lane to Colin\u2019s house. She\u2019d nearly missed the turnoff, had only caught it at all because of the GPS\u2019s melodious female voice urging her to turn right. As it was, she\u2019d passed right by it and had to back up to make the turn. The lane seemed barely wide enough for the luxury sedan Wei Chen\u2019s people had provided for her, but she thought that might be due more to her lack of driving experience than anything else. After all, she remembered that Colin drove one of those oversized American alpha-mobiles, as if a man\u2019s courage was somehow tied to the size of his truck. Or perhaps it was something else, something more intrinsic to being a man? She laughed out loud at the thought. As she recalled, Colin had no worries in that regard.</p><p>All thoughts of laughter died as Colin\u2019s house finally came into sight. She saw the lights first, shining through the ubiquitous trees which gathered closely around and above the narrow lane. Before too long, she entered a large clearing and saw the house itself. It was a big A-frame, all wood and glass, with light beaming from every one of the many windows, including the entire top half of the A itself. Short wings tucked out to the left and right, but only the one on the right had any lights showing.</p><p>At least she could be fairly certain Colin was home. Either that or he didn\u2019t like to come back to a dark house. But, no, his truck was there, parked off to the right in front of a detached garage.</p><p>Sophia half expected him to hear her arrival. Not that the car she drove was noisy, quite the opposite, but it was so quiet here, especially compared to the cities she was used to. She turned off the engine and sat for a moment, waiting for the house door to open. When it didn\u2019t, she opened her car door, closing it gently and walking up onto the porch. There was no bell, so she knocked . . . and knocked again. She frowned and sent a narrow thread of power past the door and into the house. There. A human heartbeat. And running water, which probably explained why he hadn\u2019t heard her knock.</p><p>There were few times that Sophia regretted being Vampire. This was one of them. Had she been human, she would have simply opened the door and walked in, surprising Colin when he finally emerged from his shower, or whatever washing up he was doing. Unfortunately, as a vampire, that wasn\u2019t an option. So she waited until the sound of running water ceased, and she knocked again.</p><p>Footsteps came from inside and she repeated her knocking. The footsteps drew closer, the heavy tread of a big man and her heart beat a little faster.</p><p>The door opened and Colin stood there. He was only half-dressed, his broad chest completely bare, a pair of low-slung sweat pants hanging on narrow hips, revealing a flat abdomen ridged with muscle. He had a towel draped around his neck, and his hair was still damp.</p><p>\u201cSophia. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>His voice startled her into meeting his sapphire blue eyes, so striking in contrast with his black hair, and she realized she\u2019d been staring. But oh, he was so stare worthy. If anything, he was more delicious now than he\u2019d been when she\u2019d met him nearly a decade ago. He\u2019d held the promise of a man back then, young and strong and fit. But now he was a man fully grown, with thickly muscled shoulders and arms and a man\u2019s deep chest. A light sprinkling of dark hair across his chest arrowed downward, teasing her eye as it disappeared beneath the loose, drawstring waist. There were slices and puckers of shiny scar tissue across his torso and down his arms, but they only made him seem more fearsome, a warrior in his prime.</p><p>And suddenly Sophia remembered why she\u2019d taken him as her lover. Men had always wanted her, some for the bragging rights of claiming her, others for the things she could give them. But no one had ever wanted her for herself. Until she\u2019d met Colin Murphy. He hadn\u2019t wanted Lady Sophia Micaela Angelina, her father\u2019s only child and heir, or Sophia, vampire and favored child of Lucien. Colin had only wanted Sophie, a peasant girl from the Central American countryside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie?\u201d Colin said again, his brow creased in concern. \u201cIs something wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she dragged herself back to the present, to this place of perpetual rain and towering trees. \u201cI just wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a few minutes, then stood back from the door, inviting her in. She felt a blush heating her face and neck.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to invite me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to say the words,\u201d she snapped, embarrassed and angry about it. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat part\u2019s true?\u201d he asked in disbelief. \u201cYou really can\u2019t come in without an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. And it\u2019s cold out here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on in, Sophie. Or do I have to call you Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie will do,\u201d she muttered and stepped into the warmth of his house.</p><p>Colin closed the door, watching Sophie\u2014no, Sophia, he reminded himself\u2014scope out his home. She was polite about it\u2014more polite than Leighton had been the other morning\u2014sticking mostly to the front room, poking her head into the kitchen and glancing down the hallway. She lingered there and he could read in her body language that she was dying to explore further. But she didn\u2019t, looking over at him, before walking back into the living room where he stood waiting.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sit. Didn\u2019t invite her to sit. It was bad enough that she was here in this house with him, looking pretty much the same as she had when he met her ten years ago. In fact, she looked exactly the same tonight with her hair hanging loose and those tight denims hugging her plump thighs and that fine, high ass of hers that had once made him hard just looking at it and thinking about what they\u2019d do later. He\u2019d dreamt about that ass when he was out in the jungle, had awakened too many times hard and aching, and counting the days until he\u2019d see her again. And damn if he wasn\u2019t getting hard just thinking about it again.</p><p>This was the Sophie he\u2019d fallen in love with. He\u2019d stopped kidding himself about that a long time ago. He\u2019d loved her, had never loved anyone since and figured he never would. When she\u2019d died\u2014or when he\u2019d thought she\u2019d died\u2014he\u2019d mourned for a long time. And now he\u2019d discovered it was all a lie. He had to remember that. That he\u2019d wasted all those years mourning a lie.</p><p>\u201cSo, what is it, Sophie?\u201d he asked impatiently. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, her chocolate brown eyes boring into his soul, searching. For what? What did she want from him this time?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have her, you know,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>He scowled at her in confusion. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s woman. Cynthia. She\u2019s in love with him, and even if she wasn\u2019t, she belongs to him. He won\u2019t let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your fucking vampire mind, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you with her at the compound tonight, laughing and talking.\u201d</p><p>Colin chuckled bitterly. \u201cJealous, Sophie? You\u2019re a little late to that game, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been dead for ten years.\u201d</p><p>She jerked a little at his words. He felt bad about hurting her and then immediately called himself twenty kinds of fool. She\u2019d torn his heart open and left it bleeding on the jungle floor and he was worried about hurting her?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working together,\u201d he said finally. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of like my partner. We watch each other\u2019s backs. It\u2019s a matter of loyalty. Something I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she demanded, bristling.</p><p>\u201cIt means your idea of loyalty is letting me think you\u2019d been burned to death in a fire instead of just telling me to take a hike,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIf you wanted to end it, Sophie, you could have bought me a glass of chicha and just told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to end it,\u201d she said, still giving him those big eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did. Everyone has a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that simple,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThere was a lot going on back then, Colin. More than you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd clearly more than you\u2019re going to tell me. So why are you here, then? You working for Raphael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not working for Raphael and I never will. My master is Lucien. Raphael rules the west, but Lucien rules all of Canada. He\u2019s the one who made me Vampire, which was . . .\u201d She stopped talking suddenly, giving him an almost frightened look.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d he asked her intently. \u201cThis Lucien guy made you a vampire, which was what?\u201d He was still staring at her, but she\u2019d shifted her gaze away, refusing to meet his eyes any longer. He tilted his head thoughtfully, repeating her words in his head. The thought hit him and he jolted in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot what, but when. Isn\u2019t that right, Sophie?\u201d He put his hand on her arm when she would have moved away. \u201cWhen did you become a vampire, Soph? How old are you?\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to his, her pupils so big her eyes were nearly black. \u201cI was born in seventeen thirty three,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cLucien made me Vampire just prior to my twenty second birthday.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at her. He\u2019d known what it meant to be Vampire, knew they lived a long time, that they didn\u2019t age, but he\u2019d never . . .</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said in sudden realization. \u201cThat means you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly two hundred sixty-eight years old when you met me.\u201d</p><p>Not just when he\u2019d met her, but when he\u2019d fucked her. When he\u2019d fallen in love with her!</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d he growled and headed around the kitchen counter, grabbing the bottle of whiskey he kept on hand for emergencies. If this didn\u2019t qualify as an emergency, he didn\u2019t know what did.</p><p>Three hundred years, give or take a few decades. His Sophie, the sweet girl from the village he\u2019d been so careful with, was a centuries-old vampire who had probably seen and done things he could only imagine. And after twelve years on the teams, he could imagine an awful lot.</p><p>He poured a healthy three fingers of whiskey into a glass, then took a long sip, closing his eyes and letting the whiskey roll down his throat, its warmth spreading into every muscle and nerve.</p><p>He leaned back toward the living room and called to Sophie, \u201cYou want a\u2014\u201d</p><p>The words froze in his throat at the sight of Sophia bending over to pull off her boots, her long, dark hair tossed over one shoulder. Her faded jeans stretched lovingly over her pretty ass as she slipped off first one boot and then the next, revealing small, delicate feet with bright red nail polish.</p><p>He stifled a groan, his gaze traveling over her curvaceous body. This was a bad idea.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Raphael climbed out of the SUV while it was still rolling. Duncan joined him immediately, giving him an enigmatic look he ignored, while Juro swore softly in rare surprise. Raphael wasn\u2019t worried. There was nothing here that could threaten him.</p><p>He gazed around the clearing, noting the battered truck to one side and the untidy pile of wood next to a metal tool shed in the back. The dwelling was more of a cabin than a house, small enough that he suspected it had just one room, the wood in desperate need of refinishing and the windows taped over or painted. He couldn\u2019t tell for certain. Perhaps it was both. The lone door looked like it cost more than the entire cabin around it, which told him the owner didn\u2019t know much about security.</p><p>Next to him, Duncan was doing his own survey of the surroundings. \u201cThere is a single human male inside the house, my lord. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHugh Pulaski.\u201d</p><p>Duncan tipped his head curiously.</p><p>\u201cA very foolish man,\u201d Raphael added.</p><p>Duncan shrugged. \u201cThe door appears rather sturdy. The walls on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>Raphael bared his teeth. \u201cI thought we\u2019d try knocking first. I have a few questions for him.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, leapt onto the rickety porch and knocked loudly. Raphael could hear movement inside. Hell, he could hear the man\u2019s racing heart and panting breath. The human might not know it was vampires in his yard, but he certainly knew it wasn\u2019t a friend.</p><p>\u201cHugh Pulaski,\u201d Raphael called. \u201cWe know you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open suddenly and a shotgun shoved the screen door open, the man behind it already flexing his finger on the trigger. Juro leapt in front of Raphael, while Duncan used his inhuman speed to grab the gun\u2019s barrel and whip it upward before the human could finish squeezing the trigger. He jerked the shotgun away from Pulaski with enough force that the human stumbled out of the safety of his house. Realizing what he\u2019d done Pulaski screeched frantically and tried to turn around, but Duncan had already closed his fingers around the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cI should kill you for that,\u201d Duncan said intently, throwing the shotgun into the yard.</p><p>Raphael strolled closer. \u201cNot yet, Duncan. Questions first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck you people are,\u201d Pulaski tried to yell, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan bared his fangs, stopping the man\u2019s words. The pungent scent of human sweat on an unwashed body filled his nostrils and Raphael sniffed. \u201cIf you would, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Pulaski screamed as he was thrown through the air to land with a grunt at Raphael\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he whined shakily. \u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 more about them murders. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked down on the sniveling piece of humanity. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. And we\u2019ll get to that later. But first\u2014\u201d He crouched down, letting his power rise until the dirt around them was dancing with electricity, until the human worm was cringing beneath the silvery glow of his eyes. \u201cYou threatened my mate this afternoon. Tall, beautiful, dark-haired? You remember her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNuh, no! I never saw\u2014\u201d He screamed as Raphael\u2019s power closed around his heart just enough to hurt . . . badly.</p><p>Raphael tsked softly. \u201cDidn\u2019t your murdering friends teach you anything about vampires? After all, a good hunter always knows his prey. And I know all about you, Hugh Pulaski.\u201d</p><p>Tears were streaming down the man\u2019s face, carving a path through the oily sweat. He was mumbling something beneath his breath. It sounded like a prayer.</p> <p>Raphael laughed. \u201cYou would do better to pray to me, human. Your life is in my hands tonight, not your God\u2019s. Now\u2014\u201d He drilled into Pulaski\u2019s brain, forcing him to look up. \u201cI believe you wanted to apologize, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Pulaski nodded desperately, his eyes rolling white with fear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cOf course, it would be better if you apologized directly to my mate, but that won\u2019t happen. In fact, I think it would be best if you left this area altogether. You\u2019re not the kind of neighbor I had in mind for my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave. I will. I\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned and Pulaski screamed again. \u201cTonight,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ll go tonight. I promise. I will. Just, please don\u2019t hurt me anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHurt you? Oh, Hugh. You don\u2019t know what pain is yet.\u201d</p><p>Raphael ignored the human\u2019s pathetic whimpering and began rummaging through Hugh Pulaski\u2019s brain, his mouth pursed with distaste. The man was nobody. A rich man pretending to be poor, a small man pretending to be big. A liar and a cheat. And this, this slug had dared insult his Cyn, dared threaten her with violence? Raphael should do the world a favor and rid it of bad trash. But that wasn\u2019t his purpose tonight.</p><p>Cyn\u2019s bodyguard, Robbie, had been certain Pulaski knew more than what he\u2019d been willing to tell Colin Murphy this afternoon. But it was also possible that Pulaski knew more than he realized he did. Raphael sent a suggestion to the human\u2019s mind, directing him to the recent vampire murders, to the people behind it.</p><p>Pulaski twitched where he lay on the ground, his eyes rolled back in his head, drool dripping from his mouth. He looked like the idiot he was, but he wasn\u2019t permanently damaged. Not yet.</p><p>Raphael followed the human\u2019s twisting thoughts, the vicarious thrill when he\u2019d heard about Marco and Preston being murdered, the sick twist of perverted arousal at the news of Mariane\u2019s brutal rape. Raphael growled and dug deeper, going farther back in time. Pulaski was in a tavern of some sort. It was small and dark, with no lights except over the bar and only a few tables cloaked in heavy smoke and deep shadow. It smelled of beer and sweat and old cigarettes, with the lingering scent of a toilet that had run over in the not too distant past. The only noise was a low hum of conversation, too low to hear. A few words popped out, though. Enough to know they were going to hunt some vamps, going to hit \u2018em in daytime while they slept. No one would know a thing until it was too late and they\u2019d be long gone by then.</p><p>Raphael forced Hugh to look deeper, to see details, things he passed over without paying conscious attention. Details about the bar\u2014the sign advertising some beer, the brand indistinguishable because half the bulbs were burned out, the dusty deer head above the cash register, a plastic lei twisted in its antlers. Details about the conspirators\u2014men Hugh knew well, and others he didn\u2019t. But it was the men he knew that Raphael was interested in. He dug further, pushing until an involuntary whine rose from the human\u2019s throat and his back bowed from the ground with effort.</p> <p>Raphael released him.</p><p>A stench filled the air as Pulaski wet himself. He rolled over in the dirt and curled up into a ball, weeping piteously for his own suffering.</p><p>Raphael stepped away, shaking dirt from his coat. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Hugh Pulaski,\u201d he said, watching dispassionately as the human froze, listening. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving this area tonight. And make it permanent. I\u2019ll know if you come back.\u201d</p><p>Duncan walked with him back to the SUV, while Juro waited, standing over the whimpering human. Once Raphael was in the truck with the door closed, Juro followed, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat without the slightest reaction to the human or his suffering.</p><p>He looked up, meeting Raphael\u2019s gaze in the rear view mirror. \u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>Raphael considered how much time was left before morning.</p><p>\u201cLocate Wei Chen and Loren,\u201d he told Juro. \u201cTell them to meet us at the compound.\u201d</p><p>Juro spun the SUV in a tight circle, the tires coming close enough to Pulaski that he was pelted with bits of dirt, close enough that he screamed, cringing away from the big truck. Raphael glanced at his security chief and caught a slight upward twinge of the big vampire\u2019s mouth. Juro was very fond of Cyn. He respected her, which was saying something. There weren\u2019t very many beings Juro respected, human or vampire.</p> <p>As they drove back to the main road, Raphael considered everything he\u2019d learned from Pulaski\u2019s muddled brain. There was useful information there, but it would require interpretation. He\u2019d originally wanted to meet Wei Chen and Loren, because they were local. But what he really needed for this was someone local and human. Someone like Colin Murphy.</p><p>Raphael spotted Elke as soon as he came through the glass doors. She was standing on guard in the precise position she\u2019d occupied when he\u2019d left earlier.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said upon sighting him.</p><p>Raphael tilted his head in question.</p><p>\u201cShe came up for a few hours earlier. We played cards,\u201d she added disparagingly. \u201cI think she did it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Raphael agreed. \u201cBut it won\u2019t work. How long ago?\u201d</p><p>Elke didn\u2019t have to check her watch. Like all vampires she measured time by the sun\u2019s next arrival and knew exactly how much time had passed, because she knew how much time was left. \u201cAn hour, my lord. A few moments more.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, turning when he heard more vehicles pulling through the gates. Standing near the doors, Juro turned and said, \u201cWei Chen, Sire. Loren is not with him.\u201d</p><p>Raphael paused in taking off his coat. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Duncan was already on his cell. He said a few words, hung up and turned to Raphael. \u201cHe was checking out a lead, my lord. He\u2019s on his way back now.\u201d</p><p>Raphael and Duncan shared a skeptical look. Loren was Raphael\u2019s own child. The vampire couldn\u2019t lie to him, not successfully. Still, the situation bore watching. He finished removing his coat and threw it across the long couch not far from Elke before crossing to the meeting room. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in here,\u201d he told her, signaling Duncan to accompany him.</p><p>They settled to one side of the big doors, Raphael sitting at the end of a huge, antique sofa, his legs crossed at the knee, his arm stretched out along the back.</p><p>Duncan sat at the other end. \u201cOther than Mister Pulaski\u2019s close affiliation with his tree-dwelling ancestors,\u201d he said, \u201cdid his brain reveal any reliable information?\u201d</p><p>Raphael smiled slightly. \u201cThe man\u2019s a worm. He sat within a few feet of the humans who planned these murders and was too terrified to even look over his shoulder. Instead, he eavesdropped like an old woman in a marketplace.\u201d He shrugged dismissively. \u201cUnfortunately, the music was loud and the conspirators careful.\u201d</p><p>Duncan met his gaze knowingly and Raphael\u2019s smile grew.</p><p>\u201cI know your skill, my lord, and your determination. If it had been necessary to tear Pulaski\u2019s meager brain out through his ears and spread it on the ground to examine it, you would have done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColorful. But accurate. The worm knew two of the people involved. One he called by a nickname. Junior. It was a taunt of sorts, something the conspirator had been called as a child and apparently hated. The other is Curtis. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a first or last name. And I don\u2019t think our people will be too helpful on this.\u201d</p><p>Duncan eyed him thoughtfully. \u201cBut Colin Murphy would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Let\u2019s give him everything I got from Pulaski, not just the names, but the description of the local bar where they met. Pulaski spent a fair amount of time there, so anyone familiar with the place should be able to ID it from what I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cynthia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you also inform her of these new findings?\u201d</p><p>Raphael drummed his fingers on the tufted back of the sofa. \u201cI don\u2019t want her anywhere near this, but she\u2019ll be well and truly pissed if she finds out from someone else. And we both know she will. So, send her the same info, but copy Robbie on everything. At least she won\u2019t be able to pull a fast one on him and go after it herself. And tell Robbie if anything happens to her, he\u2019d better be dead before I know about it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Colin watched Sophia walk toward him, laughter warring with desire in her deep brown eyes. Her hips swayed as she crossed the room, one long curl of hair falling over her shoulder to caress her breast. She looked terrific. Sexy as hell. Just looking at her made his dick hurt. It always had. Nothing had managed to change his reaction to her\u2014not the years, not the lies, not even the knowledge that she drank blood to stay alive. He tried to imagine what it would be like to have her licking his skin, to feel her teeth sinking into his neck, drinking his blood. His erection grew harder.</p><p>Fuck that! He forced himself to remember the months he\u2019d grieved for her, the guilt and pain he\u2019d endured, thinking she was dead.</p><p>He looked away and took a good, long draught of whiskey, hoping it would wash away the taste of her, still so fresh despite the years.</p><p>Sophia slid gracefully onto the couch to sit facing him, her feet tucked under her thighs. She reached for his glass and he let her take it, watching as she drank, her plush lips closing around the rim, her tongue slipping out to taste before she let the whiskey roll into her mouth. Christ, what was wrong with him? He looked away, desperately trying to think of something, anything except what it would feel like to have that tongue licking other things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She offered the glass back to him and he took it, careful to sip from the opposite side of the glass, not wanting to feel the warm residue of her mouth. He drank, glancing up to meet her eyes, seeing her awareness of his arousal in their chocolate depths. Not that she\u2019d need any special powers for that one. His cock was so stiff, he was afraid it would break if he didn\u2019t move soon.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, clearing his throat when his voice came out as scratchy as a thirteen-year-old\u2019s. \u201cVampires drink? I mean, other than blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d Sophia agreed. \u201cSome do. I don\u2019t usually, although I do enjoy the taste of a good wine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo wine here, darlin\u2019,\u201d he drawled, relieved to have something to think about besides her effect on his libido. \u201cJust beer and whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whiskey is fine. Quite nice, actually,\u201d she murmured. She moved closer, until her breasts were brushing against his shoulder, her hand resting high on his thigh, so close to his throbbing cock, he would have sworn he could feel the heat of her fingers caressing its aching stiffness. She ran her other hand up his arm to his shoulder, her fingers playing lightly in his hair. She reached for the whiskey again and he released it, thinking she wanted another drink.</p><p>Instead, she set the tumbler on the coffee table, the remaining liquid sloshing slightly against the sides of the glass. Colin watched the gentle amber waves move back and forth, closing his eyes when her fingers closed over his erection. He grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sophia purred confidently, pressing her breasts harder against his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin confirmed. He stood suddenly, dislodging her so that she fell against the back cushions of the leather couch.</p><p>She rose to her feet slowly, anger in every movement, her eyes literally throwing off sparks of bright amber, reminding him illogically of the whiskey they\u2019d been drinking moments before. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow dare I?\u201d Colin repeated sharply, grateful for the anger that washed away the last vestiges of desire. \u201cWho the fuck are you? This is America, darlin\u2019. The U.S. of A. I\u2019ll dare anything I damn well please, including choosing the women I want to fuck. And you know what, Sophia? That doesn\u2019t include you, because I don\u2019t fuck dead women.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, her hand flashing out with incredible speed. He grabbed her wrist. \u201cAh, ah. No hitting, remember? Besides, I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d he added, grudgingly. \u201cI know you vamps aren\u2019t dead. But you died for me ten years ago, Soph, and you made damn sure I knew it. I see no reason to change that now.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, all of her anger gone, replaced by a look so lost, so full of sadness . . . Shit. He felt like an ass. And he was pissed that she\u2019d made him feel that way.</p><p>But before he could figure out what he wanted to say, her expression changed again, like a mask suddenly covering her face\u2014a mask of pure, cold arrogance. Without looking away from him, she stretched her arm toward her boots where she\u2019d left them beneath the counter. They came whipping across the room, passing so close to his head that he felt the air move, so close that he knew it had been on purpose. He narrowed his eyes at her, and she flashed a look of smug satisfaction in his direction, before tucking the boots under her arm and opening the door.</p> <p>Before he knew what was happening, she was out of the house and inside the car, which was already gunning for the highway. Colin swore softly. He hadn\u2019t seen her move, hadn\u2019t even seen the damn car door open and close. She zipped by so fast, his front door was still swinging slightly in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cSon of bitch,\u201d he muttered. He shook his head and turned to go back inside, wondering why his dick had grown hard all over again.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Raphael waited while the elevator made its smooth descent, his leather coat hanging over one arm. It was late. By the time he\u2019d finished briefing Duncan and the Seattle vampires, his hunt teams had begun arriving back at the compound. Duncan could have handled those reports, but he\u2019d chosen to sit in on them, to show his people that this matter was important to him, that his need for revenge burned as hotly as any of theirs. The truth was his desire for retribution was greater than they could possibly understand. It was his vampires who\u2019d been taken, his children. Blood of his blood.</p><p>But vengeance would have to wait a few more hours. The sun was looming just below the horizon. He felt it in his blood and bones. It infuriated him. It wearied him.</p><p>The doors opened on a nearly dark room, only a small light near the bed playing across the nearly still form of his beloved Cyn. He secured the vault doors and crossed to the bed, watching her breathe for a few minutes and wishing he had the courage to send her back to Malibu, to brave her anger and her protests and keep her safe. But he couldn\u2019t do that to her. Wouldn\u2019t do that to her. Wouldn\u2019t trap her in a cage of his making, a cage she would never leave because she loved him too much. But a cage that would eventually leave nothing but hate between them.</p><p>He sighed and stripped off his clothes, wondering at such dismal thoughts. He must be more tired than he thought. He lifted the covers carefully and slid into bed next to Cyn. She stirred, turning toward him instinctively, draping a leg and arm across his body without ever waking. He wrapped his arms around her, holding her tightly, wishing he could protect her from . . . His heart stuttered in his chest as an alarming foreboding suddenly darkened his thoughts and a final, terrifying question filled his mind before the sun took him. Protect her from what?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p> <p>Colin stood at the counter between his kitchen and living room the next morning, sipping his first cup of coffee and trying not to think about Sophia or her visit the night before. He scanned the list of e-mails that had come in during the night, studying it as if he expected anything to be there but junk. Holding the cup in one hand, he deleted one after the other until he came to a message from Loren. His fingers paused over the touch pad and he frowned. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever received an e-mail from the vamps before. If asked, he wouldn\u2019t have been certain they had his e-mail address. Not that it was a secret. Pretty much everyone in town had it, and it was printed on his business cards, too.</p><p>With a mental shrug, he clicked the file open and began to read the e-mail from Loren, swearing under his breath as he read the first few lines. Lord fucking Raphael had paid a visit to Hugh Pulaski last night. Not that Hugh was a model citizen or even a particularly decent one, but, damn, if even half of what Sophia had told him about Raphael was true, Hugh must have had a rough time of it. Colin was thinking he should probably take a trip out there, to make sure the aging woodsman wannabe had survived the encounter, but then he read the rest of the e-mail and decided Hugh could wait. The bastard had held out on him. Son of a bitch.</p><p>He checked his watch. It was just barely nine o\u2019clock, probably too early for Leighton. He called anyway, waiting while the number switched over to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cLeighton, Colin Murphy here. Check your e-mail. Your boyfriend apparently got us some new leads last night. I know the bar Hugh described. It\u2019s a fair distance out of town, on a two-lane road that connects to the main highway eventually. We\u2019ll probably find Curtis Jenkins there, too. He\u2019s on disability right now\u2014broken arm or something that hasn\u2019t healed right\u2014spends most of his time there. Anyway, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s the \u201cCurtis\u201d Hugh talked about. Don\u2019t know anyone who goes by \u201cJunior,\u201d though.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna check out the bar later and thought you might want to come join in the fun. Robbie\u2019s welcome, too, even if he is just a pussy Ranger. Can\u2019t hurt to have some extra muscle on hand.</p><p>So, call me when you get this. I\u2019m going to make some calls myself, see if I can\u2019t figure out who \u201cJunior\u201d is. Could be an old nickname. Hugh\u2019s been around a lot longer than I have. I\u2019ll try to track it down before we hook up.\u201d</p><p>He started to disconnect, then added, \u201cAnd I meant hook up in a completely nonsexual way, so don\u2019t get all riled up and tell your boyfriend on me. Later.\u201d</p><p>He poured himself a second cup of coffee before making the next call. He and Garry McWaters went back a long way. Back to BUD/S when Garry had been an old man with several years seniority and Colin had been a raw recruit. It had been Garry who\u2019d pulled him out of that town in South America, who\u2019d dragged him back to base camp and made sure he made their pickup out of the country the next night.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s Rest was Garry\u2019s hometown. He\u2019d been raised here by his grandparents, and they\u2019d been among the first founders of the independent community. His grandmother had died while their SEAL team had been out of country. Garry hadn\u2019t even been able to attend her funeral. His grandfather had lasted longer, dying less than a year after Garry and Colin had shown up in Coop with little more than their duffels and their Navy regulation haircuts.</p><p>The old man\u2019s death took something out of Garry. He didn\u2019t want to hang around after that, even though Colin had decided to stay. Garry headed back to California and signed up with a corporation that provided private armies to the U. S. Government. It was lucrative work, especially for someone with SEAL training and experience. He\u2019d tried more than once since then to recruit Colin into it, but the money wasn\u2019t enough to make up for a job that was too much like the one he\u2019d left behind. Besides, Colin had discovered he kind of liked the laid back lifestyle he\u2019d found in Cooper\u2019s Rest.</p><p>He pulled up Garry\u2019s number on his contact list and hoped his buddy was in-country. If not, Colin would have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Colin!\u201d Garry\u2019s voice boomed loud enough that Colin pulled the phone away from his ear by a few inches. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude? Ready to make some money at last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mac, you\u2019ll have to find some other sap to bail your ass out.\u201d</p><p>Garry made a dismissive sound. \u201cThink you got that a little backwards. Must be all the rain up there. Speaking of which, how\u2019s old Coop doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame as always, slow and easy, just the way I like it.\u201d Dead silence greeted this announcement and Colin frowned, wondering if they\u2019d been disconnected. \u201cGarry?

So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some trouble up here and a name\u2019s come up. One I\u2019ve never heard before. I figure since you\u2019re old as dirt\u2014\u201d He kept talking over Garry\u2019s profane reaction. \u201c\u2014and know just about everyone around here, maybe you could help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVamps? We never had any problems with\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the vamps causing the problem. Someone\u2019s killed a couple of \u2018em\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you knew them. Marco and Preston? Don\u2019t think they had last names, not that I knew anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco\u2019s the guy with the horses, right? On the short side, dark hair? He was living there when I was just a kid. Man, he\u2019s dead? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke in, blew off the door to his . . . bedroom, I guess you\u2019d say. More like a vault. But they killed him. It was daytime, so no resistance. Happened maybe a week ago. I didn\u2019t even know about it until some vampire big shot showed up to investigate. They killed Preston the same day and hit Jeremy and Mariane two days later. Couldn\u2019t find Jeremy, so they savaged Mariane instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. I\u2019ve got the next month free. You need me to come back and give you a hand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but the vamps brought in their own army to hunt down the killers. I\u2019m not big on vigilantes, but in this case, I\u2019m not inclined to protest too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see your point.\u201d He breathed deeply. \u201cSo what\u2019s the name you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat what I got. Supposedly a nickname, but not one the person particularly liked to be called. I don\u2019t know any juniors. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior,\u201d Hugh repeated. \u201cI\u2019m thinking back to grade school, maybe? High school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a long way back,\u201d Colin said with mock seriousness.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Murphy. There\u2019s only something like six years between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s see, when you were doing BUD/S, I was in eighth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you. And I don\u2019t remember any juniors off hand, but I\u2019ll think on it. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m going out to Babe\u2019s later this afternoon, following another lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRough place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a human P.I. in town, a woman who works for the vamps. Former cop. She\u2019s not military, but she knows her stuff. She\u2019ll be with me.\u201d</p><p>Garry laughed. \u201cBetter than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling she\u2019s tougher than she looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you get to it, then. And I\u2019ll get back to you on that name, maybe drag out my old yearbooks or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Chief, you\u2019ve still got your high school yearbooks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep flowers from freshman homecoming pressed in the pages, memories of my first lay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t get any until then, huh? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The silence on Garry\u2019s end was complete. His friend had hung up on him. Colin laughed briefly, already thinking about the trip out to Babe\u2019s when the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cLeighton,\u201d he answered after checking caller ID. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp is a relative term. I\u2019m vertical, if that\u2019s what you mean, but awake will take a couple more cups of coffee. So what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou check your e-mail yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it now. I\u2019m guessing you mean the one from Loren. Let\u2019s see . . . Oh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know Raphael was going out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Robbie the fink told him about visiting Pulaski in all its gory detail.\u201d She sighed audibly. \u201cWhat can I say, Raphael\u2019s a very protective guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining. He got more out of Hugh than we did. Like I said, I know the bar and I know Curtis. I\u2019m going out there today. You wanna come with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Robbie?\u201d</p><p>Leighton made a dismissive sound. \u201cLike they\u2019d let me out of this place without him. We\u2019ll come by your house. Give me an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring all your guns, Leighton. You\u2019ll need \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>Colin was loading the magazine for his Benelli when he heard the truck coming down the drive to his house. He secured the shotgun in its combat sling, set the whole thing down and pulled open his front door. Leighton was standing next to one of the big Suburbans, talking on her cell phone, while Robbie walked around back and reached into the cargo compartment, emerging with a huge, black duffel bag. He slung it over his shoulder, strolled over to Colin\u2019s Tahoe and dumped the bag on the ground.</p><p>Colin nodded to Robbie and leaned back inside to grab his keys. Beeping the locks open on his truck, he grabbed his gear and walked out onto the porch, closing the house door behind him. Robbie had already tossed the black duffel into the Tahoe. Colin eyed it curiously as he dropped his own gear next to it, but Robbie didn\u2019t offer and Colin didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>The two men leaned against the truck, watching Leighton on the phone. Colin didn\u2019t know with whom she was talking, but he was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t girl chat. She was listening carefully and responding with short, terse sentences he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Colin wondered again about the duality that was Leighton, with her model\u2019s good looks and her concealed weapons. He wondered if she\u2019d always been this way, or if Raphael had somehow molded her into what he needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it\u2019s like?\u201d he asked Robbie thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in Leighton\u2019s direction. \u201cHaving a vampire lover.\u201d</p><p>Robbie\u2019s dark eyes crinkled with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019ve never . . . indulged with a vamp?\u201d</p><p>Colin frowned and shook his head. \u201cHell, no.\u201d Not intentionally, he added to himself. After all, he hadn\u2019t known Sophia was a vampire back then.</p><p>Robbie laughed, teeth flashing. \u201cOnce they draw blood, the sex is terrific, man. But it\u2019s more than sex if you\u2019re actually mated to someone, like Cyn.\u201d He gave Colin a challenging look. \u201cOr like me,\u201d he added.</p><p>Colin drew up in surprise. \u201cYou? Shit. I didn\u2019t mean anything. I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDe nada,\u201d Robbie said casually. \u201cMy wife Irina is Vampire. A tiny little thing who runs Raphael\u2019s household with an iron fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe runs you pretty much the same way,\u201d Cyn interjected, having joined them without either of them noticing.</p><p>Robbie grunted in agreement, looking like a very satisfied man. \u201cYou hear me complaining? So, what\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>Colin quirked his eyebrows in question.</p><p>\u201cThat was an old contact of mine. A gun seller. Not altogether legal, but not a bad guy either. His business gives him a certain amount of access to his customer\u2019s activities. Sometimes he has a problem with those activities and he\u2019s willing to talk, including the white supremacist groups operating out of Idaho and parts west. He tells me there\u2019s a whole lot of ordinance being trucked this way, along with the people to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Let\u2019s hope they haven\u2019t arrived yet,\u201d Colin muttered. \u201cI hope you guys came prepared. What\u2019s in the duffel?\u201d</p><p>Robbie grinned and unzipped the black bag, pulling the two sides wide. He reached inside and pulled out an Uzi submachine gun, tossing it to Colin. He then dug farther in the bag and produced a Point Blank ballistic vest for Leighton, handing it to her with orders to \u201cput it on.\u201d</p><p>Colin inspected the matte black Uzi. He was familiar with the weapon, but preferred his Benelli. He handed it back to Robbie who was watching a grumbling Leighton don her vest. It was a concealable model, the same thing worn by most police departments in the country. It was also probably the only kind she\u2019d be willing to wear. Anything heavier would weigh her down and restrict her movements.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d she asked Robbie, giving him a narrow look.</p><p>\u201cIn the bag. I\u2019ll put it on if I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz I promised Raphael I\u2019d take care of you. But mostly because you\u2019ve got a piss poor sense of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Leighton objected, but she was laughing when she said it.</p><p>Colin shook his head. He wasn\u2019t even going to try to figure that one out. \u201cLet\u2019s roll,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fair drive ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin here\u2019s a virgin.\u201d Robbie was leaning forward from his seat in the back, his substantial presence inserted between the two front bucket seats.</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Colin protested immediately.</p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d Leighton clarified with a sideways grin. \u201cRobbie\u2019s talking vampire virgin. You\u2019ve never been bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cReally? I would have sworn there were sparks flying between you and that Sophia chick. Definite sexual tension,\u201d she added, drawing out the word.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he responded stiffly. \u201cAnd she never told me she was a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Next to him, Leighton raised her eyebrows, but didn\u2019t make any further comment about Sophia. \u201cSo what\u2019s this place we\u2019re going to?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cBabe\u2019s. It\u2019s what we\u2019d call a good ol\u2019 boy bar back home. Sits just off the highway, the other side of the forest. It\u2019s open five, sometimes six, days a week, but Friday and Saturday are the big nights, just like everywhere else. There\u2019s at least one fight every weekend, and that\u2019s just counting the ones where someone gets arrested or someone else ends up in the hospital. It\u2019s a pain in the butt, but it\u2019s been here a while, since back in the sixties. Strictly speaking, it\u2019s not a part of Cooper\u2019s Rest, but we\u2019re the closest town to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spotted the break in the trees signaling the bar\u2019s parking lot. \u201cHere ya go,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The parking lot was full, or nearly so, when they pulled even with the bar. It wasn\u2019t a big lot\u2014just two rows in front, perpendicular to the highway. The rows had just enough room between them to maneuver, with spaces for four or five trucks to park side by side. And trucks were just about the only kind of vehicle anyone ever parked here. Colin surveyed the crowded lot and frowned. It looked more like a Friday night, than a weekday afternoon. One of the logging crews must have shut down early.</p><p>He drove past and made a U-turn, then parked his Tahoe in the last space next to the highway, driving right into to it with the front of his truck facing outward, so that he could make a fast exit, if it came to it. It probably wasn\u2019t necessary, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d wanted a quick departure from Babe\u2019s either. Fights were as common as the beer here, and the patrons played rough.</p> <p>His tires were barely off the highway asphalt, his door opening right into traffic, if there\u2019d been any. A Dodge Ram dually\u2014a big truck with four wheels on the rear axle\u2014was parked next to him, nose in to his tail. A scant few inches separated the two trucks, with the other guy\u2019s passenger side squeezed right up against his.</p><p>He checked the highway and slid out of the truck. He went to close the door, but stopped when he realized Leighton was climbing over to his side from the passenger seat, rather than attempting the narrow space on the other side. His momma having raised him to be a gentleman, Colin held the door open while she levered herself onto the console and over with a surprising amount of ease, finally sliding across his seat and out onto the dusty roadside.</p><p>She grinned at him as she stepped out, then stood staring up at the rusted and bullet-pocked sign that hung from the top of a lodge pole pine at the edge of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cPaul Bunyan?\u201d she asked, eyeing what had once been a fairly decent rendering of the huge lumberjack in his red plaid shirt, arm draped over the wide shoulders of his blue ox, Babe. She glanced over at the bar and back again, giving him a skeptical look.</p><p>Colin grimaced. \u201cYeah, well. The couple who opened the place back in the day were university professors from down south somewhere. They retired up here and opened this place. You\u2019d think they\u2019d know better, being professors and all. But while they were expecting the bar from Cheers, what they got was a lot closer to Cops. When Leon\u2019s dad bought the place off of them\u2014pretty much for a song, I\u2019m told\u2014he kept the sign. It was cheaper than buying a new one, and the name\u2019s okay. This is lumber country, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Leon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeon Pettijohn. He and his wife Ellen took over from his dad a few years back. That was before I got here, but word is the old man retired to Mexico for the weather. Leon\u2019s here most nights, but Ellen works at the grocery in town. Far as I know, she never comes to the bar. Most women don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Leighton shifted her attention, her eyes scanning the nearly full parking lot before moving on to the bar itself. Not that there was much to see. Babe\u2019s was a small, single story, concrete block building, with a satellite dish on the roof. The whole thing was painted black, and Colin knew if you got close enough it looked like the paint had been rolled on thick by someone more interested in getting it done than getting it done right. The only window was a tiny triangle of filthy glass set in the front door. The bar was set well back into the woods, with thick tree trunks crowding around the three sides that didn\u2019t face the parking lot. Those trees blocked out what sunlight there was, leaving the whole building surrounded by bluish-gray shadows. When combined with the black paint job, they gave the whole thing a rather sinister feel.</p><p>Colin took another look at the trucks crowding the lot. \u201cFuck it,\u201d he said and followed Robbie to the back of the Tahoe. Yanking open the cargo hatch, he grabbed his vest and pulled it on with a few swift movements. Robbie met his gaze and Colin shrugged. \u201cToo many trucks in this lot. Could be nothin\u2019, one of the logging crews shut down early. But could be our guys are having an impromptu meeting in there.\u201d</p><p>Robbie frowned, then turned to look at Leighton and shook his head. Swearing under his breath, he pulled over the huge duffel, unzipped it and dug out his own vest. Leighton wandered back, her gaze sharpening when she saw what they were doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking?\u201d she asked Colin. Her right hand was resting at her waist, just inside her jacket. Not touching her weapon, but close enough that she could get to it. She felt it, too. Something not quite right.</p> <p>\u201cI think maybe you should wait here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly a place for ladies.\u201d</p><p>Robbie coughed and Leighton gave him a dirty look before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t come all this way to sit in the car. Besides, you\u2019re the one who said to bring my guns. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because you thought they might come in handy.\u201d</p><p>Colin shot a quick look at Robbie, who shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, man. I\u2019ve seen her shoot.\u201d He reached into the duffle and handed Leighton one of the Uzis, along with three thirty-two round magazines, taking the second gun and some ammo for himself.</p><p>Leighton tucked two magazines into the thigh pockets of her black combats and slapped the other into the weapon with a practiced ease Colin hadn\u2019t expected, despite her claims of experience and Robbie the Ranger\u2019s endorsement. She glanced up and saw him staring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that weapon\u2019s illegal,\u201d he observed blandly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m licensed as a private bodyguard for Lord Raphael in every state in the Union,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cI can show you my permits back at the compound, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. I\u2019ll go in first. You two hang back a couple steps. Most likely, I\u2019ll know everyone in there, or they\u2019ll know me, anyway. I hope you\u2019re not shocked by foul language, Leighton.\u201d</p><p>Robbie laughed out loud at that and Leighton muttered darkly, \u201cYeah, fuck you, Robbie. You fink.\u201d</p> <p>Colin shook his head at the two of them. Despite their sniping at one another, he got a clear sense of friendship between them. It reminded him of the relationships he\u2019d had with the guys on his SEAL team. Guys like Garry McWaters. He had a moment\u2019s regret that Garry had chosen to leave Cooper\u2019s Rest. Times like this, he could have used someone he trusted. Not that he didn\u2019t trust Leighton and Robbie. But he didn\u2019t really know them either. It just wasn\u2019t the same as working with someone who\u2019d walked into hell with you and come out the other side.</p><p>He pulled the combat sling over his head, secured his Benelli and closed the cargo hatch, clicking the locks closed. He\u2019d taken three strides toward the bar when some instinct made him stop and click the remote again, unlocking the Tahoe\u2019s doors. Maybe it was all these trucks making him nervous, he thought, or maybe it was just the Uzis and the level of violence they brought with them. But whatever it was, he went with his instincts.</p><p>Leighton had moved ahead of him into the parking lot. She had her cell phone out and was snapping pictures of license plates as she passed them. She looked up as he walked around her, giving him a quick grin before slipping the cell phone back into her pocket.</p><p>Colin approached the door, Leighton and Robbie a few feet behind him, and spread out to the right. Robbie was standing slightly ahead of Leighton, his much larger body blocking hers, as if he expected something awful to come boiling out as soon as the door opened. Colin hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, hoped he was wrong and there was nothing in there but some hard drinking men taking advantage of an early break from a dangerous job.</p><p>Standing slightly left of the door, Colin reached out and closed his fingers over the door handle, pushing against the door first, and then tightening to pull. He caught movement from the corner of his eye as Leighton crossed out of Robbie\u2019s shadow and took two careful sidesteps to the right. Robbie turned to follow her and Colin opened the door.</p><p>And all hell broke loose.</p><p>Robbie bellowed a warning, \u201cMurphy!\u201d as he grabbed Leighton and shoved her between the nearest trucks on the right. A shaft of sunlight hit the opening door and Colin saw the black barrel of a gun just inside.</p><p>\u201cGun!\u201d he yelled, as the boom of heavy shotguns roared from the trees around the right side the bar.</p><p>Colin felt the shock of bullets hitting the thick wood of the door before he rolled to one side, shielded by the solid block walls. The door crashed open and a hail of gunfire spewed out from the dark interior. Leighton and Robbie had taken cover behind a big two-ton rig, and they popped up now, both Uzis firing full auto as Colin scrambled away from his now exposed position next to the building wall and ducked between two trucks on the left side of the lot.</p><p>From the open door of the bar came the distinct rat-tat-tat of an M4 carbine on full auto, and all three of them ducked down as bullets sprayed the parking lot full of trucks, zinging off metal and shattering glass. The oily stinky of diesel fuel snuck into the air and then the hollow boom of a big tire deflating punctuated the racket.</p><p>Colin saw Robbie swivel around the two-ton\u2019s long bed and fire a quick burst. Someone screamed inside the building and the door slammed shut once again. But the steady barrage of fire from the right side of the building continued, the shooters using the trees and the bar itself for cover. They were concentrating all of their fire on Leighton and Robbie\u2019s position, which made Colin suspect they didn\u2019t know he was across the parking lot by himself.</p><p>He considered maneuvering quietly down the left of the building and around the back to come up behind the shooters, but ruled it out almost as soon as he thought of it. There was a back door to the bar. The guys who\u2019d been waiting for him inside seemed to have given up on the front door, but that probably meant they were on their way out the back to join their buddies, and those boys were shooting to kill.</p><p>Judging purely by the amount of fire they were taking, the three of them were vastly outnumbered, and this was not a fight they could win. What he, Leighton and Robbie needed to do was get the hell out of Dodge. But how to do that without becoming even more of a target than they already were? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Leighton and Robbie were right in the middle of a firefight, Colin was taking no fire and had no targets from his current position. He crouched over, maneuvering down the narrow space between the trucks and the trees on the left side of the parking lot. He kept glancing over his shoulder. The parking lot was wider than the bar, which meant he was exposed if someone realized where he was and came around behind him. He stayed as close to the trucks as he could, taking advantage of their bulk. He was hoping to get an angle on the shooters and provide cover for Leighton and Robbie to withdraw back to the Tahoe. He\u2019d then have to cross the open parking lot to join them, but that was for later.</p><p>He cast a fleeting look as he ran along the tree line and saw Robbie go down. His stomach twisted and he paused, slipping alongside a beat-up F-150, but he quickly realized the big Ranger hadn\u2019t been shot. He had dropped into a combat crawl and was using the vehicles and ground for protection as he maneuvered closer to Leighton who was no longer sheltering behind the two-ton rig. While Colin had been positioning himself to join the fight, she\u2019d managed to get away from the two-ton and was now crouched alongside a big Century wrecker, which was probably the heaviest thing in the lot and only two trucks away from Colin\u2019s Tahoe. If she could hold there until Colin got into position, he could provide covering fire while she retreated safely to\u2014</p><p>He swore softly as Leighton pulled herself up onto the back of the wrecker and started firing, using the body of the tow arm for protection.</p> <p>He heard Robbie cursing, heard the splintering crack of safety glass and the sharp ricochet of bullets as they struck the heavy metal of the wrecker\u2019s body. But Leighton stuck to her position like a tick on a hound, her slender frame tucked in behind the thick tow arm as she kept up a steady hail of fire.</p><p>Robbie caught Colin\u2019s attention, holding up a hand with five fingers. Colin nodded, watching as the fingers dropped one by one. When the countdown ended, Robbie stood up and started shooting, joining his fire power with Leighton\u2019s, pinning their attackers beneath a wave of death.</p><p>Colin dashed across the lot and dove beneath the dually which was snugged up against his Tahoe, belly crawling under the dually first and then his own truck. His back scraped on the Tahoe\u2019s skid plate, but he blew out a breath and came out on the other side, right next to the highway. He stepped up onto his truck\u2019s running board.</p><p>\u201cLeighton,\u201d he yelled. \u201cFall back.\u201d</p><p>He thought she shouted an acknowledgment, but couldn\u2019t be sure as she ducked down and the back window of the wrecker blew out when someone cut a line of fire right across where her head used to be. Colin held his breath as she seemed to fall off the big wrecker, swearing in relief as she appeared next to Robbie who dragged her to the ground and shoved her under the next truck in line.</p> <p>Colin pulled the Benelli up and fired a couple of rounds into the trees. He couldn\u2019t see anyone, but someone gave a cry of pain, far enough away that he knew it wasn\u2019t from the Benelli\u2019s fire. Shotgun in hand, he crouched down, back-stepped along the side of his truck and opened the rear passenger door.</p><p>\u201cRobbie,\u201d he shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Moving back to the hood, using the engine block for cover, he swung the Benelli away and took up his .9 mm, firing steadily. The sound of a second .9 mm joined in and he glanced over to see Leighton had rolled out from under the Tahoe and taken up a position near the rear end of the Tahoe. As he looked over, she ejected the magazine from her Glock 17, slapped in a replacement and resumed a steady, methodical rate of fire with a speed that spoke of a hell of a lot more than just target practice.</p><p>Robbie dropped to the ground on the far side of the dually, but he was too big and the truck was too close to the ground for him to crawl under, even if he blew out every ounce of air in his lungs. The front end of the dually was snug up against the trees and fully in the line of fire from that side. He duck walked his way to the back end instead, pausing long enough to slap the spare magazine into his Uzi.</p><p>Colin saw what the big man had planned and yanked his Benelli up again, stepping up on the Tahoe\u2019s running board and firing over the roof. It wouldn\u2019t hit anyone at this distance, but it would keep their heads down. Robbie took the advantage offered, rushing out of cover and backing toward the road, his Uzi spitting fire all the way. He reached the relative safety of the Tahoe, ducked beneath the windows and ran toward Leighton who was still shooting her Glock in a steady double tap rhythm\u2014bang bang, bang bang.</p><p>\u201cLeighton!\u201d Colin shouted. He glanced worriedly at the open highway behind them. It was time to leave. Leighton nodded and kept firing.</p><p>The Tahoe tilted as Robbie jumped onto the running board behind the passenger compartment, putting Leighton between the two of them. Firing his Uzi on semi-auto in the general direction of their assailants, he roared at Leighton, \u201cIn the truck, Cyn. Now!\u201d</p> <p>Fresh gunfire erupted suddenly from a new direction, coming from the other side of the parking lot, where Colin had been hiding earlier. Colin dropped to the ground as Leighton stepped out and began firing, covering his back while he yanked the front door of his truck open, and began to return fire. He felt more than saw Robbie drop off the running board and glanced over to see him reaching for Leighton, trying to pull her out of her exposed position and into the protection of the truck.</p><p>Colin heard a soft grunt and a gasp of breath, heard Robbie\u2019s horrified shout of denial.</p><p>He spun around, a wordless protest choking him as ice water filled his veins. \u201cGoddammit!\u201d he swore. Leighton was slumped on the ground, blood already drenching the front of her combats and soaking into the dirt.</p><p>\u201cGet her in the truck, Robbie. Get her in the fucking truck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast magazine,\u201d Robbie shouted and threw his Uzi at Colin who caught it one-handed. He tucked the .9 mm into its holster and started firing the Uzi on full auto, not even trying to hit anything. His only thought was to force their enemies to take cover long enough for Robbie to get Leighton in the truck so they could get the hell out of here.</p><p>He shot another glance over his shoulder and saw Robbie scoop Leighton up like she weighed nothing. Bullets were whizzing through the air, carving into the dirt parking lot and gouging chunks out of the trees. Someone got lucky and shot out all the windows on the Tahoe, spidering the safety glass. Robbie curved his body around Leighton and kept moving, crawling into the backseat and staying low.</p><p>Colin reached over and slammed the back door. Lying almost flat on the front seat, he shoved the keys into the ignition and jammed the truck into gear. He started to sit up, his foot reaching for the gas, when he heard a voice shouting orders, a voice almost as familiar to him as his own. His stomach clenched in denial. That was impossible. The gunfire died abruptly and he heard his name called. He closed his eyes against a wave of sick betrayal.</p><p>He slammed his truck door and hit the gas, his tires spitting dirt before catching on the asphalt with a scream of burning rubber.</p> <p>Colin didn\u2019t think about anything for the first few miles. The windshield was cracked, but he could still see, so he concentrated on driving, on getting Leighton some help, on putting distance between them and goddamn Babe\u2019s. The Benelli sat on the passenger seat, along with Robbie\u2019s Uzi, the .9 mm was in his hand. His attention veered from the road in front to his rear view mirror and back again, over and over until he was convinced no one was following.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked Robbie, risking a quick look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou got a first aid kit or something in this truck?\u201d Robbie asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s in the back, but it might be better if we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull over, goddammit,\u201d Robbie demanded. \u201cI need something besides my hands to stop this bleeding,\u201d he added more quietly, his voice rough with emotion.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Colin checked the mirror quickly and turned down an old logging road, not stopping until the highway had disappeared into the trees behind him. He threw himself out of the truck, raced around back, lifted the cargo hatch and grabbed the first aid kid, slamming the hatch down.</p><p>Hurrying back, he yanked the back door open and swore viciously at what he found there.</p><p>Blood. Too much blood for one person to lose. Her pants were black with it, the gray carpet splotched with bright red. Robbie was cradling Leighton in his arms, one big hand stroking her hair back off her face over and over again. \u201cCyn, baby,\u201d he begged softly. \u201cHang on for me, sweetheart. Hang on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Colin asked grimly.</p><p>Robbie looked up and met Colin\u2019s gaze. He didn\u2019t need to say anything. The grief was written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up,\u201d Colin said in a hard voice. \u201cThe hospital\u2019s a good sixty miles, but I can make it in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leighton\u2019s voice was unexpected, terrifying in its frailty. Her eyes opened, fogged with pain as she searched Robbie\u2019s face. She fumbled for his hand with bloodless fingers. \u201cRaphael. Robbie, you\u2019ve got to get me to\u2014\u201d She groaned, vomited to one side, and then screamed with pain.</p><p>Colin automatically grabbed a wet wipe from the first aid kit, staring at it in his hand before throwing it onto the floor. What the fuck did it matter if her face was dirty?</p><p>Leighton\u2019s cries subsided into soft moans, and she sobbed suddenly, her hand falling away where she\u2019d been clinging to Robbie\u2019s arm. \u201cIt hurts so bad, Robbie.\u201d Tears were flowing down her cheeks, choking her words. \u201cPromise me, Rob,\u201d she said in a barely there whisper.</p><p>\u201cI promise, sweetheart. I will. You know I will. Just take it easy now.\u201d</p><p>Colin was grabbing packages almost at random from the first aid kit, tearing them open, shoving the contents into Robbie\u2019s hand and ripping open some more. Bandages, wraps, gauze, anything he thought might help. The floor was littered with paper wrappings on top of the blood and vomit. Robbie was holding the makeshift compress over Leighton\u2019s bloody gut, keeping it in place even when she cried out, whispering apologies to her over and over again.</p><p>He looked up, suddenly intent. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cShe\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got to get her to the compound before sunset.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe compound?\u201d Colin said. \u201cMan, what the fuck\u2019s that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Robbie said in a hard voice. \u201cOr I\u2019ll shoot you and drive the damn truck myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019ll fucking drive. You take care of her.\u201d</p> <p>Colin slammed back into the driver\u2019s seat and reversed into a three-point turn. He headed back to the highway, stopping only to check the road carefully before pulling out and starting back toward Cooper\u2019s Rest and the vampire compound. He crushed the gas pedal beneath his boot, demanding every bit of speed the Tahoe had to give him.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Cyn,\u201d he heard Robbie plead softly. Colin glanced in the rear view mirror. The big man\u2019s face was streaked with tears, his eyes closed as his mouth moved in a silent prayer.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Colin called over his shoulder what seemed like a lifetime later. He made a sharp turn onto the narrow road where the vamps had their compound. \u201cMaybe less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a cell phone?\u201d Robbie asked tautly. \u201cMine got fried back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot?\u201d Colin demanded, risking a backward glance.</p> <p>\u201cNothing that won\u2019t hold. Cell phone,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Here.\u201d Colin fished it out of his pocket and held it back over his shoulder, but Robbie didn\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cCall this number,\u201d he said instead, rattling off an L.A. area code and phone number.</p><p>Colin punched it in, heard it ring. \u201cIt\u2019s ringing. What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d</p><p>Robbie\u2019s hand was covered with blood as he took the phone. \u201cDoc Saephan, it\u2019s Cyn. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d His voice broke and Colin heard him draw a deep breath. \u201cYeah,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s bad. Gut shot. She\u2019s bleeding . . . She\u2019s bleeding a lot, man. Murphy says ten minutes tops.\u201d He paused a moment, then said, \u201cFuck me, you think I don\u2019t know that? Right, sorry. Okay. See you there.\u201d</p> <p>Colin watched in his rearview mirror as Robbie wiped a bloody forearm across his brow. The big Ranger looked up and met his gaze. \u201cYou want this back?\u201d he asked, holding out the phone.</p><p>Colin reached for the phone which was sticky with blood. He dropped it in the center console. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Saephan. He\u2019s a trauma surgeon, one of the best in the country. His partner is one of Raphael\u2019s soldiers and he travels with us a lot, especially if Cyn\u2019s along. How long \u2018til sunset?\u201d</p><p>It took Colin a minute to process the shift in subject. \u201cUh,\u201d he glanced around at the darkening trees. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. Half hour, maybe? The light\u2019s deceptive around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Robbie breathed. \u201cYou hear that, Cyn sweetheart. It\u2019s almost sunset.\u201d</p><p>Colin was pretty sure Leighton wasn\u2019t hearing much of anything. But she was still alive and that was something. And if this surgeon was as good as Robbie claimed, maybe he could save her life. And, okay, so it was nearly sunset and Raphael and the other vamps would be awake soon.</p><p>But other than Raphael holding her hand while she suffered, what the hell difference would that make?</p><p>He looked up as the compound came into sight. The guards were ready for them and had the big gate rolling out of the way before they got there. Colin barely slowed as he made the turn, hitting the brakes all the way around the curve of the driveway and up to the big building.</p> <p>He\u2019d never been here in daylight before. Every window in the place was shuttered on the inside, presenting a nearly uniform gray fa\u00e7ade with the concrete front. The shutter over one of the big glass doors was rolling upward as he skidded to a stop by the broad stairs. The door flew open and a slender, dark-haired man rushed out, carrying a folded, portable stretcher. He hurried down the stairs and yanked open the back door before the Tahoe had stopped moving.</p><p>He took one look at Leighton in Robbie\u2019s arms, cursed fluently and snapped into doctor mode, which told Colin this was the Doc Saephan Robbie had talked about. Two of the gate guards had followed the truck up to the house and one of them was already deploying the stretcher, snapping it rigid as his buddy grabbed the other end.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Saephan ordered Colin, \u201cget around here and give them a hand. I don\u2019t want that dressing disturbed anymore than necessary right now. Robbie, we\u2019ve got maybe twenty minutes before the shit hits the fan. I can\u2019t do much in that time, but I can make her look better than this. You ready?\u201d he asked over his shoulder.</p><p>The two gate guards nodded. \u201cReady, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Robbie scooted across the seat, holding Leighton to his chest, using his legs to control the slide. When he reached the door, he turned slightly and Colin was there with Saephan, taking her weight and transferring her to the stretcher. Leighton cried out as they moved her, but she didn\u2019t regain consciousness. Her face was deathly pale beneath the dirt and sweat, her hands lying limply over her chest where Saephan had put them.</p><p>The guards were already moving up the stairs, the stretcher held carefully between them, Saephan running alongside. A woman stood at the top of the stairs, holding the door open, her eyes wide with shock.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is that?\u201d Robbie demanded.</p><p>Saephan glanced over hurriedly. \u201cShe works here.\u201d He turned back, drawing Robbie\u2019s attention. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of here, Rob. Just for the night. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Robbie opened his mouth to protest, but Saephan held up a hand, his gaze following Leighton\u2019s stretcher through the doors.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue and you know I\u2019m right. I don\u2019t need two patients. I\u2019m sure this gentleman will let you sleep on his couch. Now I\u2019ve got to help Cyn.\u201d</p><p>Saephan spun around, taking the last few steps and dashing through the open door, shouting orders as he went. The woman appeared again. She pushed the door closed, her fingers resting on the handle for a moment as she studied Colin and Robbie through the glass. Then she stepped back and the heavy shutter rolled down, closing them off completely.</p><p>Colin turned on Robbie, his anger a fire in his gut. He\u2019d been forced to wait more times than he could count while his buddies fought for their lives, but he\u2019d never been shut out like this. \u201cWhat the fuck? Look, I get it, Raphael\u2019s gonna be pissed. But why can\u2019t we go in there with her? What kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Robbie said dully, his gaze still riveted on the now-shuttered door. He lowered his head, sighing deeply. \u201cDoc\u2019s trying to save my life. Yours, too.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at him. \u201cYou know, somebody better start talking and I don\u2019t see anyone here but you. You got a trauma surgeon here, fantastic. So why aren\u2019t we life flighting the doc and Leighton to a hospital? And who the fuck cares if Raphael\u2019s awake yet or not? The woman needs medical care, not handholding. And why the hell are we standing out here like yesterday\u2019s trash?\u201d</p><p>Robbie met his stare wearily, despite Colin\u2019s anger. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen wounds like that before, Murphy. You know the odds. But you don\u2019t know much about vampires, so you\u2019ll have to trust me when I say her best chance of surviving is asleep in that building. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here and that\u2019s why I care what time the damn sun goes down, all right? As for the other\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words chopped off, his eyes going wide with shock as a huge roar thundered through the air, shaking the ground beneath their feet and sending dust flying everywhere as the concrete building trembled on its foundation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Colin breathed.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d Robbie whispered.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Raphael came awake with a howl of rage. Cyn\u2019s pain was like a knife in his belly. He could smell her blood, could feel the weakening beat of her heart, her lungs struggling to breathe. For the first time in centuries, true terror struck him at the thought of losing her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother with clothes, striding across the room, cursing at the time it took to open the vault door, then the elevator door, waiting for the doors to close, for the elevator to rise the short distance to where she lay dying without him.</p><p>The doors opened and he sprang down the hallway and into the great room, snarling at the two human guards who stood huddled near the front doors.</p><p>\u201cThey carried her from the car, my lord,\u201d a man\u2019s familiar voice said. \u201cThey can\u2019t leave until the shutters open for the night.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s head swung to the human kneeling next to his Cyn. He growled, but the human had already turned away and was leaning over her, doing something that Raphael couldn\u2019t see. Raphael reached out, intending to pick the man up and throw him across the room for daring to touch her. But the human looked up at the last moment and Raphael had just enough presence of mind left to recognize Peter Saephan.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Raphael ground out.</p><p>Saephan did so, rolling away without standing.</p><p>Raphael sank to his knees in front of her and ripped open his wrist. He touched it to her mouth, but she was too weak to drink. He howled and raked a fang over his lip instead, bending over to press his lips to her unresponsive mouth, sliding his tongue between her teeth. Her breath hitched and then eased, as if she\u2019d been waiting for him, as if she knew he was finally here.</p><p>Raphael closed his eyes and lifted his mouth away from hers, nearly crushed by the pain rolling off her in waves. He fisted his hands and rolled his head back on his shoulders, letting out an anguished roar that filled the building, shattering glass behind the heavy shutters.</p><p>Gathering Cyn into his arms, he stood and, holding her tightly against his chest, he moved with lightning speed back to the elevator.</p><p>Footsteps clattered behind him and he could hear Saephan speaking quickly. \u201cShe needs blood, my lord. Human blood to replace what she\u2019s lost.\u201d</p><p>Raphael ignored him. He knew only one thing. He was taking her down to his lair where no one could touch her, where she was safe. With him.</p><p>Raphael leaned against the back of the elevator, his head next to Cyn\u2019s, whispering words of reassurance, of love, of entreaty, begging her to stay alive. He barely noticed the doors opening downstairs, barely registered his own movement as he crossed the room and laid her on the bed with exquisite care. He sank his fangs into his wrist, tearing open the vein which had already begun to close. Blood poured out and he held it over her mouth, urging her to drink. He reached out to her mind, but she was too weak, too far gone. He felt a wave of despair and shoved it ruthlessly aside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dragging his fingers through his own blood, he rubbed it over her lips, sliding his fingers into her mouth and massaging her gums. Her tongue touched his fingers instinctively, taking in even more of his blood. She swallowed at last, feebly, then coughed, and cried out in pain, tears leaking from beneath her closed eyelids.</p><p>Raphael felt his own face wet with tears. \u201cA little more, lubimaya,\u201d he whispered encouragingly. He widened the tear in his wrist, letting a few drops fall into her mouth and rubbing her throat gently. She swallowed again, more easily, her mouth opening eagerly as if some part of her understood, even in her unconscious state, that his blood would save her.</p><p>She swallowed once more, strongly this time, and he fed her a few more drops, murmuring to her the whole time, slipping into the fluid rhythms of his native Russian. Her chest rose in a deep breath and his heart soared . . . only to crash again when he began to remove her clothing and saw the true extent of her injuries.</p> <p>Her ribs were broken along her right side, her chest black and blue where the vest had protected her. But the vest could do only so much, and its protection had not extended below her waist. The assassin\u2019s bullets had torn into her stomach and belly, ripping apart her intestines, damaging so many vital organs. Saephan had been worried about blood loss, but Raphael knew that was the least of it. Infection was already spreading through her damaged body, its heat like a malicious beacon taunting him.</p><p>Anyone else would have been dead already. Only her connection to him, fortified by the blood she took from him almost daily, had given her the strength to survive this long.</p><p>But his Cyn was not immortal. The blood they shared made her seem so to those who didn\u2019t understand. But for all their closeness, for all that she was life itself to him, the reality was they had not been together for long\u2014less than a year, which was not long enough for her to have more than a minimal healing ability. A hundred years from now, she would be virtually immortal, but even then she would still need his assistance to heal something this devastating.</p><p>A spike of pristine fury stabbed him in the gut. He wanted to tear down the walls of his so-called civilized existence, to destroy every human who had dared to harm her, to lay waste to their foolish little town and leave every one of them bleeding and broken for the buzzards to feast upon.</p><p>Cyn moaned softly and Raphael jerked back to awareness, cursing himself. She had felt the strength of his anger and reacted to it. It had hurt her. He had hurt her. He wiped the tears from her eyes and lay down next to her, pulling her gently into the curve of his body, tugging the covers up around them. Ignoring everything else, everyone else, he sank into the depths of his power and pulled Cyn in with him. He would heal her. She would survive. Or they would die together.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Sophia woke with a start, a howl of raw power still thundering in her head. She sat up, heart pounding with adrenaline, her own power roiling just beneath her skin. The sun wasn\u2019t down yet. She could feel it clinging to the horizon and yet she was awake. And she wasn\u2019t alone. Doors slammed open down the hall and footsteps pounded past. Voices were raised everywhere, shouting orders, demanding information.</p><p>Sophia closed her eyes and listened. Not to the voices of panic and confusion outside her door, but beyond to that ephemeral something which was the aura of power, the gift of Vampire.</p><p>She stretched out her senses as much as she dared in this unfamiliar place. She was a guest here, not welcome but tolerated. She had to be careful. A second wave of fury shook the walls, silencing the noise outside her door, sucking the breath from her lungs. She pressed a hand to her chest, drawing on her own power to insulate her from the anger and the pain that was all but oozing from the walls. Something had happened. Something terrible. Raphael was raging, his unbound wrath waking every vampire in the building, threatening to tear the walls down around them and causing the very air to vibrate for those with senses to feel it. She\u2019d never experienced such raw pain from one so powerful. And she dreaded to discover what could have caused it.</p><p>She dressed quickly, pulling a t-shirt and sweater over her head, stepping into her denims and jamming her feet into low boots. She yanked open her door, braiding her long hair as she ran, joining the guards and others who were hurrying in the same direction.</p><p>The great room upstairs was controlled chaos. She smelled blood, a lot of it. She turned her head, tracking the scent to a location on the far side of the room, near the hallway to Lord Raphael\u2019s private lair. Two of his vampire guards were removing a couch soaked in blood, another rolling up the rug which had lain before it. Across the way, a door stood open to the large room where she\u2019d met Raphael that first night and she saw Duncan standing just inside, talking to someone out of sight.</p> <p>She headed that way. Whatever it was that had happened, Duncan would know. No doubt her presence would be unwelcome, but at worst, he\u2019d ask her to leave. And at best, she would find out who was dead. Sophia hurried, determined to find out what had happened before Raphael\u2019s people had a chance to shut her out. This had to be connected somehow to the recent murders and to Lucien\u2019s disappearance. And she wanted to know whose blood had stained the couch red. She could think of no one but Raphael\u2019s mate who could trigger an outpouring of such agonized rage from the powerful vampire lord. But if Cynthia had been injured or if, God forbid, she was dying, how had it happened? And had Colin been with her?</p><p>She slowed down when she reached the tall double doors and slipped quietly inside the room. Duncan was there with his back to her, the mountainous Juro by his side. For the first time since she\u2019d arrived, the two were dressed in something less than sartorial perfection. Duncan had clearly pulled on the first thing at hand, a pair of worn sweatpants and a t-shirt, his feet still bare. Juro had managed shoes and a pair of dark slacks, but his plain white shirt was untucked and only half buttoned.</p><p>Neither acknowledged her presence, focusing instead on the third person in the room\u2014a human male who was speaking rapidly.</p><p>\u201cIt was bad, Duncan, as bad as I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t know if even Raphael can heal something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, do you know?\u201d Duncan asked intently.</p><p>The human shook his head, clearly frustrated. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask. Robbie called ahead, warning me they were coming in with her. When they arrived\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I think it was that local policeman\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColin?\u201d The name slipped out before Sophia could stop herself. She froze as everyone turned to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d Duncan said in a cool voice. He paused, then tilted his head slightly. \u201cJoin us. This is Doctor Peter Saephan, a valued member of Lord Raphael\u2019s staff.\u201d He gestured in her direction. \u201cSophia, Lucien\u2019s representative.\u201d</p><p>Sophia strode forward, nodding an acknowledgment. \u201cWhat about Colin?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWas he injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Saephan said, shaking his head. \u201cWell, not that I could see,\u201d he amended. \u201cI mean, he and Robbie were both scratched and bloodied, but I think most of the blood was Cyn\u2019s. Murphy was driving. Robbie was in the backseat with Cyn and . . . Ah, God, Duncan, when I opened that door and saw them . . .\u201d</p><p>When he looked up, his eyes were full of misery. \u201cThere was nothing I could do for her. Even with a full trauma unit, I don\u2019t know if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what you could, Peter,\u201d Duncan reassured him. \u201cAnd so did Robbie by bringing her directly here. Where\u2019s Robbie now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent him away. I was afraid of what Raphael would do when he saw her. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still at the gate,\u201d Juro interrupted. \u201cMurphy refuses to leave until he knows her condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Sophia said, keeping her voice every bit as emotionless as Duncan\u2019s.</p><p>Duncan turned that impersonal gaze on her once again, his face completely expressionless. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cJuro will walk you to the gate.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wanted to protest, to say she didn\u2019t need anyone walking her the hundred yards to the damn gate, but decided it wasn\u2019t worth arguing over. This was their compound and she\u2019d only lose.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d she responded impassively.</p><p>Colin forced himself to remain still, aware of the hostile gazes of the vampire guards who had poured out of the building right after Raphael went ballistic and now seemed to have doubled in number over the last few minutes. Robbie was crouched a few feet away, next to the wall, his head lowered into his hands. He\u2019d washed off most of the blood, using a garden hose near the garage. He\u2019d all but forced Colin to do the same, turning the water on him almost without warning. Colin had thought it inappropriate, a waste of time and effort. Until the vampire guards had shown up to replace their human counterparts. Until every one of them had stared hard at Robbie, nostrils flaring. They\u2019d paid less attention to Colin, but then he\u2019d had less blood to wash away. Robbie had been almost bathed in it.</p><p>Colin strode over to his Tahoe just for something to do. It was pretty much wrecked\u2014there were no windows left, except the windshield which was cracked, the body was riddled with bullet holes and the inside was soaking wet from the water they\u2019d used to wash away Leighton\u2019s blood. Not that it mattered. He didn\u2019t care about the damn truck. The only thing that mattered was whether she was dead or alive. And no one seemed able, or maybe willing, to tell him that.</p><p>He tightened his hands into impotent fists. It was hard standing around here when what he wanted to do was start looking for the person who\u2019d done this. That voice kept coming back, haunting him. He had to be wrong. It couldn\u2019t have been\u2014</p><p>The vampire guards suddenly stiffened to attention. Colin spun around as Raphael\u2019s huge Japanese security chief appeared out of the darkness, followed by\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello, Colin,\u201d Sophia said. Her face was utterly calm, her voice devoid of any emotion.</p><p>Colin just stared. This wasn\u2019t Sophie from the village. This wasn\u2019t even the seductress Sophia who\u2019d shown up at his house the other night. This was Sophia in her true vampire visage. Her usually warm brown eyes were frigid pools of black in the low light, her body held haughtily upright. He turned his gaze away, wondering which was her real face, or if any of them were. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robbie had risen from his misery-soaked crouch as soon as they appeared. He was standing in front of the big Sumo guy now, hands fisted tightly on his hips, as if to keep them from grabbing the vampire and shaking the truth out of him. \u201cHow is she, Juro? Is she alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Raphael,\u201d Juro responded. \u201cThat\u2019s all we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Sophia said with certainty. \u201cNone of us would be standing here if she\u2019d died.\u201d</p> <p>That made no sense to Colin, but it seemed to satisfy Robbie. He nodded and looked longingly up at the big house.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to leave, Rob,\u201d Juro\u2019s deep voice rumbled with surprising compassion. \u201cWe know you did all you could. Lord Raphael will know it, too.\u201d</p><p>Robbie looked up, his face filled with gratitude, but he shook his head. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have been there at all, Juro. It wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know her better than that,\u201d Juro insisted. And for the first time, Colin saw real emotion cross the huge vampire\u2019s face. It was the same expression he\u2019d seen on Robbie\u2019s face in that bloody car. The same thing he\u2019d seen on the faces of his buddies as they paced the sterile halls of military hospitals, waiting for word on whether they\u2019d be attending another funeral or cheating death one more time. It was a look he\u2019d seen on his own face in the mirror. They loved Leighton. Not as a lover, but as a friend, as a comrade-in-arms.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d Sophia\u2019s voice jerked him out of his contemplation of this new idea.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled slightly, acknowledging his rudeness. \u201cIf I could have a word with you?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d</p><p>Sophia gazed up into Colin\u2019s eyes. They looked almost gray in this low light, but they were blue\u2014a beautiful, crystalline blue that contrasted with the black hair now hanging wetly over his forehead. Black Irish, he\u2019d told her, and she\u2019d laughed at him, never having heard of such a thing before. He\u2019d grinned then, but he wasn\u2019t grinning now.</p><p>She gave a small sigh, trying to figure out the right way to talk to this man, this human who, despite their shared past, was a stranger in this place and time. He didn\u2019t seem to appreciate the danger he was in, and she suspected it was because he knew so little about vampires. What she\u2019d said a moment ago was absolutely true. If Raphael\u2019s mate died, nothing would save any of them. That much power unleashed in a storm of grief would wipe out everything for miles before the vampire lord even knew what he was doing. He would kill friend and foe alike, not discriminating in his blind need for revenge.</p><p>But even if Cynthia didn\u2019t die, there would be consequences. Colin and this other human, Robbie, had been with her when she was attacked. By Raphael\u2019s reasoning that would make them responsible for failing to protect her. Robbie, certainly\u2014he was some sort of bodyguard, after all. But Colin would be considered equally guilty by association. Raphael would remain with his mate through tonight at least. But when he finally emerged from his lair, he\u2019d be looking for someone to punish. He\u2019d hunt down those truly responsible, but his anger would begin with the first person at hand. And if she had anything to say about it, that person wouldn\u2019t be Colin.</p> <p>But how to convince Colin of that?</p><p>Aware of her vampire audience, particularly Juro, she turned her back on them and touched Colin\u2019s arm, urging him away from the group and across the driveway. It wouldn\u2019t stop Juro from hearing every word she said, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her face when she said it.</p><p>Colin surprised her by not shaking off her touch. He walked with her a few yards off the driveway and onto the grass. There wasn\u2019t much moonlight, but there were security lamps above the gate. And Colin seemed untroubled by the dark, his footsteps sure on the uneven lawn.</p><p>Careful to keep her back toward the gate and its vampires, she smiled up at him, a genuine smile of warmth and affection. He gave a little jerk of surprise at the change in her demeanor. He controlled it quickly, but she saw it. \u201cYou have very good night vision,\u201d she commented.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, as if trying to figure out her angle. But she didn\u2019t have an angle. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cYears of night ops. It stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she began, her hand still resting on his thickly muscled forearm, \u201cthere\u2019s something you need to understand about vampires, especially powerful ones like Raphael. Their\u2014\u201d She struggled for the word. \u201c\u2014aggression is very close to the surface. It\u2019s part of what makes them who they are, what they are. Their willingness to fight for what they want, to defend what is theirs. And nothing, Colin, nothing is more sacred to a vampire than his mate. I heard the report from the human doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s expression brightened immediately. \u201cYou talked to him? What\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled, marveling at the complexity of her human. Her human? Was that what he was? She sighed inwardly. \u201cHe told us she is very badly injured, that if she is to live, it will be Raphael who saves her.\u201d</p> <p>Colin shook his head in denial, a pained look on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that, Sophie. Everyone keeps saying Raphael can save her, but how?\u201d</p><p>A part of Sophia jolted with pleasure at his use of the nickname, but at the same time, she realized just how very little Colin knew about vampires. This wasn\u2019t just about the power and aggression of a vampire lord; it was the essence of Vampire itself. And how much could she share with him? The vampire community held certain truths close and for very good reason. One of the most tightly concealed, and most dangerous, of those truths was the healing power of vampire blood.</p><p>She studied the familiar face of the man in front of her, so clear to her vampire sight. He was a handsome man, her Colin, with a strong jaw and square chin. The slight creases around his eyes testified to his easy laughter, creases that hadn\u2019t been there ten years ago. She wondered if another woman had put those laugh lines on his face and felt a surge of jealousy.</p><p>The truth hit her like a jolt of electricity. She wanted him. Not for an hour or a night. She wanted him to be hers and no one else\u2019s. Despair followed close behind, the knowledge that she might have destroyed whatever affection he once held for her when she\u2019d made the decision to deceive him all those years ago.</p><p>Her jaw tightened determinedly. She couldn\u2019t change the past. But if she hoped for a future with him, only the truth would do now. He was still looking at her, waiting for an answer to his question.</p><p>\u201cVampire blood is very strong, Colin, especially that of an old and powerful vampire like Raphael. A vampire mating is based on the exchange of blood. Cynthia\u2019s human blood feeds him, but his blood keeps her healthy and young for as long as they are together. This is why most matings are between vampire and human. They sustain each other.\u201d</p><p>Colin was utterly focused on what she was saying. He was listening to every word, visibly taking it all in and storing it away, and she was forcefully reminded that Colin Murphy was more than a strong body, more than a highly skilled warrior. He had a first-class mind, as well.</p><p>But Sophia didn\u2019t want to say anything more about the healing properties of vampire blood, not in front of Juro and the others. She would answer all of his questions, but later, when they were alone.</p><p>Something in her expression must have warned Colin, because he cocked his head just a fraction and smiled slightly. \u201cSo he can save her life?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone can,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cWe won\u2019t know for some hours and probably not until after sunset tomorrow. He won\u2019t want to leave her side until she is completely stable, and perhaps not even then. I don\u2019t know them well, but even I can see how much he loves her, and she\u2019s important to these others, too,\u201d she added, indicating the vampires around the gate and especially Juro and Robbie. \u201cTheir loyalty speaks, at least in part, to their master\u2019s love for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying, Sophie? What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>She smiled gently. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to go home. It\u2019s not safe for you here. If\u2014if\u2014the worst happens, Raphael will go a little mad, at least for a time. That\u2019s why the doctor sent you and Robbie away in the first place. It\u2019s not safe, especially for humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Juro told Robbie he could stay, that it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Juro is correct. It is probably safe for tonight. But Robbie has friends here, powerful friends who will argue on his behalf, perhaps even protect him as much as possible. You only have me.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI will let you know immediately when we have news, good or bad,\u201d she quickly added. \u201cTrust me this much.\u201d</p><p>He was still studying her. Finally, he blew out a breath and looked away, shaking his head. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go home. But I\u2019m trusting you, Sophie.\u201d He met her gaze evenly. \u201cI\u2019m trusting you,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head once and spun on his heel, walking over to where Robbie still waited. Resting a hand on the other man\u2019s shoulder, he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going home to shower and change clothes. You\u2019re more than welcome to come with me. I have plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>Robbie looked from Colin to Sophia and back again. \u201cThanks. But I think I\u2019ll bunk here. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Colin\u2019s head swung around, pinning Sophia with those perfect blue eyes. \u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Colin pushed away from his computer and checked the time, just as he had every ten seconds since he\u2019d been back home. It was barely two a.m., but it had been hours since he\u2019d left the vamp compound and he was going a little stir crazy.</p><p>He\u2019d hosed down the inside of his Tahoe one more time, knowing if he left it as it was, it would attract every scavenger in the forest. He\u2019d washed away the remaining blood, balling up wet paper and bandages and throwing them in the secure trash bin behind his house. It had eaten up at least an hour\u2014an hour he hadn\u2019t spent sitting around waiting to hear from Sophia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He used up a bit more time with a hot shower, but showers just didn\u2019t take as long as they had before he\u2019d spent twelve years in the Navy. Unless he was showering with someone.</p><p>Which brought him right back to Sophia. And damn if he didn\u2019t still want her. It would have been easy if she\u2019d maintained that cool vampire persona she\u2019d thrown at him tonight. Or even if she\u2019d become someone completely different in the years since they\u2019d spent time together. But tonight, standing there in the dark with her hand on his arm, the years had fallen away and he\u2019d been back in that Central American village, with the heat and humidity, the smells of the jungle all around him, and the ebb and flow of Spanish teasing his ears.</p><p>Maybe he should just do her. A quick roll in the sack for old time\u2019s sake to get her out of his system. But it wouldn\u2019t be that easy with Sophie. It never had been. He\u2019d loved her. Hell, he\u2019d been planning that white picket fence with her. And now here she was back in his life.</p> <p>He heard a car in the driveway and turned, his bare feet slapping the wooden floor as he crossed to the front window. He snorted softly. Yeah, here she was. Back in his life.</p><p>Colin pulled the door open as the lights clicked off on the Lexus sedan she was driving. He was a little surprised Sophie knew how to drive at all. She hadn\u2019t when he\u2019d known her before. Not that he knew of, anyway. He scowled, reminded that he hadn\u2019t known as much about her as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>The light from the doorway spotlighted her as she closed the car door and started toward him. Her eyes caught the light at a weird angle, making them shine a rich amber gold for a moment. He blinked and it was gone.</p><p>He watched her face as she drew closer, searching for some sign of bad news. He didn\u2019t see any, but . . . \u201cLeighton?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo news. But in its own way, that\u2019s good. Duncan\u2014you know him, right? The blond vampire who\u2019s Raphael\u2019s lieutenant?\u201d She waited until he nodded. \u201cWell, Raphael is Duncan\u2019s Sire, the one who made him Vampire. They\u2019ve been together for more than two centuries, and they work very closely together. Duncan is also quite powerful in his own right, which means he is far more sensitive to Raphael\u2019s state of mind than anyone else, except perhaps Cynthia.\u201d</p> <p>Colin nodded impatiently. He appreciated the vamp history lesson, but what he really wanted to know was how Leighton was doing.</p><p>As if she knew his thoughts, Sophia explained. \u201cI tell you this so you\u2019ll understand the reliability of Duncan\u2019s assessment. He reports that Raphael has sunk into the depths of his power.\u201d She held up a hand, forestalling his next question. \u201cIt\u2019s a trance of sorts, a deep, almost meditative state. It permits him to block out all distraction, to focus only on the one thing he seeks, or in this case, the one thing he cares about, which is his mate. He is concentrating all of his considerable power on healing her, not just his blood, but the . . . magic you\u2019d call it that makes him a vampire lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it work?\u201d</p><p>She gave a grim smile. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to explain, Colin. I\u2019m sorry, it just is.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, he asked, \u201cDo you have this magic?\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised by his question. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s not just vampire lords, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it is directly proportionate to the individual vampire\u2019s power. Tell me, do you have something else to drive?\u201d</p><p>Lost in contemplation of vampire magic, Colin frowned at her question, then realized she was talking about his truck. \u201cRight,\u201d he said as his brain caught up with what he was seeing. He jumped off the porch, strode over to the Tahoe, and began slamming doors. \u201cThis baby is a total loss. I\u2019ll have to have it towed tomorrow and then go down to the city and rent something. Why?\u201d</p><p>Sophia sniffed discreetly and winced. \u201cIt smells of her blood. It would be best if you didn\u2019t drive it at all, not even to move it.\u201d</p><p>Colin rubbed a hand over his hair. \u201cIs the blood smell really that bad? Maybe I should tow it tonight, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s only because the blood is Leighton\u2019s that I mention it. Things are more unsettled than usual right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsettled how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Raphael succeeds in healing her, she\u2019ll be weak for some time. It will make him more protective of her than usual, and far more sensitive to the scent of her blood, especially on another man or his possessions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it. That\u2019s kind of freaky, you know. The whole blood scent thing.\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted them. \u201cOh, hey, I didn\u2019t mean to be offensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offended, Colin. I haven\u2019t so thoroughly forgotten my human origins that I can no longer remember what it was like.\u201d</p><p>They stood in awkward silence for a very long moment until Colin caved like the craven he was. \u201cSo. You want to come inside?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was big and full of gratitude. \u201cI would, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia walked past Colin and into the center of his living room. She could feel the tension in his powerful body and knew that, for all their easy banter, his feelings toward her were still ambivalent. Still, she considered it a victory that he could have a casual conversation with her at all.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay long,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI just needed to get away for a while. Everything is so tense over there, everyone on tenterhooks waiting for word, and I\u2019m a stranger to them. All of the vampires traveling with Raphael are of his own making, including his entire security detail and all of the additional troops he brought in once the murders were discovered. They\u2019re fanatically loyal and they\u2019ve completely closed ranks around him during this tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that usual?\u201d Colin asked. \u201cI mean, for a vampire lord to be surrounded by his own . . . you know, the vampires that he made?\u201d</p><p>Sophia shrugged. \u201cVampire lords are not trusting of strangers, so, yes, the innermost circle is frequently composed of the lord\u2019s own children. But it\u2019s unusual for a vampire lord to have so many of his own children living so closely to him, especially since many of Raphael\u2019s people are quite powerful. I would guess that at least half of the vampires living at my Sire Lucien\u2019s headquarters in Vancouver were turned by someone else, although he does have an inner circle of his own progeny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others? The regular vampires, the ones who aren\u2019t vampire lords. What about their\u2014\u201d He stumbled over the word. \u201c\u2014children?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, smiling in amusement. \u201cIt\u2019s not like movies or television, Colin. Only a very few vampires are strong enough to sire another, and the vampire lords reserve that power to themselves, in any event.\u201d Her expression turned serious as she continued. \u201cAny vampire siring a child without permission would be severely punished, perhaps destroyed, depending on his master\u2019s wishes. It\u2019s a form of population control, you understand. Vampires are virtually immortal. Without restrictions, the population would soon grow too numerous.\u201d</p><p>Since she had no intention of telling him why too many vampires would be a problem\u2014because they\u2019d quickly outgrow their food source, i.e., humans\u2014she turned away, strolling over to sit on one of the bar stools drawn up to the counter between the living room and kitchen. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not one of Raphael\u2019s children, and with everyone on edge, tempers are flaring. The last thing I need is to get into some sort of pissing contest with one of his vampires.\u201d</p><p>Colin crossed the room, coming close enough that she could feel the heat of his body, could smell the strong masculine scent of his skin. He had a shirt on, but it was unbuttoned and his faded denims hung low on narrow hips. Her fingers itched to stroke a line down his chest and over his abdomen, to feel the hard ridges of muscle there and drag her nails along the arrow of dark hair that disappeared beneath the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>For his part, Colin seemed unaware of how attractive he was to her at that moment, reaching past her to snag an open bottle of beer from the bar before sitting on the stool next to hers. \u201cIgnoring the pissing analogy for now,\u201d he said, \u201ccould you take \u2018em?\u201d He started to take a drink, then paused and said, \u201cI mean if one of the vamps started something, could you, know, win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Sophia said, frowning at his total obliviousness to her desire.</p><p>Colin grinned. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened to a scowl. \u201cYes, really. And I know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s what they all think. The little woman, so pretty, so fragile. I\u2019d expect Raphael\u2019s people to know better, at least. They accept Cynthia for what she is, after all.\u201d She flicked a hand in disgust. \u201cBut vampires are like some sort of primitive throwback. Granted, some of them were born a very long time ago when women were little more than chattel, but many of them weren\u2019t, and still they\u2019re all testosterone and thumping chests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m personally rather fond of my testosterone,\u201d Colin commented casually.</p><p>Sophia laughed, her eyes going wide with surprise as her hand flew up to cover her mouth. She felt her cheeks flushing, which was something that rarely happened to her anymore.</p><p>She dropped her gaze, her hands brushing needlessly at her black denim-clad thighs. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she said, still not looking at him. \u201cI could take most of them. Although, probably not Duncan. And not if they ganged up on me, but one-on-one, I\u2019d do all right. I am Lucien\u2019s most powerful living child, you know. I doubt that\u2019s what he intended when he turned me, but here I am.\u201d</p><p>She grew quiet, thinking about the missing Lucien and the very real possibility that she could be in battle for control of his territory before too long.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>She looked up and realized she\u2019d been quiet for too long. \u201cSorry. I was thinking about something. The point is,\u201d she said, returning to their conversation. \u201cEven if I could win, I don\u2019t want to fight anyone. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin took another sip of beer, then laughed. \u201cLittle Sophie, big bad vamp,\u201d he teased and then froze, staring at her.</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t have to hear his thoughts to know he was remembering why he shouldn\u2019t be hanging around talking to her\u2014or God forbid, laughing with her. She saw it in his striking blue eyes. But she also saw the tug-of-war going on behind them. He wanted to do those things. He wanted her.</p><p>He stood suddenly, setting his beer bottle on the bar with a loud clunk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being rude. You want a drink or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got pretty much everything,\u201d he continued, walking around the bar and into the kitchen. \u201cOr I can make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He stood with his back to her, his hands flat against the refrigerator door. He was silent a long time and then he turned around and looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think we do, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to. Please.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted into a scowl. \u201cGive me a reason, Sophie. Tell me something that can wash away the lies and make me believe in you again, something to make me believe you\u2019re the woman I was in love with ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart thudded in her chest. She could hear it even if he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d never told her he loved her, not back then. Although she\u2019d known it anyway. It was difficult not to read a man\u2019s mind when you were making love to him, when he was buried inside your body, bringing you more pleasure, more joy, that you\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>And she\u2019d already promised herself that she\u2019d tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI was frightened,\u201d she said simply.</p> <p>Colin jerked back. \u201cBullshit. I never did anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of you, Colin. Never of you. That was part of the problem. You were . . .\u201d She shook her head in amazement. \u201cPerfect. Too good to be true. You were kind, generous, funny. A wonderful lover and so vicious in protecting me from the slightest threat.\u201d She smiled, her thoughts going back to the time they\u2019d spent together.</p><p>Colin huffed a dismissive breath. \u201cIt probably seems stupid now,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you hardly needed me to protect you, but I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up. \u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cNo, Colin. It was never stupid. It was lovely.\u201d Her smile fell away. \u201cAnd I knew it couldn\u2019t last. I was a vampire. Even worse, I was a vampire living alone. Lucien had sent me away. Not harshly, and not without affection, but I couldn\u2019t go back to Vancouver. Not then. So I moved from country to country. I was still pledged to Lucien, and no other vampire was going to let me live in his territory for long when I was pledged to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not do whatever it is you all do? Find a new lord or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Lucien. I still do.\u201d Sophia saw Colin\u2019s eyes narrow unhappily at this and felt a little thrill of hope.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cThis guy throws you out and you still love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Lucien is my Sire. We were lovers once, centuries ago when he first made me, but not since then. It would be almost unnatural if we were to become lovers now.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it. I don\u2019t know if I have the words for something that is ingrained in every cell of what I am, what he made me, what he gave me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that, Soph?\u201d</p><p>Sophia stared at Colin and wondered if she could go back to that horrible place even for him. Her chest ached at the thought of reliving those terrible times. Almost as much as it did at the thought of losing Colin forever.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cMy father was a very wealthy man,\u201d she began. \u201cMy older brothers had all fallen to disease or warfare before I was ten. I was his only living child, his heir. My only virtue, the sole reason for my existence in my father\u2019s eyes, was my ability to produce a grandson to replace his dead sons. By the time I was thirteen and starting to grow breasts, we were entertaining suitors every night of the week. I say we, but no one cared what I thought. I was trotted out like one of his show horses and then sent back to my rooms. I wasn\u2019t even permitted to eat at the table.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stood and began pacing. None of these were good memories, but the next part . . . the next part was so painful, so powerful, it could still bring her to her knees. She paused and glanced over to where Colin was watching her, waiting. She turned away and started talking. \u201cI was married at sixteen to a man I detested.\u201d</p><p>1755 \u2013 Southern Spain</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hot, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Sophia turned from the doorway where she\u2019d been enjoying the fresh scents of the garden, hoping for a cool breeze. It had been hours since the sun had set on yet another scorching day, and still the air was warm, the breeze almost nonexistent. She stepped carefully in the near darkness, making her way over to the makeshift bed where her two young sons lay next to each other.</p><p>\u201cI know, Teo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She sat down, hearing the wooden frame creak beneath her weight. Teo, the oldest by less than a year, gazed up at her, his dark eyes gleaming in the dim light of the single lantern.</p><p>\u201cIt should cool down soon.\u201d She smoothed sweat-soaked hair away from his forehead, high and elegant like his father\u2019s. Both of her sons resembled their father, which was only natural, she supposed. Although she would have liked to see something of herself in them, maybe around the eyes or the shape of their chins? But no, they were each the very image of their father. And he was a handsome enough man, for all that he was a pig.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Papa?\u201d Her younger son\u2019s face popped up over his brother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She smiled fondly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be home soon, Miguelito.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay here with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, beb\u00e9. I will never leave you. Now sleep. I\u2019ll sing you a song.\u201d</p><p>She sang softly, sitting with them until they\u2019d drifted off to sleep, so tired from their busy little boy days that not even the heat could keep them awake for long. She only wished she was so fortunate. The heavy layers of clothing she was forced to wear, even here in the privacy of her gardens, were stifling. The lacings were so tight she sometimes thought she\u2019d suffocate before the sweltering heat could take her. On a normal evening, she\u2019d have retired to her rooms and removed the binding clothes by now. But her little ones were so uncomfortable with the temperature in the house, despite its thick walls, and the gardens were green and welcoming.</p><p>She stood with a long sigh, walking over to the doorway and its feeble breeze. A light moved on the second floor of the main house and her lips tightened in irritation. Her husband had come home at last, finally leaving the bed of that French whore Alberto Alejandro had married last winter. Unfortunately, Alberto had dropped dead soon after, leaving his young wife a penniless widow in a strange country, without even the money to go home in disgrace, which was all she deserved.</p><p>One might have felt sorry for the woman had she possessed a scrap of virtue. But having lost one husband, she\u2019d set her sights on Sophia\u2019s husband Teodosio, who was far from penniless. Or so the whore thought. She was too stupid to understand that Teodosio would never leave Sophia, not even for a beautiful French whore. Not because he loved Sophia, but because he loved the money and lands she\u2019d inherited from her father. An estate which was vested in her sons, not her husband. If Teodosio abandoned Sophia, he would be just as penniless as his whore.</p><p>She watched as the balcony doors opened and her husband stepped outside, clearly seeking the same nonexistent breeze as she had earlier. He glanced down at the summer cottage where his sons slept and paused. Perhaps his eyes met hers. It was too dark to know, but he knew she was watching him. He turned without a word or gesture and went back inside.</p><p>A wave of pure, bright hatred swept over Sophia, leaving her shaking in its wake. Hatred for her father who\u2019d married her off to a man she despised. Hatred for her husband who hadn\u2019t touched her since the birth of their second son. Not that she cared about sharing a bed with him. Many husbands and wives lived separate lives, especially those with estates to consider. But most at least played the game of courtesy, keeping their affairs discreet. Not Teodosio. The French whore was only the latest of his indiscretions and would not be the last. He would tire of her as he had the others, while Sophia bore her embarrassment in silence.</p><p>She spun back into the garden cottage, a flimsy structure with open half walls and a thatched roof, meant for picnics and children\u2019s games. Her sons had thought it a great adventure to sleep out here these last few nights. She smiled, remembering. They were the joy of her life, her treasures. Not even their pig of a father could destroy that.</p><p>She crossed over to the pitcher of water she\u2019d had a servant bring out before retiring. The water had been cool then, fresh from the well. She tipped it over, pouring out the last few drops and remembered she\u2019d used much of it to bathe their little faces before sleep. She made an impatient noise, thinking they were very likely to wake again during the night, asking for water and she\u2019d have none.</p><p>She could wake one of the servants to get it for her, but the well was only in the courtyard on the other side of the kitchens. It seemed pointless to wake them for such a small thing, especially when she was up and certainly strong enough to do it herself.</p><p>Sophia checked each of her sons one more time, smiling at Teo\u2019s sprawl of sleep, while Miguelito lay quiet and tucked in against his brother\u2019s back like a mouse. She picked up the pitcher and walked into the gardens, heading for the courtyard.</p><p>She met no one as she passed through the kitchens and back outside to the big well in the center of the courtyard. The wooden cover was half open, the bucket sitting on the edge. It made a flat slapping noise on the water when she dropped it inside, and she leaned over idly, staring down into the dark depths until the rope tightened, telling her the bucket was full. Straightening, she took hold of the crank and began turning it to bring the bucket back up again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard the shouting first. Leaning over to grasp the bucket as it rose over the lip of the well, she frowned. With the heat, Cook had been waking earlier than usual and it was nearly time for the kitchen drudges to be up lighting the fires on the big ovens. Had they discovered mice in the flour again?</p><p>She picked up her pitcher and started back through the courtyard, only to be nearly bowled over by men racing past her with buckets hanging from every hand. And then she smelled the smoke.</p><p>She dropped the pitcher, jumping over its wet shards as she ran for the gardens, visible now through the open kitchen doors. Golden light flickered among the green shadows, as if a million candles danced at once. Sophia was screaming before she reached the doorway, clawing her way through the clusters of terrified servants, knocking aside any who tried to stop her.</p> <p>The cottage was on fire, its straw thatch a torch in the night. She registered the image as she shoved through the chaos, her heart thundering in her chest, her brain shrieking at her to hurry, even as her heart told her God would not be so cruel, that she was a good Catholic who honored her Church, who donated generously and never missed an observance. God would not take her beautiful babies, not her boys.</p><p>She raced toward the conflagration, searching the huddled servants as she did so, looking for her children, listening for their voices. Someone called out and she turned, relief like a rush of wind blowing through her soul. She scanned the faces all around and found her husband, Teodosio, his face a stricken mask of grief that stole his handsome features and turned them into something grotesque.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d he said, his voice breaking as he reached out to her.</p><p>She backed away from him, shaking her head, somehow believing if she never heard the words, she would never have to know the awful truth.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d he repeated, grasping her arms, pulling her against his chest in a mockery of comfort.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She pounded his chest, pushing him away.</p><p>A loud whooshing sound spun her around in time to see the flames twist suddenly higher, sending a shower of sparks to catch on the trees. Sophia screamed and raced toward the fire. Her children were in there, why was no one saving them? Why was their useless father weeping instead of braving the flames in search of her sons?</p><p>The heat hit her like a wall, shriveling the small hairs on her skin, burning her hands and face before she\u2019d come within ten feet of it. She would have gone farther, would have run into the fire itself, but strong arms grabbed her, holding her tightly, turning her away from the intense flames.</p><p>Sophia fought, shrieking, kicking, clawing at the hands that held her. \u201cCh\u00e9rie, Sophia, no. It\u2019s too late.\u201d His voice was a soothing murmur of foreign words, his hands never easing their grip no matter how hard she fought.</p><p>The roof caved in without warning. Embers flew and servants shrieked, running after the smaller fires, lest the house catch and the entire estate burn down. Not that Sophia cared. She watched in despair, her eyes cloudy with tears and ash, her breath coming in sobs as she fought to breathe in a world that had lost all meaning.</p><p>The arms holding her relaxed slightly, lowering her until her feet touched the ground. She twisted, looking up to see the face of a stranger, blackened with soot from the flames, tears carving pale streaks down smooth cheeks.</p> <p>Overwhelming grief drove Sophia to her knees. Her heart seized in her chest and she welcomed the agony. She drew breath to scream, but her lungs couldn\u2019t find the air, and she welcomed that, too. Why should her heart beat, her lungs bellow when her children, her beautiful babies, were gone? She raked her nails down her face and felt warm blood welling, replacing the tears she couldn\u2019t shed. She found her voice at last, but it was only to keen like an animal, rocking back and forth, clutching herself against a pain beyond any other.</p><p>She heard nothing of the servants or the villagers who had come running to help fight the fire which threatened everyone should it get it out of hand. Their shouts and cries, the distant panicked screams of the horses, footsteps running as bucket after bucket of water was thrown into the greedy maw of flame\u2014all of it was meaningless noise. Her mind was filled instead with the sweet voices of her children, with their laughter and songs. She saw no reason to listen to anything else . . . until a woman\u2019s voice pierced the night, shrieking curses.</p><p>Sophia froze, her head swiveling to one side to listen. Men\u2019s voices were shouting angrily, the woman\u2019s outraged screams rising above them.</p><p>\u201cDon Teodosio,\u201d one of the men shouted. \u201cWe found this one running away!\u201d</p><p>Sophia heard the gasps all around. She stood and saw her husband glaring down at his whore of a lover. The woman was blackened with smoke, her hair seared away in places, but it was her hands that drew everyone\u2019s attention. They were reddened and burned, covered in blisters.</p><p>Sophia raised her gaze to Teodosio\u2019s look of horrified realization. She shrieked wordlessly, running the short distance and grabbing the whore by her hair, yanking at it in great handfuls until the men pulled them apart. Teodosio wrapped his arms around Sophia, whispering her name over and over again like a prayer for forgiveness.</p><p>Sophia howled and spun on him, reaching up and slapping his face. She had no forgiveness to give. \u201cYou did this,\u201d she snarled furiously, her face crumpling in grief. \u201cYou murdered your own sons.\u201d Her voice broke on the last, sobs replacing her words as she turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, Sophia, please, I had no\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Sophia didn\u2019t hear the rest of his denials. She went back to the fire and dropped to her knees, not to pray, but to bear witness to the death of her children.</p><p>They\u2019d buried her babies the next day. Their small bodies had been taken from the charred hulk of the cottage and swathed in white linen while Sophia lay in bed, drugged into unconsciousness by a well-meaning physician who\u2019d thought to spare her the sight of all that was left of her sons. She\u2019d stood on the dry hillside, listening to the priests mutter their empty words in fervent voices of how her children had been called to God, how their great destinies had just begun. But Sophia had no use for a God who would do this, who would permit a worthless French whore to murder innocent children. She\u2019d turned away from them and their prayers, turned away from her faithless husband and walked into the hills, waiting for death to find her.</p><p>Death hadn\u2019t come. But Lucien had.</p><p>Three days later the heat broke at last. Sophia stood once more over the graves of her sons and felt the night\u2019s cool breeze blowing across the parched hills. She thought how Teo and Miguelito would have laughed to feel it and smiled sadly. There would be no more little boy laughter in her life.</p><p>Shouts arose from the estate house behind her. She looked over her shoulder and saw lantern lights moving out of the gates, toward the hillside where she stood alone with the souls of her sons. Her piggish husband had discovered her absence again and was no doubt screaming at the servants to find her.</p><p>The lights were drawing closer. She turned her back on them, whispered a final farewell to her children, and walked into the darkness.</p><p>He was waiting for her there\u2014Lucien, the stranger who had held her as the cottage burned, who\u2019d saved the life she no longer wanted to live. He\u2019d been waiting for her that first night, when she\u2019d snuck up onto this hillside, intending to bleed out her own life onto the graves of her sons. He\u2019d kept the knife from her wrist and held her while she wept, sobbing out her grief to a stranger in a way she hadn\u2019t until then. There hadn\u2019t been anyone else she\u2019d trusted enough to do so.</p><p>And then he had told her he could make it go away\u2014the pain, the awful, wrenching loss, the emptiness that would never be filled. They would have to leave, he warned her, to travel far away, farther than she\u2019d ever gone before, than she\u2019d ever dreamed of going. Sophia had begged him to do it. She\u2019d been ready to leave immediately, that very moment, if necessary. After all, what reason did she have to stay? But Lucien had insisted she wait. She had to be sure, he said. Because, once accepted, what he was offering could not be undone.</p><p>Sophia had been certain from the moment he first spoke, but he would not be moved. Until tonight. This would be their third meeting and he\u2019d promised her they would leave tonight.</p><p>\u201cSophia.\u201d His voice was warm and rich, like heated rum on a winter\u2019s night.</p><p>\u201cLucien,\u201d she said softly, her own voice full of relief. \u201cTonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTonight, ch\u00e9rie. If you are certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Lucien, please.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and he was beautiful. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked in surprise. She\u2019d been so lost in the past that she\u2019d forgotten where she was. She looked around blearily, as if she\u2019d just awakened. She was still standing, her legs aching with tension, her arms crossed and hugging herself tightly. Colin was near the bar, half sitting on one of the tall bar stools.</p><p>Sophia closed her eyes again, her chest aching and hollow. Even now, after centuries had passed, her loss was as fresh as if it had happened yesterday.</p><p>Colin stood, coming closer. \u201cSophie?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou said Lucien took away the memories,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>She met his gaze for a moment, seeing the same warm compassion there that she\u2019d seen in Lucien\u2019s eyes so long ago. And she thought neither man would be pleased with the comparison.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave them back to me after awhile. He told me the story, as if it had happened to someone else and asked me what I\u2019d do. I told him I couldn\u2019t imagine a mother not wanting to remember her own children, and so he gave them back to me. Not only the memory of their deaths, but of their lives, too. All those wonderful moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you leave Spain right away after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually. For all his debauchery, Lucien is very practical about certain things. Most of the older vampires are, especially when it comes to retaining wealth. When my sons died, the estate came back to me, for my future children. My father was quite determined that only his blood would inherit. And Lucien had agents in place to handle such things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father\u2019s entire estate\u2014mine now\u2014was sold, the investments liquidated. At a considerable loss, I\u2019m certain, but we didn\u2019t care about that. Or Lucien didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t care about anything at that point. It took several months, and I had to make a few appearances before the authorities, but eventually it was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Frenchwoman? How did they punish murder back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they would have done,\u201d Sophia said dismissively. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave it to them. I killed her. She was my first.\u201d She glared at Colin, daring him to dispute her right to exact revenge on her children\u2019s killer.</p> <p>Colin\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. \u201cYou mean your first vampire kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago, Colin. Things were very different than they are now, especially for vampires.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a knowing smile. \u201cI\u2019m guessing not everyone you kill becomes a vamp, then. I can\u2019t imagine you giving that bitch immortality.\u201d</p><p>Sophia met his smile with a grin of her own. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I killed the whore outright, and I made sure she knew I was the one doing it, too.\u201d</p><p>Colin gave a sideways tilt of his head. \u201cSounds good to me. What about your husband? What happened to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea. I wanted to kill him, too, but Lucien wouldn\u2019t let me. Teodosio had no part in the deaths beyond lust and stupidity. And few men would be alive if that were a killing offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m offended,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>Sophie smiled wearily. The memories no longer had the power to make her weep, but the emotions were still powerful, the loss still keen, and it was exhausting to talk about it.</p><p>Colin stepped even closer, his body radiating heat like a furnace, the thump of his heart loud in the sudden quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you talk about it,\u201d he said. His hands hung loosely at his sides, fingers flexing over and over as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with them.</p><p>Sophia met his eyes. \u201cI wanted you to understand,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou asked for the reason I left, the reason I let you think I was dead that night.\u201d She reached up and gave into temptation, touching his cheek, letting her fingers linger on his lips when he surprised her by not pulling away. \u201cDo you know, I still hear that caf\u00e9 exploding in my dreams. I was blocks away and still the street buckled so hard I nearly fell. Everyone was screaming and I looked up and saw the flames and I knew. There were the rumors\u2014we\u2019d even talked about them, you and I\u2014that certain people were unhappy with the government, unhappy with foreigners suddenly appearing all over the country, and I knew they\u2019d attacked that damn caf\u00e9 and that you were in it.</p> <p>She shook her head, remembering. \u201cI ran as fast as I could, not bothering to be discreet or to hide my vampire otherness the way Lucien had taught me. When I reached the caf\u00e9 and I saw the flames . . . I was back in that garden all over again, watching fire take someone I loved. I nearly went in after you. I didn\u2019t know if I could survive it or not, but I didn\u2019t care. I just knew I couldn\u2019t live through that again. But then I saw you standing across the square. I saw your friend hanging onto you, dragging you away as you fought him, and I knew the Fates had given me a second chance.</p><p>\u201cI had lost my precious children. There was nothing I could do about that. But you were alive, Colin. Your life had been spared, and I wasn\u2019t going to ruin the chance I\u2019d been given, that you\u2019d been given, by dragging you into the drama of my life. I was a vagabond, traveling from place to place. I couldn\u2019t go back to the United States with you. The U.S. vampire lords would never have tolerated my presence. And we were never going to have that white picket fence you\u2019d talked about. There would be no children, no picnics on the beach in the sunshine. I had nothing to offer you but blood and darkness. So I let you walk away, and I told myself it was what the Fates wanted, that I\u2019d done the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Colin reached out at last, his arms tightening around her, his breath brushing against her hair when he asked, \u201cAnd what do you think now, Soph?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and spoke without lifting her head, afraid of what she\u2019d see in his face. \u201cI think I might have been wrong about what the Fates were telling me back then. Or maybe I just don\u2019t care anymore. You\u2019re the only man I\u2019ve ever loved, Colin Murphy, and I\u2019m tired of living without you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Colin swore softly under his breath, cursing himself for every kind of fool as his body reacted to Sophie\u2019s words. If what Leighton had told him about vampiric senses was true, Sophie probably already knew that his heart was thudding and his breathing was so fast he was almost hyperventilating. And she sure as hell couldn\u2019t miss the erection trying to bury itself in her soft belly.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She lifted her head to look up at him, her beautiful, brown eyes full of questions.</p> <p>\u201cI probably should have told you this earlier,\u201d he began. Her eyes grew wider and a little fearful, and he hurriedly added, \u201cI love you, darlin\u2019.\u201d He stroked the fingers of one hand down her soft cheek. \u201cI loved you then, and I\u2019ve never stopped.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, intending to kiss her gently, soulfully. Something appropriate to this special moment. But his body had its own ideas. His mouth touched her lips and raw desire swept over him, tightening his gut and hardening his cock like a steel rod. He\u2019d missed this for nearly ten years, missed Sophie, with her lush curves and tender mouth, her gorgeous breasts . . .</p><p>She moaned softly, her fingers tugging his hair and forcing him closer. He grinned against her lips. And, yeah, he\u2019d missed that, too.</p><p>His mouth never leaving hers, he swept her up into his arms, carried her into the bedroom and lowered her to the bed. Her fingers were scrabbling fitfully at his shirt and he shrugged out of it. She switched to his jeans, undoing the button and tugging at the zipper. He reached to unzip it himself, but paused to appreciate his Sophie, as she shimmied out of her tight jeans and tugged her sweater over her head.</p><p>He knew the fashion these days was for thin women with narrow hips and tiny asses. But that wasn\u2019t for him. He loved the feel of soft hips and a rounded belly beneath his fingertips, of succulent breasts crushed against his chest as he sank into a woman\u2019s warmth. In short, what he liked in a woman was Sophie.</p><p>She stretched out on his bed, preening beneath the heat in his eyes, proud of her curves and wearing nothing but lace, a matching set of panties and bra in warm pink that made her skin look flushed with health in the light of his single bedside lamp.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d Colin growled, his hands on the zipper of his jeans.</p><p>Sophie gave him a wicked grin. \u201cI will if you will,\u201d she purred, climbing up onto all fours and crawling across the bed toward him.</p><p>Colin watched her come, her large breasts threatening to spill out of their fragile confinement, her hips shifting enticingly with every movement. When she reached for his zipper, he grabbed her fingers, his eyes flashing up to meet hers.</p><p>She laughed, a low, sultry sound that took his breath away. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she promised and bent over to kiss his cock through the denim, giving him a tantalizing view of her perfect ass.</p><p>Colin fisted his fingers in the thick strands of her long hair as she slowly lowered his zipper. He groaned out loud when his cock was free at last, when Sophie\u2019s delicate hands brushed against his hips as she pushed his pants down to his thighs.</p><p>He twisted her hair in his hands, holding it back from her face so he could watch as she began licking him slowly, twining her tongue around his cock, her fingers reaching beneath him to cradle his balls. He sucked in a hard, fast breath when she took him in her mouth, when she tilted her gaze upward to watch his reaction as she began to move up and down, his cock sliding in and out between her plump lips. He began to move his hips slowly, going deeper into her mouth and throat with each thrust.</p><p>His cock touched the back of her throat and Sophie moaned hungrily, the sound vibrating along his shaft like a tuning fork. Colin closed his eyes and began thrusting harder, his sac tightening beneath the caress of her fingers, her tongue stroking him as her mouth sucked harder and faster.</p><p>Colin groaned. He wanted to fuck her, wanted to be inside her and he\u2019d never\u2014</p><p>Jesus Christ!</p><p>Sophie ran a fingernail along the taut skin of his sac, a sharp, intense pain that sent every one of his senses into overdrive. He gave a hoarse shout as all thought disappeared, as every nerve ending suddenly centered on his cock and the need to come now. His orgasm roared through his body, boiling out of his balls and down his cock in a rush of pure, heated pleasure. Sophie drank it all in, her fingernails digging into his ass as she held onto him, as she kept him from flying apart.</p><p>Sophie twirled her tongue around Colin\u2019s softening cock, smiling as he shuddered one more time. His fingers were still wrapped in her hair, but they were massaging gently now as his big body relaxed one muscle at a time.</p><p>She pulled back with a final lick, coming up onto her knees. He wrapped his arms around her, burying his face against her neck, kissing gently, moving up her jaw to her mouth. His hands dropped to her bottom, squeezing softly.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most perfect ass,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo do you.\u201d She kissed him lightly, biting playfully at his lips. \u201cIf you show me yours, I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head sharply, blue eyes hot and intent. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Sophie trailed her fingers across his broad, muscled shoulders and down his arms, loving the hard feel of him. She moved back a few inches and sank down onto her heels, caressing herself, her hands moving slowly over her lace-covered breasts, down past her narrow waist to the fullness of her hips, along the outside of her thighs. Colin\u2019s gaze followed every movement, narrowing as she dipped her fingers to the inside of her thighs and spread her knees wide, smoothing her hands sensuously along her tender skin and over the pretty triangle of lace covering her sex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes lingered between her legs, suddenly snapping up to meet hers. \u201cI want you naked, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled lazily, gliding her tongue along her upper lip as she lowered first one bra strap and then the other, feeling the heat of Colin\u2019s rapt attention as he watched her breasts slowly begin to overflow the lacey cups. She reached behind her and unfastened the clasp, letting it fall forward, feeling the accustomed rush of pleasure as her breasts were freed, glancing up and gasping as the hunger in Colin\u2019s eyes tightened her nipples and left her aching with need.</p><p>Her hands were trembling slightly when she tossed the bra to one side, shaken by what she saw when Colin looked at her. He wanted her. She knew that. But the strength of his lust, the sheer intensity of it . . . that rattled her. She had grown accustomed to her young men in Rio, the human toys she played with for a while and then cast aside, lovers who were completely dominated by her needs and wants. And she realized abruptly that Colin was not that kind of man. He was alpha down to his core, and he was eyeing her the way a lion eyes a particularly tasty gazelle.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she started, but he interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of it, Sophie,\u201d he growled. \u201cTake it all off.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and hooked her fingers into her panties, tugging them down her hips. But Colin didn\u2019t wait. He shoved his jeans and underwear down his legs, stepping out of them and onto the bed in a single movement. She fell backwards as he stripped her panties down her legs and over her feet, his big hands stroking up her calves and between her thighs, spreading her wide. But he didn\u2019t stop there. He ran his fingers over the silky bare skin of her mound, humming to himself with a pleased smile as he slipped two fingers between her swollen folds and, tormenting her with her own slick heat, bared her completely beneath his gaze. He looked up then with a wicked glint in his eye.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sophia bucked as his mouth fastened on her clit, sucking until it throbbed hungrily, every stroke of his tongue sending a jolt of unbelievable desire through her body\u2014a shock of electricity that left her trembling perpetually on the edge of climax. Had any man ever pleasured her so? Had she let them? She shrieked out loud as he drove the same two fingers he\u2019d been stroking her with deep inside her at the exact moment his teeth grazed her tingling clit. His fingers began to thrust in and out slowly and she pushed against them, desperate for the orgasm she could feel building in every inch of her body, in her breasts which were full and aching, in her womb which seemed to throb with the need to orgasm. She grabbed Colin\u2019s hair, pressing his mouth against her more tightly, afraid she would die the true death if he didn\u2019t release her soon.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she gasped, then groaned wordlessly.</p><p>His tongue swept lazily along her slit, teasing her with quick brushes against her pulsing clit. He slid his fingers out from inside her and sucked them noisily, drinking in her wetness and watching her the entire time. \u201cYou taste good, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d she practically shrieked at him.</p><p>He laughed! But then he sobered almost immediately, becoming preternaturally intent as he raised himself up over her body, his hips spreading her legs even wider, his big, hard cock sliding back and forth in the aching wetness between her thighs. \u201cIs this what you want, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sophia nodded, nearly sobbing with relief. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her legs tightly around his hips, her fingers digging into his arms, holding him close lest he think to torment her further.</p><p>Colin drew back slightly and reached down, positioning his cock at her entrance. He looked up and met her eyes, holding her gaze while he slammed his full, hard, wonderful length deep inside her.</p><p>Sophia screamed as she came hard, her vaginal walls convulsing around his shaft, the orgasm rippling up to her womb and into her breasts, tightening her nipples and sending ripples of exquisite eroticism throughout her body. She thrust against him almost violently, unable to control her need to feel more\u2014the rough scrape of his chest hair against her sensitive breasts, the thickness of his cock as he stretched her wider with every thrust, the tautness of his arms as he held himself over her, his powerful thighs and ass pumping his hard shaft deep inside her like a piston.</p><p>Sophia wrapped her arms around him, raking her nails down his back, feeling the warm blood beneath her fingertips. Colin threw his head back, groaning as he thrust harder. She pulled him closer, wanting the touch of his mouth, his kiss.</p><p>Their lips met in a hard, hungry kiss, teeth clashing, tongues battling each other in a frenzy of mating. She bit his lip, drawing her first taste of his blood. Heat zinged through her veins, that tiny sip like molten lava, racing to her heart and sealing her fate. Colin Murphy was hers and she would kill anyone who tried to take him from her.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Sophie,\u201d he murmured against her mouth, his blood still fresh on his lips. \u201cLet me feel you come all over my cock.\u201d</p><p>As if his words were a psychic trigger, Sophia\u2019s entire body shook with orgasm, every muscle, every nerve responding to his demand. She moaned, overwhelmed with sensation, crying out as ripples of pleasure rolled over her like a tidal wave, tossing her back and forth as she hung on to him for dear life. Her thighs squeezed his hips as she bucked beneath him, her inner walls caressing his cock, trapping him inside her until he surrendered, throwing his head back and roaring as he joined her in ecstasy, his climax a heated rush against her trembling womb.</p><p>Colin collapsed against Sophie, her soft, full breasts a sweet cushion against his chest. The image of those breasts with their large swollen nipples, plump and straining for his mouth, sent a pulse of fresh desire straight to his groin, taunting his drained cock with impossible ideas. He groaned and shifted sideways, taking his weight off Sophie and pulling her against his side. She responded limply, one arm falling over his chest as if she didn\u2019t have the strength to lift it.</p><p>He smiled in what he recognized as pure, male satisfaction and dropped his arm down her back to cup that spectacular ass. Another shock of desire stabbed his groin, this one causing his cock to twitch weakly. The guy might be drained, but he was recovering.</p> <p>\u201cI can hear you gloating,\u201d Sophie murmured around a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gloating,\u201d Colin responded. \u201cI\u2019m planning for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Sophie protested dramatically. \u201cIs there no satisfying you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>Sophie lifted her head to smile at him, kissing her way down his chest. He rolled slightly, wrapping her in both arms. Her hands slid around his back and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cScratches, I think,\u201d he said, suddenly aware of the distant pain. \u201cThey\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>Sophie sat up, staring intently at the blood on her hand. She shifted her gaze to meet his. \u201cI can make them heal faster.\u201d</p><p>Colin swallowed hard. Her eyes had taken on that weird amber glow again, and his sex-addled brain finally clicked on what it meant. She was a vampire. And he was bleeding. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy blood can heal you,\u201d she said, completely calm. \u201cNot just the scratches, but all of these as well.\u201d She touched the nicks and cuts he\u2019d acquired in the gun battle that had nearly taken Leighton\u2019s life. She met his gaze again. \u201cAnd anything else, Colin. If you take my blood, you\u2019ll feel ten years younger.\u201d</p><p>Colin blinked. \u201cIs that what you were talking about back at the compound? About Raphael healing Leighton? You mean he can literally heal her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you didn\u2019t see how bad she was, Soph. She was gut shot. There was blood everywhere. I didn\u2019t really expect her to make it back to the compound alive. Can vampires heal something that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the vampire is powerful enough, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s true, why isn\u2019t vampire blood the new wonder drug? Every researcher in the country could use something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would happen to us? To the vampires?\u201d Sophie asked gently. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what humans are capable of. What do you think your leaders would do if they learned about our blood? They\u2019d lock us away in a heartbeat. Or they\u2019d try.\u201d She brushed back his sweat-dampened hair. \u201cNo, Colin. This is one secret every vampire alive respects. Or they die. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are exceptions, meu querido. People we trust.\u201d She shifted, pushing him over onto his back and going up onto all fours as she bent to lick at the sweat on his chest, biting his flat nipples gently. He wound his fingers through her long hair and tugged her head back, meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take my blood, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>She stilled, studying him in that intense way a predator watches its prey. Her tongue swept out and across her upper lip and he saw the first hint of her fangs, white tips barely visible below her gums. Her eyes changed, their color once again a brilliant amber that left humanity behind. She drew a long, slow breath, her nostrils flaring as they took in his scent.</p><p>\u201cI can smell it,\u201d she said in a low, sensuous purr. \u201cThe scent of your blood is intoxicating. Think of the most delicious aroma you\u2019ve ever encountered, baking bread, chocolate, a bubbling stew\u2014all of that and more. It\u2019s not just blood, Colin, it\u2019s your blood. And, oh, yes, I want it.\u201d</p><p>Colin drew in a deep, hard breath. Adrenaline spiked, but it wasn\u2019t fear. Or not only fear. He\u2019d have to be nuts not to be a little intimidated by the idea of someone biting into him and drinking his blood. But it was more than that. It was lust, pure and simple. Damn if he wasn\u2019t turned on by the idea. And if that made him a sick fuck, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>The amber glow of Sophie\u2019s eyes amped up, like turning on a flood lamp. She opened her mouth and her fangs slid into full view, white and gleaming. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cDo it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled slowly and stretched out on top of him, sliding her satiny smooth mound over and around his cock, enticing him, as if he needed anymore enticement. Her nipples scraped against his chest as she buried her face against his neck. Her breath was hot, her tongue a stroke of wetness along the side of his neck. His heart was racing faster than in the worst firefights he\u2019d ever endured. He rebelled against the fear, reminding himself this was Sophie. He began to thrust gently beneath her and she groaned against his neck. He felt something hard and blunt scrape over the skin below his jaw, heard her indrawn breath.</p><p>Ecstasy. His cock hardened instantly, unbelievably. Sophie was straddling him, her legs on either side of his hips, her silky hair draped over his chest. He could feel the tug of her mouth, the slick glide of her fangs as she took his blood. And he felt a kick of desire like nothing he\u2019d ever experienced. He wanted to throw her over, spread her legs and fuck her hard and long. He gripped her ass, sliding his hands over the firm mounds and dipping his fingers between her legs. She was soaking wet and still hot from her earlier climax. She moaned when he began pumping his fingers in and out of her, rubbing herself gently back and forth over his erection where it lay trapped deliciously beneath her. He guided the fingers of his other hand along the crease of her buttocks, teasing her tightly puckered star, and Sophie jerked in his arms, the tight walls of her sex clenching around his fingers.</p><p>There was a sting, a slight ache as her fangs withdrew from his neck, but it was quickly replaced by the warm caress of her tongue. Pushing against his shoulders she sat up, her beautiful breasts swaying tantalizingly close. Her eyes were almost completely amber as she stared down at him, glowing like jewels in the dark room. Without a word, she lifted her hips, her soft fingers wrapping around his cock as she sheathed him inside her once again and began rocking slowly back and forth.</p> <p>She cupped her breasts, squeezing and releasing, scraping her fingernails around and around her nipples, until they begged to be suckled, until blood streaked the round perfection of her breasts and drops hung poised on their very tips. She leaned forward, her hands to either side of his head as she moved, sliding herself up and down his aching cock. Colin growled, grabbing her hips and holding her in place as he began to thrust upward, delving deeper inside her with every stab of his cock into her welcoming body. She leaned closer and he fastened his mouth over one breast, sucking hard, tasting her blood on his tongue, feeling it hot and slick as he swallowed. Sophie cried out, her inner walls shuddering around him in warning. Colin grinned, tightened his grip on her hips, and switched his attention to the other breast, taking it in his mouth and sucking until it was bright pink and swollen.</p><p>Sophie had closed her eyes, her body swaying above him as if in a trance. Colin could feel her orgasm building around his shaft, could feel the tremors in her belly, the tightening of her inner walls as they began to ripple along his cock, caressing him, urging him to give up his seed. He grunted softly, trying to hold out a little longer, wanting to feel her climax, her wetness soaking his cock and dripping out of her swollen sex.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t last much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, don\u2019t, Sophie. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>As if waiting for his invitation, Sophie threw her head back, screaming as the climax roared over her. She collapsed on top of him, moaning as her entire body quivered in the throes of sexual release. Colin gritted his teeth, relishing the feel of her soft body trembling over his, her channel convulsing, shivering with the strength of her orgasm. Groaning, he tightened his hold on her hips and rolled over, drawing her knees up and placing her legs over his shoulders as he shoved himself into her over and over again in a frenzy of need. Sophie\u2019s eyes flashed open. She snarled wordlessly and began to move, meeting his downward plunge with an upward thrust of her hips, flexing her inner muscles to grip his cock even tighter.</p> <p>Colin felt the orgasm coming. There was no stopping it this time. He shouted uncontrollably as it rolled over him like an earthquake, shaking him down to his bones, every muscle in his body clenching as his cock pulsed over and over again, burying itself deep in Sophie\u2019s body until it was spent.</p><p>He eased her legs off his shoulders and rolled over, gathering her against his side.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Soph,\u201d he managed.</p><p>She responded with an unintelligible \u201cmmph,\u201d her voice muffled by his chest.</p><p>Colin wasn\u2019t sure how long they stayed that way. He wasn\u2019t even sure when they\u2019d started making love or how long they\u2019d been at it. He did know they both fell asleep at some point. He woke when Sophia stirred restlessly and sat up next to him.</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep,\u201d she fretted. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly dawn. I don\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, darlin\u2019,\u201d he soothed, pulling her back down into the warm bed. \u201cThese are blackout drapes and I\u2019ll stand guard. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sleepily, reaching up to caress his face. \u201cColin,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found each other, Soph. Now, sleep. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>The ringing phone dragged Colin from sleep. A quick glance at the clock told him, it was just past two. He checked it again. Two in the afternoon, he clarified. Sophie lay next to him, curled up beneath the covers. If he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think she was asleep, but a closer look told him it was more than that. It wasn\u2019t like the vampires in the movies who were pale and gray, their hands bony with long, curving nails. His Sophie wasn\u2019t dead. But this was something more than sleep, too.</p><p>He thought about the others, the vampires who\u2019d been murdered, and he understood for the first time how completely vulnerable they\u2019d been when their attackers fell on them. There would have been no resistance. Their deaths had been brutal butchery, nothing less.</p><p>The phone rang again, and he jolted, thinking it might be Robbie with news about Leighton. But right on top of that thought was the realization that it was his house phone ringing. Not his cell, but the land line. Cell reception had been spotty up here for years, until the vamps moved in and paid to have a new tower installed. His broadband came in over the land line, so he kept the service, but hardly anyone called him on that number anymore.</p><p>He let it ring. It would go to the answering machine before long, and he could listen to see if it was someone he wanted to talk to.</p><p>He pulled the covers up over Sophie and climbed out of bed, careful to close the bedroom door behind him. As he\u2019d told her, the curtains in his bedroom were heavy, with blinds underneath. After years of sleeping in all sorts of places and conditions, he liked a dark room and a comfortable bed when he slept.</p> <p>The incoming call rolled over to the machine as he walked into the living room, his skin prickling with cold. He almost turned around to go back to the bedroom and pull on a pair of sweats when Garry McWaters\u2019s familiar voice rolled out of the machine.</p><p>\u201cYo, Murphy. You around?\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s stared at the machine in disbelief. Jaw clenched, he strode over the phone and yanked it off the charger.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d he said growled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the woman had a bodyguard, Murph,\u201d Garry chided. \u201cNot nice of you.\u201d</p><p>It had been Garry\u2019s voice he heard at Babe\u2019s after the shootout yesterday. He hadn\u2019t wanted to believe it, but now\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d taken to ambushing friends, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we weren\u2019t aiming at you, buddy. You wouldn\u2019t have been hurt at all if that bitch hadn\u2019t seen a couple of the guys moving around outside. I hate working with amateurs, you know what I\u2019m saying? Anyway, she was the target. You were just supposed to open the door like you always do for the ladies. You\u2019re such a gentleman, Murph. I always admired that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fuck you, Garry.\u201d</p><p>McWaters just laughed. \u201cYeah, well you fucked up the plan. And the boys aren\u2019t happy. Their trucks got all shot up and you know how they feel about their trucks around here. Besides, you looked fine to me when you drove away. The bodyguard, too, for that matter. What is he, Delta? Rangers? That boy definitely had some training somewhere. Hey,\u201d he said suddenly, as if it had just occurred to him. \u201cHow\u2019s the woman doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, she was hardly helpless out there. Fine lookin\u2019 woman, and she knows her stuff. Too bad she\u2019s on the wrong side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wrong side? Which one\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>All laughter fled and Garry\u2019s voice turned grim. \u201cThe fucking human side, Murphy. You\u2019re from the South. I thought you\u2019d recognize a righteous cause when you saw one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to disappoint, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not disappointed. We were hoping to take her out, but we hurt her bad enough. I hear those vamps are pretty attached to their women, kinda fall apart when something bad happens to them, like with Mariane. But this one, the big man nearly losing his girlfriend like that? That\u2019ll put a crimp in their hunt, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Colin frowned. Where was Garry getting his information? How did he know how badly Leighton was hurt, or even that she was still alive? For that matter, how\u2019d he know what Raphael\u2019s reaction would be to Leighton getting shot up like that? Even he wouldn\u2019t have known before he\u2019d seen Jeremy\u2019s reaction to Mariane\u2019s injuries. Sure, everyone in town probably knew about the assault on Mariane by now, but no one outside the vamp compound should have known how badly it had affected Jeremy.</p><p>All this time, they\u2019d been looking for a mole among the humans in town, but maybe the mole was inside the compound.</p><p>Garry had remained silent, waiting for Colin to react. Was he looking for confirmation of Leighton\u2019s death, or at least an update on her condition? Colin\u2019s lip curled. The son-of-a-bitch would wait a long damn time before he got any information out of Colin. He\u2019d also made a huge miscalculation if he thought Raphael\u2019s reaction was going to be anything like Jeremy\u2019s. Jeremy was a fucking accountant. Raphael was\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit. Raphael was going to tear this town apart.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve done, Garry?\u201d he asked instead. \u201cRaphael\u2019s going to paint the town with your blood for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, I hope so,\u201d Garry said with false enthusiasm. \u201cWell, not my blood. But anyone else\u2019s will do.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cWhy the hell do you think we targeted her instead of someone else? If those vamps start killing people, maybe the rest of you will open your eyes and realize we\u2019ve got a bunch of monsters living among us and our fucking government isn\u2019t doing shit about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re making some sort of political statement with this?\u201d Colin asked in disbelief. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any last stand here, Mac. No Waco, no Ruby Ridge, no media standing by to cover your glorious sacrifice. You\u2019re dead, pure and simple. You and all your crazy ass buddies. Those vamps are going hunt you down and tear you into pieces so small, there won\u2019t be enough of you left to bury.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t wait for a response. He hung up, shaking with anger. That stupid SOB. He couldn\u2019t believe Garry would go along with that kind of ignorant bullshit. Hell, he couldn\u2019t believe Garry would turn on him like this, after everything they\u2019d been through together, after they\u2019d saved each other\u2019s lives more than once. But Colin couldn\u2019t save him this time. He\u2019d be lucky to save himself. Once the vampire lord found out Leighton had been specifically targeted . . . Colin shook his head. He might not know much about vampires, but he\u2019d been there when Raphael woke up at sunset last night. He\u2019d seen that huge, damn building rattle like it was made of cardboard.</p><p>Hell. Forget Garry McWaters and his idiot friends. Colin would have his hands full trying to convince the vamps not to take out every human being between here and Seattle.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, rubbing it back and forth. He wouldn\u2019t get any more sleep today, not with this buzzing in the back of his brain. But as long as he was awake he might as well do something useful, and he could start with Leon and Ellen Pettijohn, the owners of Babe\u2019s bar. He\u2019d be surprised if either of them was directly involved in this. They weren\u2019t going to win any citizenship awards, but he didn\u2019t peg them as murderers either.</p><p>He started back toward the bedroom, intending to take a quick shower, get dressed and head into town. Ellen worked a day shift at the market, but Leon would probably be home, still asleep. Colin figured to head over there first. He could call, but these things worked better in person, and If he had to rouse Leon out of bed all the better\u2014</p> <p>He hit the bedroom doorway and skidded to a halt.</p><p>Well, hell. He couldn\u2019t go over to Leon\u2019s today. He couldn\u2019t go anywhere. Sophia was sound asleep in his bed, completely helpless. Chances were no one knew she was here except him, but was he willing to take that chance? Hell, no.</p><p>He spun on his heel, going down the hall to his study and sitting at his computer. There was one more thing he could do, and he didn\u2019t have to leave the house to do it. Garry and his buddies had to be holed up somewhere nearby, and this was a small town. If Garry had been staying with one of the regulars, it would have leaked out by now. But if he was in hiding, maybe with those out-of-towners Hugh Pulaski had complained about . . . well, Garry\u2019s family had been in Cooper\u2019s Rest a long time. They probably had property way out in the back of nowhere that Colin didn\u2019t even know about.</p><p>But if he could find it before the sun went down tonight, he could give the vamps someplace to start looking, a focus for their hunt. And maybe, if he was very lucky, he could stop Raphael from turning Cooper\u2019s Rest into a bloodbath.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Sophia stretched languidly, feeling more sated and relaxed than she had in a very long time. Maybe ever. Her eyes were closed, but she knew Colin was nearby. She could feel him watching her and she arched her back, preening for him, sliding her hands over her breasts and down to her thighs before extending them over her head in a final stretch.</p> <p>Colin swore softly and she opened her eyes with a grin. He was half-naked, his chest bare, a pair of black combat pants snugged low on his narrow hips, and he was eyeing her body like a starving man.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you way over there?\u201d she purred, patting the bed.</p><p>\u201cIf I come to bed, we\u2019ll never get out of here and we have to leave. God knows I\u2019m sorry, but we have to get back to the compound.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sat up, her mind already churning over the possibilities. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a phone call today from an old friend. He wanted to know if Leighton was dead.\u201d</p><p>Sophia grew very still. \u201cWhy would he care?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s probably the one who shot her. He and his buddies killed Marco and Preston and attacked Mariane, too.\u201d</p><p>Her power rose unbidden, filling her with fire. She saw Colin\u2019s eyes widen and knew her own had begun to glow. \u201cWho is he?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cGarry McWaters. We served together.\u201d His jaw tightened, and his eyes narrowed with something more than anger. She tasted his emotions and recognized it. Betrayal. And that was something Sophia understood very well.</p><p>\u201cSo we kill him,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>Colin met her gaze directly. \u201cWe kill him,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd I think I know where to start looking. Get dressed and I\u2019ll fill you in on the way. We have to talk to Raphael before he starts killing the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>Colin slid the truck to a halt, jamming it into park and shoving the door open without even bothering to take the key out of the ignition. There had been even more vampires on the gate tonight, and they\u2019d all been jumpy with adrenaline, or whatever it was that made vampires jumpy. They weren\u2019t scared and they weren\u2019t nervous, they were . . . excited, like something big was about to happen and they could hardly wait. But that hadn\u2019t stopped them from searching him and his truck thoroughly, as if they\u2019d never seen him before. As if Sophia wasn\u2019t sitting right next to him.</p><p>And they\u2019d completely ignored his questions about Leighton. Either they didn\u2019t know anything or they weren\u2019t telling.</p><p>The main building was lit up like a damn party palace, lights shining through the big glass doors. He saw people standing inside\u2014vampires. Lots and lots of vampires, all dressed for war. It was like being back on an op\u2014everyone wearing head to toe black, combat pants and boots, with long-sleeved T-shirts\u2014except that some of these soldiers had fangs showing.</p><p>Sophie came up behind him and gripped his hand hard, forcing him to stop and turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he protested. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cLeighton must have survived the night or the guards wouldn\u2019t be so relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was relaxed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Colin. If she\u2019d died, you wouldn\u2019t have made it through the gate, at least not in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, let\u2019s get in there, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d she repeated urgently. \u201cYou had a taste of what Raphael can do. Just a taste, Colin. If he lashes out at you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big boy, Sophie. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>She jerked his arm angrily. \u201cNot from this. But I can. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? You have to let me protect us if it comes to that. Don\u2019t interfere and don\u2019t try to help.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared down at her. He wasn\u2019t an insecure man and he didn\u2019t feel the need to constantly prove himself. Twelve years with the teams had taught him the value of standing back and letting someone else take the lead when they could get the job done better. But there was a huge difference, a cosmic difference, between his buddies and Sophia. She wanted him to hide behind her while she fought Raphael? The guy who could cause small earthquakes when he got pissed?</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease. I know what I\u2019m asking, but it\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cFuck,\u201d he snarled. \u201cAll right, fine. But so help me, Sophie, if anything happens to you, I\u2019ll take you over my knee and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed her lips on his, silencing him. \u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she whispered. She froze for a moment and then her head whipped around toward the building. \u201cRaphael,\u201d she said.</p><p>Colin looked over her head and saw Robbie on his knees. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>Raphael opened his eyes and immediately reached for Cyn. He\u2019d been aware of her lying next to him throughout the day, had listened to her heart growing stronger with every beat. She would live. He knew that now. And she would heal. But it would be a long, slow process, and most likely many months before she was back to full strength. As powerful as he was, there was only so much he could do. His blood could start the process, could keep her alive and accelerate the healing. But with these injuries, her body would have to do some of it at its own pace.</p><p>He wrapped her gently in his arms and leaned over to kiss her forehead. She stirred, but didn\u2019t wake. She knew he was there, though, and that was enough for him. He would rather she save her energy for healing than waste it on unnecessary words.</p><p>Lifting his arm, he used his fangs to slice a vein open and lowered the wrist to Cyn\u2019s mouth. She latched on eagerly, another sign of her increasing strength. One of her hands came up to hold his wrist as she suckled and Raphael noticed how fragile it looked, how she seemed to have lost weight just over the last few hours. Her body was using itself up. He was reminded of Dr. Saephan\u2019s words yesterday. His Cyn was still human. She needed human blood to replace what she\u2019d lost, and she needed nutrition beyond what Raphael could give her.</p><p>Her grip on his wrist loosened as her suckling ceased and she seemed to be falling more deeply asleep. Raphael put his mouth to hers, kissing her, murmuring words of love against her lips. He lifted his head, stroking her hair back from her face.</p><p>\u201cI need to leave you for a short time, lubimaya\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDoctor Saephan will be here with you and Elke will be up above. I need to know how this happened, why Robbie was\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes flashed opened and she grabbed his wrist again. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt them,\u201d she said in a strained voice that seemed to take all of her strength.</p><p>Raphael shushed her, twisting his wrist carefully to take her hand in his. He kissed the back of it. \u201cWho is it you think I\u2019ll hurt, lubimaya? Softly now, I\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobbie,\u201d she breathed. \u201cMurphy. It wasn\u2019t their fault.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s mouth tightened and he kissed her eyelids, forcing her eyes to close so she wouldn\u2019t see the anger on his face. He wouldn\u2019t make promises he couldn\u2019t keep. Not to Cyn. \u201cSleep,\u201d he urged her and nudged her mind gently under, ensuring she would rest until he returned.</p><p>He waited until she was breathing evenly, then pulled the blanket over her and crossed to the desk, picking up his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Duncan answered immediately. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will live,\u201d Raphael said grimly. \u201cTell Doctor Saephan to gather whatever supplies he requires. I\u2019ll send the elevator up. No one but the doctor is to come down here, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. Everything is already prepared, Saephan needs only to retrieve the blood from the storage unit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce he is here with Cyn, I\u2019ll come upstairs. Where\u2019s Robbie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is here, my lord, and ready to accept your judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? We\u2019ll see.\u201d Raphael disconnected, tossing the phone back on the desk. He went first to the vault door, keying it open and sending the elevator up for Dr. Saephan. While he waited, he pulled on a robe, then sat on the bed next to Cyn, holding her hand, knowing she would sense his presence and take comfort in it.</p><p>He heard voices down the elevator shaft, heard Saephan directing others as they loaded up the doctor\u2019s medical supplies. And then the door closed and he heard the motor\u2019s hum as the elevator descended. The doors opened and Peter Saephan stepped out, dropping immediately to his knees.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>The doctor was a very smart man. He\u2019d been around powerful vampires enough to know Raphael would be walking the very edge of temper with his mate lying so gravely injured beside him. Raphael stared at Saephan\u2019s bowed head, fighting the instinct to leap across the room and destroy this intruding male presence.</p> <p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d he ground out at last. \u201cYou said she needed blood. Did you bring it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Saephan looked up quickly, his gaze torn between Raphael and Cyn, his expression that of a physician who saw nothing but a patient in desperate need of his care.</p><p>And that easily, Raphael relaxed. Saephan wasn\u2019t here to harm Cyn or to steal her away. He was here to help her. He stood and, knowing the doctor would be reluctant to approach with him standing so close, walked to the bathroom door, then turned back to say, \u201cI need a shower. I will leave her to your care for now.\u201d</p><p>Saephan met his eyes for the first time. \u201cI will take care of her, my lord. On my honor.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded, his gaze shifting away to rest on Cyn and then back to Saephan. \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d He stepped backwards into the bathroom and closed the door.</p><p>Raphael stripped off the robe and showered quickly. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have bothered since he intended to bathe in his enemy\u2019s blood before the night was over. But he was covered in Cyn\u2019s blood and she was his. Her blood was his, no one else\u2019s. So he let the soap and water sluice over his body, and he swore privately that the blood of those who had harmed his Cyn would run like water tonight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother drying off, just wrapped a towel around his hips and yanked the door open, suddenly needing to see for himself that she was well.</p><p>Saephan barely noticed the intrusion. He glanced up absently, but most of his attention remained on his patient. He\u2019d already hung a unit of blood and was checking Cyn\u2019s IV, his dark head bent over her too-thin arm.</p> <p>\u201cYou saved her life, my lord,\u201d Saephan said quietly. \u201cIf anyone else\u2014\u201d He drew a deep breath. \u201cShe is your mate, my lord, but she is also my friend and I feared for her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood there dripping wet, watching another male touch his mate, and realized he trusted this human more than any other. \u201cMy Cyn inspires loyalty in others,\u201d he observed.</p><p>Saephan glanced over at him. \u201cAs do you, my lord. Never doubt it.\u201d He turned back to Cyn and when he spoke next it was with the flat, dry delivery of a physician reporting on his patient\u2019s condition. \u201cHer greatest need at this point is human blood. She lost\u2014\u201d His professional demeanor slipped for a moment and he swallowed hard. \u201cShe lost a great deal,\u201d he continued, his voice slightly rough. \u201cBut, I can replace that. We have plenty on hand, of course, and her type is common. Cross matching is not necessary, because she has your blood to offset any incompatibility. She\u2019s also dehydrated, so I\u2019ll run a second IV and provide some critical nutrition at the same time. Given the severity and type of her injury, I\u2019m going to add some antibiotics to the mix. Again, with your blood working inside her, this is mostly a precaution. At best, it will be unnecessary, at worst, it will speed her recovery. But, my lord,\u201d Saephan turned and addressed Raphael directly for the first time. \u201cEven with your blood, her injuries . . .\u201d He drew a breath. \u201cShe will take a very long time to heal completely.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d He walked over to the closet, rubbing the towel briefly over his body before donning clothing for the night. Jeans, sweater, boots. Black for moving through the shadows; black for hunting his enemies.</p><p>Saephan had bent over Cyn once again. He spoke over his shoulder without turning. \u201cWith your permission, my lord, I will bathe her more completely while you\u2019re gone. She\u2019ll rest more easily once she\u2019s cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Raphael froze in the act of pulling on his boots, once again fighting the instinct to protect his mate. He brushed it off with an effort, swallowing his snarl of frustration to avoid alarming the doctor. \u201cDo whatever you feel is necessary,\u201d he managed, stomping the boot onto his foot and standing to his full height. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cno one except you is to see her like this, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. I would have it no other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElke will stand guard above. You will remain here until I return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. I leave you to it, then.\u201d</p><p>Raphael crossed to the bed, stroking a hand down Cyn\u2019s cheek. He leaned close enough to kiss her mouth again, whispering against her lips, \u201cThey will pay, lubimaya. Those responsible will die tonight.\u201d</p><p>Elke looked up quickly when Raphael emerged from the elevator.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will live, Elke. Others will not be so fortunate. Doctor Saephan will stay with her until I return. You will guard this entrance. No one is to come or go from my room, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice, speaking to her alone. \u201cI know you would rather join the hunt, Elke, but there is no one I trust more to guard her.\u201d</p><p>Elke\u2019s pale eyes turned pink with unshed tears and Raphael blinked in surprise. He\u2019d never seen her exhibit a shred of emotion before, except for anger. \u201cI will guard her with my life, Sire. My place is here.\u201d</p><p>Raphael tilted his head, smiling slightly. He knew Cyn and Elke were friends of a sort. They sparred together in the gym, and because Elke was the only female guard in his inner circle, she was frequently assigned to Cyn. But he hadn\u2019t realized until now the depth of that friendship.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting, my lord,\u201d Elke said.</p><p>Raphael bared his teeth. \u201cThe ground will be black with blood tonight, Elke. I swear it.\u201d He clapped a hand on her shoulder and turned a sober gaze across the great room. Duncan was already there, walking toward him. They met halfway.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Duncan began, but Raphael interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Robbie emerged from the large common room. \u201cI am here, my lord.\u201d He took several steps toward Raphael and sank to his knees, his head bowed.</p><p>Raphael stared down at the big bodyguard\u2019s bare neck. \u201cTell me why you deserve to live,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d another voice interrupted.</p><p>Raphael swiveled his head slowly, looking over his shoulder to where Colin Murphy stood in the open door with Lucien\u2019s child Sophia. Cold, wet air gusted around them, slapping against his legs.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Raphael sneered. \u201cAnother who somehow survived unscathed while my Cyn was being torn apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Robbie protested, but Raphael silenced him with a sharp look, exerting just enough power to pin the human in place without harming him. \u201cBe very careful, Robert,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe only reason you\u2019re still alive is that my Cyn pled for your life, though she had barely the breath to do so. Don\u2019t make her sacrifice in vain.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned to face Murphy, giving the human his complete attention. He gathered his power casually, letting a tiny fraction of it swell out into the room, enough to scatter papers and rattle doors.</p><p>To his surprise, Sophia stepped forward, her own defenses rising sharply, expanding to encompass the human male. Her eyes began to glow slightly as her power built, and she stood directly in front of the much larger human, hands clenched at her sides, her chin raised in defiance.</p><p>Raphael blinked lazily and gazed down at her. \u201cYour Sire may have anointed you his successor, Sophia, but never make the mistake of thinking you are my equal.\u201d</p><p>Her shapely jaw tightened angrily, but she gave a curt nod, acknowledging the truth of his words. And then her chin came up again and she said, \u201cYou would die to protect your mate, Lord Raphael. I will do no less.\u201d</p><p>Raphael studied her more carefully, noting for the first time the connection between her and Murphy. It was very new and very tenuous, but it was there. He frowned, glancing over at Duncan who was regarding the newly mated pair with open curiosity. Apparently, no one else knew about this either. It wouldn\u2019t stop him from killing her if he had to, but it made him willing to listen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRobbie,\u201d Raphael snapped over his shoulder. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Over the next several minutes, Robbie told him in detail the events of the previous day. \u201cWe were almost away, my lord,\u201d Robbie said, coming to the end of his tale. He was still on his knees, but his eyes met Raphael\u2019s stern gaze with open honesty. \u201cI had Cyn moving toward the truck door, covering her back, when they opened up on us from a new direction. You know Cyn, my lord. She could have dived into the truck, gone for her own safety, but instead she started firing, covering Murphy\u2019s back. I should have grabbed her, should never have let her go. That\u2019s when\u2014\u201d His voice broke for the first time and he looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord. I failed Cyn and I failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault,\u201d Colin Murphy insisted again. \u201cDammit, Raphael, you have to listen to me!\u201d</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s vampires, already jumpy and ready for the hunt, bristled at the human\u2019s tone, and even Sophia had the good sense to place a cautioning hand on her mate\u2019s arm. Murphy drew a deep breath and continued more carefully.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, sir. But someone I know called me today with information that you really need to hear.\u201d</p><p>Raphael gritted his teeth impatiently. This was taking too long. \u201cTalk,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLeighton was specifically targeted,\u201d Murphy said intently. \u201cThey knew, or they thought they knew, that taking her out would weaken you personally. They thought your vamps would be leaderless and go nuts, or that you\u2019d join them and start butchering humans indiscriminately. They want a bloodbath. They want headlines all across the television and Internet screaming about vampires prowling the night and slaughtering innocent humans.\u201d</p><p>Raphael flattened his lips thoughtfully. \u201cStand up, Robbie,\u201d he said without turning. He heard the human coming to his feet behind him.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Robbie said.</p><p>Raphael turned. \u201cThe only words my Cyn spoke this morning were in defense of you . . . and him,\u201d he added, with a jerk of his head toward Murphy. \u201cAnd your account of events was truthful.\u201d He regarded the bodyguard silently. Robbie had been with him a long time, and he was mated to one of Raphael\u2019s vampires. It was why he\u2019d entrusted Cyn\u2019s protection to him. \u201cWe won\u2019t slow down for you,\u201d he told him now. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to join the hunt for these killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Colin Murphy spoke up again and Raphael turned to eye him darkly.</p><p>\u201cThey knew about Mariane,\u201d the human said urgently. \u201cThey knew what the attack on her did to Jeremy, how it weakened him. They knew where to find Marco and Preston\u2014\u201d He glanced quickly at Sophia before continuing in a quiet voice, \u201cAnd they knew Leighton was still alive when we brought her here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared at him, slipping easily into the human\u2019s mind despite Sophia\u2019s newly established link. The man was telling the truth as he knew it. And that meant Raphael had a leak inside this compound. His own people, the ones he\u2019d brought from Malibu, were loyal to the core. He would stake his life on it. He did stake his life on it every day. He looked around, noting who was there . . . and who was not.</p> <p>\u201cGet Loren on the phone,\u201d he ordered Wei Chen, watching the nest leader\u2019s eyes widen as he searched the surrounding faces and realized Loren was not among them. He pulled a phone from his pocket and paged rapidly through his call list.</p><p>\u201cLoren,\u201d he said, surprise evident in his voice. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Raphael took the phone from him in time to hear Loren\u2019s answer. \u201cI\u2019m at Marco\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cI got word of a possible break-in.\u201d</p><p>Even over the phone line, Raphael could hear the lie in his words, and it only confirmed what he\u2019d already begun to suspect.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to try that again?\u201d Raphael said coldly.</p><p>\u201cSire!\u201d Loren gasped. \u201cMy lord, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back here now. And bring the woman with you.\u201d He hung up while Loren was still sputtering, trying to justify his duplicity. Stupid son-of-a-bitch. He exchanged a quick look with Juro who nodded and took several steps away, taking two of his security people with him.</p><p>As they began to confer in low voices, Raphael turned to Murphy. \u201cDo you know who these killers are?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them,\u201d the human replied. \u201cAnd I think I know where at least some of them have been hiding out. But I don\u2019t know all the names. If we can take the ones I do know alive, we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>From behind Raphael, Robbie spoke up, \u201cWait a minute.\u201d He walked around Raphael to face Murphy. \u201cCyn took pictures of the license plates in that parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Murphy agreed, snapping his fingers. He switched his gaze to Raphael. \u201cWe need her cell.\u201d</p><p>Raphael pulled his phone from an inside pocket and rang Peter Saephan, who answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cCyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is resting well, my lord. The fluids are helping already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I require Cyn\u2019s cell phone. Her clothing from last night is in a bag in the closet. Could you check and see if her phone is there?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief pause and then Raphael heard the closet door slide open and the sharp crackle of a plastic bag. \u201cOne moment, my lord,\u201d Saephan said, followed by a soft thud as he put the phone down. More rustling of plastic and then the phone was picked up again.</p><p>\u201cI have it, my lord. Let me . . . I\u2019m cleaning the blood off with a bit of alcohol.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s blood, Raphael knew and was grateful for the good doctor\u2019s hygienic impulses.</p><p>Saephan had continued, saying, \u201cIt looks okay, but the battery is low. Do you want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Doctor, thank you. If you would put it in the elevator and send it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. Was there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael disconnected and turned to the others. \u201cThe phone is coming up in the elevator now.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stepped forward as if to retrieve the phone himself, but Raphael growled and Duncan stepped in front of the human, blocking his path.</p><p>\u201cElke will get it,\u201d Duncan said. His tone was calm enough, but his body language left no room for dispute.</p><p>Murphy opened his mouth as if to protest anyway, but it died unsaid when he swung toward Raphael and saw the look on his face. Duncan might be calm, but Raphael most definitely was not.</p><p>Murphy fell back to stand next to Sophia who placed herself slightly ahead of him and cast a hostile glance in Raphael\u2019s direction. Duncan, meanwhile, waited until they heard the elevator doors close once again and then sent one of the vampire guards over to get the phone from Elke who remained at her post.</p><p>The guard brought the phone over to Duncan. He looked to Raphael for permission, then accessed the phone\u2019s memory. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d he confirmed, paging through several photographs. \u201cThere\u2019s a shot of the entire lot and then the individual plates. It looks as if . . . yes, she got them all,\u201d he said with a note of admiration.</p><p>\u201cI can run those\u2014\u201d Murphy started.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Duncan interrupted</p><p>He beckoned Maxime over from near the front office where she stood along with Wei Chen and some others, watching events unfold. None of those watching were hunters\u2014Raphael\u2019s soldiers were specifically chosen and trained. But even among the vampires who wouldn\u2019t actively participate tonight, even to those who spent most of their waking hours in front of a computer, the excitement level was high and contagious.</p><p>Duncan turned the phone over to Maxime, and she flipped through the images, moving far more quickly than he had. She gave Murphy a smug look. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d she said and headed for the nearby office.</p><p>\u201cMost of those license plates are local,\u201d Murphy commented, watching Maxime walk away. He turned back to Raphael. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing the owners are, too. And I have a couple of possible locations for the guy who called to taunt me this afternoon\u2014Garry McWaters. He was raised around here, but until yesterday I thought he was living in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly not,\u201d Raphael observed dismissively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Murphy admitted. \u201cBut that\u2019s what he wanted me to think. I\u2019d know if he was staying in town. You can\u2019t keep a secret in this place. But his family has a couple of old properties way the hell back of nowhere. I didn\u2019t even know they were there until I went looking for something like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>Murphy frowned, as if reluctant to speak. \u201cHe was a friend,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. \u201cI thought I recognized his voice out at the bar yesterday, after Leighton went down, but now I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tonight he dies,\u201d Raphael said darkly.</p><p>Murphy shook his head, but didn\u2019t argue, which was a good thing, because Raphael wasn\u2019t in the mood to be contradicted by anyone, much less a human.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Murphy said impatiently. \u201cYou don\u2019t need us here. While you wait for Loren to show up, Sophia and I can swing by Leon Pettijohn\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner of the bar where Cynthia was attacked, my lord,\u201d Sophia supplied. \u201cHe and his wife own it jointly, but only the man works there. She has a day job at the local market .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re part of this,\u201d Murphy jumped in to add. \u201cI tried calling Leon at the bar already, but there\u2019s no answer. He\u2019s probably running scared after yesterday\u2019s shootout, but if I can get him to talk, he\u2019ll know who else was there. It wasn\u2019t only McWaters shooting at us.\u201d</p><p>Raphael studied the human silently. He wasn\u2019t inclined to trust him, but Cyn had.</p><p>\u201cOur hunt will begin at the bar, then,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cBy Robbie\u2019s accounting, it\u2019s likely one or more of the attackers were shot, which means they bled. We\u2019ll catch their scent and track them that way, if nothing else works. Sophia, you and Murphy go to this bar owner\u2019s house, and if you discover anything of worth from these people, let us know. If not, you may catch up to us later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLoren is at the gate, my lord,\u201d Duncan murmured.</p><p>Raphael smiled slowly, viciously. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p> <p>\u201cWell, that was intense,\u201d Colin commented as he held the door open so Sophie could climb up into the Suburban they\u2019d borrowed from the compound\u2019s garage. Sophie had suggested they take the Lexus she\u2019d been driving earlier, but there was no way Colin was going out on an op\u2014even a civilian one\u2014driving a damn luxury sedan. It would be too embarrassing. Since his Tahoe was pretty much totaled and, according to Sophia, stank of blood, he\u2019d commandeered one of Wei Chen\u2019s fleet of SUVs.</p><p>He closed Sophie\u2019s door, hurried around the hood and settled himself behind the wheel, starting the truck with a quick twist of the key. He pulled out of the garage and started down the curve of the driveway, slowing as the gate opened and a gray BMW pulled through with Loren at the wheel. Colin caught a glimpse of the vampire\u2019s shaken expression as he drove by. There was a woman sitting next to him and she didn\u2019t look happy, either. Colin shook his head. He didn\u2019t envy Loren. Not one little bit.</p><p>It was a short drive to the Pettijohn\u2019s place. Their house was on the near side of town, down a narrow slice of dirt that barely qualified as a road. Like a lot of the other homes around Cooper\u2019s Rest, theirs was older and in a state of gentle disrepair. The wood could have used a good oiling and the eaves were clogged with pine needles, but the roof was sturdy and there was a brand new aluminum garage off to one side. The double doors were open and Colin could see Ellen\u2019s Honda sitting inside, but there was no sign of Leon\u2019s truck.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this quick. Looks like Leon\u2019s left already and I\u2019d like to get to him before Raphael does.\u201d</p><p>Sophie snorted delicately. \u201cOnly if you want him to keep breathing.\u201d She opened the truck door and slid to the ground, closing the door quietly behind her. \u201cMaybe we should go directly to the bar and this Leon fellow. You said the woman\u2019s never there anyway. She won\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but Leon probably tells her stuff. As long as we\u2019re here, it\u2019s worth a five minute conversation.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your call. I don\u2019t know these people.\u201d She glanced around the yard and then at Colin, as if to say, and I\u2019d really rather not know them.</p><p>Colin grinned, taking the steps to the front porch in two long strides. Before he could ring the doorbell, the door whipped open and Ellen stood there, rifle in hand and pointed right at his face.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Six</p><p>Raphael felt Loren\u2019s fear long before the vampire entered the building with the human woman at his side. He looked awful, his face pale and his eyes wide as he scanned the vampires gathered around the entrance. He pushed his way through, took one look at Raphael and dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Sire,\u201d he sobbed.</p> <p>Raphael gazed down on him dismissively. How had he ever thought this one was worthy of responsibility?</p><p>\u201cIn the other room,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>Two of his vampires grabbed Loren by the elbows, hauling him to his feet. The woman wailed noisily and Duncan stepped up, cutting off her cries with a thought. At his signal, another of Raphael\u2019s guards escorted the now placid female after Loren.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, you\u2019re with me.\u201d He turned to face Juro. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d he told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll go directly to the bar and move out from there. Make certain everyone understands the rules of engagement. I want to be absolutely certain we catch every one of these animals in our net. Information first\u2014\u201d He lowered head and let a fraction of his power flow outward, swirling around him. \u201c\u2014and then we hunt,\u201d he finished.</p><p>His vampires roared. He gave them all a fierce grin, then spun around and strode through the double doors and into the nearly empty room. With just the few of them there, the lights were low, the night nothing but a black space beyond the windows. Loren was on his knees, hunched over, arms wrapped around himself miserably. The human woman sat on a chair nearby, although she didn\u2019t seem aware of anyone, much less her vampire lover.</p><p>Raphael walked over to Loren and stared down at him, hands on his hips. Raphael had given Loren life. He owned him body and soul. It was impossible for him to lie to his Sire, even if he\u2019d thought to try.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been fucking her, Loren?\u201d Raphael asked flatly.</p><p>He swallowed dryly before speaking. \u201cAlmost a month, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeb Jenkins. But I\u2019ve told her nothing, my lord. I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>Loren\u2019s mouth closed and he dropped his head to his chest, his shoulders bowed and shaking with fear. Raphael hadn\u2019t yet decided what to do with him. Despite Loren\u2019s protests to the contrary, Raphael knew the vampire had been spilling secrets to the woman. The question was with what intent? It was one thing if he was simply a fool who let information slip while lying in bed with her. But if he\u2019d intentionally dropped secrets to persuade her of his importance or to curry favor, that was something else. The next several minutes of Loren\u2019s life would depend on what he\u2019d told the woman . . . and what she\u2019d done with it.</p><p>\u201cDeb.\u201d As Raphael said the woman\u2019s name, he wrapped a thread of power around it, ensuring her cooperation. If necessary, he\u2019d rip the truth from her mind, but as he touched her thoughts, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be necessary. She was wide open to him.</p><p>She looked up, meeting his gaze with a smile. \u201cYes?\u201d she said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known Loren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since I\u2019ve been back from L.A. We met in town at the Post Office. I was in there makin\u2019 sure that old bat Mavis didn\u2019t fuck up my mail. I don\u2019t know why they keep her on there. Anyway, Loren was there. Gettin\u2019 his mail, too, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know who he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. My brother Curtis told me all about you guys as soon as I got here.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s gaze sharpened. When he\u2019d scoured Hugh Pulaski\u2019s mind\u2014after teaching him the folly of threatening Cyn\u2014the human had identified someone named Curtis as one of those he\u2019d overheard plotting against the vampires.</p><p>\u201cCurtis said if I got the chance,\u201d Deb continued, \u201cI should hook up with one of you. Loren was good-looking enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>Loren had turned to stare at her in horror, and she winked at him when she said this, unaware of his reaction.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019d heard the sex was mind-blowing,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I thought why not? I\u2019ll give it a try. It\u2019s not like Coop\u2019s is crawling with eligible guys, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire, I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael simply looked at Loren. The vampire shut his mouth with a whimper.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying, Deb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, well, Curtis, him and his friends that is, wanted to know all about it. Not the sex so much\u2014that would have been too creepy, him being my brother\u2014but everything else. He used to grill me like a steak after I\u2019d spent the night with Loren. Pissed me off sometimes, because all I wanted to do was sleep. You know what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she said with a meaningful look.</p><p>Raphael sighed. \u201cWhat sorts of things did you talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit, there wasn\u2019t much to tell. I mean sex was pretty much all we did. At least until you showed up. Loren was pretty stressed about that, because you wanted everyone living in this place,\u201d she said, waving a hand around. \u201cThat would have meant no more sex, and neither one of us was too thrilled about that, I gotta tell ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then that poor girl got attacked,\u201d she went on, shaking her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her, but that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. I asked Curtis was that him or any of his buddies\u2014\u2018cuz they might have a grudge against vamps, but that girl was as human as me or\u2014\u201d She grinned. \u201cWell, not you, but you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Curtis say to that?\u201d Raphael asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cHe told me no. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure I believed him. I mean I believe him, but some of those boys he\u2019s hanging around with . . . well, I wouldn\u2019t wanna run into them in a dark alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Loren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Loren\u2019s sweet as can be. He\u2019d never hurt a fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said patiently. \u201cI mean what did Loren tell you about Mariane\u2019s attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, he told me all about her husband Jeremy and how upset he was. How it was a good thing you came when you did or she would\u2019ve died and that would have been it for Jeremy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told your brother this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. It was the first real thing I ever had to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first? Was there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, last night Loren was pretty upset. I guess some woman got shot, so he couldn\u2019t stay over. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>Raphael ignored the question. He wasn\u2019t about to tell this woman anything about Cyn. Unlike Loren, apparently. \u201cDid you talk to Curtis about this, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. He woke me up this morning with that damn phone.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned away, walking over to the window and staring out, seeing in his mind\u2019s eye the bloody mess they\u2019d made of his Cyn, hearing her cries of pain. And why? Because they wanted to weaken him. Because Loren had been so hungry to fuck this ignorant human that he\u2019d run his mouth off like an eager-to-please child. He hoped the woman had been worth it, because Loren wouldn\u2019t be fucking anyone else for a very long time.</p><p>He remembered the other conspirator Pulaski had overheard in the bar, and he spoke without turning to look at her. \u201cTell me, Deb, are any of Curtis\u2019s friends called Junior? Maybe a nickname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. That\u2019d be Garry McWaters, but he hates that name. Pretty much hates his old man, or hated him. I think he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Raphael spun away from the windows, striding across the room, signaling his guards as he went by. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two of them grabbed Loren who cried out, \u201cSire, please!\u201d</p><p>Raphael ignored his cries.

Certainly not Mariane or Jeremy, and especially not Cyn.</p><p>As for her brother, Curtis. He wouldn\u2019t be a problem after tonight.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell you want, Murphy?\u201d Ellen nudged the rifle to emphasize her question. It was an amateur\u2019s move, but at this distance, it didn\u2019t make much difference.</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d Colin said quietly, aware that Sophia had grown perfectly still behind him. He held his hands up where the woman could see them. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to cause problems. I heard there was some trouble at Babe\u2019s yesterday afternoon and I\u2019m just trying to figure out what happened.\u201d</p><p>Ellen regarded him suspiciously down the long barrel of her Remington. It was a nice rifle and, amateur or not, at this range a blind man could hit him.</p><p>\u201cLeon didn\u2019t come home last night.\u201d Her voice wavered when she said it, but the rifle didn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s not like him.\u201d</p> <p>Colin nodded. \u201cI heard there was some trouble,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Ellen stared at him, clearly trying to decide how much to say or whether she could trust him. She lowered the rifle a fraction.</p><p>\u201cSomeone said guns were fired, Ellen. If something has happened and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snapped the rifle up again, glaring at him suspiciously. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that? What\u2019d you\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was all she managed to say before Sophia stepped deftly around Colin, wrapped her fingers around the rifle barrel and tore it from Ellen\u2019s hands, almost before Colin even saw her move. Holding the rifle out to Colin with her right hand, she held Ellen immobilized with her left and said, \u201cShall we take this inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit, Sophie,\u201d Colin drawled. \u201cIt was goin\u2019 so well, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can give her the gun back if you\u2019d like?\u201d she said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. All right, let\u2019s see what Ellen has to tell us.\u201d</p><p>Sophie had wanted to use her vampire mojo to force Ellen to talk, but Colin had persuaded her to let him try talking with her first. Once Ellen stopped rubbing her neck and glaring at Sophie, it hadn\u2019t taken long to convince her that Colin had nothing to do with the men who\u2019d shot up the parking lot yesterday. He\u2019d been right about Leon telling her what went on at the bar, but he\u2019d never mentioned Colin\u2019s name. Besides, Ellen was genuinely worried about her husband and had no one else to turn to.</p><p>\u201cLeon didn\u2019t have nothing to do with them,\u201d Ellen insisted for the third time. \u201cThey met in the bar, but that was it. He can\u2019t turn away customers because he don\u2019t like their politics. He\u2019d have no one at all if he did that. Besides, even if he knew they was planning something, what\u2019s he supposed to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf something was going on, he could have told me, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed noisily. \u201cYour buddy McWaters was right in the middle of \u2018em, Murphy. How\u2019d we know we could trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he ground out, still feeling the punch of Garry\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>Ellen shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much, though. Those boys are bad news. If you\u2019re planning on taking \u2018em on, I hope there\u2019s a lot more than just you two.\u201d She eyed Sophia distrustfully. \u201cEven if one\u2019s a vamp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllen,\u201d Murphy said, drawing her attention away from Sophie. \u201cDid Leon mention anyone besides Garry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurtis Jenkins, who else? He\u2019s been trouble since day one.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Leon now, Ellen? I\u2019d like to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bleak look. \u201cI told you, he didn\u2019t come home last night,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI figured I\u2019d find him here when I got home tonight, sleeping off a bender.\u201d Her eyes filled with sudden tears. \u201cHe\u2019d have called me if he could, Murphy. He knows I\u2019d worry.\u201d</p><p>Colin swore under his breath. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to the bar\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ellen stood. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin said immediately, thinking of Raphael and his vampires who\u2019d soon be overrunning Babe\u2019s and the woods around it. \u201cI\u2019ll check it out and call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force me to wait here, Murphy. I\u2019m a free\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia was suddenly there, her hand cupping Ellen\u2019s neck as she eased her onto the couch. Clearly after having zapped her unconscious, or whatever the hell it was that vampires did.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Soph, could you warn me before you do anymore of that vamp shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too polite, and we don\u2019t have time to argue with her. Raphael will be on his way by now, and we don\u2019t want to miss the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Colin covered Ellen with a crocheted throw from the back of the couch. There was something in Sophie\u2019s voice when she talked about the hunt that made him turn and look at her. She was edgy and anxious to leave, already heading for the door. She glanced back at him impatiently and he saw the gleam of her eyes, not full-on amber the way they got sometimes, but like a rim of gold around her irises.</p><p>She met his scrutiny with a challenging stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re excited,\u201d he said, realizing it as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re looking forward to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea what it\u2019s like to spend your life pretending to be ordinary. To tamp down your power, conceal your differences, lest the humans become frightened. Raphael will let his people run tonight. There\u2019ll be no holding back. You\u2019re damn right I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She moved faster than he could see. One second she was by the door and the next she was right in front of him, her arms around his neck, her lush body pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cYou may be human, Colin Murphy.\u201d She licked a long line up his neck and over his jaw until her mouth touched his. \u201cBut you\u2019re definitely not ordinary.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips against his in a quick hard kiss.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run the night, Colin. It\u2019s time to hunt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><p>Colin and Sophie pulled into the parking lot outside Babe\u2019s on the heels of Raphael and his vampires. The bar was dark, the lot empty. Or it had been before they arrived and filled it with SUVs. And even then it remained dark. The vamps had traveled without headlights, apparently seeing as well or better in the dark than they did in light. Even Sophie had slipped on a pair of sunglasses to preserve her night vision from his headlights as they\u2019d driven here.</p><p>Colin turned off the engine and flicked off the interior light, so it wouldn\u2019t come on when they opened the doors. Then he waited, although he didn\u2019t know what they were waiting for. The SUVs in front of him just sat there, presumably filled with vampires. He was about to ask Sophie what was going on when, as if some signal had been given, the doors all opened at once and Raphael\u2019s people piled out.</p><p>Colin did the same, going around to the back of the truck and gearing up, all the while watching warily as the vampires jostled each other, practically bouncing on their toes with anticipation. He wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that. On the one hand, the adrenaline rush of going into battle was so familiar, it almost hurt to feel it again. He hadn\u2019t appreciated until that moment how much he missed this. But there was something a little creepy about being surrounded by vampires who were all juiced up at the idea of killing a bunch of humans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it get to you,\u201d a deep voice said next to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rob,\u201d Colin said, looking up to find the Ranger standing in front of him, armored up and ready to roll.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t let their hyperactive behavior fool you either. These guys are trained within an inch of their lives. When it comes down to it, they\u2019re disciplined as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Colin\u2019s attention shifted as Raphael walked over to the two of them.</p><p>\u201cTell, me, Murphy, do you think you managed to shoot any of these animals? Or was my Cyn the only one injured?\u201d</p><p>Colin ground his teeth together, reminding himself the vampire was worried about Leighton. \u201cWe hit a few. I don\u2019t know how seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can start with that, then. Duncan.\u201d His lieutenant half-turned toward the assembled vamps and nodded.</p><p>Like horses out of the gate, several of the vamps took off, rushing in among the trees so fast, they were little more than a blur of motion. And they didn\u2019t make a fucking sound, not even a whisper of movement despite the tightly packed trees and years of deadfall.</p><p>Sophia joined Raphael and Duncan in some sort of confab. Presumably discussing their plans for tonight, but who the hell knew? Not Colin.</p><p>When she joined him again, he gave her a dark look which she returned with a smile. \u201cPatience, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s people are searching for a blood scent. You and Robbie both said some of the attackers were injured which means they bled. The scent will help us identify the guilty. It also has a . . . psychological benefit, I suppose you\u2019d say. It motivates the soldiers, gets them ready for battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike these guys need more motivation,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cRaphael knows his people,\u201d she said calmly, placing a hand on his arm.</p><p>A huge noise shattered the stillness. Colin looked up, expecting to see a tree falling nearly on top of them, but at the same time, his brain played the sound back in his head and he realized it wasn\u2019t a tree at all. One of the vamps had kicked in the back door to Babe\u2019s.</p><p>The vampires around Raphael all came to immediate attention, staring at the closed bar like dogs on point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing they found what they were looking for,\u201d Colin said dryly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia stood quietly, her head tilted to one side, listening. \u201cA body,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck.\u201d Colin sighed deeply. \u201cI should take a look.\u201d</p><p>Sophia walked with him into the bar. They went in the front door, held open by one of Raphael\u2019s vamps who directed them to the back. Not that Colin needed the assist. There was only one place a freezer big enough to hold a body could be.</p> <p>It was a big chest model, maybe twenty-five or six cubic feet. A lot of the people around here had them. Coop\u2019s small grocery store was fine for day-to-day sort of stuff, but most of the residents made a monthly trip down the hill and stocked up on things like meat and anything else that could be frozen.</p><p>The lid was propped open, but Colin really didn\u2019t want to see what was inside. He looked anyway.</p><p>\u201cYeah, dammit, that\u2019s Leon.\u201d He glanced away. This was beyond the pale, completely unnecessary. It wasn\u2019t Leon\u2019s fault those jack-offs had decided to meet in his bar. But even so, the bar owner hadn\u2019t told anyone what he\u2019d heard. And they\u2019d killed him anyway.</p><p>He reached for the freezer lid and slammed it shut, careful to hold it by the edge and wiping his prints. \u201cThe cops\u2019ll have to be called on this,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cMake sure there\u2019s nothing to say you were here.\u201d</p><p>He spun on his heel and strode back through the bar into the parking lot.</p> <p>Sophia walked with him. She put a hand on his arm as they crossed the dirt lot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it wasn\u2019t any of you that did it.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s grip on his arm tightened, pulling him to a stop. He waited while she listened to something only she could hear. \u201cRaphael wants to speak with us,\u201d she said.</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t even ask how she knew that. He\u2019d already figured out there was some sort of telepathy going on between the vamps. He just wondered how widespread it was.</p><p>\u201cYou were correct in your assessment,\u201d Raphael told him, once they\u2019d drawn within human earshot. \u201cThere were no fewer than four blood trails. They begin among the trees, where the assailants concealed themselves, and they end here\u2014\u201d he said, indicating the parking lot. \u201c\u2014at which point the humans took to their vehicles. The human male in the freezer\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s head shot up and he glared at Raphael. \u201cLeon,\u201d he snapped. \u201cLeon Pettijohn.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael gave a sideways tilt of his head, acknowledging the point. \u201cYet another victim of these killers. He died inside the bar, his neck was broken. With no blood and the body frozen, the scent was almost completely concealed by the air tight container.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cSo what happens next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go after them, beginning with McWaters,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cHe appears to be some sort of ringleader, maybe even the mastermind behind this scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should split up,\u201d Colin suggested. \u201cEllen Pettijohn, Leon\u2019s wife\u2014his widow now\u2014gave us a name that came up on the vehicle list, as well. Curtis Jenkins\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeb\u2019s brother,\u201d Raphael said, surprising him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Colin agreed, puzzled. \u201cBut how do you know that? She just got back into town a month or so ago. Are you saying she\u2019s involved in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly, no.\u201d</p><p>Colin waited for some sort of explanation, but it wasn\u2019t forthcoming. Next to him Sophie seemed as puzzled as he was, at least at first.</p> <p>But then she exhaled a breathy \u201cahhh\u201d sound and said slowly, \u201cBut she is involved. Perhaps with one of your vampires?\u201d</p><p>Raphael gave her an unfriendly look, which was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cShe is most likely the one who told them how devastated Jeremy was after Mariane was attacked,\u201d Duncan provided. \u201cWhich is no doubt why they believed targeting Cynthia would incapacitate Lord Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Colin said dryly. \u201cOkay, fine. So, one of us goes after McWaters and the other Curtis Jenkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcWaters is mine,\u201d Raphael said flatly.</p><p>Colin nodded, trying not to think about what Raphael had planned for his old buddy.</p><p>\u201cThen, Sophie and I will check out Jenkins and a couple of others on that list,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get lucky and they\u2019re all holed up together somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked over at his lieutenant. \u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense, my lord. Sophia and Mister Murphy can reconnoiter Jenkins and the local citizenry. Several of your hunters can accompany them, while the rest of us take on McWaters and his allies. You have my cell number, Mister Murphy. In the event you require assistance, we can immediately dispatch additional people to your location. If the need is urgent,\u201d he added, anticipating Colin\u2019s next words, \u201cwe can abandon the vehicles and arrive in moments.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. He\u2019d seen the vamps move fast earlier, but apparently they could do it over distance, too. Good to know.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is acceptable. Good hunting to you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo all of us,\u201d Raphael growled, and his vampires responded with an eerie howl, a warning to all creatures that a far more dangerous predator was abroad in the forest tonight.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Nine</p><p>Raphael strode into the yard in front of Garry McWaters\u2019s hideout, his vampires maneuvering silently among the trees to surround the house. This was the first of the two locations Murphy had suggested, but there was no doubt it was the right one. There were multiple trucks parked alongside and around the back, several of them showing signs of the gun battle, and at least one carrying a familiar and strong scent of blood. These were the men he sought, the men who had tried to kill his Cyn.</p><p>Next to him, Duncan was communicating quietly with the others, while Juro walked several paces ahead of him. They were all aware that the humans they hunted were armed and willing to kill. Cyn herself had taught Raphael and his vampires that even the most powerful among them could be destroyed by a human with the right weapon and the courage to use it.</p><p>Juro\u2019s twin brother was back at the compound tonight, overseeing security and protecting Cyn, which had taken on a new urgency in light of Murphy\u2019s information that she\u2019d been specifically targeted. That same urgency fed Raphael\u2019s hunger for blood tonight. The best way to ensure her safety was to eliminate those who sought to harm her.</p><p>Duncan moved closer. \u201cTwo sentries, my lord,\u201d he said in a whisper that only another vampire could hear. \u201cBoth eliminated.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. Around them, the night had grown utterly quiet. Any animals that might have been about earlier had taken refuge in their dens or nests, or what other safety they could find. The ultimate predator was afoot tonight, the top of the food chain on this planet, and the animals, even the human ones, knew it.</p><p>He focused on the house in front of him. It was a rough-made structure, fairly old, but well maintained and larger than he\u2019d anticipated. Instead of a pitiful cabin along the lines of Hugh Pulaski\u2019s, this was more like the hunting lodges of old Europe\u2014drafty structures with few private rooms designed to accommodate the lord and his retinue in what passed for comfort back then. The building in front of him had been expanded not too long ago, probably in anticipation of their killing spree. The additional wing was obvious and the sharp bite of fresh wood still stung his nose. The windows were covered with thick curtains, but there was light visible around the edges, and there were definitely people inside.</p><p>There was no music or television to be heard, and only muted conversation, which only made his task easier. He listened closely and isolated the beating hearts of\u2014he cocked his head, counting\u2014thirteen humans, one of whom was near death. With the two sentries whose hearts would never beat again, that made fifteen humans altogether. Raphael had himself and seven vampires, including Duncan and Juro. It was hardly a fair fight. For the humans.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged away the fa\u00e7ade of humanity that he wore like a cloak, released the bonds that kept his power concealed and let it flow out of him like a river of molten silver. It warmed his veins and sped the pumping of his heart, pushing his lungs to expand more fully with every breath. It was a heady rush that had his lips drawing back in a vicious smile of pure exhilaration, his fangs emerging from his gums as he became the purest form of what he was . . . Vampire.</p><p>He lowered his head and focused on the flimsy structure in front of him. He could knock it down with a single brush of his power, could snuff out every living creature cowering within its walls. But that would be too easy, too kind to those who had dared harm what was most precious to him. And his vampires deserved to join in this hunt.</p><p>He let his power swell outward to touch the human dwelling, heard their cries of fear as the walls shook around them, tasted their terror as it drenched their cowardly minds.</p><p>\u201cGarry McWaters,\u201d he whispered, sending his words lofting on a thread of power so that every being inside the dwelling would hear it as if spoken directly into his own ear. \u201cCome out and face me if you dare.\u201d</p><p>Raphael waited, unconcerned. There was little possibility of his prey escaping. Even if the humans somehow managed to sneak out of the house, his vampires would catch them before they\u2019d taken more than a few steps. And if by some completely unlikely stroke of luck they managed to take out one of his vampires, perhaps they deserved to live.</p><p>Or perhaps Raphael would wait until they believed themselves safe, and then he would hunt them down and kill them.</p><p>After a few moments, he heard low voices from inside, urgent words quickly hushed. The locks snapped back and the door opened. The lights within had been turned off, but that was more of a disadvantage to the humans than to him. They clearly had little understanding of whom they\u2019d set themselves against when they\u2019d taken on Raphael and his vampires.</p><p>Several men emerged finally from the shadows inside the house, edging slowly onto the narrow wooden porch where they spread out, shotguns and other weapons at the ready. Juro tensed, but Raphael watched impassively as one of their number separated from the rest, taking the steps down to the yard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The human was a big man, nearly as big as Raphael himself. His head had been shaved bald and he wore clothing similar to that of Raphael\u2019s hunters, black combat gear with lace-up boots. There were two weapons visible, and more concealed on his person.</p><p>Juro started to step forward, no doubt intending to disarm the man, but Raphael stopped him with a thought. This one was his, no else\u2019s.</p><p>Raphael frowned. There was something draped around the man\u2019s neck and shoulders, crisscrossed over his chest.</p> <p>He stared at it, then raised his gaze to the human\u2019s in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, vampire,\u201d the human taunted. \u201cPure silver. Suck on that!\u201d</p><p>Raphael exchanged a silent signal with Duncan, and then he moved. Faster than McWaters\u2019s primitive senses could detect, Raphael stripped away the man\u2019s guns and tossed them to one side, while Duncan hit the others with a mental blast that sent them reeling, dropping their weapons as they fell to their knees, one of them vomiting over the side of the porch.</p><p>Raphael took a single step back and paused intentionally, smiling at the look of shock in the man\u2019s eyes at finding himself all alone, face-to-face with the big, bad vampire, and weaponless. He recovered with admirable speed, however, puffing out his chest, confident in the protection of his silver talismans.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s smile took on a mocking edge as he reached out, grabbed one of the silver medallions studding the human\u2019s thick chest, and snapped the chain holding it in place. Flipping the hunk of silver in his fingers, he held it up in front of McWaters\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cSsssst,\u201d he hissed and laughed when the man jerked in surprise, his eyes gone wide with fear.</p><p>Raphael grinned, revealing the full length of his fangs. All around the clearing his vampires roared as they reacted to the surge of vicious satisfaction emanating from their Sire.</p><p>\u201cGarry McWaters, I assume,\u201d Raphael confirmed unnecessarily.</p><p>McWaters just stared at him, clearly terrified. And he had reason to be, because for him the terror was just beginning.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d Raphael said calmly.</p><p>McWaters started to shake his head, but Raphael slipped the command straight into his brain. \u201cNow,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The human hit the ground with a soft grunt of pain. Raphael looked down and saw the silver glow of his own eyes bathing the man\u2019s face in light. He brushed back his leather coat and began flipping the bit of silver medallion back and forth over the knuckles of his right hand.</p><p>\u201cYou should know, human, that I am Raphael. It was my mate you targeted. My mate you bragged about trapping in your cowardly ambush. My vampires you murdered in cold blood.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Cyn\u2019s pain, of Marco and Preston\u2019s terror, Raphael\u2019s vision washed out in a haze of red for a moment. Everything in him screamed for vengeance, urging him to squash this human like a bug. But he wanted him to suffer first.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s vision cleared and he contented himself with a small sliver of power, smiling in satisfaction as a series of sharp pops radiated from McWaters\u2019s right arm. The man grunted in shock at first and then screamed as every bone in his arm cracked in sequence, one at a time.</p><p>Raphael leaned closer and whispered. \u201cWhat do you think, human? Am I weak? Am I huddled in a corner terrified by your brazen display of courage in sending a dozen men to kill a single woman?\u201d</p><p>McWaters only stared up at him, his eyes wide and unfocused with pain, tears lost in the sweat soaking his pale face.</p><p>Not enough. Not nearly enough.</p><p>Raphael studied the man, pretending a curiosity he didn\u2019t feel. \u201cWould you like to beg for your life? It probably won\u2019t help, but you never know, and I\u2019m quite certain my vampires would find it entertaining.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his fear, the human\u2019s jaw clenched and he shook his head. \u201cJust don\u2019t make me one of you,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>Raphael reached down and grabbed the big man by his throat, lifting him effortlessly until his feet dangled several inches above the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Raphael crouched by what remained of Garry McWaters. The human\u2019s intestines had been shredded and were gushing poison into his system. Raphael had especially wanted him to experience the precise agony he had inflicted upon Cyn. Every bone in his body had been broken, as well, but the human was still alive, his spine still intact to ensure he felt every ounce of pain. Raphael had made sure of it. He\u2019d also made sure to retrieve every bit of information the human possessed about this plot against his vampires.</p><p>\u201cOne last lesson before I send you to hell,\u201d Raphael said, pushing his coat back behind him to get it out of the way.</p><p>\u201cNever, ever, touch what is mine.\u201d</p><p>He slammed his fist into McWaters\u2019s chest, grabbed his heart and squeezed. The human screeched feebly, the only sound he had the strength left to make. Raphael looked up and captured the man\u2019s gaze, and then he ripped the beating heart from his chest and stood, eyeing it dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cDo you think my Cyn would like a souvenir?\u201d he asked Duncan.</p><p>Duncan leaned sideways to study the dripping organ. \u201cProbably not, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael agreed. He exerted a small amount of power and the heart went up in flames, turning to ash in seconds, soon joined by the rest of McWaters\u2019s body.</p><p>Raphael brushed his hands off briskly and looked toward the house. The remaining humans were huddled against its walls, rendered harmless by terror. They still had weapons, but were unable to muster the will to use them as long as Duncan and the other vampires filled their heads with nightmare visions of what awaited them.</p><p>\u201cShall we deal with these others now?\u201d Raphael asked, flashing Duncan a quick grin. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring my hunters all the way out here only to watch.\u201d</p><p>He gave Duncan a nod and stood back, smiling in satisfaction as his vampires howled their release, as the shackles of civilization fell away and they were given free rein to hunt, to rip and tear, to drink blood flowing hot and fresh from the vein, as the heart of their prey fluttered beneath their palms. Willing donors were fine, far better than bagged blood, but nothing beat the viscous gush of heat as a vampire tore out the throat of his prey and reaped the reward of a successful hunt.</p><p>Raphael leaned against the SUV and waited, as the human killers were freed from their nightmares and the true terror began.</p><p>Sometime later, Duncan appeared from beneath the trees, strolling over to where Raphael sat in the open door of an SUV.</p><p>\u201cJudging by the photographs in Cynthia\u2019s cell phone, my lord, I would estimate that the bulk of her attackers were here. The hunters with Sophia and Mister Murphy may be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Raphael said absently. His attention was on the distant compound where Cyn was beginning to stir from the deep healing trance he\u2019d woven around her. He turned back to focus on Duncan. \u201cIs that everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Juro is cleaning up the last of them now. By morning, there will be no trace that anyone was here, other than their vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny blood traces?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cBoth inside the cabin and in two of the trucks. All human, none of them ours.\u201d</p><p>It was a delicate way of saying there was no scent of Cyn on the premises or in the vehicles. Raphael debated what to do next. He could leave things the way they were, or torch both the cabin and vehicles, leaving nothing but a blackened pile for anyone who came looking. But there would be no bodies either way.</p><p>A very few of the humans had invited death, cowering inside the cabin, believing they\u2019d be safe there, that his vampires couldn\u2019t enter the dwelling. Unfortunately for them, once McWaters died, the cabin was no longer anyone\u2019s home, which made it akin to an office building where anyone could come and go\u2014including vampires.</p><p>The rest, those who had come outside with McWaters in the first place, had at least fought back and provided his vampires with a good hunt. Not that any escaped. That was never even a possibility. And once the hunting was done, Duncan and Juro had incinerated the bodies, just as Raphael had disposed of McWaters. Not every vampire had the power to do so, but Raphael surrounded himself with power, not with weakness.</p><p>\u201cLeave the cabin as it is,\u201d he said finally. \u201cHave one of the vehicles dropped in the bar\u2019s parking lot. It will give the investigators something to think about when they discover the owner\u2019s body there. Leave the rest of the vehicles here. But make very certain the bodies are gone and any other evidence as well, Duncan. The human authorities may have their suspicions, but they\u2019ll have no proof we were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned in the direction of the compound once again, drawn almost against his will. Cyn wasn\u2019t doing it consciously, but her need called to him and that was enough.</p><p>\u201cI need to return,\u201d he said abruptly. He started around the SUV intending to drive himself, but Duncan issued a sharp command and two vampires appeared out of the darkness, their black combats reeking of blood and violence. Raphael glanced down at his own clothes. He would have to shower before seeing Cyn.</p><p>Raphael leapt from the SUV while it was still rolling, his cell phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Saephan\u2019s voice answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the building,\u201d Raphael said as Juro\u2019s twin held the door open for him. \u201cI\u2019ll shower in the guards\u2019 quarters and be there momentarily.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother asking his guards if anything had happened while he was out. If it had they would have contacted him. Instead, he took the left-hand hallway out of the great room, heading for the wing opposite the one where he had his private quarters, hitting the door to the basement stairs at a near run.</p><p>He slammed open the door of the first room he came to, noting absently that it was currently in use by one of his male vampires. The odds had favored him, but it was fortunate all the same, because he intended to borrow some clothes. Equally fortunate was the fact that this section was reserved for Raphael\u2019s personal security and those vampires tended to be bigger than average. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tore off his bloodied and filthy clothing, dropping it into a pile. Someone would retrieve it later. What could be saved would be cleaned and returned to him. Anything else would be burned. He stepped into the shower while it was still warming up, soaping his body and washing his hair with quick economical movements. He could feel Cyn\u2019s restlessness. On some level, she knew he was near and she wanted him closer. And, although he\u2019d been gone only a few hours, he needed to see her again, needed to see with his own eyes that she was well, before the sun rose and deprived him of his senses.</p><p>He rubbed a towel over his wet hair as he rummaged through the available clothing. A pair of sweats and a T-shirt came to hand, which was all he needed.</p><p>Two minutes later and he was back upstairs\u2014barefoot, his hair still wet, towel in hand, heading across the great room to his private quarters in the opposite wing. Wei Chen stepped out of the office as Raphael strode by. The Seattle nest leader opened his mouth to say something, probably to ask about the hunt, but Raphael spoke first.</p> <p>\u201cThe human woman you have working for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWill she be here tomorrow?\u201d He didn\u2019t slow down, forcing Wei Chen to hurry along next to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind an excuse to keep her tomorrow until after sunset. I\u2019ll have someone follow her when she leaves. And I\u2019ll want to meet with you privately first thing. Bring her records. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. Is there anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He turned his attention away from the Seattle leader, nodding instead to Elke who looked as if she hadn\u2019t moved the entire time he was gone. He hurried past her and entered the code to call his private elevator, waiting impatiently for it to arrive. The ride down was interminable and he shot through the opening doors as soon as they\u2019d widened enough to accommodate his shoulders.</p> <p>Dr. Saephan stood, calm despite Raphael\u2019s precipitous arrival. No doubt he\u2019d heard the elevator\u2019s departure and known what it meant.</p><p>\u201cLord Raphael,\u201d he said, bowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cShe is well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lord. I\u2019ve removed her IV for now. The bag would have needed changing during the day, and she\u2019ll be fine without it for those few hours. What she needs most she will have, and that is you, my lord. Speaking of which\u2014\u201d</p><p>Saephan paused as if gauging Raphael\u2019s mood before continuing. Raphael tore his gaze away from Cyn to give him an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cThere is blood in the refrigerator, my lord, if you have need of it.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael didn\u2019t move. Under normal circumstances, he took blood from his mate and no other. But that was obviously impossible in her current condition. So either Saephan feared that Raphael\u2019s hunger would drive him to take blood from her anyway, and thus endanger her life. Or he was honestly concerned that Raphael might be neglecting his own health in his preoccupation with healing Cyn.</p><p>Raphael chose to believe the latter.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he said, his gaze meeting Saephan\u2019s without blinking. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael waited until he heard the doors open upstairs and close again, confirming with a quick probe that the elevator was empty. He then called it back and locked it down for the night, pulling the vault door across the small vestibule and securing that as well.</p><p>Stripping off his borrowed clothes, he slipped into bed next to Cyn. She was wearing one of Raphael\u2019s t-shirts, obviously selected by Dr. Saephan after bathing her. Cyn rarely wore nightclothes of any kind and almost certainly had not brought any with her on this trip. Raphael experienced a surprisingly visceral pleasure at seeing her in his clothes and mocked himself silently. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t as far above primitive man as he liked to believe.</p><p>He slid closer, wrapping his body around her carefully. \u201cI\u2019m here, lubimaya,\u201d he said unnecessarily. Cyn\u2019s entire body relaxed as she turned into him, her breath running out in a long, slow exhalation that warmed the naked skin of his chest. Raphael closed his eyes in relief and placed a gentle hand beneath the shirt she wore, resting it against the bare skin of her lower back. They both needed the contact. But in this case, his need might have been greater than hers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he murmured. He fell asleep to the strong beat of her heart against his ribs, not even noticing when the sun began its daily ascent.</p> <p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Colin sat in the front passenger seat, giving Robbie directions to the next address on the list Raphael\u2019s tech had provided. Sophie sat behind him. She didn\u2019t say anything, but he was exquisitely aware of her, almost as if she was touching him even though she wasn\u2019t. He wondered if it had something to do with the blood she\u2019d taken from him. Had it linked them somehow?</p><p>Robbie made a turn and Colin looked up. They were heading for Curtis Jenkins\u2019s place, but several people on the list were on the way, so they were stopping at those addresses as they came up. They\u2019d already checked a couple off and it had taken no time at all, since no one had been home.</p><p>There had been no word from Raphael and his party yet, but it was still too early to expect anything. After all, both of McWaters\u2019s old family places were pretty far out. Maybe he expected more because of Duncan\u2019s assertion that the vampires could come to his assistance in only minutes, no matter where they were. Or maybe it was because he was sure on some level that Garry was at one of those hidden cabins, and that his old buddy wouldn\u2019t survive the night if Raphael had anything to say about it. And Colin was pretty sure Raphael had a lot to say on that particular subject.</p><p>Not that Colin blamed him. Garry and his newfound friends had tried to murder Leighton. They\u2019d killed Leon, as well as Marco and Preston. And Garry had all but bragged about what they\u2019d done to Mariane. But after so many years of covering his back . . . Hell, maybe that was the real reason he\u2019d suggested splitting into two groups. So he wouldn\u2019t have to face up to his friend\u2019s execution. Or, rather, his former friend. He might have mixed feelings about Garry\u2019s death, but he had none at all about the past tense of their friendship.</p><p>\u201cDeep thoughts, dude,\u201d Robbie said, without looking away from the road.</p><p>Colin grunted and ran a hand through his hair, aware of Sophia listening to every word. She knew he was ambivalent about Raphael\u2019s plans for McWaters and the other humans. And she was watching him, probably wondering if he\u2019d judge her, too, before the night was over.</p><p>Colin turned halfway around in the seat. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t go with Raphael, Jeremy,\u201d he said to the vampire sitting next to Sophia.</p><p>Jeremy turned back from staring out the window. He\u2019d grown tenser with every mile they\u2019d driven away from the bar, and Colin recognized it for what it was. Fear, plain and simple. The vampire might be determined to seek revenge for his mate, but he\u2019d never been in any kind of battle before. He was scared to death.</p><p>Jeremy darted a quick glance at Sophia before answering Colin. \u201cI\u2019m only an accountant. Lord Raphael and his people are accustomed to a level of violence that is completely foreign to me. Some of them have been with him for decades and have fought challenge after challenge. I would only be in the way.\u201d</p><p>Colin shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to get into some shit here, too, you know. If we find any of these old boys, they won\u2019t go down easy.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy jerked his head in a sharp nod. \u201cYes. And I won\u2019t hold you back. I may be an accountant, but I am also Vampire. And besides, I\u2019m hoping at least one of those we find will be among the ones who attacked my Mariane. I owe her that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no problem with that,\u201d Colin assured him, aware of the morbid amusement in Sophia\u2019s dark eyes. He suspected it was over the fact that her very human lover was less nervous than a fucking vampire about going into a firefight.</p><p>And speaking of that, what the hell had she meant back at the compound when she\u2019d called him her mate? It had sure made Raphael sit back and take a second look. Shouldn\u2019t somebody have asked him if he wanted to be her mate? Hell, wasn\u2019t there even a ceremony involved? He rolled his eyes, realizing he sounded like a reluctant bride. What was next, for God\u2019s sake? Was he going to start worrying about getting a nice ring? Shit.</p><p>He was relieved when Robbie took the final curve, bringing the next house into sight. Give him a clean fight any day of the week. It was a lot easier than trying to figure out what made a vampire tick.</p><p>Robbie slowed, stopping before they left the protection of the trees. Behind them, the second SUV, with a half dozen of Raphael\u2019s hunters inside, followed suit. There were lights inside the house, but no vehicle parked out front.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Robbie asked, peering through the windshield.</p><p>\u201cI think the wife\u2019s home. They don\u2019t have kids.\u201d Colin unbuckled his seat belt. \u201cStay here. I\u2019m gonna knock on the door.\u201d Sophia\u2019s hand touched his shoulder as he climbed out and he gave her a reassuring wink as he quietly closed the truck door and headed for the house.</p><p>He took it slowly, his fingers stroking the butt of his gun. He checked both sides of the house, looking for a vehicle or even some sort of shed where one might be hidden. But there was nothing. Still, he took the steps cautiously and listened at the door for a moment before knocking.</p><p>The sound of a television immediately went silent. He knocked again. Someone cursed, and he heard what sounded like a recliner being lowered and then footsteps approaching the door. Whoever it was had on mule slippers. He could hear them slapping against a hardwood floor with every step. The door swung open.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d The woman standing there didn\u2019t look or sound happy to see him.</p><p>\u201cJan,\u201d he said politely. \u201cGordon home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like he\u2019s home? You see a big, black truck out there anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t, but it\u2019s always possible it\u2019s in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t. You want Gordon, you best be heading over to Curtis\u2019s. The whole lot of \u2018em are cooking up something over there. And before you ask, I don\u2019t know what the hell it is and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Colin didn\u2019t immediately react, she made a disgusted sound. \u201cIs there anything else? I\u2019m watching my shows.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ll check out Curtis\u2019s like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whoop-dee-doo. Jesus H. Christ,\u201d she muttered, already closing the door in his face.</p> <p>Colin grinned in spite of himself. Before he\u2019d gotten two steps down the stairs, he heard the clunk of a recliner slamming backwards, followed by a wave of canned laughter as Jan returned to watching her shows.</p><p>He was still smiling when he climbed back into the SUV.</p><p>\u201cShe looked right happy to see you standing on her doorstep, Murph,\u201d Robbie observed.</p><p>\u201cYou got that,\u201d Colin agreed. \u201cShe saved us a bit of time, though. Says her husband and his buddies are all over at Curtis Jenkins\u2019s place. Looks like these boys are hiding out in someone\u2019s rec room, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaves us some time and ammunition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you find them, we won\u2019t need much ammunition,\u201d Sophia chimed in, her sexy, low voice a sharp contrast to the bloodthirstiness of her words. \u201cWe vampires favor a more direct solution to this sort of problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Robbie agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Lord Raphael in action and direct is definitely the word I\u2019d use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want blood,\u201d Jeremy said in a savage murmur from the backseat. He lifted his gaze and stared at Colin. \u201cHuman blood. I want the night itself to scream with their terror.\u201d</p><p>Colin met the vampire\u2019s intense gaze, noting the red glaze flickering over his eyes. \u201cI hope you get what you need, Jeremy,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Mariane\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Colin turned to face the front once more, watching the dark road disappear beneath them as they raced to Curtis Jenkins\u2019s house. He just hoped none of that human blood Jeremy was so hungry for would be his or Robbie\u2019s.</p><p>Chapter Forty-One</p> <p>Sophia strolled down the center of the gravel road, or maybe it was a driveway. They all looked the same and really, what did it matter which it was? The only thing she cared about were the ruts to either side where the gravel had all but disappeared into the dirt, leaving a pitted, uneven mess. She\u2019d worn her sturdy, flat-heeled ankle boots, anticipating there might be some mucking in the dirt, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to do any mucking.</p><p>She smiled, amused at herself despite the seriousness of the situation. She\u2019d have to share that thought with Colin once this was all over and they were safely back in Vancouver. Because that\u2019s where she was going. No more hiding down in South America. If Lucien was dead\u2014and it still grieved her to think so\u2014but if it was true, then she intended to be the next Vampire Lord of the Canadian Territories. And if Lucien wasn\u2019t dead? If somehow he\u2019d managed to thoroughly conceal himself while others cleaned up his mess? She frowned.</p><p>It might be better for him if he was dead.</p><p>A tiny sound brought her back to the present and the house at the end of the driveway. She eyed it curiously. All of the missing humans might not be hiding out here, but many of them were. She counted five trucks pulled up in front, like horses at a hitching post. And there was a glint of metal around the side of the house that could easily be one or two more.</p><p>Still within the cover of the forest, and camouflaged by her dark clothing, she paused, assessing the situation. She might not be as experienced in combat as Raphael and his people, or even Colin and his friend Robbie, but she\u2019d fought her share of challenges over the years. And since vampire duels were frequently to the death, especially among strangers, she wouldn\u2019t be standing here in front of this dismal dwelling if she hadn\u2019t learned how to fight . . . and win.</p><p>The house in front of her was mostly dark. Perhaps they hoped to hide their presence from the road. Or maybe Colin was right and they were all gathered in the basement. Either way, they hadn\u2019t bothered with sentries. The vampires Raphael had sent with her and Colin had already surrounded the house and reported they\u2019d found no one.</p><p>She identified Colin and Robbie as they came up behind her, their human heartbeats giving them away despite the fact that they walked nearly as silently as a vampire. They moved into position on either side of her, fading in among the trees. In response, she left the cover of the forest behind and took a single step into the yard proper. A loud click sounded and she winced, lowering her eyes against a flood of yellow light from above. Too late she recognized the scattering of ragged poles around the house for what it was. Security lights set on some sort of motion detector system which she\u2019d just set off.</p><p>Not that it mattered. She wanted to be seen. The plan was to draw the humans out of the house and this would do as well as anything else.</p> <p>Sure enough, another light snapped on over the front door just before it opened to reveal a skinny human standing behind the screen and peering out into yard. It was foolish of him to provide such an easy target. Fortunately for him, dropping him in the doorway wasn\u2019t part of their plan.</p><p>\u201cAnimals probably set the lights off all the time,\u201d Colin whispered from somewhere to her left.</p><p>Sophia nodded and took two more steps forward, making sure the human could see her.</p><p>The man jerked slightly when she appeared, freezing for just an instant too long. Further testament to his poor survival instincts. As if belatedly aware that he was spotlighting himself, the human reached back inside and snapped the light off, saying something to someone behind him before opening the screen door and stepping onto the porch. He carried a rifle of some sort, and he had it up to his shoulder. But while it was more or less pointed in her direction, even she could tell it wasn\u2019t quite aimed at her. She was, after all, only a woman and all by herself. What threat could she possibly represent to an armed man?</p><p>This was the part of the plan Colin had objected to. He\u2019d hated the idea of her standing there in the open, just waiting to be shot. Sophia had assured him she could survive almost any gunshot wound, even one to the head as long as her brain remained largely intact. Colin had responded by enumerating the list of bullets readily available which could blow her brains out the back of her head quite handily. And although he\u2019d pointed out that these were the same men who had tried to murder Cynthia Leighton, even he had admitted, when pressed, that most men would hesitate to shoot a lone, unarmed woman.</p><p>And just to sweeten the argument, Sophia had reminded him that even when they\u2019d been trying to kill Cynthia Leighton, they\u2019d shot her body, not her head. Of course, it was always possible they\u2019d been aiming at her head and had simply missed, but she hadn\u2019t mentioned that to Colin. He had enough to worry about.</p><p>The skinny human from the house took another step forward, coming to the edge of his porch, the toe of one boot hanging over the first step. He lowered the rifle slightly and did a slow one-hundred eighty degree turn as he searched the grimy yard, snapping back to her when he found nothing there.</p><p>He grinned, revealing a mouthful of even, white teeth. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he called back over his shoulder. \u201cYou gotta see this.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the gun to his side, he bounced down the four steps to the ground, landing on both feet in a puff of dirt. More men crowded out onto the porch behind him, all of them armed, some skipping the stairs to drop directly off the porch and fan out to the sides. Sophia counted quickly. Seven humans. She wondered how many Raphael had found.</p><p>\u201cIs this what them vamps have come to?\u201d the first man asked jeeringly. \u201cSending a human woman to do their dirty work? You got a message for us, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Sophia shrugged. \u201cIn my experience, women have always done the dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad enough she\u2019s a fucking fangbanger,\u201d someone muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s a fucking femi-Nazi fangbanger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more reason to off her, the way I see it,\u201d the skinny man said, his sharp gaze resting briefly on her face before continuing to search the trees.</p><p>\u201cGood lookin\u2019 enough, though,\u201d another said, taking the four steps from the porch in two long strides. \u201cMaybe we should have some fun before we get rid of her. How \u2018bout it, beautiful?\u201d he called out. \u201cYou wanna fuck a few of your own before you die?\u201d</p><p>Sophia cocked her head curiously. Interesting that they assumed she was human. Had they never seen a female vampire?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck animals,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>Several of the men swore nastily, the last of them dropping off the porch and onto the ground, where they confronted her in a rough half circle, although they were still several yards away. For all their bravado, none of them were willing to leave the protection of the herd.</p><p>The skinny one took an aggressive step forward. \u201cYou watch your mouth, bitch, or I\u2019ll fill it with something useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cHey, Curtis,\u201d one of the other men called out suddenly, \u201csomething\u2019s not right about this.\u201d Clearly the brains of the bunch, he backed toward the porch, looking around uneasily. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing out here all by herself?\u201d</p><p>Behind Sophia, Colin\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cWho says she\u2019s by herself?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, letting them see her fangs, as all around the clearing grinning vampires stepped from the cover of the trees.</p><p>The humans turned almost as one, racing for the safety of the house. Sophia reached out with her power, slamming the door and cutting off their retreat, scattering them into the arms of Raphael\u2019s hunters.</p><p>All except the skinny human, Curtis Jenkins. Jenkins was hers.</p><p>Ignoring the sounds of battle all around her, trusting completely in the ability of her fellow vampires to handle a half dozen humans and knowing Colin would watch her back, she wrapped Jenkins in bands of power and pulled him slowly, inexorably, across the yard until he was standing a couple feet in front of her, bellowing curses as he fought to break free.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d she muttered irritably.</p><p>The human\u2019s mouth continued to move, opening and closing like a fish gasping for oxygen. When no words came out, his eyes widened and he stared at Sophia in shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCurtis Jenkins,\u201d she said, smiling pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I want to fuck you after all.\u201d She frowned. \u201cOr wait, that\u2019s not right. My English . . .\u201d she added, shaking her head in dismay. \u201cLet me think. Ah. No. I don\u2019t want to fuck you. That\u2019s rather repulsive. What I want is to fuck with you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile disappeared and she slammed the human to his knees. Strangled noises filled his throat as he thrashed about, struggling to break the invisible bonds of her power. Sophia circled him slowly, amused by the way his head twisted as he tried to keep her in sight.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Jenkins, do you know where Lucien is?\u201d</p> <p>The human froze, clearly startled by her question. He stared at her in confusion.</p><p>Puzzled by his reaction, Sophia cocked her head quizzically. \u201cDo you know who Lucien is?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head frantically, eyes wide.</p><p>Sophia sighed. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d thought it would be that easy. Throwing away all pretense of humanity, she delved directly into the man\u2019s mind, ripping it apart in search of the truth. His thoughts were a cesspool of hate and resentment and she felt sullied by the touch of them. Foremost in his mind was triumph over his gang\u2019s recent attack on Raphael\u2019s mate and Colin, too. He resented that Colin had been hired for the local law enforcement job, believing he was far more qualified, although what possessed him to think so was unclear.</p><p>But the brutal assault on Jeremy\u2019s young mate was there, too, surrounded by a savage lust that sickened her soul. She destroyed that memory without hesitation, not caring what damage she caused. Reeling with disgust, she was debating whether she needed to waste anymore time on this piece of trash when a familiar face flashed briefly\u2014there and gone. Sophia dug around, trying to call it back, but it was lost in a jumble of recent memories, most of them hardly worth remembering.</p> <p>Frustration made her clumsy and she shoved the human\u2019s mind away from her too quickly. The muscles in his body seized all at once and then released with an audible snap like the release of a spring. It sent him sprawling to the ground where he lay quivering as his brain recovered from her indelicate probing.</p><p>Sophia eyed him dispassionately. She lifted a hand to end it all, pausing when she heard familiar footsteps. She turned in time to see Colin emerge from the shadows under the trees. He was carrying some sort of shotgun in one hand, and as he drew closer she detected the distinct scent of gun powder on his clothing. She blinked, suddenly registering the fact that she\u2019d heard gunfire a short time ago.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked, scanning him quickly.</p><p>Colin gave her a half smile. \u201cFine.\u201d He leaned around her, eyeing Jenkins with bored disinterest. \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d</p><p>Some remnant of Jenkin\u2019s brain recognized Colin\u2019s voice, and he grunted, drawing her attention. He was on his back in the dirt, unmoving but for his eyes which were wide open and fixed on Colin. Sophia watched him curiously, wondering if perhaps he retained just enough animal brain to think his fellow human would save him.</p><p>\u201cYou need any help here, darlin\u2019?\u201d Colin asked her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure, then I\u2019m gonna track down Jeremy. He was looking pretty green a while back.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stood on tiptoes and pulled Colin\u2019s head down for a quick kiss. He blinked, clearly startled, but his eyes sparked with pleasure nonetheless. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Colin nodded and walked past her, heading for the rear of the house. She watched him go, admiring the way he moved, that loose-hipped grace of a powerful male. She sighed with pleasure. And then turned back to Jenkins.</p><p>\u201cNow where were we?\u201d</p><p>Colin was surprised at himself. He had no qualms at all about leaving Jenkins back there with Sophie, even though he knew there was only one possible outcome. It wasn\u2019t a matter of whether the old boy would die, but how. And if Sophie wanted to do the honors, that was fine with him. Somewhere between the day he\u2019d discovered Mariane ravaged nearly to death and the afternoon he\u2019d raced Leighton\u2019s bloody body back to her vampire lover in a desperate bid to save her life, he\u2019d decided these people didn\u2019t deserve to live. And he didn\u2019t trust the courts to serve up justice when it came to vampires or the human women who loved them.</p><p>He heard a soft grunt and brought his shotgun up, his eyes searching the shadows behind the house as he advanced slowly. He\u2019d seen Jeremy disappear back here sometime ago. The vamp wasn\u2019t a soldier and it was entirely possible . . . He froze in mid-step, letting his foot drop slowly to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHey there, Jeremy,\u201d he said carefully.</p> <p>The vampire lifted his mouth from the neck of someone Colin no longer recognized, spitting out a gob of blood and flesh before treating Colin to a gruesome grin. \u201cHi, Colin,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>Colin stepped closer. The human was clearly dead, although his blood was still dripping, so it hadn\u2019t happened all that long ago.</p><p>\u201cYou know this guy?\u201d he asked, glancing at Jeremy.</p><p>\u201cWell enough,\u201d the vampire said darkly. \u201cHe was one of those who hurt my Mariane. I saw only glimpses of what happened that day, but his voice is one I recognized. I don\u2019t know his name. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Colin studied the mess that was the man\u2019s face. He shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cSophia will destroy all the bodies before we leave here tonight anyway. Even I know that much about how things are done.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. He\u2019d overheard Sophie saying something about that to the others, although he didn\u2019t have a clear picture yet of how it would come about.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably drag this one around front,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need any help with that?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy stood with that surprising speed and grace that all vampires seemed to possess. He grabbed the dead human\u2019s arm and hefted him easily, tossing him over one shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry, as if he weighed nothing at all. He grinned at Colin\u2019s look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cVampire, remember? Better get used to it if you don\u2019t want Sophia to run you ragged.\u201d</p><p>Colin watched the vampire march off with his burden like the eighth dwarf in a particularly gruesome fairy tale. And he had a feeling Sophia was going to run him ragged no matter what he did.</p><p>It was a while before they got everything cleaned up, but eventually Sophia was walking alongside him back to where they\u2019d left the SUVs tucked into a narrow turnout on the main road. The bodies were gone, reduced to ash and scattered throughout the forest, so there wouldn\u2019t be any suspicious piles of ash for some industrious crime tech to sift through. Not that it was likely they\u2019d find anything if they did. Sophie\u2019s power had produced a blaze that disintegrated flesh and bone more thoroughly than any regular flame could have done. The result had been something that more closely resembled the remains of a wood fire than any human cremation. It gave Colin pause to realize Sophie had that much power inside her, but it also made him a little proud.</p><p>He was quiet as they neared the SUVs, but he needed to know something and Sophie was the only one he could ask. \u201cYou saw what Jeremy did to that guy. I couldn\u2019t even tell who it was when he finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that . . . I mean, do you think that\u2019s what Raphael did to Garry?\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, pulling him to a stop so she could look into his face. \u201cYour friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my friend,\u201d he insisted, meeting her gaze evenly. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded slowly, acknowledging the distinction. \u201cMcWaters, then\u2014he tried to murder Raphael\u2019s mate. You saw what Jeremy did, what his need for revenge drove him to do. And Jeremy is\u2014\u201d She shook her head, as if searching for a comparison. \u201cJeremy is a child\u2019s breath compared to the most destructive storm the world has ever seen, one that destroys everything in his path without regard. And that storm is Lord Raphael.\u201d</p><p>She took his other hand, squeezing gently. \u201cMcWaters is almost certainly dead by now, and there is no benefit to be found in trying to envision things which are quite beyond most people\u2019s imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Colin looked away. \u201cMac wasn\u2019t who I thought it he was. He turned out to be about as low as a man can get. But he was a good soldier, too. And once an honorable man. It\u2019s hard. Feelings can\u2019t change on a dime, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Sometimes people disappoint us, but that doesn\u2019t change our memories of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tightened his fingers on her hand and started walking again, looking up when they reached the road and Robbie called Sophie\u2019s name.</p><p>He started toward them in the dark, holding out a cell phone. \u201cDuncan,\u201d he said and offered her his cell.</p><p>Sophie nodded her thanks and accepted the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened in irritation as she listened, but her voice remained all business. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bodies were burned to ash and scattered at random, all blood trace eliminated. None of ours were injured.\u201d</p><p>She listened a bit longer, then raised her head and asked Colin. \u201cHow long before we arrive at the compound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis late at night, we can make time. Half hour probably, forty minutes at the most.\u201d</p><p>She repeated the information and nodded in that automatic way people do on the phone. \u201cTomorrow night, then. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d She disconnected the phone and handed it back to Robbie with a murmured, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Colin and said quietly, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking her hand again and continuing toward the SUVs. He figured whatever it was they had planned for tomorrow night involved the still missing Lucien. The humans responsible for the murders might have been taken out, but Lucien had something to do with it, too, and he was still an unknown. Was he dead? Or was he pulling the strings from somewhere in hiding? Colin didn\u2019t know. And it seemed no one else did either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Colin knew one thing. He wasn\u2019t leaving Sophie\u2019s side until Lucien was rounded up and neutralized. The vampire lord was her Sire and that gave him some sort of power over her. The bastard had also called Sophie back to Vancouver, letting her and the others risk their lives, paying the price for his stupidity and sheer cowardice. But now that the mess was cleaned up, now that Lucien no longer needed Sophie, he might view her as a threat. He might be looking to get rid of her.</p><p>But Colin needed her. Now and forever. He\u2019d lost her once and he had no intention of losing her again. Jenkins and his buddies hadn\u2019t had the foresight to arm themselves with vampire killing rounds, but Colin wouldn\u2019t make that mistake. Not when Sophie\u2019s life might be on the line.</p><p>Chapter Forty-Two</p> <p>The first thing Raphael heard when he woke, the first thing he listened for, was Cyn\u2019s heartbeat, still pulsing against his chest. He\u2019d felt her there in his dreams, but that didn\u2019t stop the relief that squeezed his heart at finding her there in truth as night fell around them.</p><p>He touched his lips to her forehead, tightening his arms around her by the slightest degree.</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d she said, sounding sleepy and confused, and far too weak.</p><p>\u201cAnd who else would be lying naked in your bed, my Cyn?\u201d</p><p>He felt her smile against his skin, and in the next moment felt her tense sharply. \u201cAre you okay? Did you go\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are dead, lubimaya. The ones who harmed you, who murdered Marco and Preston and attacked Mariane. All dead.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back a little, searching his face with eyes that were weary with pain. The sight infuriated him and for a moment he wished he had a hundred more humans to slaughter for her vengeance.</p><p>Some of that must have shown in his face, because she touched cool fingers to his cheek. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am well, my Cyn. As is everyone else, including your Robbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Murphy, too?\u201d</p><p>Raphael felt a surge of jealousy that she would even ask about the human. She saw that, too, and her mouth softened into a gentle smile.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head to touch his lips to hers and she responded for the first time since her injury, opening her lips and letting her tongue brush lightly against his.</p><p>Something broke inside him at that fragile touch, so unlike their usual lovemaking. He struggled to control the emotion, not wanting her to be upset by it.</p><p>\u201cMister Murphy is unharmed, as well,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I believe he and Sophia are, as you would say, an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a history,\u201d Cyn murmured, sounding tired, as if even this short exchange had exhausted her.</p><p>Raphael kissed her mouth once more, briefly. Then her cheek and her forehead, brushing her hair back with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower,\u201d she fretted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect as you are, my Cyn.\u201d Alive, he thought privately, which was all that mattered. She would regain her strength in time. Thinking of that, he lifted his arm and sliced his wrist with his fangs.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to drink, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed open. \u201cWhat about you? If I keep drinking from you, won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fed last night,\u201d he assured her. She didn\u2019t ask, and he didn\u2019t offer to tell her whose blood it was he\u2019d dined on. But he and his vampires had all fed very well on the blood of their enemies.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s good, but I\u2019m feeling a lot better tonight. I won\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he ordered, interrupting her. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss the rest later.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, but surrendered to the inevitable. She was too weak to resist him in any event. Her mouth closed over his wrist and she began to suck. Raphael cupped the back of her head with his other hand, his thoughts drifting to the night ahead. The humans had been taken care of, but Lucien was still a problem. He needed to be found soon and dealt with permanently. Raphael could no longer tolerate the influence of a foreign vampire lord within his territory, particularly one who had brought such grief to Raphael\u2019s people.</p><p>Lucien would have to go, and Sophia would have to follow.</p><p>Chapter Forty-Three</p><p>Raphael was pulling a sweater over his head when Elke called down to say that Dr. Saephan had arrived. Cyn was asleep, but she woke when the phone rang, turning her head to watch as he opened the vault and sent the elevator up to fetch the doctor.</p><p>While he waited, Raphael called Duncan, letting him know he\u2019d be upstairs shortly and verifying their arrangements regarding the human woman Wei Chen employed. Raphael wasn\u2019t certain she was involved in recent events, but he felt she was. He had no reason that he could put a finger on. It was instinct, nothing more, but he trusted his instincts. They\u2019d brought him a long way from his father\u2019s dirt farm in Russia.</p><p>The elevator doors opened and Peter Saephan emerged, murmuring a brief greeting to Raphael while heading directly for the bed and Cyn. He was carrying a cooler under one arm and his black bag in the other hand.</p><p>\u201cMy Cyn seems much improved tonight, Doctor. She slept through the day and just woke a short time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Cyn is right here,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Saephan laughed. \u201cYou are feeling better. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I missed your smart ass self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice bedside manner, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved it just for you, darling.\u201d Saephan sat down and opened his bag. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d</p><p>Raphael watched quietly as the doctor checked her vitals, then listened to her chest and rolled up the t-shirt to examine her abdomen. Cyn winced more than once beneath his careful touch and Raphael frowned, but Dr. Saephan gave a satisfied nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, my lord,\u201d he said to Raphael and then to Cyn, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely better. But considering you were nearly dead two days ago, better is a relative term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she whispered, with only a shadow of her normal vitriol.</p><p>Saephan laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible patient, but I love you. So come on, give me the arm.\u201d</p><p>Cyn glanced at Raphael as she stretched out her arm with a sigh. \u201cGo on,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. And if I\u2019m not, you can beat up the doc here for me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael crossed the room, leaning over to give her a careful kiss. \u201cNot likely since he helped save your life, lubimaya. But be good and I\u2019ll tell you all the news when I return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews of what?\u201d she asked, her voice already fading as she yawned tiredly.</p><p>\u201cThe new Lord of the Canadian Territories.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded at the ever vigilant Elke as he came out of the elevator. She gave him an inquiring look and he stopped long enough to say, \u201cShe improves every day, Elke. When I left she was arguing with Saephan.\u201d</p><p>Elke knew Cyn well enough to laugh at this, knowing it for the good news it was. \u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Elke, for guarding her so well.\u201d</p><p>Elke was still flushed with pleasure when Raphael left her to join Duncan who met him halfway across the great room, handing him the leather coat he\u2019d left in the guard\u2019s room he\u2019d used to shower in last night. It had been cleaned and he shrugged it on as he walked. Raphael liked the coat. It was comfortable and functional. But he wore it largely for Cyn\u2019s benefit. She loved the coat, saying it made him look all vampirish and dramatic. He\u2019d actually replaced it more than once at her behest and now had several identical coats as backups.</p><p>\u201cThe woman left the compound shortly after sunset, my lord,\u201d Duncan told him as they walked. \u201cJustin and Aaron are following her and Wei Chen is in the conference room.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spent the day at Mister Murphy\u2019s,\u201d Duncan reported dryly. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Wei Chen first.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned off the great room, heading not for the big meeting room where he\u2019d greeted Sophia at the start of all of this, but for the smaller, more private conference room down the hall from Wei Chen\u2019s office.</p><p>The nest leader was waiting for him. A manila folder sat on the table in front of him and he was working busily on his PDA when Duncan opened the door. He set the device aside immediately and stood, giving a short bow.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sire,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand last night\u2019s hunt was successful.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cWe eliminated the human threat.\u201d He sat, leaning back in his chair, gesturing for Wei Chen to resume his seat. \u201cBut Lucien remains at large,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd neither Sophia nor I found any knowledge of him amongst the humans.\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen cocked his head thoughtfully, then tapped the folder in front of him. \u201cBut you believe Sandra Koepke may have knowledge of this?\u201d He nodded and opened the folder, flipping a few pages before turning the folder so Raphael could see. \u201cBefore coming to us, she worked in Vancouver, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael passed the folder to Duncan who bent over the table to read it. Raising his eyebrows at what he found, he pulled out his cell and made a call.</p><p>\u201cJustin,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhat is your location?\u201d He listened a short time, then said, \u201cWhatever it takes, stay on her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked up at his lieutenant, and Duncan said, \u201cWherever she\u2019s going, it\u2019s definitely not the address she lists as her home.\u201d</p><p>Wei Chen looked from Duncan to Raphael in surprise. \u201cMy lord, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have a vampire connection in Vancouver, or anywhere else before coming to work here?\u201d Raphael interrupted.</p><p>Wei Chen seemed badly startled by Duncan\u2019s news and it took him a moment to process Raphael\u2019s question. \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI would never have hired her if that were the case.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood without warning, prompting Wei Chen to jump to his feet. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay Ms. Koepke a visit. You are not to call her or communicate with her in any way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not, my lord!\u201d</p><p>Raphael strode through the door Duncan held open for him and down the hallway. Sophia and Murphy were coming through the doors as he reached the great room.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d he said without pausing. \u201cYou and Murphy will want to join me for this. You have a vehicle, Murphy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Murphy said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cGood. Take Sophia and follow us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, you and Juro. No one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuro is already waiting, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael smiled grimly as he pulled the door open and headed down the stairs into the cold, wet air. His instincts were screaming louder with every step he took. He wasn\u2019t certain yet what this night held, but he knew he was on the right track.</p> <p>And Lucien was waiting at the end of it.</p><p>Chapter Forty-Four</p><p>\u201cDo you know where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Sophia jerked her gaze and her thoughts away from the SUV in front of them. It was little more than square of black, with the red taillights gleaming like a demon\u2019s eyes on the dark roads. Colin had both hands clenched on the wheel and was every bit as tense as she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou heard everything I did. But it must have something to do with Lucien. He\u2019s the only string left dangling.\u201d</p><p>Colin gave her a quick glance. \u201cThis is the same Lucien who\u2019s your Sire, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is only one Lucien, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s suppose we find him. What then?\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s lips tightened unhappily and she turned away from Colin, staring at the blur of dark trees as they sped by. She would never have said as much to Raphael\u2014it shamed her to admit it even to herself\u2014but she was fairly certain Lucien had intentionally led the killers away from his own territory and into Raphael\u2019s. She didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d done it, but she understood Lucien enough to know why, especially now that she\u2019d seen the kind of men who were behind the murders. For Lucien, it would have been quite simple. He was not a fighter, but Raphael was. So why not let Raphael deal with these vicious human thugs?</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d Colin said, when she remained quiet. \u201cYou okay?</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cThose men were here because of Lucien. I don\u2019t know how, but I believe it. And I think Raphael does, too. He\u2019ll want to kill Lucien if he finds him, and he would be justified.\u201d</p><p>Colin gave her a long glance. \u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIf he did this, he deserves to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good answer, Soph.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t have another one right now.\u201d</p><p>Colin braked sharply and Sophia looked up to see the SUV ahead of them making a hard right turn. They drove along for several more minutes before Colin muttered, \u201cWhere the fuck are we going?\u201d</p><p>He started playing with the GPS device built into the dash, punching buttons and swearing softly at whatever he found.</p><p>\u201cLook at the GPS,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>Sophia did, then shrugged. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ve looked. Now tell me what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d</p><p>Colin huffed impatiently. \u201cA few more miles and we\u2019re at the Canadian border. Do vampire territories follow international lines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually. It\u2019s easier that way. But there\u2019s no checkpoint here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no border. There are places around here where you can walk back and forth pretty easily. This is the longest border in the world, you can\u2019t guard the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>Sophia got a sick feeling in her stomach. If they were that close . . . Her thoughts were interrupted as Raphael\u2019s SUV braked sharply, turning again, but onto a private road this time. The gravel here was thick, shifting smoothly beneath their tires as they drove a short distance and parked in front of a tidy little cabin. Lights glowed warmly from behind white lace curtains and tubs filled with flowers crowded a porch as wide as the cabin itself.</p><p>Colin turned off the engine. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Sophia stared at the cabin.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>She shook herself impatiently. Whatever, whoever, waited for them here, she would deal with it, because she had to. Because no matter what it was, she had dealt with worse and survived.</p><p>\u201cWe see who answers when we knock,\u201d she said matter-of-factly and opened the truck door.</p><p>She was struck immediately by the scent of all those flowers. It was lovely, the first truly pretty thing she\u2019d seen since arriving in this rainy place. Whoever lived in this house had an appreciation for beauty.</p><p>Something whispered through her mind, a touch there and gone before she was even aware of it. She caught her breath and stared hard at the homey little cabin. Impossible.</p><p>Her attention shifted as a pair of dark shapes separated from the shadows and headed directly for Raphael and his party. Vampires. They were clearly Raphael\u2019s and had been set to watch this place until he arrived.</p><p>A light came on over the door. One would have to be deaf and blind not to notice their arrival. The door was pulled back and a vaguely familiar human female appeared in the opening. Sophia took a few steps to the side to escape the porch light\u2019s glare and get a better look. She was puzzled to discover it was the woman who worked for Wei Chen during the day.</p><p>Even more puzzling, the woman took one look at who was waiting for her and instead of sensibly slamming the door, she opened the screen and stood back, welcoming them into her home.</p><p>Sophie frowned. This was not the behavior of a guilty person. So why were they here?</p><p>Whatever qualms Sophia had, Raphael had none. He started toward the stairs, and Sophia smiled as both Juro and the two vampire guards jumped to get there ahead of him. Raphael\u2019s people were fanatically devoted to his safety. She could only hope her own\u2014 Sophia froze in mid-step. Her own?</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>She took Colin\u2019s offered hand, taking comfort from its solid warmth. \u201cLet\u2019s see what Lord Raphael has in mind, Colin.\u201d</p><p>The woman was unremarkable, Sophia thought. Although not unattractive. She might have been pretty if she\u2019d taken the time to fuss. Her hair was a lovely auburn shade, but she had it pulled back into a tidy pony tail that did nothing to enhance her features, and her eyes were hidden behind sturdy wire rim glasses.</p><p>She was nervous, but who wouldn\u2019t be when confronted in the middle of the night by so many hulking vampires? It had to be terrifying to answer your door and find them waiting on your doorstep.</p><p>And yet, even knowing who Raphael was\u2014and working at the compound, she had to know what he was\u2014she smiled and invited them inside, as if she\u2019d expected them.</p><p>\u201cMs. Koepke,\u201d Duncan said with his customary calm. \u201cYou have nothing to fear from us. Wei Chen has spoken highly of you and your work for him.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded, her gaze flashing around once again, seeming to hesitate when it touched on Sophia before moving on. \u201cHow can I help you, Lord Raphael?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know why Lord Raphael is here in Seattle,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cYou know about the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I heard\u2014\u201d Her lips shut in a tight line.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d Duncan asked gently.</p><p>Sophia watched the woman closely, wondering why Raphael was bothering with such gentle inquiries if he truly believed she had something to do with the murders. And if she didn\u2019t, then Sophia\u2019s question was the same as the woman\u2019s. Why were they here?</p><p>\u201cI heard you found the awful men who did this,\u201d the woman said in a low voice. \u201cThe ones who murdered Marco and Preston and then attacked poor Mariane. And I heard that Lord Raphael and . . . that one,\u201d she added, giving Sophia a malevolent glare, \u201ckilled them all.\u201d</p><p>Sophia drew back in surprise. As far as she knew, she\u2019d never met this human before, and the woman seemed to have no problem with the others. So why the hostility toward her?</p><p>Raphael was leaning against the cold fireplace, one arm resting negligently along the mantle, as if trying to seem less than he was. Privately, Sophia thought it would take much more than a casual pose to make Raphael seem harmless, and apparently he agreed with her. He straightened impatiently, giving up the pose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of this,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat do you know about the men who committed these murders? About their connections in Vancouver?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Lucien! The abrupt awareness of her Sire drew Sophia\u2019s shocked gaze to the dark hallway. She stared as he walked slowly into the light, anger warring with relief that he was here and alive. She risked a quick glance at Raphael. He wasn\u2019t surprised. Clearly this was the reason they were here. That big bastard had known all along that they\u2019d find Lucien with this woman.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d Colin said softly as Sophia tensed, facing her Sire.</p><p>But she was too stunned to answer, staring in horror as Lucien emerged fully into the soft lamplight of the woman\u2019s living room. If Sophia hadn\u2019t heard his voice first, she wouldn\u2019t have recognized him. He was bent and feeble, his fingers bony with knobby joints and yellowed nails. His black, wavy hair, once a source of shameless vanity, was now a dull gray that drank in the light and swallowed it, hanging as stiff and straight as dried twigs. And his face\u2014his beautiful face\u2014was parched and wrinkled, jowls hanging to his chin, his once sparkling eyes concealed beneath heavy lids and coarse brows.</p><p>Sophia wanted to weep. Concern radiated from Colin like a heat lamp as he moved closer, and she knew he was prepared to defend her even though he had no idea what was causing her distress.</p><p>Her fingers brushed against his. He was too much a warrior to take her hand in an unknown and possibly hostile situation, but his hand touched her lower back briefly in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d Lucien rasped. His head rotated slowly in her direction. \u201cAnd Sophia, my treasure. I knew I could count on you.\u201d</p><p>His clouded eyes studied the other vampires in the crowded room. \u201cDuncan, of course. But I don\u2019t know these others.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then his gaze fell on Colin, standing so close to Sophia, and for one moment his eyes held their old sharpness. But then it was gone, and he smiled, baring discolored teeth.</p><p>\u201cYours, Sophia? I gave you my good taste, if nothing else, heh?\u201d He chuckled dryly and then coughed, one hand hitting the wall as he staggered into it.</p><p>\u201cSandra love,\u201d Lucien said, beckoning the Koepke woman to his side. She hurried over, her face wreathed in joy as she gazed up at the vampire lord\u2019s ruined countenance.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she whispered, her fingers reaching upward to stroke his cheek, halting inches away as if not daring to despoil such perfection.</p><p>Lucien smiled and rested his hand on her arm as she guided him to a big upholstered chair in the corner as if he was a visiting prince.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t see him,\u201d Sophia murmured, staring. The words were intended for Colin\u2019s ears, but she knew every vampire in the room caught it, too. \u201cHe\u2019s cast a glamour over her mind. She sees him in his glory, as he used to be.\u201d</p><p>Sophia tore her gaze away from the spectacle of Koepke fawning all over Lucien, and studied Raphael, wondering what would happen next. She could feel the hunger rising from every vampire in the room. It was only the fact that Lucien was her Sire that kept her own hunger from joining theirs. Vampires were predators, all of them. But among vampire lords, that instinct reached soaring heights. Raphael was the epitome of Vampire, the predator\u2019s predator. And Lucien had just shown himself to be prey.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked suddenly, needing answers before Lucien died. She stared at him, demanding that he deal with her. \u201cWhy all this subterfuge? Why\u2014\u201d She struggled to find words for a concept she didn\u2019t really understand. \u201cWhy diminish yourself like this?\u201d She gestured at their modest surroundings, although her words encompassed so much more.</p> <p>Koepke twisted around to glare at Sophia once more, but Lucien touched the human woman\u2019s cheek, stroking it softly to pull her attention back to him. \u201cI have spoken to her of you, Sophia,\u201d he said without looking away from Koepke. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she is somewhat jealous. Gently, cherie,\u201d he murmured to the human, and the familiar endearment on this old man\u2019s lips filled Sophia with fear and disgust in equal measure.</p><p>That was all he said for some minutes, but then he raised his head and met Raphael\u2019s gaze, as if asking for permission to tell his story. He had to know his situation was precarious, Sophia thought worriedly. But did he understand the extent of his danger? Did he know his actions had nearly cost the life of Raphael\u2019s mate? It was a miracle, an act of supreme restraint on Raphael\u2019s part, that Lucien still breathed.</p><p>Lucien was still staring at his fellow vampire lord, waiting. Raphael\u2019s jaw tightened perceptibly, but he nodded, a short, sharp jerk of his chin.</p><p>Lucien seemed to relax, his breath running out in a sigh. He leaned back in the chair, one gnarled hand stroking Koepke\u2019s head where she sat tucked up against his legs like a dog.</p><p>\u201cIt was a woman, of course,\u201d Lucien began. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a weakness for beauty, although it never mattered whether it was man or woman, did it, Sophia? Remember that young man\u2014ah, my apologies. We shouldn\u2019t speak of such things in front of your human.\u201d</p><p>A soft growl, little more than an audible vibration, emanated from Raphael where he stood near the empty fireplace.</p> <p>\u201cQuite right, old friend,\u201d Lucien said quickly. \u201cI am sorry for the deaths of your people. I never intended\u2014 Well, that\u2019s not quite true.</p><p>\u201cBut the woman was lovely, and I was vain. Little to be vain about anymore, I suppose,\u201d he added ruefully. \u201cAlthough ma belle Sandra sees me as I was, don\u2019t you, cherie?\u201d he said, stroking her head once more.</p><p>\u201cMy story goes back to before I became what you see. And the woman\u2014so beautiful, so very human\u2014was charmingly shocked to discover that I was Vampire, that such a thing really existed. I know now it was all a pose, but I was too blinded by her flattery to recognize it. She was intrigued by everything\u2014what I was, what I could do. And finally, by all of the others I held in my grasp. I boasted like a fool. I told her about the vampires living among humans, while neighbors, friends, even coworkers were none the wiser. I told her of our houses, our wealth.\u201d</p><p>A pink tear rolled from his eye, losing itself in the deep creases of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd I then I showed her. I showed her Giselle,\u201d he said in a barely audible voice.</p><p>Sophia jerked at the name. Giselle. It had been her face Sophia had glimpsed in Curtis Jenkins\u2019s dying memories. He\u2019d been there when the Vancouver vampire and her housemates were murdered.</p><p>\u201cYou led them right to her,\u201d she said, horrified. \u201cThey murdered her, Lucien. They killed all three of them while they lay helpless in sleep!\u201d</p><p>Lucien looked away, refusing to meet her gaze. \u201cTo my great shame,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the human woman?\u201d Raphael demanded harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out what she\u2019d done, I stripped her mind and then I killed her,\u201d Lucien said calmly. \u201cIt was too late for my Giselle and her lovers, Damon and Benjamin. Such beauty gone forever,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cand all because of me.\u201d</p><p>His voice ached with regret, but it only infuriated Sophie. What good was his regret to the vampires who had died, both here in and Vancouver?</p><p>\u201cBut killing the woman who seduced me wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Lucien continued. \u201cI knew she had told others everything I\u2019d shared with her. I might be a fool, but not so big a fool that I thought she had the stomach to do the killing herself. I took the identity of the killers from her mind. I sought them out and charmed them. And I discovered how little they knew of what we are and what we can do. They were killers, certainly. But there was no subtlety in what they did. They hated and they killed.</p><p>\u201cSo I persuaded them to move their butchery out of Vancouver and into the U.S. Into your territory, Raphael, although they didn\u2019t know that. I let them believe it was simply a matter of convenience, why kill in Canada, when they could do their killing right here at home?\u201d</p><p>Raphael had become frighteningly still, his silver-flecked eyes staring unblinking at Lucien, who seemed unaware of his danger.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Sophia interjected, hoping he would redeem himself somehow, that he would tell them he\u2019d done more than simply shove his murderous problem onto others\u2014including her\u2014to take care of. \u201cWhy send them here to kill even more, my lord? Why not stop them?\u201d</p><p>Lucien looked up at her, his eyes sunken and shadowed, and yet there was a light of compassion there, as if he knew she was hoping for an answer he couldn\u2019t give her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew I couldn\u2019t defeat them,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cThey\u2019d brought in someone new\u2014this McWaters fellow. And where the others were disorganized and mindless in their killing, he was not. He was a strategist and more than just a killer\u2014he was a highly trained, intelligent killer who hated everything we were. I had been hard pressed to deal with them before, but I didn\u2019t stand a chance once McWaters became their leader. Even worse, he brought more humans with him. Far too many for me to deal with alone.</p><p>\u201cBut it was painfully easy to turn McWaters\u2019s hatred back on the ones he despised most. It took so little encouragement on my part, just a few hints about where to look and what to look for. It was the reason he\u2019d come to Vancouver in the first place, to learn how to find and kill the vampires who\u2019d sullied his home town.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his gaze to Raphael and continued, \u201cMy vampires were so much easier to kill than yours. You know me well, Raphael. You used to chastise me for my lax ways back when we were both new to this continent, for not having even a pretense of security.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he studied his fellow vampire lord, becoming shrewd and calculating. \u201cBut I know you, too, old friend. And I knew you could defeat them. Even more, I knew nothing would stop you once they\u2019d killed one of yours.\u201d</p><p>Raphael moved faster than even Sophia\u2019s eye could follow, his eyes shooting silver sparks as he grabbed Lucien by the throat and ripped him from the chair. The human woman screamed, finding herself shoved aside where she huddled whimpering against the wall.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s rage filled the room in a rush, crushing Sophia\u2019s chest and hurting her ears as it threatened to displace every ounce of air in the small house. She raised a small cone of power, for Colin\u2019s protection even more than her own.</p><p>\u201cThey nearly killed my mate,\u201d Raphael growled, his voice so deep it rattled the dishes in the kitchen. \u201cThey butchered two of mine and nearly raped another to death.\u201d</p><p>His power grew along with his fury, becoming a storm of energy that sent furniture scraping across the floor to shatter against walls, pictures crashing to the floor with the chime of breaking glass.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sophia cried. \u201cWait. Please, Lord Raphael.\u201d</p><p>He turned to stare at her and she wasn\u2019t certain he could see her anymore. His eyes had gone solid silver, and even Duncan and the others had backed away.</p><p>Sophia was exquisitely aware of Colin standing next to her, of his terrible vulnerability if Raphael unleashed even a fraction of the power swirling around them. She tightened her own power ruthlessly. It was like knives of red-hot steel clawing at her insides, demanding to be set free, to respond to Raphael\u2019s overwhelming threat and defend what was hers. She wanted to scream in agony, to shred her own skin in a bid to release the unbearable pressure. But Colin\u2019s life, and probably hers, as well, depended on her ability to seem harmless, to offer no challenge to Raphael\u2019s execution of the vampire who had caused so much pain and loss to Raphael\u2019s children, and God save them all, to his mate.</p><p>\u201cA question, my lord,\u201d she pled. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared at her, unmoving. And then he blinked. \u201cMake it fast,\u201d he grated out and dropped Lucien back into the chair.</p><p>Sweat was pouring from Sophia\u2019s skin, soaking her clothes as she turned to face her Sire. \u201cWhy me, Lucien? Why call me back here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucien gave her a gruesome smile. \u201cYou were always my favorite, child.

He shook himself slightly and then straightened to stand unassisted and look Sophia in the eye.</p> <p>\u201cI surrender to you, Sophia. All that I am, all that I have . . . is yours.\u201d</p><p>Sophia frowned. \u201dWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>Sophia jerked as he touched her mind. She opened her mouth to protest.</p><p>Lucien shuddered once.</p> <p>And Sophia fell to her knees, screaming.</p><p>Chapter Forty-Five</p><p>Sophia\u2019s head was full of voices, crying, screaming, demanding. Wanting answers, comfort . . . love. She fought to make sense of it, to understand what was happening. And suddenly Lucien was there, showing her how to quiet the tumult, to shuffle the pleas and silence the screams. To counter the demands with one of her own. I am your lord. You will be silent.</p><p>\u201cTake care of them, cherie,\u201d Lucien whispered. \u201cBe better than I was.\u201d And with a final wash of love, he was gone, the one constant in her life for nearly three hundred years vanished, leaving a gaping hole in her soul.</p><p>She opened her eyes, sobs choking her throat as she stared at the pile of thin ash that was all that was left of Lucien. He\u2019d known Raphael would kill him. He hadn\u2019t even tried to defend himself, knowing it would be fruitless to try. Instead, he\u2019d taken the easy way out. He was already diminished by his efforts to hide from Raphael, and if his appearance was any indication, he\u2019d taken no blood nourishment for sometime. Rather than die in agony by Raphael\u2019s hand, he\u2019d simply surrendered his life along with his power.</p><p>Lucien had been her parent far longer than the humans who\u2019d given birth to her, had shown her more love and understanding, had taught her more of the world than those two strangers had ever dreamt of doing. But in the end, he\u2019d been true to his selfish nature, leaving Sophia to deal with the carnage he\u2019d left behind, to face the furious Raphael alone.</p> <p>\u201cSophie.\u201d It was Colin\u2019s voice, harsh with stress and fear. For her. He was standing over her, his gun drawn, his strong legs bracketing her. And he was facing down Raphael and his vampires. For her.</p><p>She was not alone, after all.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she croaked. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He dropped down next to her, his voice deep and warm in her ear, one arm clasping her tightly to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m here, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she whispered brokenly against his chest. \u201cLucien is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of the human, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s voice had her stiffening to attention, painfully aware of the target she made at this moment. A freshly minted vampire lord, overcome with the shock of transfer despite Lucien\u2019s efforts to ease the transition for her.</p> <p>She crumpled Colin\u2019s shirt in her fingers, fighting for composure, for the strength she\u2019d need. She loosened her hold and stood slowly, giving Colin plenty of time to adjust to her movements.</p><p>Raphael was still standing on the far side of the room. He was watching her closely, his power no longer evident but for the occasional flash of silver in his black eyes.</p><p>\u201cLord Raphael,\u201d she said, her voice still rough with emotion.</p><p>\u201cLady Sophia,\u201d he acknowledged meaningfully. \u201cI propose an alliance.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart was pounding, but she met his gaze evenly. She couldn\u2019t afford to show weakness and yet she would do almost anything to get herself and Colin out of here alive. But an alliance? She\u2019d never heard of such a thing. Not among vampire lords.</p><p>Her thoughts sped, trying to reason out Raphael\u2019s motives, to calculate her own benefit in such an arrangement. And wondering why he would propose such a thing and what he would expect in return. In all of this, however, one thing was certain. She would be vulnerable for some time as she built her power base essentially from scratch. The weaker vampires in the territory would simply accept her, grateful they had survived the trauma of Lucien\u2019s death and that someone had been willing to step up and keep them alive.</p><p>But Lucien\u2019s stronger children, few as they were, would have to be brought to heel, would have to swear loyalty to her in person one by one, and some of them would challenge her. Many of them didn\u2019t know her and even those who did hadn\u2019t seen her in decades and would assume she was weak because she was female and, frankly, because Lucien had chosen her. His preference for beauty over practicality was well known, even among his children.</p><p>But if Raphael supported her, if it was known that he at least would not oppose her and would not make a move on the territory as long as she was its ruler . . . That would go a long way toward smoothing her takeover, to soothing doubts and damaged egos.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind, Lord Raphael?\u201d she asked, making her voice as cool and controlled as she ever had.</p><p>Raphael smiled, as if he knew the effort it cost her, the arrogant bastard.</p><p>\u201cYou rule your territory and I rule mine. But when certain matters come before the Council, matters which are to our mutual benefit\u2014\u201d His black eyes turned flat and cold. \u201c\u2014you agree to be guided by my greater experience.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wasn\u2019t fooled by the polite language. Nor was she fooled into thinking he would let her live if she didn\u2019t agree . . . or if she tried to renege later on. But in the final analysis, it was still a good deal for her.</p><p>\u201cI accept your offer,\u201d she said, with a formal little tilt of her head.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He paused for a polite few seconds. When he continued, his voice and manner were both inflexible. \u201cGiven the late hour, and our newfound alliance,\u201d he added deliberately, \u201cyou have twenty-four hours to leave my territory. I assume Mister Murphy will accompany you back to Vancouver. Arrangements will be made by my people to act as agents in the disposition of his affairs within my territory.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her agreement, but strode for the door, pausing just before he exited into the night. \u201cCongratulations, Lady Sophia.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly it was all over.</p><p>Lucien was a pile of ash on the carpet.</p><p>Raphael was gone.</p><p>And Sophia was Lord of the Canadian Territories. She shuddered, a hard, full-body jerk that had Colin wrapping his arm around her in concern. She permitted herself a moment to relish the heat and comfort of his big body, and then she straightened and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded as the two vampire guards followed him out onto the porch and locked the house door behind them. Raphael and Duncan were gone, so was Juro. They\u2019d left right after the dustup and taken the Koepke woman with them. Justin and Aaron, the two vamps who\u2019d followed Koepke home from work for Raphael, had stayed to clean up the house. They\u2019d also disposed of what was left of Lucien after he fucking disintegrated\u2014and that was something Colin could very happily do without ever seeing again.</p><p>The two vamps gave Sophie a wide berth as they circled around the yard and climbed into their vehicle. She was sitting on the passenger seat of the Suburban, turned around so she faced the open door. Which was right where Colin had left her after hustling her out of that house.</p><p>He waited in the yard, watching the vamps leave, and thinking about what to say to Sophie. Lucien had apparently passed his mojo\u2014Colin refused to call it magic\u2014to Sophie and then offed himself. Or maybe it was the transfer of mojo that killed him. Who the hell knew? It didn\u2019t really matter. If the old guy hadn\u2019t done himself in, Raphael sure as hell would have done it for him.</p><p>For a while back there, Colin had thought he was going to have to defend Sophie against that whole bunch of badass vampires. He\u2019d figured he could take out a few before they got to him and had hoped it would be enough for Sophie to get away.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t been necessary because his Sophie turned out to be a badass vampire all her own. He grinned, liking the idea, and suddenly he knew what to say to her.</p><p>He waited until the vamps\u2019 SUV made it down the drive and turned left onto the highway leading back to the compound before walking over to see what was up. Because something was definitely up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Colin took one look at Sophie\u2019s face when she raised her head to glance at him and amended that thought. Not up, down. Definitely down.</p><p>He edged in closer, resting his hands along the outside of her thighs and rubbing them slightly. \u201cTalk to me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes, long enough that Colin was about to nudge her again before she finally pressed her hands against his and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived in Vancouver,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand discovered Lucien was missing, my first desperate thought was that we had to find him. But my second thought was that if he was dead, I would do anything it took, fight and kill anyone who stood in my way, to seize his territory for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with ambition,\u201d Colin said confidently.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s not. But now that Lucien is dead and the territory really is mine, I can\u2019t help wondering what the hell I was thinking.\u201d She shook her head, laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cBut you took it without a fight. That\u2019s gotta be good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only that were true. But the fight is just beginning.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into fists against his, and he shifted, taking her hands in his and smoothing her fingers gently.</p><p>\u201cMost of Lucien\u2019s people won\u2019t care if I\u2019m the one who succeeds him, as long as I don\u2019t demand anything more from them than he did. But there are others who will only pretend to offer support while they wait for me to fail. They\u2019ll watch for every mistake, for any shred of weakness. And until I have a chance to create vampires of my own, people I can trust, I\u2019ll have to be on guard every moment, wondering whom I can trust and where the stake will come from. And then there are those who will point to every sign of anger, every tiny mood, every hint of indecision as proof that a woman simply doesn\u2019t have what it takes to rule. It exhausts me just talking about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Colin said, raising each hand in turn and kissing her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Sophie. Until you can make your own vamps, I\u2019ll be the one who stands guard and watches for that stake so you won\u2019t have to. And if you get angry, you can yell at me. If you get down or just need a sounding board, I\u2019ll be there. And at the end of the night, when we\u2019ve locked the door and it\u2019s just you and me again, I\u2019ll strip you naked and we\u2019ll make love until sunrise, because I happen to love every womanly inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Sophie slid off the seat to stand in front of him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>Colin tugged her closer, pulling her into his arms while resting one hand on the curve of her delicious butt. \u201cHold me anyway you want, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said, pulling back to see his face. \u201cYou do understand that if you go with me to Vancouver, if you continue to take my blood . . .\u201d She paused, searching his eyes. \u201cWe will live a very long time together. You need to be sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed with relief, squeezing her tightly. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I, darlin\u2019. And I am sure.\u201d He bent his head and kissed her, drinking in the sweet warmth that was his Sophie, feeling her soften in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sophie,\u201d he murmured against her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cColin,\u201d she said breathlessly, her eyes wide open and staring into his from only inches away. \u201cYou\u2019d really leave your home here and go with me to Canada?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try to keep me away. I do have one question, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cJust one. Who says we have to clear out on his high and mighty\u2019s timetable? There\u2019s plenty of hours left before sunrise and Vancouver\u2019s not that far. I say we blow this place tonight and the hell with Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Sophia fisted her fingers in his hair and pulled him in for a quick, hard kiss. \u201cI like the way you think, meu querido. You drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I\u2019m gonna drive. Don\u2019t let this vampire lord thing to go your head, woman.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie was still laughing as they drove out to the highway and turned right, heading for Canada.</p><p>Chapter Forty-Six</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t destroy Sophia,\u201d Duncan observed quietly, as they sped back to the compound.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question; Duncan would never have questioned him. But Raphael heard the curiosity in his lieutenant\u2019s voice. He considered the statement for a few moments, then said, \u201cIn the end, she wasn\u2019t really a part of this. Lucien played her just as he did the rest of us. But mostly, I want the Canadian territory stable, and she\u2019s strong enough to hold it. She\u2019s also indebted to me now. That will be far more useful in the coming days.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThe Koepke woman didn\u2019t know Lucien was using her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael agreed.</p><p>\u201cLucien knew her in Vancouver. He\u2019d never bound her to him, but he\u2019d used her. It was easy for him to find her and use her again.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head irritably. \u201cLucien might have pointed the killers at Marco and Preston, but they didn\u2019t need him for the addresses. They\u2019d both been here long enough that people knew where they lived. They may not have gotten out much, but they did go out, and Marco\u2019s horses made it easier to identify his property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven so, my lord, if they\u2019d only upgraded their sleeping arrangements, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cWhen the new compound was commissioned, I authorized whatever expenditure was necessary to bring everyone\u2019s security up to modern standards. Loren was to have seen to it.\u201d</p><p>A few more miles went by as Raphael thought about everything that had happened since they\u2019d arrived, all the details that had slipped his mind in his worry over Cyn. His hand tightened into a fist as he fought the urge to punch something. Or someone. But Loren wasn\u2019t here, and Lucien was no more.</p><p>\u201cI want someone new brought in,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cSomeone from outside the Seattle nest. Wei Chen can remain the nominal leader, but I want a strong head of security, someone more powerful than Wei Chen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll compile a list, my lord. Do you want it before we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re leaving first thing tomorrow night. Cyn will be able to travel by then and I want to take her home.\u201d</p><p>They pulled through the compound\u2019s gate, Juro guiding the SUV to a smooth stop below the stairs to the main building. One of Raphael\u2019s security contingent was waiting. He pulled the door open and Raphael climbed out, giving the vampire a nod of greeting.</p><p>As he started up the stairs, Duncan joined him. \u201cHow is Cynthia, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Raphael gave his lieutenant a small grin. \u201cWell enough to fight with Doctor Saephan over his restrictions.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed. \u201cI would expect nothing else. I will see you both tomorrow evening, then, my lord. I will make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>The next night came none too soon for Raphael, nor for Cyn, although for all her professed eagerness to return to the comfort and security of their home, there was something troubling her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t push her, though, knowing she\u2019d eventually tell him what it was.</p><p>He glanced over to where she sat on the bed, resting after the exertion of her first shower since the shooting. She\u2019d managed to pull on her underwear and a sweater, but her long legs were bare, and far too thin.</p><p>Doctor Saephan had finally permitted her to eat something this evening. Or rather to drink something. He\u2019d arrived bearing a high protein liquid shake instead of the usual blood bags. He\u2019d made it up for her himself, adding plenty of chocolate syrup, which testified to how well he knew his patient. Cyn hadn\u2019t even whispered a protest.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>He shook himself out of his thoughts and smiled at her, picking up the yoga pants she\u2019d chosen to wear.</p><p>\u201cStay there, lubimaya. I\u2019ll put these on for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d he agreed, standing in front of her. \u201cNow, slide over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy,\u201d she muttered, but she did as he asked, sitting on the edge of the bed while he slipped the pants over her feet and up her legs. He held out a hand and she took it, letting him help her stand and then support her while she wiggled the pants over her hips.</p><p>\u201cI look awful,\u201d she said miserably, stepping into her shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. You look beautiful, as always.\u201d</p><p>But her eyes when they met his were shining with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t want everyone staring at me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ah, he thought to himself. So that\u2019s what it is.</p><p>\u201cThen no one will,\u201d he told her and pulled out his cell phone. \u201cI want the great room cleared, Duncan.\u201d He looked around, gauging their departure time. Everything was packed and ready, except for Cyn. \u201cIn five minutes. You, Juro and Elke. The rest of our security can wait in the vehicles outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Raphael,\u201d she said, then gave him a weak grin. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be the king, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re my queen, lubimaya.\u201d He bent over and touched his lips to hers. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He scooped her up easily. She was too weak to fight him, but she didn\u2019t try very hard, wrapping her arms around his neck and resting her head on his shoulder. He touched his cheek to her freshly shampooed hair and smiled, remembering her almost orgasmic sigh when he\u2019d washed it for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the shower,\u201d she murmured, stroking one finger along the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d he scolded, carrying her to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few days,\u201d she said softly, switching her finger to the curve of his ear. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re just toying with me.\u201d</p><p>Cyn nestled into the curve of his shoulder, her kiss soft and moist against the underside of his jaw. \u201cHave I told you you\u2019re my very favorite vampire?\u201d she murmured tiredly.</p><p>\u201cNot often enough,\u201d Raphael said smoothly, fighting a tidal wave of emotion at how light she was in his arms, how very fragile.</p><p>He felt the curve of her lips as she smiled against his skin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that. I love you, fang boy.\u201d</p><p>Her body softened and Raphael knew she was close to falling asleep. He tightened his hold on her, the terror of almost losing her still too fresh and too horrible to remember. He didn\u2019t know what he would have done if she\u2019d died. But he knew one thing . . . She wouldn\u2019t have died alone.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Malibu, California</p><p>Raphael settled the phone back on its cradle and shared a sober look with Duncan, who sat across the desk from him in one of the two visitor chairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will miss you. Cyn will\u2014\u201d He lifted his head and nearly groaned. \u201cCyn will be joining us soon.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stood immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy, my lord,\u201d he said and headed for the doors.</p><p>Raphael laughed grimly. \u201cCoward.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grinned, bowed slightly from where he stood at the open door and disappeared down the hall.</p><p>Raphael sat alone, tracking Cyn\u2019s movements as she drew closer to his office, automatically gauging her mood and her physical well-being. She\u2019d made considerable progress since coming home from Seattle, but she was far from her usual fighting form, and she still tired much too easily. He hated that he was about to upset her. Hated the news he was about to deliver almost as much as he hated telling her about it. But now that the decision was made, word would travel like fire through the household, and she would be angry and, even worse, hurt if she heard it from someone else first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>The doors pushed open and Cyn strode into the room.
