But I am the one who\u2019s here to take you to the angels.\u201d I add a friendly smile to make her feel more at ease.</p><p>She considers this for a moment, then turns back to look at her grieving parents who sit agonised by her bedside.</p><p>\u201cWill I ever see them again?\u201d I can hear the tremor in her tiny voice, sadness I know it to be.</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know when, but one day you will see them again.\u201d</p> <p>This I\u2019m not privileged to have seen with my own eyes, but it is what the Elders tell us to be true.</p><p>I deliver humans to the door of Heaven. To their door into Heaven, but don\u2019t truly know what occurs when they pass through. But I do know it to be something wonderful, giving joy and happiness to all who go there.</p><p>I\u2019m a Bringer.</p><p>It\u2019s what I do, and have done since I\u2019ve existed. I\u2019m here to guide, to make humans feel as comfortable as possible through their, mostly unwanted, transition from being alive to just being.</p><p>Humans struggle to leave behind the ones they love. And for their sake, I have to ensure they don\u2019t try to stay here on earth, trapping themselves for all eternity. Because once they walk away from Heaven, they will never, ever, be able to go there. Once their door closes, it never again opens.</p><p>I glance over at her parents. The mother is sobbing, clinging to her daughter\u2019s lifeless hand. The father has silent tears trickling down his cheeks as he desperately tries to comfort the mother. They both appear broken, beyond repair.</p> <p>Humans always take the death of a child the worst. I think I understand why this is.</p><p>I have seen what these two people are feeling hundreds, of thousands, of times before. Have been told in vivid description by many humans who I\u2019ve taken to Heaven how it feels, but have never felt it myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel.</p><p>Not in the physical or emotional sense. I have an awareness of feelings - sorrow, happiness, love, pain, compassion. I also note the sensation of touch. But I don\u2019t actually feel it.</p><p>I do comprehend the joy and beauty in things, such as the sun rising in the bright blue sky, or the sound of a songbird singing gaily in the morning. Just not in the same way as a human does.</p><p>I know of all the feelings that surround me every day, but they just don\u2019t attach themselves to me.</p><p>That\u2019s just how it is \u2013 Bringers don\u2019t feel.</p><p>I believe we were conceived like this, so we don\u2019t attach ourselves to humans in any way.</p> <p>Often, though, I do wonder how it would be to feel.</p><p>With what I see in every single moment of my existence it obviously presses me to peruse the question which is worse - to feel the agonising pain of loss, or to have never felt it at all?</p><p>I have no concept of what it is like to love someone with such ferocity that it rips you to your very core to lose them. My imagination limits my understanding.</p><p>I just sometimes wonder, what if . . .</p><p>The child I\u2019m here to take to Heaven \u2013 Amy Jones, as I know her to be called - takes one last look at her parents, at her body, then turns and tentatively walks toward me. Her movement slow, reluctant.</p><p>It\u2019s strange that humans have two names. Sometimes they have three, four, sometimes more. I have only one.</p><p>When Amy Jones reaches me, she slips her tiny hand into mine and looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like my mamma,\u201d Amy Jones says, inclining her head toward her mother.</p><p>I ponder that for a moment.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>It intrigues me how I look to each human. They see me as whichever female human form makes them feel most comfortable. Like now, with Amy Jones, she chooses to see me akin to her mother, thus making her feel safer. They do this unknowingly.</p><p>I have never seen myself. I have no reflection upon which to do so. When I look down all I see is a solid mass of light, alike to the shape of a human body, which glistens and sparkles, just as the snow does when the sun is gently dancing off it.</p><p>Often I have wondered what my true appearance is, or if I at all have one.</p><p>I look at the mother again. To my eyes she looks to be visually pleasing. Hair the colour of ripe cherries, skin the colour of the pale moon, eyes the colour of emeralds.</p><p>Is this exactly as I look now?</p><p>I glance down at Amy Jones about to ask this very question, when I see a faraway look in her eyes, sadness covering her face. And very quickly, my question becomes incredibly futile.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d I ask instead.</p><p>Her eyes glitter up at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name angel?\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself. Children never believe I\u2019m not an angel. I think it somehow comforts them to think I am.</p><p>\u201cLucyna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d she hums my name over her plump lips. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty name. Am I going to Heaven, Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Amy Jones you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be staying with me in Heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can only remain with you until we reach Heaven\u2019s door.\u201d</p><p>Her face saddens. \u201cThen will I be alone?\u201d The fear is so apparent in her voice, it practically tremors across the room.</p><p>\u201cNo, you will be with others. Many others just like you. You\u2019ll never be alone.\u201d</p><p>She mulls over my words for a moment. Her tiny lips trembling ever so slightly. She bites down on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Lucyna. I think I\u2019m ready to go to Heaven now.\u201d I sense her hand tightening around mine.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d I say.</p><p>Her heavily lashed lids close slowly. I can sense her fear. Her apprehension of stepping into the unknown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear Amy Jones, you\u2019re safe,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I close my eyes and we\u2019re gone.</p><p>I\u2019ve returned to Earth since taking Amy Jones to Heaven as I wish to spend some time at my favourite place \u2013 Hyde Park in London - before I take my next human to Heaven, my next 'bring\u2019 as we refer to it. London, coincidentally, is where my next human happens to be. Not that it would matter where I am, as it only takes me a matter of seconds to travel. I close my eyes, think where I want to be, and there I am.</p><p>I see my friend Arlo already here, sitting on our usual bench. He too must be waiting for his next bring. We Bringers have no need to sit, to rest, as we never tire. We do so, I suppose, in attempt to adapt to the environment around us.</p><p>I glance around Hyde Park. There are a few humans milling about, taking in the wonderful sights. This place fascinates me. Over time I have observed with interest the beautiful sights it has to offer. Year after year I have watched it travel through its seasons, noting how the trees sprout greening leaves that spiral around the willowy branches, creating the most incredible shades of greenery, for them to only turn to burnt amber as they succumb to wane, and fall unwillingly from their dwelling. Lastly they end their journey on the Earth\u2019s floor, leaving the tree bare, only for it months later to once again begin its cycle. And I am charmed by all the differing varieties, of colourful flowers. I watch as they explode into bloom. Then ultimately, and sometimes untimely, fade and die.</p><p>Just as humans do.</p><p>Arlo and I have been to places all over the world, seen all the extraordinary sights that God has to offer, but sometimes it is the simplest of things that can be the most captivating.</p><p>The bench Arlo is sitting on has a plaque with an inscription scribed on it. It reads \u2013</p><p>\u2018John, I\u2019ll love you always and I know we\u2019ll be together again one day. In the fields of Heaven, when God calls for me to come join you, where I know you\u2019ll be waiting patiently for me. Ava\u2019</p><p>I always sit on this bench, one that has been marked by a human loss. It feels very much in time with who I am.</p><p>Humans always mark the death of ones they love. Whether it\u2019s a headstone at a grave or a bench very similar to this one. I think I understand why they do this. An expression of how much they truly meant to them.</p><p>They really do have some very strange ways, which is why I find them so fascinating. Arlo is also intrigued by them. We spend almost all our free time together watching humans, discussing them. Seeing how they interact with one another. We spend countless hours puzzling over them. How they think. How they feel. Why they behave as they do.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d I ask as I approach Arlo.</p><p>He looks up at me, his yellow hair glowing in the light of the sun. \u201cEighteen minutes. And hello to you, Lucyna.\u201d</p><p>Arlo is always very precise and to the point.</p><p>\u201cHello, Arlo,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>Taking my seat beside him, I pause momentarily, hovering over a question that I have wanted to ask him for some time, a question which has now been piqued by my visit with Amy Jones.</p><p>\u201cArlo, may I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>He turns to me. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I look to you?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me puzzled.</p><p>I refresh my words. \u201cI know our appearance changes according to each human, but for some time now I have wondered how I actually look to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Arlo looks as though I have ignited a thought within him. \u201cYou have never wondered this before, Lucyna?\u201d It almost isn\u2019t a question, but I answer anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have thought of it many times before Arlo, but have never asked you. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure why. It\u2019s very curious to me.\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at him. His bright eyes are gazing upon me with seeming concentration.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you wish me to describe?\u201d</p><p>I take a moment to think this over before answering. \u201cWhat colour is my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack. As black as the night sky,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is my eye colour?\u201d</p><p>He ponders this for a moment, rubbing his forehead in thought. \u201cWell, I would say they are like the colour of the waters that surround the Maldivian Islands. I would have to go back and check that I am correct in this, but that is what I believe to be true. I can go now if you wish -\u201d His eyes close, readying to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo, Arlo, there is no need. I take your word on this.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes.</p><p>I now find myself even more curious. I thought by asking Arlo these questions it would end my wondering, but it now seems to have only furthered it.</p><p>How I wish I could see what Arlo sees when he looks at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I, Lucyna, how do I look to you?\u201d Arlo says, breaking into my thoughts.</p><p>Putting aside my own contemplation, I turn and look at him even though I do not need to. I would know how Arlo looks even if my eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cYou, Arlo, have the most glorious hair. It\u2019s the colour of the sun, and your eyes, well they are the colour of sugar snap peas.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadens at my words.</p><p>I glance back at the few humans around us, gliding through life. Completely unaware of our existence.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think we cannot see ourselves, Arlo, as others do?\u201d</p><p>But before he gets a chance to answer, my mind begins to fill with the name of my next bring. I\u2019m always informed of when and where in good time, but I don\u2019t receive the name until two minutes before the human is about to leave their body for good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, Arlo. Time for me to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to now, Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChelsea and Westminster Hospital, here in London,\u201d I say, as I prepare to travel. \u201cWe shall continue our discussion later?\u201d</p><p>He nods in response.</p> <p>\u201cI shall see you soon, then.\u201d</p><p>I hear the beeping of machines and frantic commands of human voices before I even open my eyes.</p><p>Humans have ones they call doctors who take care of others when they are ill or dying. I do admire them. Their determination to cure and save is awe inspiring. But unfortunately for them, when a human is truly dying, when God has called that one to Heaven, no one, or nothing can save them.</p><p>The doctors are working tirelessly on the human I know to be called Maxwell Harrison, but I know that their tiresome work will not save him to his body. My being here says so.</p><p>He appears at the end of the bed where his body still lies.</p> <p>Maxwell Harrison is an older human, but he hasn\u2019t died from old age. His death was meant to be when his when his heart ceased to work.</p><p>Positioned by the doorway, I begin my patient wait, allowing Maxwell Harrison the time he needs to come to this new realisation.</p><p>Suddenly he spins around, his eyes frantically searching the room.</p><p>He locks them onto me and visibly wavers at my sight. Then his eyes narrow in his glare. \u201cTell me ... am I dead?\u201d I can see panic and fear gripping his face, not an unusual sight for me.</p><p>Some humans are prepared for death; they know its coming. Some don\u2019t. These are the ones it hits the hardest. But all humans, though, however much prepared, will fear the unknown. It\u2019s inbuilt. It\u2019s in their nature to do so. That\u2019s just being human, I suppose.</p><p>\u201cYes, Maxwell Harrison you are,\u201d I answer with finality.</p> <p>\u201cAnd who are you \u2013 my angel?\u201d I hear what I believe to be sarcasm adjoining his already gruff voice. \u201c ... because listen to me, angel,\u201d he continues. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to be dead. It\u2019s not my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it is your time.\u201d I speak candidly.</p><p>\u201cAnd who says so \u2013 you?\u201d</p><p>I decide not to answer his question with words, instead raising my eyes up to Heaven.</p><p>He laughs. A big raucous laugh, it bounces off the walls. \u201cThe big man upstairs? Give me a break! Trust me, he certainly wouldn\u2019t want an old reprobate like me in Heaven. I\u2019ve definitely been no angel in my time.\u201d He nods at me. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d There\u2019s a grave expression on his face, but a smile is curving the edge of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an angel, Maxwell Harrison.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with open surprise. \u201cSo, what are you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me your guide to Heaven.\u201d</p> <p>He hovers over my words for a moment before speaking. \u201cSo \u2013 guide, why don\u2019t you just put me back in my body, and we can forget all about this.\u201d</p><p>I slowly shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not a possibility.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his broad shoulders. \u201cWell a guy\u2019s gotta try, huh.\u201d I catch a gleam in his eyes before he turns back to his body.</p><p>The doctors have finally given up trying to save Maxwell Harrison, and with much resignation they all quietly move around the room carrying on with their job in the aftermath of a human death.</p><p>One of the doctors begins speaking to another. This appears to prick Maxwell Harrison\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out and tell the son,\u201d the doctor says.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d he utters. His eyes follow the doctor to the door, just skimming past me, and his gaze remains there until moments later when a man enters the room.</p><p>The man is younger than Maxwell Harrison, but very similar looking. He has the same intense, deep brown eyes.</p><p>I watch him slowly walk over to the bed where Maxwell Harrison\u2019s body remains. Then all of a sudden, something unexpected and inexplicable hits me, almost knocking me off my central balance. It appears like a veil of shimmering light, wrapping itself all around me. And no sooner is it there, it\u2019s gone.</p><p>What on earth . . .?</p><p>The man\u2019s face crumples up with pain. \u201cOh, dad,\u201d he whispers, laying his trembling hand on Maxwell Harrison\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat am I gonna do without you?\u201d</p><p>I continue to watch the man as the shock of what just happened reverberates through me. Tears are tumbling down his cheeks, dripping freely onto his chest. He roughly wipes at his eyes.</p><p>Maxwell Harrison looks forlorn as he walks up to the man. He reaches his hand out to him, pauses, and turns back to me.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch him?\u201d</p><p>It takes me a moment to answer, to find the words, as my mind is spinning with confusion.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I eventually say, \u201cbut know that he won\u2019t feel you.\u201d</p><p>He bows his head in submission and lays his hand tentatively on the man\u2019s back. \u201cJames, I\u2019m here. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Then out of nowhere I do something very out of character. I move from my stance by the doorway. This is not something I have ever done before. I don\u2019t even realise I\u2019ve moved until I find myself there, standing at the other side of the bed, looking across at the human Maxwell Harrison calls James. And I mean really looking at him.</p><p>Of course I always observe humans, but never truly look at them properly. Usually, I only bother to graze my eyes over their external features, my interest only ever laying in their minds, their emotions, their feelings. But as I stand here looking at James, I appear to be looking for more as I attempt to absorb every fine, physical, detail of him. I\u2019m intrigued by the structural shape of his face. The depth of brown that colour\u2019s his hair. His sun stained skin. The scar splicing his brow. His broad nose, and chiselled jaw line. His perfectly lined teeth and the full lips that adorn them. I watch with fascination as tears glisten on his lashes, sparkling against his intense, dark eyes.</p><p>And as I stand here, soaking up every microscopic detail of him, I\u2019m suddenly struck by the shimmering light again. Only harder this time. It seems to grasp hold of me, wrapping around me, knocking me backwards, lingering slightly longer than before, then, once again, gone as if never here.</p><p>Quickly shutting my eyes I go back to the doorway whilst my mind begins to spill over with bewilderment. Maxwell Harrison doesn\u2019t even seem to have noticed my movement. He\u2019s still standing with James, his forehead lightly resting against his shoulder.</p><p>I am completely and utterly perturbed, and I very quickly decide not to go anywhere near James again, because every time I look at him that shimmering light hits me.</p><p>\u201cCan you watch over him?\u201d Maxwell Harrison says suddenly to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I utter, not fully registering his words, still wrapped up in my own puzzling thoughts.</p><p>He turns to me, wavering ever so slightly. \u201cJames, he\u2019s got no one left. I\u2019m his only family. We lost his mother, she died when he was still a baby. It\u2019s always just been me and him. He\u2019ll be all alone and I can\u2019t bear the thought of it. I know him, he won\u2019t take care of himself properly. Please, can you just watch over him? Take care of him. Make sure he\u2019s okay. Please.\u201d</p><p>Now he has my attention. This is not the first, or I imagine, the last time that I\u2019ll be asked this. The Elders have taught us well on how to handle this situation.</p><p>\u201cMaxwell Harrison -\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax. Please just call me Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201c- Max,\u201d I continue in a soft voice, \u201cthis is not something I can do.\u201d \u2018Or right now would wish to,\u2019 I silently add.</p><p>Max reluctantly leaves James\u2019 side and takes a few steps toward me. \u201cHave you ever been human?\u201d he asks.</p><p>His question throws me. Surprisingly, I have never been asked this before.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer warily.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause between us. Max looks at me impatiently. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever heard of that before. Is it some sort of special heavenly name?\u201d</p><p>I smile. Max has a strange manner. Oddly, it makes me want to smile. I can honestly say I have never encountered anyone like him before in all my time.</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe there are some humans who also have this name, amongst their other names that is.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath. I find this intriguing. A human soul has no need to exert for air, but as the body requires it, it becomes a natural thing for them to do, even when no longer required. So they unknowingly continue with the pretence of breathing.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lucyna I\u2019m not asking for much. Just every now and then check in on him, make sure he\u2019s doing okay.\u201d</p><p>My eyes trail down to the floor, away from Max\u2019s determined stare.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lucyna,\u201d he implores.</p><p>As his pleading words swirl around me, my voice of reason is urging me to once again tell him that it\u2019s not possible. That it is most definitely not a possibility. It\u2019s very much a rule breaker. The Elders are very clear on this; under no circumstances are we to honour this request.</p><p>I have been asked to do this thousands of times before by other humans, and have never once had any difficulty in explaining to them how this is not a possibility. If I and the other Bringers were to look in on every human we were requested to, we would never have time to tend to our duties. Yes, we could lie to them, ease their pain, but deception is not a part of who we are.</p><p>And yet, knowing this to be the case, why can I not seem to be able to bring myself to once again say it now?</p><p>And honestly, I really do not wish to be around James because, for some unknown reason, he seems to bring this odd shimmering light with him that insists on striking me at any given opportunity. It\u2019s something I have never encountered before, or wish to again. And really, what could I do if James wasn\u2019t coping? Nothing, obviously.</p><p>But as much as I try, I can\u2019t seem to make my mouth convey the words.</p><p>I look back up at Max and can clearly see the hope on his face, as if written there in indelible ink, the very hope he is pinning on my response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>Relief sweeps the breadth of Max\u2019s face. \u201cThank you so much, Lucyna. You don\u2019t know how much this means to me. I would kiss you right now, if it didn\u2019t seem really inappropriate to do so.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cYour thanks are plenty enough, Max.\u201d I return his smile, far from wishing to as my mind is nearly combustible with turmoil.</p><p>What am I doing? This is not something I can commit to.</p><p>I know I\u2019m the one speaking but I don't know where these words are coming from. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve been taken over and someone else is now speaking for me.</p><p>Frantically, I try to search for the right words to take back my agreement with Max. Disappointingly, nothing comes to mind, or should I say nothing I find myself able, or more to the point, wanting to say?</p><p>\u201cMax, you need to be aware that I won\u2019t be able to tell you how James is doing. Once I leave you at your door to Heaven, we will never again see each other.\u201d</p><p>His brows knit together. \u201cWon\u2019t I see you in Heaven?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Unfortunately Heaven is not a place I am permitted to access. I take you there, but never pass through.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a good question, and one I don\u2019t truly know the answer to.

After a moment he pauses, glances at me sideways, opens his mouth to speak, closes it again, then reopens. \u201cDo I have to go to Heaven?\u201d he finally says.</p><p>This is a question that is not very agreeable for me, but I\u2019m never surprised when it occurs.</p> <p>I take heed before answering. \u201cNo, you do not have to go,\u201d I answer truthfully, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t advise staying here on Earth. Once you take the choice to remain here, then you will be here for all eternity, unable to ever access Heaven. And, Max, eternity really is a long time to spend alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be here with James.\u201d The hope is evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd he will not know you\u2019re here. You\u2019ll be very much alone until the day he dies, and then what? On discovery, I believe James would also choose not go to Heaven and stay with you. Is that what you would want for him? For yourself? To be trapped on the plains, on the outside, always looking in at the world, but never able to once again be a part of it. Please trust me, Max, when I say that it\u2019s in your best interests to come with me and be a part of something that you now belong to.\u201d</p><p>With my speech over, Max turns from me and back to James. I know he\u2019s considering my words.</p><p>At these moments a distinct unease always settles around me. Even though I have never lost a human to this idea before, there is always the possibility that it could happen one day. If I had the need for breath, then I would be holding it right now.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Max says after a long moment. He turns, bringing his dark eyes to meet mine. \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying.\u201d He pauses with some consideration. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll come with you as long as you promise me that you will take care of James.\u201d The emphasis is on the \u2018promise\u2019 and he looks at me with heavy persuasion.</p><p>Please, not this again. Once more, if I could breathe, I would sigh right now. I have absolutely no idea why I have found myself committing to this.</p><p>\u201cI promise to do my best, Max.\u201d</p><p>Why do I continue to dig myself further and further into this? It\u2019s like I can\u2019t stop myself. Making a promise now, a promise that is impossible for me to keep, a promise that if I do keep, will break the rules I reside by.</p><p>He raises his brows, creasing up his forehead. \u201cWell . . . okay, if that\u2019s all I can get you to promise, then I guess it\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go now, Max?\u201d</p> <p>He gives me a sorrowful look. \u201cNo, but I guess no time is ever gonna be right, is it?\u201d Reluctantly, he nods in assent.</p><p>\u201cTake hold of my hand.\u201d</p><p>He slips his large hand around mine. \u201cYou know, Lucyna, you look really similar to my wife, James\u2019s mother. When I first saw you, for a moment there, I thought you was her . . . you\u2019re not, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He visibly contracts with relief. \u201cThought not.\u201d He shakes his head as though clearing his thoughts. \u201cIf you were my Maddy, she would have probably given me a good hiding the moment she laid her eyes on me after what I\u2019ve been getting up to over the years since she passed.\u201d He grins, then it suddenly drops from his face. \u201cOh, boll . . . err . . . blast. She\u2019s gonna be waiting up there for me, isn\u2019t she?\u201d He looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Max. I would say she is in Heaven.\u201d</p><p>A look of discomfort passes over his face and he takes a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mutters to himself.</p><p>I wonder what on earth he\u2019s been doing that makes him fear seeing her so.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get this show on the road,\u201d Max says. \u201cBest not keep God waiting.\u201d His nervousness is very apparent so I press an encouraging smile at him, hoping to offer some ease. But this smile I provide is one that is forced because something is nagging at my thoughts, fluttering around my mind.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d I say, relaying my usual line.</p><p>Max takes one last look at James, as all my brings do, taking that one last look at how their life used to be, and I find myself unwittingly following his gaze to where James still stands, his pain clearly evident as he cries silent tears over Max\u2019s body. Then, once again, I\u2019m hit by the shimmering veil strengthening in its intensity.</p><p>Pulling my eyes to a close, I instantly take leave, ensuring Max's passage to Heaven and getting myself away from James and this strange shimmering light he brings with him.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The Promise</p><p>I\u2019m confused, to say the least.</p><p>Puzzled. Perplexed. Bewildered. Yes, they seem more fitting.</p><p>I\u2019ve returned home now, as I have some free time. Home is Pure Land. It lies on the Astral Plane between Heaven and Earth. It\u2019s where all Bringers live, alongside the Elders.</p><p>The wonderful thing about home is that it can be whatever I want it to be. For instance, if I want to be standing on a sandy beach whilst the bright moon glows down on me, then I can manifest that to be as I wish.</p><p>Which is exactly where I am right now.</p><p>I even have gentle waves lapping at the water\u2019s edge, for perfection, allowing the moon to reflect off them artistically, a beautiful sight for me to gaze upon whilst I nomadically wander up and down the shore line in a tireless attempt to work through my puzzled thoughts about James and his shimmering light.</p><p>I have been deliberating over many options of what it may actually be as I have never encountered anything like it before.</p><p>A thought suddenly strikes me. Maybe James is not human. He could be something otherworldly, something I know not of - but no - the thought is as quickly quashed as it appeared.</p><p>James is Max\u2019s son, and Max was very much human.</p><p>Maybe James\u2019s mother was otherworldly then? But again, no. Max himself told me the mother had died. She must have been human to have done so.</p><p>No mistaking it then, James is human.</p><p>Pausing, I sit down on the sand, push my legs into the water and try to imagine what it feels like. Is it warm or cold? How would it be to feel it wash up over my legs? Would it soothe or discomfort me?</p><p>I begin to trace my finger over the wet sand. It disappears and emerges, in and out, with my movement, making no indentation at all on the sand itself.</p><p>Suddenly, I have the urgency to want to make a mark. So I focus all my attention on trying to push my finger into those tiny grains. Unsurprisingly, it just passes through, as I\u2019m fully aware it will.</p><p>Why on earth am I even trying to do such a thing?</p><p>I\u2019m plagued. Everything I know is in turmoil. The calamity of all calamities, you could say.</p><p>James and his shimmering light. My promise to Max.</p><p>What in the world was I even thinking agreeing to this, or not thinking, as the case may be?</p><p>And there\u2019s no way I can go back on this as it would be wrong to renege on a promise, thus leaving me no option other than to fulfil it.</p><p>But I\u2019ll have to be beyond the realms of careful, because if the Elders ever discover what I have pledged myself to, then there will undoubtedly be consequences to my reckless actions.</p><p>What has become of me? Now I\u2019m considering deceiving The Elders, the one thing I chose not to do to Max.</p><p>Why am I doing such a thing?</p><p>No, I shall not think of that now. There is enough for me to deal with in the here and now, I will address it later.</p><p>So, it\u2019s agreed I have to visit James, but I will not go and see him now. I\u2019ll wait maybe, say seven days, and then I\u2019ll just go to where he is, make sure all is fine and leave immediately after. By doing this I will have fulfilled my promise to Max.</p><p>Then again, maybe waiting is not the way. Perhaps I should go sooner?</p><p>A human\u2019s grief, after all, is the hardest for them in the initial period of mourning. Also, it might be best to get it over and done with, fulfil my promise to Max so the Elders shall never come to learn of what I have tied myself to.</p><p>Firstly, though, I must try and understand what the veil of shimmering light is before seeing James again, as it is with him alone that I experience it.</p><p>I know this is the case as I have been around many other humans since first encountering him yesterday, and not once did it occur, not once did the shimmering light appear and impose itself on me. So that proves, it\u2019s only when I'm in the company of James when it happens.</p><p>If I can understand what it is, then maybe I can somehow dispel it into the ether.</p><p>Lying back onto the sand, I stare up at the night sky, the sky we all share, whether we\u2019re ethereal or human. We all reside together in the same atramentous universe.</p><p>And what an amazing sight it is. Exquisitely beautiful. Utter blackness. It\u2019s very enthralling.</p><p>Black.</p><p>Exactly what Arlo tells me is the colour of my hair. If only I could see for myself.</p><p>Why am I now wondering these things to this extent? I\u2019m filled with so many questions and have no certain way to the answers.</p><p>I trace my eyes carefully over the stars which adorn the sky, each one uniquely beautiful and standing majestic in its own right as I look for a distraction, any distraction, to keep me away from a thought that is consistently trying to present itself as an answer to James\u2019 shimmering light.</p><p>I\u2019m reluctant to consider this possibility, because once I do I may not be able to walk away from it. And if this is what I discover to be the truth, then things are very quickly going to become incredibly troublesome for me.</p><p>But then, on the other hand, maybe I should consider it. I\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019s not the case, so perhaps I should just think it, get it out in the open, and then I can lay it to rest.</p><p>Okay then.</p><p>Feelings.</p><p>Maybe the veil of shimmering light that struck me could possibly have been feelings. What hit me may have been a wave of emotion. Maybe that\u2019s how I would see feelings, how they would present themselves to me. I mean, I wasn\u2019t aware feelings could be a visual thing, but maybe James\u2019 grief was so overwhelming that it emitted from him in that form.</p><p>No, it just doesn\u2019t sound right as I say it in my own mind. I\u2019ve obviously encountered grief, in many different forms and have never had that, or any other emotion, present itself in that way.</p><p>Then a thought strikes me like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Oh no. It couldn\u2019t be - could it?</p><p>Could this have been a feeling that I alone incurred. Nothing whatsoever to do with James.</p><p>My own feelings?</p><p>No. To choose that option, is \u2013 well, not an option. It\u2019s inconceivable. I don\u2019t feel. It\u2019s not possible. Bringers don\u2019t feel.</p><p>To consider that I had James\u2019 feelings somehow imposed on me, causing me momentarily to feel them is bad enough, but to consider that I am beginning to feel . . . no, it can\u2019t be.</p><p>I lift my hands up to look at them. They sparkle and shine against the night sky, just as always. Nothing different. I appear to be the same but, then again, how would I know what feelings are like to be able to distinguish between them? Or may it be possible that I\u2019m not feeling physically, just emotionally?</p><p>Well it doesn\u2019t appear to be happening at the moment as there is no veil of shimmering light. It only presents itself when I\u2019m near James. But why would I feel only in his presence? If that\u2019s what\u2019s happening - would it not happen all the time? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh Lord, what am I to do? I\u2019m impounded by confusion. I wish I could ask for your unbiased help, for your guidance through this confounding time.</p><p>Maybe I should speak to Arlo about this; he is so wise and knowledgeable. He may know the answers I so desperately seek.</p><p>But, then again, if it is feeling that is happening to me, Arlo would have to tell the Elders of my problem, and then what would happen? Surely the Elders wouldn\u2019t let me near a human ever again, thus meaning I would never again take a human to Heaven. I would no longer be a Bringer. I\u2019d never be allowed to Earth. I would spend my eternity in Pure Land. What would I do? What would become of me?</p><p>I can\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019ll just have to figure this out alone.</p> <p>Well, as it appears to be James that causes this problem I\u2019m having, then I will just stay away from him, problem solved, but oh no . . . my promise to Max. This, without a doubt, means that I will have to see James again.</p><p>It\u2019s not within me to break a promise, no matter how much I may wish it. \u2018Catch twenty-two\u2019, as they say.</p><p>Okay, so I shall fulfil my duty to Max and check upon James once, and once only, thus keeping my promise, though only in part, as going to see James once and never again is most definitely not \u2018checking in from time to time\u2019.</p><p>What to do? What to do?</p><p>It suddenly becomes abundantly clear to me that the time for thinking has now passed. I have to take decisive action as my solitary thoughts are obviously getting me nowhere.</p> <p>Rising easily to my feet, I turn from the water and walk across the sand, closing my eyes as I prepare to travel. The glorious beach slowly disintegrates in the wake of my departure as I now think of going to the only one who may be able to provide the much needed answers to my impatient, burning questions.</p><p>James.</p><p>And as quickly as I think his name, then no sooner are my eyes meeting with his.</p><p>He\u2019s sat on a sofa, feet up on a coffee table, a bottle of drink in his hand - alcohol I believe it to be.</p><p>I glance around, taking in my surroundings, and find myself in a house, what I assume to be James\u2019s house.</p><p>The television is on and I see that even though he is staring at it, his eyes look to be somewhere else, somewhere very far from here. He looks tired. His face is pale. His eyes are red and puffy.</p> <p>I sit down on the coffee table next to where his bare feet are resting, fix my eyes to him, and brace myself for the inevitable light to hit me.</p><p>But nothing happens.</p><p>I wait a moment more. Still nothing.</p><p>I\u2019m perplexed. Did the veil of shimmering light not happen? No, surely it did. It made itself abundantly known, not once, but thrice.</p><p>This is, yet again, incredibly confusing for me.</p><p>Maybe I was correct in my earlier thoughts after all and it was James\u2019 overwhelming grief that thrust itself upon me in that hospital room and not my own feelings transpiring in his presence.</p><p>James shifts his position and brings his knees up to his chest. He wraps his arms around them and rests his chin on his knees. He sighs heavily and, as he does so, a stray tear glides down his cheek, which he quickly wipes away.</p><p>I\u2019m drawn to the notable affliction shown in his movement, wondering just exactly what it is he feels at this precise second.</p> <p>Is it sadness, grief, anguish? I assume it to be all these things. He will undoubtedly be suffering emotionally after the death of Max. And as my mind swims with thoughts of James, distracting my attention, I\u2019m unexpectedly hit by the veil of shimmering light again.</p><p>This time it forcibly and ineptly presents itself. But unlike the other times, it appears not to be going away any time soon as it wraps itself all around me, enveloping me, and then disappears into my very being, becoming a part of me.</p><p>And even though it\u2019s incredibly strong, I do not allow it to knock me off balance. I remain there, eyes resolutely fixed on James, absorbing every fibre of his being whilst the light surges through me, taking me over, now knowing that even if I wanted to there\u2019s no way I\u2019m able to escape its clutches.</p><p>And through this wondrous turmoil, the only thought dominating me is to wish that I could take James\u2019 pain away, ease his burden somehow, soothe him, be able to touch him.</p><p>I mentally shake myself. What am I thinking? I could never help him in that way.</p><p>That\u2019s what humans do for one another. Not Bringers. And to want to touch him is madness. I don\u2019t have the capability to do so, let alone ever wish to.</p><p>Why now? Why a human? And more to the point - why him?</p><p>I\u2019m very quickly coming to the rationalisation that the shimmering light bestowing itself on me is without question feelings, feelings, which appear to be undoubtedly connected to James. Yet I still chose to return to him, knowing this to be a strong possibility.</p><p>Was I just hiding behind the promise I made to Max as to the reason why I came here, convincing myself I needed to discover what the source of this shimmering light is, when truly I did not?</p><p>Have I unwittingly come here and seen James for another reason, a reason unbeknown to me?</p><p>Then, without warning, the truth hits me almost as hard as James\u2019 light and certainty dawns upon me.</p><p>I feel for James.</p><p>My feelings are for him.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>My new reality fast becomes apparent, stretching itself formidably and staggeringly out in front of me.</p><p>Words escape me as a hundred different scenarios quickly flash before my eyes.</p><p>This is happening too quickly. What I am supposed to do with these - feelings? I believe they are filled with complexities that far outreach my knowledge or capability.</p><p>Suddenly everything about me seems wrong somehow.</p><p>Feelings.</p><p>The word sounds out of place. It\u2019s rattling around my mind like an unwanted guest, an enemy invading on unwelcome territory.</p><p>Why is this happening to me?</p><p>It has to be of my own doing after all my time spent with Arlo having endless discussions regarding humans and their feelings. My internal questioning. The wondering. The \u2018what ifs\u2019. And now, because of this, I\u2019m been struck down, caused to feel what I was so curious to know.</p><p>Maybe this is an inflictive teaching from God who wants to show me what feelings are so that I stop defying what I know to be right.</p><p>Perhaps Arlo is also encountering these feelings. I could ask him. But wait, no, I cannot. I know this to be a doubled-edged sword. Because if he is feeling too, then he won\u2019t want to tell me for the very reason that I don\u2019t want to tell him. But, then again, knowing Arlo as well as I do - yes, he may sit with me discussing the complexities of humans, but never once would he consider how it would actually be to be one of them, how it would be to feel.</p><p>Unlike me.</p><p>Me, with my endless scrutinising thoughts, my inexplicable fascination for humans. I have, without realisation, stepped beyond the realms of mere fascination and into absolute curiosity. I have unknowingly crossed the line, something I know Arlo would never, ever, do.</p><p>I\u2019m being changed irreversibly, and it\u2019s of my own doing.</p><p>And even with all of this new unwelcome knowledge, I still have no wish to leave James\u2019 side. I know I should, but I can\u2019t seem to. I\u2019m willingly staying here as these feelings settle themselves erroneously into me.</p><p>James lifts the bottle to his lips and takes a long drink, draining it in the process. Then, unexpectedly, he leans forward and places it on the table, passing right through me as he does so. It happens so quickly, I have no time to react and the sensation it causes sends me reeling backwards. It\u2019s only in the briefest of moments but stuns me beyond belief. Words momentarily escape me. There are none to describe what just occurred within me, or none I have ever said before, or ever imagined I would.</p><p>I believe the correct thing for me to say is that there are no words to describe what I have just felt.</p><p>Felt. Feelings. Whatever they are, they should be beyond me.</p><p>It takes me a moment to steady myself before I can sit back down. But now it seems that all this strange occurrence has done to me is to peak my curiosity even further about James. I move closer to him.</p><p>He is very beautiful and he becomes more so with every moment I spend looking at him.</p><p>He\u2019s as beautiful as the Aurora Borealis, as beautiful as the reddened sky when the sun is journeying into the west.</p><p>No, truly, I\u2019d say he is beyond even those things. James is singularly the most perfect thing I have ever seen in my entirety. Never before have I seen a human in this way. It\u2019s incredibly troublesome that I do so now.</p><p>What do I feel for James? Is it concern? Do I worry for him? I can see this being so with my link to Max. Or is it something else entirely?</p><p>What am I doing? Thinking? These thoughts are escaping me before I even realise they exist. It\u2019s like I\u2019m set to accept my fate. This cannot be.</p><p>Yes, over time I have wondered these things but never once did I envisage them being within me. And, yes, parts of it do seem very wonderful - miraculous in fact - but there is no way I can feel for James. Everything I am goes against it.</p><p>The inner turmoil is almost destroying me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m fighting against myself and I\u2019m sinking under the weight of it all. But walking away doesn\u2019t appear to be an option either because, as I sit here with James, it\u2019s like there is an invisible thread that has tied me to him.</p><p>What am I to do?</p><p>I think the only thing I can do is try and figure out why am I inexplicably tied to this particular human, why feelings chose to thrust themselves upon me in his presence. Because if I\u2019m ever going to have a chance of freeing myself from this furore, I have to understand why.</p><p>James abruptly stands and I find myself following him into his kitchen. He yanks open the refrigerator door and grabs another bottle of drink.</p><p>All of a sudden I hear a shrill sound. I very quickly realise it\u2019s his telephone ringing. He sighs loudly, slams the refrigerator door shut, and trundles over to the telephone.</p><p>He reaches over and grabs it. \u201cHello?\u201d he mutters, as he walks back into the living room, slumping himself down on the sofa. I, of course, have followed him back there and have regained my position on the table across from him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he says. His voice sounds dull, listless.</p><p>Without thinking, I begin to listen in on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be on your own,\u201d says a female voice.</p><p>\u201cSara, really, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obviously not. And I wouldn\u2019t expect you would be. Have you eaten anything?\u201d</p><p>He sighs and takes a swig of drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no, then. I\u2019m coming over and bringing food with me . . . and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d Her voice sounds very authoritative. I wonder who she is.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine. See you soon.\u201d James clicks off the phone and throws it to the floor. Then he picks up the remote control and begins flicking through the channels. All the while I can\u2019t seem to move my eyes away from him.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like much time has passed when I sense the approach of a human and hear a loud knock at the front door.</p><p>I follow James out of the living room and down the hallway. He opens the door to reveal a human woman. I\u2019m assuming the woman he spoke to on the telephone - Sara.</p><p>She has golden hair, like honey, and her eyes are the colour of seaweed.</p><p>I watch them greet one another. Sara looks at James for a moment, and then pulls him into a tight embrace. I notice his reluctance at first, but then he hugs her back and his tears flow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In an instant I\u2019m struck by a veil of light. A new light. Something altogether different. Its dark green, flecked with sparkling blue, and much more forceful than the shimmering veil. In fact it\u2019s quite aggressive as it penetrates me, so edgy and poisoning that I actually flinch.</p><p>James and Sara are now no longer hugging but talking, and I can\u2019t absorb a word they\u2019re saying. I can\u2019t think straight. My mind is swimming.</p><p>Sara puts her arm around James\u2019 waist and leads him back to the living room. I don\u2019t follow. I just stare at Sara's departing back, wondering if it\u2019s her who has brought this new light to me, this new feeling. The jading light is like nothing before. What is it? And more importantly, if it is her, then why does she bring it with her?</p><p>I no longer want to be here.</p> <p>Closing my eyes, I instantly return home, manifesting a meadow covered in lush green grass with a single willow tree standing tall.</p><p>I position myself under the tree, resting against its cracked bark, and gaze upwards to see the stars dancing between the parting leaves. For a moment the disquiet surrounds me, and it\u2019s almost as if something very big is drawing in a breath.</p><p>Then, with much urgency, I set on convincing myself that I\u2019m not to go anywhere near James ever again. I have fulfilled my promise to Max. There is no other reason for me to see him, and I ignore the dull ache that that thought alone brings with it.</p><p>I know I feel for James, that without reason I am drawn to him. But, that aside, I have to see past it, rid myself of these feelings. The maelstrom surrounding me is repairable as long as I stay far, far away from him.</p><p>But even as I think it, doubt infects me.</p> <p>No. I have to. It has to work, otherwise I\u2019ll no longer know where my place is or what I\u2019ll become with this change.</p><p>I\u2019ll not be ethereal, nor human. Something different.</p><p>Maybe, something wrong. Something, very, very, wrong.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Rule Breaker</p><p>I managed one day without going to see James.</p> <p>One pitiful day which I devoted entirely to thinking of him.</p><p>It\u2019s now been three weeks, two days and thirteen hours since the world as I knew it imploded and changed irreversibly. Because of him.</p><p>And for all this time, aside from when I\u2019m tending to my duties, I have spent by his side. I guess you could say I\u2019m keeping my promise to Max, and more so.</p><p>Every spare moment I have is spent with James, watching and learning all I can about him, about his life. But this is so very different from when I used to watch other humans. Aside from the feelings I now have, I\u2019m interested in him. Not what I can learn from him, but just simply him.</p><p>I watch James work. That\u2019s what I enjoy most. He\u2019s a gardener. I have also learnt this is what he and Max did together. They have a landscaping business. Or I should say had. Now it\u2019s just James\u2019.</p><p>I regard with fascination how James tends to flowers and plants seemingly with great care and attention. It gives me an internal glow. He is very adept at what he does. His creations are incredibly beautiful. But one thing I have noticed is that he works a lot, much more than humans normally do. He\u2019s out to work as soon as the sun begins to rise and doesn\u2019t return home until the night sky forces him to. But it appears to be the only time he relaxes, the only time he\u2019s at ease, when he\u2019s outside with the plants. It\u2019s as though he seeks solace in them. The rest of the time he just seems unhappy and restless.</p><p>I was by his side at Max\u2019s funeral. I was really lucky to not have any brings to attend to at that time. But, if I\u2019m honest, nothing could have kept me away from James then anyway, not even God himself. I had to be there for him, no matter that he has no idea of my existence or how I feel for him.</p><p>It was a bad day for James and for me. I found it extremely difficult to see him in as much emotional pain as he was. Not to be able to do anything for him caused me immense discomfort.</p> <p>James seemed to want to conceal his grief, but I knew it. It was emanating from him so strongly that I could practically feel it, and I was staggered by the intensity of those feelings. Then it only proceeded to get worse when I had to watch others provide comfort to him, something I very much wished to be able to do myself. Sara was the main comfort provider and the feelings I had to overcome from that were almost unbearable.</p><p>Straight after the funeral I was called away to tend to my duties. I didn\u2019t want to leave James and it was much later before I was able to return to him. I arrived to find him laid in bed, the room shrouded in darkness, his eyes open staring blankly up at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t sleep at all that night and I stayed with him, wishing his pain away.</p><p>And in all of this time spent with James, the only thing I have managed to figure out is that I\u2019m in trouble. Big trouble.</p><p>I haven\u2019t found any way to rid myself of these feelings, and the emotional feelings I have for James seem to be growing with unbearable intensity. They are getting more and more out of control as time passes.</p><p>I\u2019m finding the longer I have them, the more I\u2019m not so sure I even want to rid myself of them. Frighteningly, I\u2019m becoming accustomed to them, even though things are becoming increasingly difficult for me.</p><p>You see, I have all of these feelings but no way in which to express them, no way to release them. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re building up inside of me and I wonder what will happen when I reach boiling point.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I can talk to Arlo or any of the other Bringers about this. I talk to James, often, but obviously he doesn\u2019t hear me. A part of me wishes he could. A big part.</p><p>As time has gone on, I have also found myself feeling for other humans. Not in the same way, or with the same intensity as I have for James - I\u2019m still yet to fully understand just exactly what type of feelings these are - but now, when I take a human to Heaven, it\u2019s become increasingly difficult for me to witness them struggling to come to terms with their deaths. I assume I\u2019m feeling compassion and sorrow, but I could be wrong in this. Also, the pain from the humans they leave behind seems to reverberate all around, striking me from all angles, nearly knocking me senseless.</p><p>Everything as I knew it to be is gone. I\u2019m so very confused. I want these feelings, and I don\u2019t. I want to be how I used to be, and I don\u2019t. My rational thoughts are being overtaken by emotions and I have no idea of what to do.</p><p>Also I seem to be careless of how much time I\u2019m spending away from home. I\u2019m sure the others will have begun to notice my distinct absence. I know Arlo, above all, will have noticed. I am being completely, and utterly reckless. I know the consequences of my actions but yet I still continue on as I am. So far Arlo has not yet sought me out to speak about this, but I know it\u2019s only a matter of time. What if he does whilst I\u2019m with James? How would I explain that away? Honestly, I have no idea of what I am going to say to him when the time comes. What explanation I can provide? I don\u2019t wish to deceive Arlo, but neither can I tell him the truth.</p><p>Truly, I wonder how long I can continue in this way. James is consuming all of me and I\u2019m losing the distinction of who I am or what is right any more.</p><p>I\u2019m standing outside Heaven, having just guided the human - Summer Sophia Davies - through. I have another bring to attend to soon but have some spare time beforehand. I can feel myself being pulled to James, something I am fast becoming used too. But no, I have to stop and start thinking rationally about my situation.</p><p>Instead of immediately going to James as I usually do, I stay where I am and take a moment to clear my thoughts. I glance around my surroundings.</p><p>It\u2019s been so long since I just stood still and looked around the outskirts of Heaven. What a beautiful sight it is. The varying shades of pinks, blues, greens and purples, all blending genially into one another in sparkling enchantment. It makes me wonder whether, if the outside is as lovely as this, just how wonderful it is inside Heaven itself. I imagine it to be glorious. How lucky those humans are who are granted entrance to it.</p><p>For a tiny moment, I begin feel more like myself, how I used to be before all of this. Then my mind immediately slips back to my woe.</p><p>Okay, so what I need to do is divide my time more evenly. It won\u2019t solve my problem, but it will help not to arouse the suspicions of the others if I am at least around them more than I currently have been. I shall go now and see Arlo, spend some time with him. Then later I shall go to James. Easy.</p><p>I arrive to find Arlo with Rosamund. They are both standing amongst the throngs of humans at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver.</p><p>The realisation hits me like a dull thud.</p><p>It\u2019s the Winter Olympics. Arlo and I always watch together and it\u2019s been running for a few days now. I cannot believe I have forgotten this. I never forget anything.</p><p>Arlo will note my absence with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d he practically smiles my name, \u201cit\u2019s been some time since I saw you last.\u201d</p><p>And as I look at him, I instantly see him in a whole new light. Never before did I realise how truly beautiful a being he is. My vision was previously dulled by my lack of feelings, but now I\u2019m equipped with them and this been the first time I\u2019ve seen him since it happened.</p><p>\u201cI know, Arlo. I have been busy. I have been venturing around the globe in search of new and wondrous sights.\u201d</p><p>I just lied.</p><p>Lied.</p><p>Where did that even come from? I didn\u2019t know I was capable of such a thing. I\u2019m covered with shame. I daren\u2019t look at either of them for fear of giving myself away.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Arlo says nodding. \u201cRosamund and I have just been watching the wondrous sports on display here.\u201d He casts his arm around.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lucyna,\u201d Rosamund says.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rosamund,\u201d I reply, in return.</p><p>Arlo turns to me. \u201cI was beginning to think you weren\u2019t going to attend this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never miss this,\u201d I answer a little too quickly. I force a smile onto my lips, hoping to be convincing enough. But then, why would Arlo ever have reason not to believe me? He wouldn\u2019t. That very thought sickens me.</p><p>Suddenly, the crowd of humans erupt into cheers as one of the competitors wins a race. The sound is practically thunderous. Oddly, it fills me with a warm glow. I quickly cast it aside, fearing Arlo and Rosamund will notice.</p><p>Rosamund shakes her head. \u201cI shall never understand these humans. They are so competitive with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosamund, this is something humans appear to like very much,\u201d Arlo says, without taking his eyes off the ever-growing crowd which is gathering around the victor. \u201cIt appears to make them happy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly bothered by Rosamund\u2019s words. If she thinks this way, then why is she even attending? She doesn\u2019t usually.</p><p>Then a terrifying thought strikes me. Does she know about me? About James? Is that why she is here?</p><p>No, that\u2019s ridiculous. Of course she doesn\u2019t know. She can\u2019t know . . . can she?</p><p>\u201cYes, that is an obvious fact,\u201d Rosamund replies, interrupting my inner conflict. \u201cBut they are such fickle creatures. I shall never understand them, and I do not wish too.\u201d She waves her hand dismissively.</p><p>I look away, pretending to be distracted by my surroundings, not wanting to be part of this conversation, knowing I no longer share her thought processes. Or did I really ever? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Lucyna have you made any new discoveries on your travels?\u201d Arlo asks.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d The lies are slipping so easily from my mouth. I feel as though I\u2019m coated in them.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have been considering doing the same for some time myself. Next time I shall come with you. If you have no objection, of course?\u201d</p><p>I fix my eyes ahead. \u201cOf course not, Arlo. You are always welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime for me to go,\u201d says Rosamund.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved at the conversation break, but not welcoming Rosamund\u2019s imminent departure as it will leave Arlo and me alone and I fear I won\u2019t be able to keep my pretence up for much longer in that circumstance. Why did I not consider how hard this would be before coming?</p><p>Rosamund nods at us both respectively, then vanishes from sight. Momentarily, I find myself wondering where she is going to. Which human will she be taking to Heaven? Unexpectedly, I feel awash with sorrow and I very quickly quell it.</p><p>Arlo begins to walk through the arena and I follow along.</p><p>\u201cI believe Rosamund is missing out on much learning there is to be done from humans. I find there to be distinctly much more to them than the categorisation she gives them. Do you agree, Lucyna?\u201d</p> <p>I can feel his eyes on me, a very surreal experience.</p><p>\u201cYes. I am inclined to agree with you, Arlo.\u201d Much more than you realise, I silently add.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is why I spend my time with you, Lucyna. We think alike.\u201d</p><p>And you, Arlo, are my friend, my dear friend, I find myself wanting to say, but instead I simply answer, \u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p><p>My mind is swamped with guilt. I\u2019m sure it is covering me in some obvious way. I glance sideways at Arlo as we walk on in silence, and feel an instant swell of affection for him. It throws me.</p><p>Instantly I find myself wanting to tell Arlo my troubles. They're practically bursting out of me. I want to unburden this guilt I have, rid myself of this internal conflict, seek his advice. Because, more than anything, I want help; I need help.</p> <p>But my rash thoughts are quickly dampened as I know I never will, never can. I\u2019m too ashamed and afraid to do so. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the consequences of my actions.</p><p>I\u2019m all alone in this.</p><p>I wish things would go back to the way they were before I ever saw James. I wish I had never met him.</p><p>But do I really? Do I really want to go back to what now seems an empty existence since experiencing the phenomenon of feelings?</p><p>Do I truly want to walk away from James? Never again see him.</p><p>That thought alone fills me with consternation.</p><p>\u201cWhen is your next bring, Lucyna?\u201d asks Arlo, breaking me from my reverie.</p><p>\u201cVery soon, Arlo. Minutes. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn twenty minutes. I\u2019m going to Thailand. Such a beautiful place \u2013\u201d but I can\u2019t hear him any more, all I can hear is the name that\u2019s now echoing around my mind, the name of my next bring, the one that has pinned me to this stony floor.</p><p>James Maxwell Harrison.</p><p>I feel sheer and utter horror. Hysteria practically leaps up and grabs hold of me. It\u2019s so overwhelming, momentarily I don\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>Arlo, noticing my abrupt stop, turns back and looks at me with curiosity. \u201cLucyna?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>No. It can\u2019t be. Not him. Not James.</p><p>Arlo\u2019s eyebrow arches in confusion. \u201cLucyna?\u201d he reiterates, taking a step toward me, awakening me.</p><p>\u201cTime for me to go, Arlo.\u201d I desperately try to make my voice sound even. \u201cI shall see you soon.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for his response. I have no time.</p><p>My next actions are beyond me. My thoughts are erratic, scattered. The only thing I know for sure is that I have to save James. Nothing else matters. Just save him.</p><p>Instantly I\u2019m there, looking at a burning car which is entangled with a tree, and trapped inside is James.</p><p>There\u2019s ninety seconds left before he\u2019s scheduled to die.</p><p>What do I do? Can I save him? Can I stop what God has set in motion? Surely not, I have no such power to override God\u2019s will.</p><p>But, James.</p><p>Eighty-five . . . eighty-four . . . eighty-three . . .</p><p>Without warning, an odd sensation suddenly ripples right through my very being and then something overtakes me. Before I know it I\u2019m at the car, yanking the door open, pushing back the air bag and pulling at James\u2019s limp body. He\u2019s stuck. Frantically I search around to see what\u2019s trapping him. It\u2019s his seat belt. I tug hard but it doesn\u2019t give way. I follow its lead to the end, press a button and hear a click. It unravels in my hand. Taking hold of James, I put his arm around me and pull him from the car.</p><p>I half carry, half drag him down the gravelly road, his feet scraping along as I do so. Then once we\u2019re a safe distance from the car, I carefully lay him down on the ground and sit beside him.</p><p>Then it hits me.</p><p>I\u2019m holding James. Physically touching him. I have carried him.</p><p>How?</p><p>I look down at myself and see a human body, skin covering every part of me. I\u2019m wearing clothes. I look at my hands. I have fingernails. I\u2019m solid matter. I look like a human.</p><p>What . . . how . . . how did this happen? How did I become this way? Questions are spilling from my mind.</p><p>Stop, Lucyna, there is no time for this.</p><p>I quickly gather myself together and look down at James. His skin is covered in black soot and he has some cuts on his face. A large one near his hairline has blood trickling from it, the blood clotting into his hair.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>Reaching forward, I gently place my fingertip on the cut. Instantly a tingling sensation shoots up through my finger.</p><p>I jump back startled.</p><p>What on earth was that?</p><p>Curious, I again reach forward and place my finger on James\u2019 face, wondering whether it\u2019s his blood that causes this tingling sensation, or just him. But the moment my skin meets his, the same wondrous sensation once again presents itself, running up my finger into my arm.</p><p>Am I touching him? Is this what it\u2019s like? Can I now feel James?</p><p>Curiosity burns every part of me.</p><p>I keep my finger on him, marvelling at this wonderful experience, letting the sensation swill through me. Then, as if slapped around the face, I suddenly realise that James' precious time is still ticking away in my mind. It hasn\u2019t stopped. Why? I mean it should, shouldn\u2019t it? Have I not done enough to save him?</p><p>Forty-one . . . forty . . . thirty-nine . . .</p><p>Don\u2019t die, James. Please don\u2019t die. Don\u2019t leave me here all alone. If you do, then this was all for nothing.</p><p>I take hold of his body and shake him, vehemently ignoring the sensations it creates in my hands, and will him to wake.</p><p>He\u2019s not waking up.</p><p>Panic stricken, I shake him again - but nothing.</p><p>Twenty-eight . . . twenty-seven . . . twenty-six . . .</p><p>\u201cJames, please don\u2019t die,\u201d I beseech.</p><p>What do I do? I am completely and utterly out of my depth.</p><p>I lay my head on his chest in resignation and his warmth radiates through me. My face is ablaze. Wait, I can hear his heart beating. Yes, it\u2019s definitely beating. He\u2019s got a good, strong heartbeat. I feel a surge of relief. That\u2019s a positive sign \u2013 isn\u2019t it? But if he\u2019s going live, if I have managed to save him, then why is his time still counting down?</p><p>Sixteen . . . fifteen . . . fourteen . . .</p><p>Maybe I haven\u2019t saved him after all. I feel a sharp pain shoot right through me.</p><p>I trace my now-human fingers across his forehead, running them into his hair, something I have longed to do.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose him. I can\u2019t.</p><p>Making one last ditch attempt, I again take hold of his body and shake him with all my might. \u201cJames! Wake up, please!\u201d I yell out.</p><p>Eight . . . seven . . . six . . .</p><p>His time is fast approaching its end. What if he dies here, what will happen? What will I do? I couldn\u2019t bear it if he was no longer here. How could I take him to Heaven and part with him? Never again see his beautiful face.</p><p>The thought terrifies me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what else I can do, so now I\u2019m literally willing him to live. \u201cJames,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Two . . . one . . . zero.</p><p>Disconsolately, I lie down beside him, look up at Heaven, and plead with the only one who has the power to save him. \u201cPlease, God, I beg you. Please don\u2019t take him from me.\u201d</p><p>Everything seems to stop. The wind stops blowing through the trees. Animals stop scurrying around. There\u2019s not a sound in the air. It\u2019s so quiet. So serene.</p><p>Then I feel James stir and I scramble up to my knees.</p><p>His eyes flicker open and he looks up at me with his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI . . . know . . . you,\u201d he mumbles. Then his eyes roll back into his head, and his lids come heavily to a close.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Being Human</p><p>I know you.</p><p>I know you.</p><p>What on earth is that supposed to mean?</p><p>He knows me? How does he know me? He can\u2019t know me. Of course he can\u2019t, it\u2019s impossible. He was delirious. That\u2019s it. He didn\u2019t know what he was saying \u2013 did he? No, of course not.</p><p>I look over at James from my seat in the far corner of the dimly lit room. He\u2019s sleeping peacefully. He hasn\u2019t woken yet, not since he uttered those haunting words in any case.</p><p>We\u2019re at the hospital. As I very quickly discovered, I no longer have my abilities in this new form of mine. No extra sensory perception. No transporting in the blink of an eye. All my abilities are seemingly gone.</p><p>So I had to sit there on the roadside with an unconscious James and wait like any other human until a passing car found us. Luckily we weren\u2019t waiting too long.</p><p>The human rang for help from his mobile phone, told us an ambulance would be there soon, and waited with us until it arrived. And it did, very quickly, as did a whole host of other humans - policemen, firemen.</p><p>James was brought to the hospital in the ambulance. The police wanted to question me about what happened. I wanted to come to the hospital to be with James, so they drove me here in a car which, might I add, was a really strange experience, and they questioned me on the way.</p><p>I told the policeman who sat in the back of the car with me that I had been walking along the road when I saw James\u2019 car crash into the tree and instantly set itself on fire, that I pulled him from the burning car and carried him down the road, then waited there until we were found.</p><p>The policeman wrote down everything I said. He asked for my name and address. Panic ensued and I had to think fast. The only thing I could say was that I didn\u2019t have one, which is pretty much the truth now. He looked me over and asked if I was homeless, to which I promptly replied I was. He wrote something else down, and then his whole demeanour toward me changed. No longer was I the heroic human but someone he suddenly viewed with mild disdain. He asked if there was any way to contact me, and I knew I had to say something so I said that he could contact me through James. He regarded me with a raised eyebrow and said \u201cbut I thought you didn\u2019t know him\u201d. My immediate response was that I don\u2019t, but after saving his life I felt an obligation to stick around and make sure he was okay.</p><p>I could see the policewoman who was driving the car glancing at me in the rear-view mirror with a very sceptical look in her eyes. I don\u2019t know whether they believed me or not, but right now it\u2019s of no regard as I have far bigger concerns, like the fact that I have inadvertently taken on human form, that I now somehow look like a human not only to myself but they can see me too. I\u2019m solid matter. Human but not actually a human. No functioning organs \u2013 well no heartbeat for starters. That is a pretty important thing for a fully-functioning human body, so I\u2019m obviously not alive. But I\u2019m here and still me, but not me. I can touch things, actually feel and touch them without my hand just passing through. No longer do I see a blaze of light that sparkles. Now when I look down all I see is a human body. So this does this mean I\u2019m no longer a Bringer? But not human either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What am I then?</p><p>I look down at my fully-clad body, wondering just where these clothes and shoes came from. Have I always worn them? And my hair, it\u2019s just hanging there, draping down my back, falling over my shoulder. And it\u2019s so very black, just like Arlo said. My skin, so creamy, so very human like. I poke myself in the arm. It\u2019s beyond strange. I can actually feel myself, poke myself in the arm. This is so unbelievably surreal, but so absolutely wonderful all at the same time, that it renders me speechless. There are no words to convey just how crazy this is. And I have never been more confused than I am right now.</p><p>I have so many questions spooling around my mind. Like for starters, how did this happen? How did I come to look like a human? I remember the odd sensation I felt go through me the instant before I saved James, and how I just did that on instinct. Okay, so the change obviously occurred then, but how? Did I somehow make this happen? I wonder if it\u2019s because I started having feelings like a human does. If so, can I take it back, can I change back? But then, do I want to? I glance over at James, my eyes lingering on his beautiful face, my feelings for him surging through me with such an overwhelming intensity that I grip hold of the chair.</p><p>I look down at my body, my new body that James will be able to see.</p> <p>So I ask myself the question again. Do I want to change back?</p><p>No, I really and truly do not.</p><p>James\u2019 breathing deepens, pricking my attention. I stand from my seat and peer over at him. He looks like he\u2019s still sleeping and the monitors he\u2019s attached to seem to be functioning as they should. I quietly lower myself back into the chair.</p><p>I\u2019m not supposed to be in here. I snuck in after everyone had left. I didn\u2019t want James to be alone. I\u2019ll always be here for him, no matter what form I take, or whether he knows it or not.</p><p>When I arrived at the hospital, the doctors and nurses were already tending to James. The nurse had asked if I was a relative, but when I said no, he said I couldn\u2019t be here. When I explained I was the one who had saved James, he was more forthcoming. He told me to sit in the waiting room until they were done with James and he would come back and let me know how James was doing, but after that I would most certainly have to leave.</p> <p>I was waiting quite a while, all the time spent worrying about James. I could think of nothing else. But the nurse was as good as his word. He came back and told me James was going to be fine. He\u2019s got a broken leg - well it\u2019s broken in two places, his tibia and his kneecap - so they have potted it, and it will take up to three months to heal. He\u2019s suffering from the effects of mild smoke inhalation, and the cut on his head needed stitches. The nurse said James had been incredibly lucky. He\u2019s seen people come off a lot worse than that after a car collision with a tree - so have I, but I was reluctant to mention that. He went on to say that James owes me his life because if I hadn\u2019t have been there to pull him from that burning car, he would most certainly have died.</p><p>If only he knew.</p><p>I\u2019m beyond relieved that I saved James. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear it if I\u2019d lost him. Not that I\u2019ve ever truly had him, or ever will. But to lose the joy of being able to see him every day would have been too much to bear. I know just how incredibly selfish of me that was, but I couldn\u2019t help it. At the time I didn\u2019t even think about my actions, or the consequences of them.</p><p>By saving James\u2019 life, I have changed the natural order of things. I have committed a cardinal sin and obviously have no regard for the consequences, as here I sit. There\u2019s no saving me now. I have crossed the line and strayed so far over it I know there\u2019s no return for me.</p><p>But I don\u2019t regret it. And I never will.</p><p>Because this is James and he makes nothing else matter. Everything else is inconsequential. He is, and will always be, the only thing that matters to me, and my only regret is that I hadn\u2019t been there sooner to save him from suffering these injuries.</p> <p>I know, fully and completely, that I did the right thing, but I suppose the ultimate question is \u2013 right for whom?</p><p>Then I hear James\u2019 bed sheets rustle and see that he\u2019s waking up. I sit up in my seat, my back poker-straight. If I had a heart right now, I imagine it\u2019d be beating out of my chest. James is going to see me. When he opens his eyes, he is actually going to see me for the very first time. A wave of nerves washes over me.</p><p>He groans a low moan as the pain from his injuries sets into his consciousness. He tries to get up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d I say, moving swiftly toward him. \u201cJust lay back and I\u2019ll call the nurse.\u201d I press the buzzer beside his bed and back away.</p><p>He slumps back, unable to do anything else. \u201cSome water,\u201d he whispers, his hand rubbing his throat. His voice sounds raspy, from the smoke inhalation I guess.</p><p>I get the jug of water off the table and pour some into the waiting glass, and hand it to him. He struggles to drink, spilling some, so I help guide the glass to his lips. He sips slowly, his eyes blinking heavily. And I step back, leaning up against the wall, allowing myself to recover from the heightened sensation I feel every single time I touch him.</p><p>I cannot even begin to describe just how remarkable this moment truly is. I\u2019m actually here with him.</p><p>He holds the glass on his chest, lies back onto the pillows, and turns his head, glancing at me in the dim light. He\u2019s looking right at me with his dark, impenetrable eyes, eyes that I never once dreamed would ever see me, eyes in which I\u2019m waiting to see if there is any spark of recognition.</p> <p>\u201cWhere am I? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>Sweet relief. He doesn\u2019t know me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital. I\u2019m \u2013\u201d</p><p>Confusion holds his face as he utters, \u201cThe hospital?\u201d He reaches up and touches where the gauze sits on his forehead covering his cut.</p><p>\u201cYou have a cut there, it needed stitches.\u201d I glance down at his leg. His eyes follow mine. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve broken your lower leg and fractured your kneecap, so they\u2019ve put a pot on it to help it heal.\u201d I look back up to his confused face. \u201cAnd your throat hurts because of the smoke inhalation, I believe.\u201d</p><p>He brings his foggy eyes back to meet mine. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He sounds more like he\u2019s addressing himself than me. \u201cI mean, I was driving home from Joe\u2019s wedding and then nothing \u2013\u201d His eyes flicker. \u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d</p><p>I reach over and take the glass from him, placing it back on the table. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a doctor. I \u2013 well, you had an accident. You crashed your car. And I \u2013 I helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty modest.\u201d I look up to see the nurse from earlier coming through the door. He leans over the bed and switches off the button that I\u2019d pressed. \u201cShe more than helped. She saved your life. Pulled you from a burning car.\u201d He nods in my direction, smiling, giving a knowing look to James. \u201cSo how are you feeling?\u201d he asks James, but James doesn\u2019t respond. He\u2019s just staring at me, wide eyes fixed on me. \u201cYou saved my life?\u201d The surprise audible in his raspy voice.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013\u201d I look down, away from his heavy stare. \u201c\u2013 I \u2013 well \u2013\u201d My mouth's not functioning as it should. My lips feel heavy and clumsy. \u201cYes. I saved you,\u201d I finally manage. I glance up at him, his eyes take hold of mine and that\u2019s it, I can\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d His voice suddenly low, warm, caressing, our eyes still locked together. \u201cI mean, what can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you is usually a good place to start,\u201d the nurse says with a laugh, and just like that the moment's broken. I look away.</p><p>\u201cRight, you need to go,\u201d the nurse says, finger pointing at me. My eyes flick up.</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d James and I both echo.</p><p>\u201cYes, go. You\u2019re not supposed to be in here, as you well know.\u201d He gives me a pointed look. \u201cAnd he needs his rest.\u201d</p><p>Go, I can\u2019t go. I\u2019ve barely spoken to James. I can\u2019t leave now. I need more time with him.</p><p>\u201cBut she can\u2019t go,\u201d James says urgently, his words practically repeating my thoughts, except mine sound more panicked and slightly unstable. I glance at him. His eyes are on me again and I feel a warm glow erupt deep inside me, lighting the whole of me. \u201cI need to talk to you \u2013 about the accident, about what happened. About everything.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth, but the nurse speaks before I have chance. \u201cShe can come back in the morning, at visiting time. It\u2019s not that far off now anyway.\u201d And I can tell by the firm look on his face he\u2019s not going to play ball.</p><p>James looks at me, a hint of shyness in his face, something I\u2019ve never seen him wear before. It\u2019s captivating. \u201cWill you come back in the morning?\u201d he asks. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but I really want to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come in the morning.\u201d I smile. He wants to see me again. I feel exhilarated, exuberant. It\u2019s hard to contain my happiness. He actually wants to see me again.</p><p>I look at the nurse. \u201cWhat time is visiting time?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNine-thirty.\u201d</p><p>I look back at James. \u201cI\u2019ll come at nine-thirty.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019 lips curve into a faint smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The nurse signals to the door and I follow him.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay getting home? It\u2019s so dark out,\u201d James says, pulling me back, and I willingly return. The nurse is by the door, finger on the light switch, his impatience radiating through the room. But I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll eek this out for as long as I can.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>James' sleepy eyes gaze at me. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The nurse flicks the light off and closes the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you back here till visiting time,\u201d he says firmly, but with a warm smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t see me until nine thirty.\u201d I return his smile, then turn to leave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a bond you guys have now,\u201d he says.</p><p>I turn back to him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He glances up from looking at the papers in his hand. \u201cWell when people share a life threatening incident, it ties them together in a way no one else can understand. I mean, how could you ever forget the person who saved your life, or the one whose life you saved?\u201d</p><p>Utter happiness is filling me and I continue on down the hall, floating on an air of complete euphoria. I press the exit button and wait until the nurse buzzes me out. Now I\u2019m stood in the lift lobby, unsure what to do.</p><p>The lift doors ping open and a man pushes out a wheelchair with a young woman in it. They both smile at me. I move out of the way, heading toward the staircase. A thought suddenly flashes through my mind as I take the steps down. There are lots of humans here, mostly ill or injured, but some also maybe dying. And a dying human brings only one thing. One of my kind. Oh no, what if one of them sees me here?</p><p>Panic shocks me into reality. I can\u2019t be wandering about like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I speed up, nearly running down the steps, and when I reach the bottom floor, I pause, quietly pull open the door and surreptitiously glance around. There are a few humans here, but I can\u2019t see any of my kind. But then, would I even be able to see one of my own kind in my current form?</p><p>I spot a sign for the ladies' toilets and head straight toward it, eyes firmly fixed forward. There would be no reason for one of my kind to be here, well, unless someone is scheduled to die in the toilets, that is.</p><p>I push the door open and poke my head in. Empty. I lock the door firmly behind me.</p><p>Looking around the small room, I take in the white windowless walls, the sink, the mirror above it and the toilet.</p> <p>Curiosity suddenly engulfs me and I slowly walk over to the mirror.</p><p>A woman with alabaster skin, long black hair, full pink lips and bright blue eyes stares back at me. I touch the cool glass with my fingertips, tracing the outline of my face. So this is me. Lucyna. My reflection. I draw closer to the mirror. After all this time, I can see what the others see. What Arlo sees. He was very accurate in his description of my eye colour. I think he caught it perfectly.</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice a few black marks on the sleeve and upper part of my clothes. It must be from James, the soot off his skin transferred onto me. I know humans keep their clothes clean, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything I can currently do about it.</p><p>I look back up at myself, at my face, and begin examining myself closely. It\u2019s so strange, I really do look human. I look just exactly like one of them.</p><p>After a time of close scrutiny, and knowing I can\u2019t stay in the bathroom all night, I slip out of the door and, with my head down, walk quickly toward the exit.</p> <p>The doors whoosh open on my approach and I find myself out on the pavement, the chilly air wrapped around me.</p><p>\u201cGot any spare change, love?\u201d</p><p>I look up to see an older man with long brown wiry hair standing before me. His clothes are old and dirty and I can smell a stale stench emanating from him.</p><p>\u201cSpare change?\u201d</p><p>He frowns at me and says impatiently, \u201cYeah, money, cash, readies, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have money.\u201d</p> <p>He looks at me like I\u2019m an oddity, shakes his head, then without another word saunters off into the night.</p><p>He\u2019s homeless, just like me. I instantly feel a pang of longing for home and gaze up at the sky, realising just how very alone I actually am, gravity weighing me down as the reality of my situation sinks in.</p><p>I sit down on the roadside.</p><p>I\u2019m here on earth, alone. All alone. I have no home. Nowhere to go. I\u2019m here with these humans, outwardly looking like one of them, pretending to be one of them, but I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t have money like they do. And I have absolutely no idea how to be a human. I\u2019m so very out of my depth. You\u2019d think after all these many, many years I\u2019ve spent observing them, I\u2019d have some clue, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>But I guess I don\u2019t have much choice, because whilst I\u2019m here I\u2019m going to have to ensure I fit in. I can\u2019t arouse suspicion to myself, and I know the police have already figured out there is something different about me, so I\u2019m going to have to learn quickly.</p><p>Right, so all I have to do is act human. I\u2019ll spend tonight thinking over all of the things I\u2019ve seen, their behaviour, their mannerisms, how they converse with one another. Then I\u2019ll know how to be one of them. Being human. Lucyna the human.</p><p>Well, that is until the Elders find me, which I\u2019m sure will not be long. Then again, I wonder if they\u2019ll be able to trace my essence now I\u2019m no longer one of them. Either way, I know they will look for me and one day, in the not too distant future, I will be taken away from here, taken away from James. The panic hits me like a tidal wave. I wrap my arms around my legs. I don\u2019t want to leave James. Not ever.</p><p>I\u2019m so confused. I made a decision, the right decision, every instinct telling me I had to save James. But ironically, I saved him because I couldn\u2019t bear to be without him and now as a result of my decision, I will one day, very soon, never again be allowed to see him.</p> <p>The reality is there pinching at me, like the cold night is pinching my skin, but I\u2019m just not ready to face the thought of leaving him, not yet anyway.</p><p>Why did James have to be scheduled to die now, only mere weeks after I find him? Then a plaguing thought hits me. Was this not a coincidence? Was God taking him now because of me? Is this punishment for my behaviour, because I feel for him, that I feel because of him?</p><p>I mentally shake myself. Of course not. How can I even think such a thing? What am I turning into too?</p><p>An ambulance comes wailing past, knocking me out of my black thoughts. I can\u2019t think about all this now. I have to think about the here and now, have to figure how to act human in the next few hours and also what exactly I\u2019m going to say to James as to why I was there, on that road in the middle of nowhere, late at night.</p><p>I stand up, wrap my arms around myself, the cold biting at my skin, and wonder just what exactly to do for the next five hours before I can see James again.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Visiting Hour</p><p>I\u2019m standing outside the door to James\u2019 room.</p><p>It\u2019s nine-thirty and I\u2019m finally allowed to see him, but for some reason I can\u2019t seem to make myself go through the door. I mean this is it, what I\u2019ve always wanted. After all this waiting I\u2019m finally going to speak to James alone.</p><p>I try to move my feet again, but they won\u2019t respond. I\u2019m nervous about going in. Really nervous. It\u2019s just going to be me and James, alone. What if he doesn\u2019t like me?</p><p>I hear a door bang shut to my right and turn to see a man wearing a dressing gown standing outside the room next to James\u2019. He\u2019s looking at me. I guess I must look pretty strange, just stood here staring at the door.</p><p>I smile a bright smile, trying to come over as human as possible. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I say.</p><p>He returns my smile and says, \u201cGood morning\u201d, then turns and walks down the hall away from me.</p><p>Right, I can\u2019t stand out here all day, and every second I do is a second wasted that could be spent with James. I place my hand on the green door, compress my fears down, and slowly push it open.</p><p>And there he is, laid in bed, watching television, looking as beautiful as always.</p><p>He turns his head, his dark eyes warm and inviting, smiling at me. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, his voice still croaky. He switches the television off with the remote control and sits himself up.</p><p>My skin is practically rippling with nerves, my theoretical heart singing with joy at the sight of him. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>I let the door close behind me with a gentle thud and tentatively walk into the room, all the time very aware of the fact that James\u2019 eyes have not once left me.</p><p>\u201cTake a seat.\u201d He gestures to the chair by his bed.</p><p>I sit down but my whole body is jittery. I know I should speak, say something, but truth be told I have no idea what to say. After all this time imagining how our conversations would be, I now can\u2019t seem to form words. It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019ve been stolen from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d His voice breaks, so he pauses and takes a sip of water, clearing his throat. \u201cI was worried you might not. I mean I knew it was a lot to ask after what you\u2019ve already done for me, but I really wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always coming,\u201d I smile. \u201cI never break my word.\u201d</p><p>His renewed smile reaches all the way up to his eyes. \u201cI realised after you\u2019d gone that I didn\u2019t even get your name?\u201d He holds his hands out apologetically.</p><p>\u201cLucyna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d he echoes, and I love the way my name sounds on his lips. It infuses me with warmth. \u201cPretty name. I\u2019m James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his brows and gazes at me. \u201cThe nurse told me your name last night,\u201d I say quickly, covering up my slip. I\u2019m in his presence less than a minute and I mess up already. Great start.</p><p>He runs his fingertip around the rim of his water glass. \u201cLucyna, I don\u2019t even know where to begin, and I know it sounds so lame in comparison but thank you so much for saving my life. I know that doesn\u2019t even begin to repay you for what you did but, really, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, the daylight glowing cordially on his face. And I wish I could tell him that he doesn\u2019t need to thank me, that I would have saved his life a thousand times over, that I would never, ever, have let him die as there is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him, but all I can say is, \u201cThank you is plenty enough.\u201d</p><p>He reaches up and touches his head where the gauze covers his cut. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface. The police were here at breakfast time and they told me the full extent of what you did, how you risked your own life to save mine, how you pulled me from my burning car. I just can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d He leans forward and grabs my hand. For a moment everything goes still. His eyes spark something, recognition maybe, but no sooner is it there, its gone. \u201cI just wish I could \u2013\u201d He pauses, urgent eyes boring into mine, and I feel exposed, like he can see into the very soul of me, my skin blazing under his touch, and oddly, I notice just how rough and calloused the skin on his hand is. \u201c\u2013 come up with something better to say than thank you.\u201d He shakes his head again and laughs.</p><p>But I can\u2019t join in. My throat is clogged up with all the words I wish I could say to him, the things, I more than anything want to tell him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d I finally say, slipping my hand out from under his.</p><p>He glances down at his empty hand and leans back against his pillows. Then I see his eyes run over me, down to my feet and back up again.</p><p>\u201cSo, you got home okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Well, if home was wandering around the park in the hospital grounds for a few hours trying to teach myself how to behave like a human and also worrying whether one of my kind would see me and then, when I could no longer bear the cold, clandestinely sneaking back into the hospital and heading straight for the cafeteria after deciding one of my own shouldn\u2019t be in there unless someone was scheduled to die - which fortunately they weren\u2019t \u2013 then yes, I got home just fine.</p><p>He continues to stare at me with an unreadable expression on his face and then he promptly rubs it away with his hand. \u201cGood, I\u2019m glad. I was worried about you getting home okay at such a late hour. I felt really bad. After all, you were only here because of me, and then I drag you back here again a few hours later. I\u2019ve caused you so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>But all I hear is \u2018worried\u2019. James was worried about me. No one has ever worried about me before. Well, okay, no one\u2019s ever had reason to worry about me before and everyone I know can\u2019t worry, but, still, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t caused me any trouble. I wanted to come back to see you.\u201d I smile. \u201cI mean, after all we\u2019ve been through \u2013,\u201d more than you\u2019ll ever know, \u201c\u2013 with the accident, and me saving you, I suppose \u2013 I feel \u2013 sort of \u2013\u201d I lower my eyes and my voice. \u201c\u2013 connected to you in a way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know where these words are coming from. It\u2019s like one minute, I can\u2019t speak and now I can\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>His eyes brighten and he sits forward, his voice eager as he says, \u201cI know what you mean. I mean, of course I wanted to see you again to talk about the accident, but I also wanted to see you because \u2013 well it seemed so final last night, you know \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t leave it there \u2013\u201d I nod, in agreement until he goes on to say, \u201c \u2013 because I just feel so incredibly indebted to you, Lucyna. I had to see you again so I can find out some way in which to repay you.\u201d</p><p>I stop nodding as my whole body sinks. And I can\u2019t stop my face from falling. He feels indebted to me. Indebted. I inwardly cringe at my moment of stupidity. Of course he does. How could I have been so stupid to think for one moment that he may have wanted to see me for any other reason?</p><p>I see the look of confusion swilling around his eyes and I quickly erase any trace of woe from my face, forcing a smile onto my lips. It feels awkward and loose, but I hold firm as I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything, James. You don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I do,\u201d he nods vigorously, \u201cand I will find some way to repay you.\u201d He sighs and rubs the back of his neck with his hand. \u201cWhat did happen last night? I mean what did you see? It\u2019s all a bit of a blank for me. Last thing I remember, I was driving through Surrey heading home from Joe\u2019s wedding and my sat nav was playing up, fucking thing.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt decided to detour me down some back roads and I was trying to find my way to the motorway, then nothing, just a big fat blank, until I woke up here, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was walking down the road and you drove past me in your car.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cI drove past you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his head, his eyes narrowing onto me. \u201cI don\u2019t remembering seeing you, but, then again, I don\u2019t remember much of anything,\u201d he says, his gaze relaxing. \u201cSorry, carry on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell about twenty or so seconds later after you\u2019d passed me, I heard tyres screeching and then a sort of crashing, explosive noise. So I ran toward the noise and saw the front of your car mangled up with a tree, and it was on fire \u2013 your car that is. I managed to get the door open and saw you were unconscious, so I released your seatbelt and pulled you from the car. Then I carried you down the road away from it as far as I could manage.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me with what can only be described as awe, shaking his head. \u201cI just \u2013 can\u2019t believe \u2013 you did that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, feeling abashed.</p><p>\u201cWell I think you\u2019re amazing,\u201d he says, and I can feel my face heating. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing you did for me, Lucyna. Most people would have run in the opposite direction from a burning car.\u201d He reaches over again, taking hold of my arm, squeezing it, sending a jolt searing up my arm.</p><p>I glance up at him and he\u2019s staring intently at me. He doesn\u2019t look away and neither do I. Our eyes are locked together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that,\u201d I murmur. \u201cHow another hu - person - could leave someone to die like that.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, but there\u2019s plenty out there who would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never have left you.\u201d I can feel myself been pulled to him, almost like there\u2019s a magnetic force drawing me closer</p><p>James smiles a crooked smile and relaxes his gaze, instantly bringing me to my senses. I shift back in my seat and avert my eyes, looking out of the window.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something I can do for you, some way I can repay you.\u201d</p><p>His words instantly remind me of his reason for asking me here, that he views me as nothing more than his saviour, as he should. I forget that he\u2019s only known me for a few hours, unlike the weeks I\u2019ve known him. Those few intense weeks. Obviously he doesn\u2019t feel for me as I do for him. I need to rein myself in and behave like any other normal human being would in this type of situation. I shake my head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I need, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d He echoes disbelievingly, eyes amused, leaning toward me.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I smile.</p><p>He laughs, shaking his head and resting back onto his bed.</p> <p>\u201cSo how long do you have to stay here?\u201d I ask, opting for a subject change.</p><p>He stretches his arms above his head, crooking his head from side to side. \u201cThey\u2019re letting me out today.\u201d He smiles, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cThe doctor came round first thing and said I was okay to be released home. I\u2019m just waiting for them to let me know when. Surprising really, usually takes ages to see a doctor. They\u2019re probably short on beds.\u201d He laughs, but it sounds forced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news for you.\u201d But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m really thinking. All I can think, is when will I be able to see him again? The realisation hits me with a dull thud. It\u2019s not like it used to be, I can\u2019t just choose to see him whenever I wish. When he leaves here, I can\u2019t just drop into his house at any given moment. At least whilst he\u2019s in the hospital I can use the visiting aspect as a reason for seeing him, but when he\u2019s at home I can\u2019t do that. Things are changing so quickly and I can\u2019t decipher whether it\u2019s for the best or not.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says quietly, his voice suddenly dull. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home.\u201d I hear his words, but know he doesn\u2019t really mean it. I can see the traces of sadness shadowing his face which most people might have missed. I wish I knew exactly what it is he\u2019s thinking. But I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the thought of going home alone that makes him sad, knowing he\u2019ll be thinking of Max, that he\u2019s missing Max. It makes me want to hold him, comfort him, tell him Max is fine, that he\u2019s in a wonderful place, a place where James should be right now, where he would be with Max. Maybe that\u2019s what he would have wanted; no doubt he would have been happy there. I know how unhappy he\u2019s been since Max died. I can openly see it now in his face. Maybe he would have preferred it if I had let him die so he could again be with his family. But now I have gone and interfered, changing his destiny for my own selfish reasons.</p><p>All my arrogance, my assurance that I had done the right thing for him was really that I was doing the right thing for me. What a self-serving being I have truly become.</p><p>Guilt shrouds me, prickling at my skin, the truth sinking its sentient teeth into me, wounding me. I wrap my arms around myself and avert my eyes to the floor, desperately trying to contain my feelings.</p><p>\u201cLucyna?\u201d The tone in his voice instantly draws my eyes up to his. I can see the affliction in them as he says, \u201cI wanted to ask you \u2013\u201d</p><p>But he never finishes the sentence because the door bursts open. I nearly jump out of my seat. For a moment, I think it\u2019s the Elders coming for me. It\u2019s not, obviously. It\u2019s Sara, James\u2019 friend.</p><p>\u201cJames! Thank God you\u2019re okay! Why didn\u2019t you call me! I mean I had to bloody hear it from Neil of all people, whom you rang, might I add, and then he rings me to see if I\u2019m going to see you in the hospital, and I\u2019m like what are you on about? Jesus Christ, I\u2019ve been so worried! I tried to call your phone but \u2013\u201d she stops abruptly as she registers my presence. Her eyes flick from me, to James, then back to me.</p><p>\u201cSara, this is Lucyna.\u201d He gestures to me, then he points in Sara\u2019s direction. \u201cLucyna, this is my friend, Sara.\u201d</p><p>She openly runs her eyes over me, appraising me.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Sara,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Same.\u201d She walks around to the other side of the bed, dragging the other chair up beside James. I see the narrowed look he gives her, but she\u2019s too busy eyeballing me to notice.</p><p>\u201cLucyna saved my life,\u201d James says with that reverent tone in his voice he\u2019s seemingly taken to using whilst on the subject. My face once again grows hot with embarrassment at his erroneous opinion of me. \u201cShe pulled me from my car whilst it was on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car was on fire!\u201d she says aghast.</p><p>He sighs, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure what happened but on the way back from that wedding I told you I was going to, I somehow managed to crash my car into a tree, and it set on fire. Lucyna pulled me out of it. If it wasn\u2019t for her I\u2019d be dead right now.\u201d</p><p>She scoots her chair closer to him. \u201cMy God, James. I can\u2019t believe it \u2013 Jesus Christ. I just \u2013\u201d She pauses and shakes her head. \u201cBut you\u2019re okay now, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just a broken leg and a few stitches.\u201d He points to his head. \u201cI\u2019m lucky. It would have been much, much, worse, if it wasn\u2019t for Lucyna.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head slowly, gazing at him, then pulls her eyes away from him to look at me. \u201cThank you for what you did, for saving James,\u201d she says with real sincerity before placing a protective hand on his arm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t even bear thinking about.\u201d She gazes back at him and I suddenly feel like I\u2019ve intruded on a moment I don\u2019t really belong in.</p><p>But James\u2019s eyes aren\u2019t on her. He\u2019s staring straight ahead. He picks up his glass of water and begins to sip it. Sara looks down at her hands. For a few seconds there\u2019s a really awkward, prickly silence in the room, making those seconds feel like hours.</p><p>Sara looks up at me and forces a smile onto her lips, her eyes drifting to the door behind me. I\u2019m getting the distinct impression that she doesn\u2019t require my presence here any more.</p><p>Maybe I should go, give them time alone to talk. But I\u2019m torn as I really don\u2019t want to leave James. Selfish, I know.</p><p>Fortunately the reasonable, selfless side of me wins, even though parting from him for even just a short space of time fills me with dread. But I have to redeem myself in some way, show myself I\u2019m not totally self-serving.</p><p>I stand up. James\u2019 surprised eyes instantly follow me up. \u201cI should go.\u201d I point toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d His brow furrows. \u201cOh, right, I just, I \u2013 er, I haven\u2019t had a chance to thank you \u2013 I mean properly. I really need to do something to repay you \u2013\u201d The hesitancy in his voice is audible and I somehow manage to keep the smile from my face at his reaction to my impending departure while ensuring I avoid acknowledging the scowl on Sara\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI can come back later if you still need to talk to me about the accident,\u201d I say.</p><p>His face relaxes and his eyes crinkle up at the corners. \u201cWould you? I\u2019m not \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d He\u2019s interrupted by a female voice, and I glance at the door to see a large portly woman in nurse\u2019s attire, with glasses perched on the tip of her nose, standing partway into the room, her hand holding the door open. She pauses momentarily, peering over her glasses at us all, then continues on to say, \u201cYour discharge papers will be ready for you sometime this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you\u2019re okay getting home or do you need transport arranging?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll take a taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>The nurse nods.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great then, thanks.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a taxi,\u201d Sara says. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be at work. You should be there now,\u201d James says, glancing up at the clock on the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just take a flyer -\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He has a smile on his lips, but a stern tone in his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what time it\u2019ll be when they release me and I don\u2019t want you getting into trouble at work. I\u2019ll take a taxi.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the nurse tapping her fingernails on the door and her intermittent sighs of impatience as James and Sara continue on with their fruitless disagreement, and I stand there wondering if I should just make my exit now or not.</p><p>\u201cBut how will you manage?\u201d Sara says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got a broken leg,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not an invalid. I can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll need help and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d I interject wanting to relieve us all from this going-nowhere conversation, and two pairs of eyes instantly flick to me. I focus on James. \u201cIf you need help, I can help you get home. I can\u2019t drive but I can ride in the taxi with you and help you into your house, help with whatever you need,\u201d thus meaning I can spend that little bit more time with him. Admittedly, my motives are not completely selfless in this instance, but who can blame me?</p> <p>For a split second I can actually hear a pin drop in this room, I can feel Sara\u2019s sharp green eyes on me, but I just keep looking at James' warm, dark brown ones. I\u2019m sufficiently up with reading human behaviour to know that, for some reason, Sara has taken an instant dislike to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he says to me warmly, his tone instantly changed from a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, James, really.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his upper body turning toward me. \u201cI\u2019m sure you must have better things to do than help me home.\u201d</p><p>I stand behind the plastic chair, gripping hold of it with my fingers. I smile, suppressing a laugh. \u201cNot really. I\u2019d be happy to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take you up on the offer, then.\u201d A smile plays on his lips. \u201cI guess that\u2019s two things which I have to thank you for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we're sorted, then?\u201d the nurse says to James with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we're sorted,\u201d he says, his eyes drifting back to me.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll book that taxi and be back this afternoon with your discharge papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d he says, but she\u2019s already gone, the door swinging shut in the wake of her departure.</p><p>He turns back to Sara who is currently looking pretty vexed, at me, I assume.</p><p>\u201cYou should be getting yourself to work,\u201d he says to her, seemingly oblivious to her annoyance. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna piss your boss off by taking too much time off.\u201d</p><p>She holds her hand up in protest, but then seems to change her mind, dropping it back in her lap. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll get off, but I\u2019ll see you soon. okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he nods. \u201cThanks for coming though.\u201d He leans over to hug her.</p><p>I feel a sharp pain at their embrace. It stabs me hard, right in the centre of my chest.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was gonna come, you idiot.\u201d She smiles bashfully, then kisses his cheek and straightens herself up, brushing her hands down her skirt. \u201cOh.\u201d She reaches down and retrieves her bag from the floor. \u201cI swung by your house on the way here and picked you up some clean clothes. Thought you might need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I do without you, eh?\u201d He looks at her gratefully, taking the clothes from her. \u201cYou\u2019re a real mate, Sara.\u201d</p><p>I see her eyes cloud over and she quickly forces a smile onto her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d she chirps. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll see you later, then.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cGoodbye, Lucyna. it was nice to meet you,\u201d and I can tell from her tone that\u2019s far from what she really thinks.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, Sara.\u201d</p><p>The door closes behind her and the room falls silent.</p><p>I take my seat back beside James. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m staying, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything for you? Get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could murder a coffee, if it\u2019s not too much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Where do I get one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust turn left out the door, the machine's a bit further down the corridor on your right.\u201d</p><p>I leave the room, feeling James\u2019 eyes on my back, and happily go off in search of this coffee machine. I find it fairly easily, but have no idea how to work it. It\u2019s got so many buttons and no visible instructions. In the end I have to get a passing nurse to help me.</p><p>I\u2019m gone a while before I return back with his coffee.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, as I hand the steaming cup to him.</p><p>I pull the over-bed table up for him to rest it on. \u201cSorry it took me a while.\u201d I shake my head shyly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t work the machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah they\u2019re not easy, are they?\u201d He laughs, but it sounds different, uncomfortable, almost forced.</p><p>I sit down and there\u2019s silence between us. That\u2019s when I notice the charge in the air, almost as if something\u2019s changed whilst I\u2019ve been gone.</p><p>James blows on his coffee, takes a sip and puts it down. He\u2019s staring at the coffee with a thoughtful look on his face and begins drumming his fingers on the side of the cup. I can tell there\u2019s something he wants to say, and at that thought he clears his throat and says, \u201cSo you managed to get home okay last night?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he ask me this already? \u201cYes. I got home fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He runs his fingertip around the rim of the cup. \u201cWhereabouts is it you live, Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my hands and start examining my new human nails. Come on, you decided this earlier on, you were just going to stick with the same story you told the police and tell him you\u2019re homeless if he asks. Just say it, it\u2019s not difficult. \u201cI\u2019m \u2013\u201d I start but for some reason I can\u2019t seem to bring myself to finish the sentence and, before I know it, I hear myself saying, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t know it.\u201d I can feel his stare but I can\u2019t bring myself to look at him. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, why can\u2019t I just tell him?</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He pauses but I can tell he\u2019s not finished. \u201cBut it\u2019s in Surrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I lift my eyes, meeting his inquisitive stare.</p><p>\u201cWhere you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight . . . well I know Surrey really well so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know it.\u201d The persistence is clearly there in his voice, telling me he\u2019s not going to let it go, and I struggle to contain the panic rising up inside me as James\u2019 expectant eyes wait for an answer.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Home Sweet Home</p><p>I stare past him, my body riddled with discomfort.</p><p>Do I know any places in Surrey? I must do. Think, Lucyna, think. But for some reason my brain won\u2019t work properly. \u201cIts \u2013 it\u2019s just this little place in \u2013\u201d Stop this stupidity Lucyna. What\u2019s wrong with you? Just tell him the truth. Well, the partial truth, anyway. So I meet his dark curious eyes and shake my head as I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a home. I did. But I don\u2019t any more.\u201d</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t react. He doesn\u2019t say anything, almost as if he was expecting it. He just continues to stare at me with those big deep brown eyes, and I feel like I have to bridge the gap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, though,\u201d I say brightly. I try to add a light-hearted laugh at the end but it comes out sounding cringe-worthy, bouncing off all four walls and straight back at me.</p><p>His eyes focus in on me with determination and, for a moment, he looks exactly like Max did when he was trying to talk me into caring for James. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay,\u201d he says resolutely. \u201cHow could it be? Someone like you shouldn\u2019t be homeless. Well, no one should be homeless \u2013 but not you \u2013 no.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI did wonder when you came back this morning wearing the same clothes you had on last night and when you said you\u2019d been out walking at such a late hour when I had my crash. I did think \u2013 well it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought \u2013 where did you sleep last night, after you left here?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and shuffle uncomfortably in my seat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I twist my lips nervously. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t actually sleep, I just spent a bit of time in the park in the grounds, and then I stayed in the canteen as it was a bit cold outside. I wanted to be close by so I could come back to see you.\u201d</p><p>He sort of grunts an angry sound. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he mutters, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous out there, Lucyna. All sorts of freaks about. If I\u2019d of known, I\u2019d have done something last night. I\u2019d have sorted you out a place to stay, a hotel or something.\u201d He sounds angry and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s with me or himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your responsibility, James,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cMy situation\u2019s not for you to fix.\u201d But how I wish he could. Little does he know that we\u2019re thinking on two very different wave lengths here, and having two very different conversations.</p><p>He looks at me, dark eyes wide, flaming. \u201cI know, but I can help you. God, Lucyna, after what you\u2019ve done for me, it\u2019s the very least I can do.\u201d His voice fills with conviction as he emphatically states, \u201cYou\u2019re coming to stay with me at my house, until you get yourself sorted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, a little more than surprised. That I wasn\u2019t expecting. Then a lovely warm glow erupts in me, like hot molten lava coating my insides.</p><p>\u201cI mean obviously I can\u2019t force you to, but I\u2019d really like it if you did. I\u2019d certainly sleep a lot better at night knowing you were safe under my roof. And you do want me to get some sleep, don\u2019t you?\u201d His lips twist into a grin. \u201cBecause I look pretty shocking when I\u2019ve had no sleep \u2013 hair all over the place.\u201d He twists a lock of his hair around his finger. \u201cDark circles under my eyes. it\u2019s not pretty sight, I can tell you \u2013\u201d And I hold off telling him I already know just exactly how he looks when he doesn\u2019t sleep, because he hardly ever does, and still always manages to look beautiful. \u201c\u2013 and I get really moody when I\u2019m tired.\u201d He nods with certainty. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be cranky at work and I\u2019ll take it out on Neil who works for me and probably the customers as well. Then Neil will quit, and my customers will go elsewhere, and I\u2019ll be out of business and lose everything, and then I\u2019ll end up on the streets too, and \u2013\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I cut him off laughing, feeling exasperated just listening to him. \u201cI get the point.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me earnestly. \u201cLook, Lucyna, I know you barely know me, but honestly I\u2019m not a serial killer, sexual predator, drug addict, or raging alcoholic \u2013 yet.\u201d A mischievous grin etches onto his lips. \u201cOh, and I don\u2019t smoke \u2013 any more - scouts honour.\u201d He does a two-fingered salute, and I laugh at him. \u201cAsk anyone - I\u2019m a pretty normal guy, well, except for a fairly serious caffeine addiction.\u201d He taps his cup. \u201cSeriously though, I have two other bedrooms just sitting there empty. And I live in Chelsea. It\u2019s a nice place \u2013 so what do you say?\u201d he asks, hopeful eyes gazing at me.</p><p>I look at him for a moment. I know why he\u2019s doing this and I also know what I have done by saving him. But what is done is done, and I can\u2019t change anything now, and if I\u2019m being honest, probably wouldn\u2019t if I had the time again. Then knowing there would never be an instance in which I would say no, as this will mean I get to spend more time with him before I\u2019m taken back home, I say with absolute delight, \u201cYes, that would be wonderful,\u201d and struggle to control the beaming smile that\u2019s etching itself across my face. \u201cThank you so much. It\u2019s really kind of you.\u201d</p><p>He beams widely. \u201cGreat. That\u2019s settled, then.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd don\u2019t thank me. Like I said, it\u2019s the least I can do for you after what you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lucyna, it was something. It was huge. I\u2019d be dead right now if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>How very true that is, and he doesn\u2019t even know the full extent of it.</p><p>We spend the rest of the morning through to the afternoon talking, well mainly me asking James question after question, wanting to learn all I can about him. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t want to know. And obviously I can\u2019t tell James very much about myself, so every time he asks me a question or tries to steer the conversation in my direction, I do a great job of side stepping and pointing it right back at him.</p><p>The nurse comes back mid-afternoon with his discharge papers. I leave the room whilst she helps him dress, then I follow behind carrying his crutches whilst the nurse pushes him in a wheelchair into the lift and outside to the waiting taxi.</p> <p>It takes about an hour to get to James\u2019 house from the hospital. We don\u2019t really talk much in the car, so I spend most of the time looking out of the window, watching the outside world whiz past before my eyes.</p><p>When we arrive at James\u2019 house, he pays the driver, and I help him out of the car and hand him his crutches. He hobbles up the path, struggling to use them for the first time, and I follow behind, gazing up at my new home. Funnily, considering how many times I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve never seen the outside of James\u2019 house, but then I guess I\u2019ve never had reason to come out here before. It\u2019s an old three storey red brick town house, a big bay window downstairs and a bright white front door with frosted glass panels. It\u2019s homely.</p><p>James unlocks the door and I step inside the wide hallway, my shoes tapping loudly against the oak floor amid the immediate quiet. And the warmth and safety of James\u2019s home radiates over me, wrapping comfortingly all around me.</p><p>I cannot begin to describe how happy I feel, hardly able to believe that I\u2019m actually going to be living here at James\u2019 request. I have been here so many times, but obviously he is unaware of this. Now, I\u2019m here because he wants me to be.</p><p>James slumps down awkwardly onto the sofa in the living room. He leans his crutches up beside him, reaches over and pulls the footstool before him and lifts his potted leg to rest on it.</p><p>And I\u2019m just stood here gazing at him, remembering how he was sitting there the very first night I came to visit him, remembering the countless times I\u2019ve sat next to him in that very spot back when I existed only for the dead.</p> <p>He sighs and rakes his fingers through his hair. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says sounding slightly breathless, \u201cmy bedroom is the one at the front.\u201d He points his finger upwards at the ceiling. \u201cSo feel free to take any of the other two on that floor. I\u2019ll show you upstairs in a bit if that\u2019s okay? Journey home\u2019s just done me in.\u201d He lays his head back onto the sofa and glances up at me.</p><p>I take a seat on the chair across from him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll find my way round just fine.\u201d Of course I will. I\u2019d know my way round this house blindfolded.</p><p>\u201cThere is a bedroom up on the top floor with its own living area and bathroom. I\u2019d offer you it but that was, erm . . . \u201d He pauses and rubs his eye with the palm of his hand. \u201cWell it was my dad\u2019s and he, erm \u2013 well he passed away recently and it\u2019s still full of his stuff so. . . \u201d He looks down and shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, James, about your \u2013 dad.\u201d I have to stop myself from almost saying Max\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He nods.</p><p>And it suddenly occurs to me \u2013 how would James feel if he knew the truth, if he knew I was the one who took Max to Heaven, that I was the one who took his father away from him? A sick feeling washes over me.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d He looks up at me and I can see the sadness he tries to hide, buried deep in his eyes I have to restrain myself from getting up and going over to him and wrapping my arms tightly around him. Once again knowing I\u2019m partly to blame for his sorrow, I grip my fingers into the plush chair, momentarily distracted by the soft feeling. He lifts his questioning brows and now, forgetting what it was I was initially going to say, I say instead, \u201cJust to have a place to stay is wonderful. Thank you again. It really is kind of you \u2013\u201d</p><p>He dismisses my words with his hand. \u201cLike I said, I owe you, big time.\u201d</p> <p>James picks up the remote control and switches the television on. My eyes drift to it and I watch as he flicks through the channels. He finally settles on one. There\u2019s a music video playing. As I listen, I hear the band\u2019s singing about not going somewhere, or something \u2013 I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>I glance at James to find his eyes on me. And that\u2019s it, I\u2019m hooked right into his gaze. And for those few seconds I can feel a charge buzzing off me, infusing me with such warmth, and feelings so intense, I can barely control them.</p><p>I force a blink, and when I open my eyes again, James\u2019s is looking at the television. \u201cI like this song,\u201d I say, wanting to say something, anything, to cover the awkwardness I\u2019ve probably just created.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Oasis are awesome,\u201d he says, turning the volume up slightly. \u201cEspecially this song, \u2018Don\u2019t Go Away\u2019. It\u2019s one of their best. Well, it is in my opinion anyway.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cOasis?\u201d</p><p>His brows knit together. \u201cYeah \u2013 Oasis \u2013 the band that\u2019s playing on the TV now.\u201d He points to it with the remote control. \u201cYou never heard of them?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Oasis? I thought that was an isolated area of vegetation in a desert which surrounds a spring, not a music band.</p><p>He looks surprised. \u201cI thought everyone had heard of them.\u201d A sceptical expression plays on his lips, and I worry that maybe I should have just said I had heard of them. But then music\u2019s never really been of interest to me. I never got it before, never understood why humans love it so much, well not until I started feeling that is. And as I\u2019ve recently discovered, music\u2019s all about feeling. You have to feel the music, to understand it.</p><p>\u201cI saw them in concert a couple of years ago, not long before they split,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cThey were amazing live.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes they seem \u2013 great. This song is \u2013 great \u2013\u201d I trail off.</p><p>He glances at me and laughs, then turns the volume lower as the song comes to an end, and asks, \u201cLucyna, do you have anything \u2013 I mean any clothes or belongings that you need to pick up from somewhere?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything?\u201d He sounds astonished, and not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wrap my arms around myself. \u201cWhen I left \u2013 well \u2013 home \u2013 I kind of left in a hurry.\u201d Which is pretty much the truth. \u201cSo, I only have these.\u201d I trail my hand down my clothes.</p><p>He rubs his forehead. \u201cWell you\u2019re gonna need some stuff. Do you have any money?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll lend you some till you get sorted so you can get some new clothes and things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, feeling abashed and not really understanding why I feel this way. \u201cI will return the money as soon as I can,\u201d knowing how essential money is to humans.</p><p>\u201cNo rush,\u201d he reassures me. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t stay in those, they need washing.\u201d He points at the dirty marks on my clothes, forcing me to look down at the clothes that I somehow came to be wearing when I turned into this human-ish being. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to borrow some of mine while you wash them. They\u2019ll be too big for you, but they\u2019ll have to do you for now. I\u2019ll go get you some.\u201d He reaches for his crutches.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up. I\u2019ll get them.\u201d I shift forward in my seat. \u201cJust tell me where your clothes are?\u201d</p><p>He rests his crutches back down and says, \u201cThere\u2019s some clean stuff in the dryer.\u201d He points toward the hall. \u201cHelp yourself. Stick your clothes onto wash as well if you want whilst your there.\u201d</p><p>I get up, and even though I know where the utility room is as I\u2019ve seen James wash his clothes there many times, I still ask, \u201cWhereabouts is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight down the hall, through the kitchen, first door on your left.\u201d</p><p>I end up wearing some black jogging trousers. I go for those as they have a drawstring on the waist which means I can tighten them to fit me, but the legs are trailing on the floor. And I pick out a black t-shirt with a motif on the front, which is also pretty big on me. I put my own clothes onto wash, recalling how I\u2019ve seen James do it before, and then return to the living room.</p><p>He looks up as I enter. \u201cRolling Stones,\u201d he says nodding at the t-shirt I\u2019m wearing. \u201cGood choice.\u201d Then his eyes move down to my legs and he laughs. \u201cBit long for you. They need turning up.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my hidden feet unsure as to what he means.</p><p>I glance up and catch the questioning in his stare, but all he says is, \u201cHere.\u201d He motions for me to go sit on the footstool beside his leg. He reaches down and cups my leg with his hand, lifting it to rest beside him, then begins turning up the hem of the trousers. And I\u2019m frozen. I am literally afraid to move in case I do something stupid, something not in keeping with normal human behaviour, because currently my whole body feels like it\u2019s going to explode from the touch of his hands on my skin.</p><p>He rests my leg down and motions for the other one. I lift it up without saying a word, curling my fingers around the edge of the stool for support, because now adjoining the explosive feeling, I\u2019ve also got these little tiny bursts of energy that keep shooting up my leg each time his skin grazes against mine. I can feel my face growing hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll done.\u201d His eyes meet mine. I hold his gaze for a moment then look away. I lower my leg back to the floor. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He stretches his hands above his head, yawning, and rubs his eyes roughly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I am,\u201d he says, sounding suddenly sleepy. \u201cSorry, I know it\u2019s only early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You\u2019ve had quite a day. I\u2019ll help you up to bed.\u201d</p><p>It takes us a while, but we finally make it up the stairs and I see him to his room.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, leaning up against the door frame.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d I take a step back. \u201cSo I think I\u2019ll go to my room and sleep too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Lucyna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoodnight, James.\u201d</p><p>I walk along the landing, heading toward the back of the house, knowing exactly which room I\u2019m going to stay in. The one that provides the perfect view of his beautiful garden.</p><p>I shut the door behind me and go over to the window. The night\u2019s drawing in, preparing to coat everything in its blackness. I look around the room, taking in just where I actually am.</p><p>I am in James\u2019 house. He\u2019s just down the hall from me. And he knows me, he actually knows me.</p><p>And I finally release the euphoria that this knowledge brings, the one I\u2019ve been working so hard all day to contain, and I let it run through me with all its heavenly urgency, releasing the smile that wants to own my lips forever. I lie back onto the bed, and begin to replay my day with James over and over again in my mind.</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>Cross Your Heart</p><p>I\u2019ve been downstairs for hours as I\u2019ve discovered I don\u2019t sleep.</p><p>I haven\u2019t slept since I became this \u2013 well \u2013 version of a human I\u2019ve become. And I\u2019ve already gathered that my new body doesn\u2019t require other humanly functions to survive, as I\u2019ve had absolutely no desire for food or drink. But I wasn\u2019t sure about sleep. I didn\u2019t know if my body would need to rest or not. As it turned out, it doesn\u2019t. I did try. I laid on the bed and closed my eyes for quite some time, but nothing happened. And I haven\u2019t had any signs of fatigue, as human\u2019s do \u2013 no yawning or desire to stretch my body of any sort, and considering how long I\u2019ve been awake, I surely would be tired by now if I was ever going to be.</p><p>So I just stayed in my room and wiled the hours away thinking about James, distracted by just how close he was to me. Then I read a book I found in my room. It was a new and joyous experience, and one I most certainly want to repeat. Some humans really do have a way with the written word. And finally I watched the sun rise.</p><p>Then, when it seemed like a reasonable hour for a human to arise after sleeping, I came downstairs.</p><p>I\u2019ve being trying to think of ways I can help James today as he is partially incapacitated. The first thing I came up with was breakfast. Humans need to eat, and James doesn\u2019t eat nearly enough, as I\u2019ve seen, so I decided to make it for him.</p><p>I searched through the kitchen cupboards and found some cereal. Then I located bread, browned it in the toaster and, when it was ready, buttered it. Finally I prepared James\u2019 coffee in his coffee machine, just as I\u2019ve watched him do nearly every morning for the past three weeks.</p><p>I survey the kitchen table. It's all set up with the food and drink I\u2019ve created, and I feel a sense of achievement. Toast, cereal and coffee. It looks enticing \u2013 I think.</p> <p>\u201cMorning.\u201d I hear James\u2019s warm, husky voice come from behind me and turn to see him in the doorway surveying the table. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d He motions to the food. \u201cWell, assuming some of it is for me.\u201d He grins, standing there one arm resting on his crutch, the other raking his fingers through his dishevelled hair.</p><p>But I can\u2019t answer. I can\u2019t form words. And it\u2019s not just because he looks glorious with his hair all messy and rumpled from sleep, his jogging bottoms that he\u2019s cut up the leg to accommodate his pot hanging so loosely around his navel \u2013 no, that\u2019s not what has clamped my mouth tightly shut and sent every particle of me into frenzy. No, it\u2019s the fact that I can see from his navel all the way up to his broad expansive chest, his bare skin perfectly smooth, exposed here before me. I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. I\u2019ve never seen James, well \u2013 naked, before. I was always very respectful whilst I was here watching him, always departing when he would be about to undress.</p><p>He raises his brows in a question mark, forcing me to finally say, \u201cYes, of course it\u2019s for you.\u201d But my voice breaks, betraying me. I turn away, face flaming, and move over to the sink. I look up to see James watching my face in the reflection of the window. I look away.</p><p>He chuckles softly, then I register the sound of a chair scraping against the wooden floor as he pulls it out. \u201cThanks for this. You really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I turn back, lean up against the sink and desperately try not to stare at his chest \u2013 it\u2019s harder than you\u2019d think. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cWell thanks. I really appreciate it.\u201d He pours himself a coffee, takes a sip, and then tips the cup in my direction. \u201cCoffee\u2019s spot on. Cheers.\u201d</p><p>I smile, glowing, happy I\u2019ve pleased him. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I take a seat across from him at the table, noticing for the first time that the gauze on his forehead has gone. \u201cYou removed your gauze.\u201d I touch my forehead in the equivalent spot to where his gauze used to be.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they said to take it off when I got home. Let the air get to it.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at the cut that sits cleanly under his hairline, tiny stitches holding it together, as his fingertip touches just shy of it. \u201cAnother scar to add to the collection.\u201d He sighs dramatically, rolling his eyes with obvious amusement, his finger drifting to the older scar on his brow. \u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d he asks, picking up a slice of toast.</p><p>\u201cOh. On the bed. It was really comfortable. For eight hours. How did you sleep?\u201d I worry because I know just how little he actually does.</p><p>He raises his eyebrow, lips curving and puts down the untouched piece of toast. \u201cOh yeah, I slept on my bed as well, for about ten hours.\u201d He nods grinning.</p><p>I smile, pleased he\u2019s slept for so much longer than normal. \u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, then says, \u201cHmm, yeah, I was expecting to be up all night with this thing on.\u201d He taps his potted leg. \u201cMust be the painkillers the hospital has got me on that knocked me out.\u201d He picks up his toast and takes a bite.</p><p>\u201cYou not hungry?\u201d he asks, words muffled by his mouthful of toast.</p><p>\u201cI ate before you came down. I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Another lie and it concerns me how adept I\u2019ve become at this lying business. And honestly, I wish I could eat the toast and drink the coffee because the smells wafting up from the table are wonderful.</p><p>He laughs. \u201c'Course it is. This is your home now, Lucyna. You do as you please. You don\u2019t have to fit around me.\u201d He leans back in his chair, cup in hand. \u201cSo what are your plans for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh \u2013 I don\u2019t know.\u201d I rest my arms on the table, linking my fingers together. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought past breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He takes a sip of coffee, then puts it down. \u201cI need to do a few things work-wise this morning, well mainly I have to get on the phone and sort a temp to help Neil and the lads out with the workload whilst I\u2019m out of action. And then I really need to go to the supermarket, as you\u2019ll have noticed \u2013\u201d He gestures to the kitchen cupboards. \u201c\u2013 there\u2019s not much in, and I thought it would be an idea for you to come with me . . . obviously I need the help \u2013\u201d He scrunches his face up, squinting at me cheekily. \u201c\u2013 but I also thought we could get you some clothes and stuff while we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll have to take a taxi, though, as obviously I don\u2019t have a car any more. I\u2019ve got the work van but it\u2019s not like I can exactly drive with this thing on \u2013 unless you drive.\u201d He looks at me hopefully.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, sorry.\u201d I used to be able to travel at the speed of light, but now I have to walk to get where I want to go.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, we\u2019ll take a taxi.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>After happily watching James eat nearly all the breakfast I\u2019ve made, I go upstairs and take a shower for the very first time, knowing this to be a normal humanly thing to do. And it\u2019s the most amazing experience I\u2019ve had so far \u2013 well except for every time James looks at, or touches, me, that is.</p><p>I stand under the hot water, exhilarated by the feel of it as it cascades down onto this body of mine. After a while, I reluctantly get out, wrap a towel around myself and stand in front of the mirror, not really knowing what I should do with my now wet hair. I know human women generally put a lot of effort into the appearance of their hair, but I haven\u2019t got a clue where to start. So I just wring the water out with a towel, leave it to hang down my back, and put my original clothes back on now they\u2019re clean.</p><p>We take a taxi to Kings Road. James steers me into a clothes shop first. It\u2019s probably one of the most challenging things I\u2019ve done since I landed here in my new attire, well aside from saving James' life. Wonderful but daunting. I\u2019m wandering around this shop with absolutely no idea of what I\u2019m supposed to buy, trying to act like I do. But part of me, well a big part, can barely believe that I\u2019m actually here amongst these humans, looking like one of them, pretending to be one of them. It\u2019s truly beyond imagining.</p><p>There are so many different clothes to choose from. I do the best I can, mainly by watching what other women in the shop are picking out, which mostly consists of t-shirts, skirts, jumpers and jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d James is standing before me holding up the prettiest dress I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s the colour of the sky, with these little jewels embellished along the neck line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really lovely,\u201d I say fingering the silky fabric.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI thought it\u2019d suit you. We\u2019ll take it, then.\u201d He peers at the tag inside the dress. \u201cI think I got the right size \u2013 you\u2019re about an eight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d his cheeks colour, \u201cnot that I know much about women's dress sizes, but you are \u2013 well, you are tiny.\u201d</p><p>What size am I? I\u2019ve just been picking up what I thought looked like it would fit me. I nod. \u201cYes a size eight is perfect.\u201d Then I surreptitiously begin flicking through the clothes I\u2019ve got, checking the labels for sizes. Mainly eights and some tens. They\u2019ll do.</p><p>\u201cYou got everything you need, then?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my arms laden with clothes and nod. I follow him over to the counter where he proceeds to pay, which oddly makes me feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re gonna need some shoes to go with all these clothes you\u2019ve just got,\u201d James says once were outside the shop.</p><p>I look down at the many bags in my hands. He\u2019s spent what seems like a lot of money on me already. I don\u2019t want James to spend all of his money on me because he feels like he owes me for saving his life, which I only did under fraudulent circumstances. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine with what I already have.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, brows raised, and says with absolute certainty, \u201cI\u2019m buying you some shoes, Lucyna, and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d Then he moves off before I can attempt a shot at resisting and, for a man currently on crutches, he\u2019s moving pretty swiftly, might I add. So I just dutifully follow along behind him.</p><p>I manage to get him down to two pairs of shoes. Then, as we\u2019re leaving the shoe shop, James clears his throat and says, somewhat awkwardly, \u201cEr \u2013 Lucyna, do you erm \u2013 well you're gonna need some \u2013 underwear, aren\u2019t you? You know, like \u2013 bras and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Underwear, of course, humans always wear this beneath their clothes. I regard his flushed face, his uncomfortable demeanour, not seeing the source of his embarrassment and without, even bothering to contest over the money, knowing it to be a fruitless exercise, I say, \u201cYes, I will need some.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd to see James like this. He\u2019s usually so self-assured, so sure. It\u2019s incredibly endearing. It makes me want to reach out and run my fingertips across his glowing cheek.</p><p>\u201cRight, well La Senza\u2019s just there,\u201d he says, voice some somewhat gruff. I follow his gaze to a shop across the other side of the busy road which has women\u2019s underwear artfully displayed in its window. \u201cHere\u2019s my card.\u201d He pushes his credit card into my hand. \u201cGet whatever you need. My pin number\u2019s \u2013\u201d He moves closer to me, his body almost pressed against mine, only the thin layers of our clothes and a sliver of air separate us, as he whispers in my ear, \u201cOne, three, three, seven.\u201d His breath blows over my neck, setting my body on high alert. He moves back, looking down at me with opaque eyes which instantly clear. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go in here.\u201d He points to a shop advertising DVDs and computer games in its window. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you outside La Senza in fifteen, okay?\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s gone, leaving me standing in the middle of the busy street, my body buzzing, kindling, practically spitting off flames. I mentally shake myself into the now, and, with his credit card in hand, slowly walk toward La Senza.</p><p>The woman in the shop is really helpful. She asks if I know my sizes, to which I obviously reply no. So she takes me into the changing area and measures me with a tape measure, and then brings bras for me to try on. I just buy the ones she brought me and the pants to match, and also some sleepwear \u2013 well if I\u2019m acting like I sleep I may as well go the whole hog and dress the part too. And after paying, recalling just how James had done it, I go outside to find him leant up against the shop window, crutches resting under his arms, a bag in his hand, waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cAll done?\u201d He smiles, back to his usual, certain self.</p> <p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I say handing his credit card back to him.</p><p>Lastly we go to the supermarket. It\u2019s packed full of humans. I steer the trolley around whilst James walks alongside, filling it with food and toiletries he says I\u2019ll need. I just agree, nodding in what I hope are the right places, praying I get it right and come across as just like any other normal human being would.</p><p>We take a taxi back to James\u2019 house, well my home now too. I put the food away in the kitchen whilst James rests on the sofa. The shopping trip really tired him out. Then I put my new clothes away in the wardrobe in my bedroom.</p><p>I\u2019m on my way down the stairs when I hear James on the telephone in the living room. His voice terse, strained, as he says, \u201cIt\u2019s my house. I can do as I please and after what she did for me \u2013 well it doesn\u2019t even fucking measure up. I\u2019m not gonna argue with you about it, she\u2019s staying here, end of . . . I know you are but \u2013 . . . Jesus Christ, Sara! What the fuck! You don\u2019t even know her to make those kinds of assumptions! . . . No. Seriously, I don\u2019t wanna hear it. I\u2019ll speak to you later.\u201d</p><p>I hear the television go on and wait a few minutes before going in the living room. I don\u2019t want him to think I was listening in on his conversation - which I obviously was.</p><p>He looks up when I enter, eyes dark, a frown etched deep into his forehead. I take a seat on the sofa beside him. He starts tapping the phone loudly against his pot.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to his voice.</p><p>I link my fingers together. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem okay, you seem \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says curtly, cutting me dead, his tone surprising me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d I get up to leave.</p><p>He puts a hand on my arm, stopping me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He shakes his head, and sighs. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you, I\u2019m just \u2013 really pissed off.\u201d He tosses the phone onto the sofa beside him. \u201cYou remember my friend Sara \u2013 the one you met at hospital?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell she\u2019s just kinda \u2013\u201d he half smiles, \u201c \u2013 pissing me off at the moment, which is weird really 'cause we never row.\u201d He rubs his brow thoughtfully. \u201cTo be honest, I can\u2019t think of a time we have in all the years I\u2019ve known her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have been friends?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks at me, his face less tense now. \u201cSince we were kids. Our dads were best friends. We grew up together. She\u2019s kinda like a sister to me. Our families always went on holidays together, days out \u2013 you know that sort of stuff.\u201d He pushes his fingers through his hair. \u201cBut she\u2019s just . . . overstepped the mark a bit. She thinks that \u2013\u201d He looks at me with weary eyes, then shakes his head and smiles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 so anyway, did you have a good time shopping today?\u201d And just like that he changes the subject.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it was great, and thanks again for all the clothes and shoes . . . and other stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, it\u2019s the \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2013 least you can do after what I did for you,\u201d I say, finishing his current aphorism with a smile.</p><p>He laughs, a real laugh, reaching all the way up to his eyes. \u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he grins, \u201ctouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>At five o\u2019clock James\u2019 employee, Neil, comes by the house to go through some work things with him. After the obligatory introductions, with me pretending like it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Neil - it\u2019s not; I\u2019ve seen him many times before when I used to watch James - I make myself scarce, leaving them in the living room to get on with their work.</p><p>I go in the kitchen, fill a glass with water and take it into the garden with me. I have no intention of attempting to drink it but I need it to appear to James that I do actually drink every now and then, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to dirty up a few glasses here and there as proof.</p><p>I sit down on one of the chairs on the paved area overlooking the big garden, resting the glass on the table, and let the afternoon sun drift over me, savouring the absolute tranquillity of this garden, the calmness it offers, as the heady scents emitting from the blossoms whirl gently around me.</p><p>I could spend forever sitting here.</p><p>After about an hour, Neil pops his head out of the back door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off now. It was really nice to meet you, Lucyna,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>I return his smile. \u201cIt was nice to meet you too, Neil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you, then.\u201d He waves and disappears off.</p><p>Five minutes later James comes out with a coat in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI brought you this in case you were getting cold.\u201d He hands me the coat and sits down in the chair beside me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I slide my arms into the sleeves, pulling it around me. It smells of him, all musky and intoxicating. \u201cYour garden is really beautiful, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks \u2013 well I suppose it should be with what I do for a living.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be a good advert if it was a mess.\u201d</p><p>I get up and begin wandering around, my eyes grazing over the colourful creations. \u201cWhat do you call these?\u201d I point to a cluster of bright purple flowers.</p><p>\u201cPurple Asters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really pretty,\u201d I say, bending down to get a better look at them - bright purple petals centred with yellow nectar. I press my nose to one, inhaling its sweet scent.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty hard to get. Usually the colour comes out violet but this season I got some true purple ones.\u201d He smiles proudly. \u201cThey\u2019re a symbol of love and patience, you know\u201d he adds knowingly. \u201cIn olden times, it was believed that if you burnt their leaves, the perfume would ward off evil spirits. They\u2019re one of my favourites.\u201d He laughs again. \u201cI know, not very manly to have a favourite flower but, hey, I am gardener after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey look like stars,\u201d I say, fingering the soft petals.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose they do,\u201d he replies, voice suddenly sounding uninterested. I can hear his fingers tapping on the wooden arm rest of the chair and after a moment he says, \u201cLucyna, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>I stand up. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ve been wondering . . . how did you come to be homeless?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my feet. Stupidly I hadn\u2019t thought this far, overlooking the glaringly obvious fact he would naturally be curious about my past.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, if you don\u2019t want,\u201d he adds, voice soft. \u201cIt makes no odds to me.\u201d</p><p>I look up at the very reason why I left my home, my one and only reason for existing as I now do - James, with his infinite pools for eyes; his curious brow creased, tilting his scar; his full lips pressed together, as he waits for my response. And it just kind of hits me smack bang in the centre of my chest, straight into my theoretical heart.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>And then it all just seems so very simple.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love,\u201d I hear myself saying, \u201cand for me to be able to be with him meant that I had to leave my home.\u201d I know just how close to the truth I\u2019m skirting but at this moment I have neither the wish nor the care to stop.</p><p>James\u2019s gaze drifts out over the garden. \u201cAnd . . . it didn\u2019t it work out with this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way I had hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love him?\u201d he asks, eyes fixed on mine.</p><p>I hold his gaze, willing him to hear me, to really hear me when I say, \u201cI will always love him, whether we\u2019re together or not.\u201d</p><p>He breaks from our gaze, looking down at the shoe he\u2019s begun scuffing against a paving stone. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you go back home after you\u2019d broken up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d broken the rules.\u201d</p><p>He looks back up at me with what can only be described as incredulity. \u201cRules? Jesus Christ, Lucyna, what rules?\u201d</p><p>I turn away from him.</p><p>And for a moment neither of us speaks.</p><p>After what seems an infinite amount of time, I hear his warm voice come from behind me. \u201cI\u2019m sure your family would want you back. How could they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they would,\u201d I wrap his coat tightly around me, pressing my nose into the collar, inhaling his scent, \u201cbut I\u2019m not so sure I want to go back. Ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear him sigh deeply. \u201cLucyna, look, you don\u2019t have to answer this if you don\u2019t want, but I\u2019m gonna ask anyway.\u201d He takes a deep breath, then says, \u201cDid you use to live in a cult?\u201d</p><p>I turn round to face him. \u201cA cult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you know, a cult, where there\u2019s loads of you all living together, like rurally, and you believe in a certain religion \u2013 and other stuff.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him troubled. \u201cI know what a cult is James. I\u2019m just wondering why you think I\u2019m from one?\u201d</p> <p>He rubs his hand over his face. \u201cBecause you\u2019re just so different, Lucyna \u2013 so completely different to anyone I\u2019ve ever met. You talk different, act different and everything\u2019s like \u2013\u201d He leans forward in his seat, arms resting on his legs, \u201c\u2013 I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It just seems like everything\u2019s brand new to you, like the world's a new place to you, almost as if you\u2019ve never really ventured out into it before, and I was trying to figure out why you\u2019d be like that, and the only thing I could come up with was that you\u2019d maybe \u2013 lived in a cult of some sort.\u201d He shakes his head, embarrassment creeping over his face. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway, obviously I\u2019m wrong, so I\u2019m just gonna stop talking \u2013 now.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the chair beside him and glance at his mortified face. Then I laugh. I can\u2019t help it. He thinks I\u2019m from a cult and I\u2019m fully aware of what that word\u2019s been denoted to mean since, well, the latter part of the twentieth century, what those places are, the very polar opposite of the good and righteous place I truly come from.</p><p>He glances at me and a smile quickly creeps onto his lips. \u201cOkay! I know it was a stupid thing to say but you didn\u2019t have to laugh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I curl my legs up onto the seat, turning to face him. \u201cJames, I know I\u2019m different from what you\u2019re used to but it\u2019s not because I\u2019m from a cult.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his eyes on me. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered to me if you had been \u2013 you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He starts tapping his fingers on the chair again, opens his mouth to speak and closes it, seemingly changing his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to ask me?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019m asking too many questions, I know, but I\u2019m just so bloody curious. I mean I know nothing about you but at the same time feel like I\u2019ve know you for ages, which is weird because I\u2019ve known you for exactly two days. Do you know what I mean?\u201d He looks at me, wanting reassurance, and I nod. Of course I know what he means, well except I\u2019ve known him for exactly three weeks and nearly five days \u2013 a bit longer than his two.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m so intrigued because of the whole \u2018you saved my life\u2019 thing,\u201d he adds. \u201cWell that and the fact that you\u2019re so bloody cryptic all the time.\u201d He laughs, nudging me with his elbow, then murmurs, \u201cYou\u2019re such a mystery, Lucyna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good or bad thing?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>He regards me for a moment, his eyes opaque, his expression unreadable. \u201cBoth.\u201d He smiles then sets his gaze out over the garden.</p><p>I can feel his unasked question still hanging in the air around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it you wanted to ask me before, James?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cSee, you know me so well already and I know \u2013 well not very much about you.\u201d He grins. \u201cOkay, well you said you\u2019re different from everyone else and I wondered \u2013 what did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my bare feet. \u201cI just meant that I\u2019m well . . . my family, they have different ways, old ways. I guess you could say . . . I was shown the world from a different view. I was raised differently from everyone else. So this is all . . . new to me. How you are, is new to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>I look at his amused eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer a question without actually answering it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYears of practice,\u201d I smile.</p><p>He shifts his position, stretching his good leg out before him. \u201cSo what do you think you\u2019ll do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wondered what your plans are. How long you\u2019ll be here for?\u201d</p><p>Does he want me to leave? Has he tired of my company already? \u201cOh \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 I hadn\u2019t thought. I just \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you because I want you to go, because I don\u2019t,\u201d he says with certainty. \u201cYou can stay for as long as you want. Well forever, if you like \u2013 but only if you keep making as good a cup of coffee as you did this morning. That stops and you're out,\u201d he quips, thumbing over his shoulder toward the door. \u201cBut no, seriously, I just meant what will you do? Will you get a job?\u201d</p><p>A job? I pull my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get a job. I have no . . . skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have.\u201d He leans toward me enthusiastically. \u201cI mean I could probably hook you up with something. I have a few contacts. What did you used to do, before you were erm \u2013 homeless?\u201d</p><p>Take humans to Heaven. I somehow don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to aid me here on earth in attempt to get a human job. \u201cI used to deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat like packages?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes \u2013 packages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there you go, then,\u201d he says resting back on his chair, smiling. \u201cYou have got a skill. You could get another job doing that. I\u2019ll ask around a few people I know, see if there\u2019s anything going. But in the meantime you could sign on at the job centre and get some benefits. I know they don\u2019t give you much but it\u2019ll be some money of your own till you get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I begin playing with my fingers. Benefits? What are they?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind giving you money, it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s just I imagine you\u2019ll want some of your own. But don\u2019t worry, though,\u201d he pats me on the arm, my skin prickling at his touch, \u201cyou\u2019ve got plenty of time and I\u2019ll just lend you what you need till then. Just have a think about it and go from there. There\u2019s no rush. I\u2019ll help you \u2013 you know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank \u2013\u201c</p><p>He waves his hand cutting me off. \u201cNew house rule. I\u2019ll stop with my annoying adage if you stop thanking me for everything. What do you say \u2013 is it a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross your heart and hope to die.\u201d He laughs, it petering off at my foggy expression. \u201cYou know \u2013 cross your heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye \u2013 you never heard it before?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>A grin plays on his lips. \u201cGod, we always used to say that when we were kids. You sure you haven\u2019t been off living on the moon or something?\u201d He regards me with amusement. \u201cDon\u2019t know who Oasis are \u2013 now this.\u201d He chuckles, shaking his head as he gets up from his chair tucking a crutch under his arm. \u201cYou want a coffee \u2013 I\u2019m making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I shake my head at his retreating back. \u201cI\u2019m fine with my water.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Cross your heart and hope to die\u2019. His words ring around my mind like warning bells. The irony of a saying that could never in a thousand years, ever apply to me but I take heed because I know when I do have to leave him, which with every dawning day comes ever closer, then it really will be like dying. Because to think of spending a day, let alone an eternity, without ever again seeing his beautiful face or hearing his voice is unbearable.</p><p>I know then I will unequivocally wish for the day to come when I can truly cross my heart and die.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Hunger</p><p>Turning my gaze from the beige coloured walls up to the white ceiling above, I watch as beams from the morning sun dance across it in perfect symmetry, a mosaic of colours glistening all above as I lay here on my bed.</p><p>Which I\u2019ve done for the last eight hours.</p><p>I haven\u2019t read a book, or watched the sun rise, or done anything of substance. I\u2019ve done nothing but watch the dark through to light and think of James, wondering how I didn\u2019t see it sooner that I\u2019m in love with him, how I didn\u2019t realise that what I felt for him was love?</p><p>Everything is making such sense now - the strength of the feelings that initially confounded me, my constant desire to be by his side, the things I have done to be with him, all pointing to that one emotion. At least I now know it was love that fuelled my desire to save him, that my selfishness was sanctioned by my level of feelings.</p><p>Love \u2013 the ultimate emotion, the crux of all others.</p><p>But how can such a euphoric feeling as love, ignite me with happiness and dull me with misery at the same time? To love him is so extraordinarily wonderful but to have him so close and for him to never be mine tortures me beyond belief. More than anything I want to feel the complete ecstasy that love creates but I can\u2019t because the darker side of it resides within me too - a yo-yo of emotions - my happiness tarnished the instant reality strikes like a cacophonous peal of thunder, yanking me back to the now.</p><p>So instead of fighting against them, I relinquished control to the medley of conflicting emotions and just let myself imagine how it would be if James and I were together, if I weren\u2019t a Bringer, if I were human, if James felt for me as I do him. If he loved me.</p><p>And what a dream it is.</p><p>Once again closing my eyes, I imagine his voice whispering the words I long to hear. He holds me in his strong arms, wrapping them around me, pulling me close to him. I can almost feel the heat of his skin on mine. I tilt my head up, eyes meeting his, and then he leans down and kisses me, a wondrous, tortuous vision of a reality that will never be mine.</p><p>I open up my eyes after the closing scene, knowing I can\u2019t spend all day in my fool\u2019s paradise, that soon enough these thoughts will be all I\u2019m left with for eternity.</p><p>Forcing myself into reality, I sit up, swing my legs over the edge of the bed and, seeing straight out the window, I\u2019m surprised to see James sitting in the garden by the large barrel pot examining the plants in it.</p><p>An overwhelming rush of exhilaration charges through me at the sight of him. It\u2019s like now I have this knowledge, now I\u2019m fully aware the extent of my feelings for him, they\u2019ve ramped their velocity up to the maximum. And I can barely contain the excitement at the thought of just being near him.</p><p>I\u2019m changed out of my bed clothes and into a pair of jeans and t-shirt in under a minute, and on my way downstairs.</p><p>James is sat with his back to me and doesn\u2019t register my presence, so I just stand here for a moment, leant up against the door frame, watching him, giving myself a little time to lock in my overzealous feelings, to stop myself from just blurting out the truth of how much I\u2019m truly in love with him.</p><p>When I finally feel I\u2019m safe to speak, I say, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>He turns at the sound of my voice, eyes squinting in the glare of the morning sun. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, voice gruff. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m well. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm . . . couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d He stares down at the ground. \u201cCame out here for a bit and saw how shabby this was looking.\u201d He gestures to the barrel with the tool he\u2019s holding. \u201cThought I\u2019d tidy it up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d I ask, concern noticeable in my voice that I don\u2019t bother to hide. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, fine, just . . . have a few things on my mind is all.\u201d His eyes fleetingly meet mine as he runs his fingers through his dark hair.</p> <p>\u201cIs it anything I can help with?\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together and shakes his head. \u201cNah, but thanks. It\u2019s nothing major \u2013 just work stuff.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s not telling me the truth but I don\u2019t push the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo can I help you with this instead, then?\u201d I gesture towards the barrel.</p><p>He glances back. \u201cSure. If you go in the shed there\u2019s a new pair of gardening gloves just in the top drawer and the secateurs are hanging up on the wall,\u201d my puzzled expression prompting him to add, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for one of these.\u201d He holds up the scissor-like tool in his hand.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod.</p><p>I venture into the shed, easily finding the gloves and secateurs, and take them back out with me. I kneel on the hard floor beside the barrel near James. \u201cSo what do I do?\u201d I ask, pulling the gloves onto my hands.</p><p>He runs his gloveless fingers over the bushy green plants. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for any browning leaves, anything that looks dead basically, then cut it off.\u201d</p><p>I begin looking through the plants, moving my fingers through the leaves, as James is, and our fingers bump together. I glance up at him and he smiles, and even though my hands are covered with these clumpy gloves, I still get a surge of warmth from his touch. I get back to the task and it happens again, this time he laughs. \u201cHow about you do that side and I\u2019ll stick to this one.\u201d</p><p>With a nod and a touch of disappointment, I retract my hand and stick to my assigned side. I find a browning leave and snip it off and place it on the floor beside me. Then I find another, and another. And before I know it, I\u2019ve clipped quite a few dead leaves off. I can see a noticeable difference in the plant already; it\u2019s starting to look far healthier than it did a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cThis is quite enjoyable,\u201d I say. \u201cI can see why you like doing this as your job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I used to love it,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I stop what I\u2019m doing and look up at him, shading my eyes from the sun with my hand. \u201cUsed to?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWell I just \u2013\u201d He shrugs. \u201c\u2013 I spent all of my working life with my dad, and when he passed away \u2013 well it\u2019s just been tough not having him around.\u201d His leans forward, arms on legs, shoulders hunched over, hands tightly clasping the secateurs. I reach over and touch his arm with my gloved hand.</p><p>He glances at my hand, then up at my face. He takes a deep a breath. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this, though, working here with you.\u201d He holds my gaze for a long moment until finally I look away and awkwardly withdraw my hand, aware that all my intense feelings for him are quickly bubbling up to the surface, knowing if I\u2019d have kept his gaze or touched him for a second longer I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep my feelings in check.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you and your dad must have been close, living and working together,\u201d I say, attempting to fill my mind with other thoughts than my need for him as I get back to my pruning.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were. We drove each other mad most of the time,\u201d he laughs lightly whilst turning the secateurs over in his hands, \u201cbut it was always just us two. He was more like my best mate than my dad. And I guess we kinda relied on each other \u2013 me on him more than I\u2019d realised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss him a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says avoiding my eyes, voice suddenly low, thick.</p> <p>I resist the urge to touch him again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just \u2013 well \u2013 I find it hard to talk about him.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t done enough prying of my own with you . . . even if it has been fruitless.\u201d There is a hint of frustration in his expression.</p><p>I move back, sitting on my behind, and watch him as he starts snipping off the dead leaves again. My eyes travel the expanse of his perfect face, studying him as he presses his lips together in seeming concentration, but I know otherwise. I know he does this when he\u2019s concealing his grief, causing me to want to offer words of comfort to him.</p><p>\u201cYou giving up?\u201d he challenges me playfully.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I was just thinking \u2013 well I think your dad will be looking down at you from Heaven \u2013\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off with a laugh, a genuine laugh, as he shakes his head. \u201cMy dad and the word Heaven don\u2019t really go together \u2013 purgatory more likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d I utter quietly to myself as I get back up to my knees, quashing my temptation to tell him just how very wrong he is. \u201cWell, wherever he is,\u201d I add. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be feeling incredibly proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me, eyebrow raised. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell just look at what you\u2019re doing, keeping his business going whilst recovering from a car accident and, in addition to that, taking a stray into your home and helping her out.\u201d I use the word 'stray' to try to lighten the effect of what I am saying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly a stray,\u201d he says, voice suddenly intense. And the way he\u2019s looking at me, so warm, so caring, sky rockets my emotions out into the stratosphere. I want to reach out and touch his face with my fingertips. I can feel them itching to move. It\u2019s like I crave his touch, hunger for him. I clasp my hand tightly around the secateurs to control the urge.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had the business?\u201d I ask, needing a distraction to stop myself from doing something stupid.</p><p>\u201cMy dad started it when I was about six,\u201d he says reaching down and picking up the coffee cup that\u2019s sitting on the floor beside his chair. \u201cHe\u2019d always been a gardener and he just got sick of working for everyone else, so he started his own business \u2013 small at first, just local contracts, and it grew from there, and now we\u2019re doing pretty well.\u201d He takes a sip of his drink and puts it back on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always done this? Worked for your dad's business, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, well after I finished uni. I\u2019d wanted to come and work for him as soon as I left school but he wouldn\u2019t have it. I had to do my A-levels.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThen I had to go to uni. But I just wanted to work for him, it was all I ever wanted to do \u2013 you know be a gardener like him, but he wouldn\u2019t have it, he wanted me to do all the things he\u2019d never had the chance to, and if you\u2019d of had the pleasure of knowing my dad, then you\u2019d have known he had a very persuasive manner. You just couldn\u2019t win an argument with the man, it was literally impossible!\u201d He laughs shaking his head, and I join in, knowing just how very true that statement is. \u201cSo before I knew it I\u2019d agreed to go to uni,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I told him if I was going I was doing a degree in Landscape Design. So I did my degree, came back home and have worked for him ever since \u2013 well except for now, obviously \u2013 I mean it became my business when he died.\u201d His eyes instantly cloud.</p><p>\u201cAnd is it just Neil that works for you?\u201d I ask to keep him talking, to stop him dwelling on his grief, even though I already know otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNah, there\u2019s six lads altogether. Neil\u2019s worked for the business as long as I have. He\u2019s kinda my right hand man \u2013 I just promoted him last week to team leader. He deserved it. He\u2019s good at what he does and he helped keep the business going when dad died. I wasn\u2019t in a great place, obviously, and he just took hold of the reins and got on with it. We\u2019d have probably lost a few contracts if it wasn\u2019t for him. He\u2019s helped me a lot. And now I\u2019m out for a few months because of this.\u201d He taps his finger on his pot and looks directly at me. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a lazy boss, you know.\u201d He grins, a slow languid grin. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had to get a temp in to cover me. I don\u2019t just sit back and give orders. I\u2019m very hands-on.\u201d His voice suddenly sounds husky and he\u2019s looking at me in a new way, in a way he\u2019s never looked at me before. It\u2019s almost as if his eyes are daring me, tempting me. I\u2019m frozen to the spot, unable to tear my eyes from his.</p><p>His mobile phone starts ringing and his eyes instantly flicker back to life. He glances down at his pocket, brushes the dirt off his hands onto the shorts he\u2019s wearing, and digs the phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d he utters looking at the caller display. \u201cI wondered who\u2019d be ringing this early.\u201d He clicks the phone on. \u201cAll right, mate, I was just talking about you . . . Nah just telling Lucyna how crap you are at your job . . . yeah, yeah, whatever! . . . oh right you are, okay, hang on a minute.\u201d He moves the phone away from his ear. \u201cIts Neil,\u201d he says to me. \u201cWork stuff. You okay if I leave you doing this for a min?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He presses the phone back to his ear. \u201cNeil, I\u2019ll just have to get the drawing\u2019s out so I can see what \u2013\u201d The sound of his voice disperses as he disappears off into the house.</p><p>I sit back in shock, little tremors of hope rippling through me. Was James just . . . flirting with me? I mean the seemingly suggestive manner in which he said \u2018I\u2019m very hands-on\u2019, and the way he was looking at me. Maybe he likes me in the way I like him . . . or maybe it\u2019s just my wishful thinking. Come on, Lucyna, these are your own desires that you\u2019re projecting onto him making you think this way.</p><p>I shake the thoughts from my mind and carry on trimming off the dead leaves, desperately trying to ignore the little shots of stupid hope that keep trying to force their way in.</p><p>James is gone a good while and, when he comes back outside, he\u2019s carrying a tray containing food and drink.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. There was a bit of confusion over the plans for the job that the lads are going to do down in Hove. All sorted now, though.\u201d He is seemingly back to normal, confirming that whatever I may have thought occurred between the two of us obviously didn\u2019t. \u201cAnyway, I thought I\u2019d get us some breakfast whilst I was inside.\u201d</p><p>He sets the tray on the table. I glance over at it seeing coffee, croissants, butter and a jar of jam. He places one of the cups of coffee and a plate with a croissant on it across the table from him where I assume I\u2019m to be sitting.</p><p>I go and take my seat, pull my gloves off and lay them on the table, all the while wondering how on earth I\u2019m going to get out of this. So far I have managed to avoid eating with him, telling him I\u2019m not hungry or that I\u2019ve already eaten. But now I\u2019m stuck here, faced with food and drink that he\u2019s made, with no easy way out. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not hungry as he knows I haven\u2019t eaten this morning. Maybe I should just try and eat it, but then I don\u2019t know what would happen if I did and I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a risk I should take. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look down at the flaky pastry before me, assessing it.</p><p>\u201cDo you not like croissants?\u201d he asks. \u201cI can get you something else, if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I like them just fine.\u201d I pick the croissant up and tear a small piece off, looking at it sitting there stodgily between my fingertips. It really does smell heavenly, if only I could eat it. I glance up to find James\u2019 eyes on me. He smiles. I smile back, and I know it comes off as an awkward smile.</p><p>I really need a distraction of some kind.</p> <p>I begin pulling bits of the croissant off, attempting to project that I\u2019m doing so in an absent-minded manner, placing them casually around my plate as I say, \u201cI know I\u2019m not allowed to thank you anymore,\u201d I smile warmly, praying this will lead his thoughts away from the fact I\u2019m not eating, \u201cbut I want you know that I really do appreciate all of this, James, everything you\u2019re doing for me.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, pausing to swallow the food in his mouth. \u201cWell I know I\u2019m not supposed to say, \u2018but you saved my life, Lucyna, it\u2019s the least I can do\u2019 \u2013 but you did and it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but I\u2019ve just come in here and invaded your life.\u201d I rest my foot up on the edge of my chair, dropping the remaining part of the croissant back onto the plate.</p><p>\u201cInvade away.\u201d He looks directly at me, eyes on mine. The air suddenly becomes thick between us. And there it is again, that possibility, the possibility that he maybe just might . . . \u201cI was just rattling around in this big house on my own anyway,\u201d he adds, cutting right into my thoughts, removing his eyes from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d I ask, keeping my eyes on his face.</p> <p>He looks back to me and shrugs. \u201cHaven\u2019t met the right girl, I guess. I mean I\u2019ve had a few relationships in my time but none of them ever stuck.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the stab of pain I feel at the thought of James and other women, I say, \u201cShe\u2019ll be out there somewhere, you know, the right girl, probably just waiting for you to notice her.\u201d Hinting, wanting to shout out that it\u2019s me, Lucyna, the one sitting right in front of you, the one who loves you above all else. Well, okay, maybe I\u2019m not exactly the right girl, but I want to be, so that has to count for something, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He picks his coffee up and takes a long drink, and puts it down, his fingers tapping the handle, eyes firmly fixed on it. \u201cWell, I did think maybe . . .\u201d he trails off, leaving his words hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d I prompt, linking my fingers together around my knee.</p><p>His face breaks into a sheepish smile. \u201cWell there was this one girl \u2013 from ages ago, who . . . well she was amazing, really great. Different to all the others. And \u2013 well for a brief time I thought maybe . . .\u201d He shrugs, fingers now fiddling with the half-eaten croissant in front of him. \u201cBut it just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d His face lifts, a positive smile now firmly adhered to his lips as he adds, \u201cSo I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you that it\u2019s my birthday this Friday and I\u2019m having a bit of a party.\u201d And once again, just like that, the subject slips away, and this time I\u2019m thankful because the last thing I need to hear about is the one-time almost love of his life. I\u2019m not even sure why I started this conversation off to begin with anyway.</p><p>\u201cHow old will you be?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cThirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two,\u201d I echo. It\u2019s funny I\u2019ve never even thought before about how old James is. Or should I say how young he is.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know I\u2019m getting old.\u201d He laughs, adding, before putting the remainder of the croissant in his mouth, \u201cHow old are you, Lucyna, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</p><p>His question throws me. It\u2019s not like I can say well I\u2019m roughly about . . . okay well I don\u2019t know exactly how old I am because when you\u2019ve been around as long as I have you don\u2019t really tend to keep count but, put it this way, if you think thirty-two\u2019s old then I\u2019m . . . archaic. But seriously, how do I even answer his question? I\u2019m not entirely sure how old I look for a human. So with quick thinking I say the only thing I can think to say, \u201cI\u2019m thirty-two, same as you.\u201d I paste a smile on hoping to come across as genuine.</p><p>He looks surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t look it,\u201d he says. \u201cI had you pegged at about twenty-five, twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I should have said that but I guess it\u2019s too late now. \u201cWell you look really good,\u201d he adds. \u201cUnlike me. Too many days spent out in the sun.\u201d He rubs his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cI think you look . . . well \u2013 just fine.\u201d I keep my opinion brief, withholding my true thoughts that I think he\u2019s beautiful beyond belief.</p><p>He grins. \u201cThanks \u2013 I think. So what do you think to the party, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . I think parties are nice,\u201d I nod, not really sure what he\u2019s looking for from me.</p><p>He does that eyebrow raising grin I\u2019ve noticed he does a lot around me. \u201cGood, so you\u2019ll be here for it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m invited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are!\u201d He laughs loudly, eyes amused, and nudges my bare foot under the table with his, skin on skin, sending a thrill running up my leg. \u201cAs if I\u2019d have a party and say, right well off you go, then, make yourself scarce for the night. God, you crack me up, Lucyna!\u201d He shakes his head, still laughing.</p><p>I can feel my face prickling with embarrassment. I will it not to go red but there\u2019s no stopping it, so I look down and set to task shredding the final part of my croissant.</p><p>He nudges my foot again, forcing my eyes up to his. \u201cI know you won\u2019t know anyone there, but Sara and Neil are coming so there are two friendly faces, and of course there\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Well I wouldn\u2019t put 'Sara' and 'friendly' in the same sentence. And I don\u2019t know why but I instantly felt irked the moment he mentioned her name.</p><p>\u201cSo are you and Sara getting on okay now, after yesterday?\u201d I ask, trying not to sound as brittle as I feel.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t spoken to her since then but, yeah, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d I stand. \u201cHave you finished?\u201d I waggle my outstretched fingers toward his empty plate.</p><p>He looks up at me. \u201cOh, er, yeah, thanks.\u201d He puts the plate in my hand, his fingers grazing against mine. I ignore the sensation it creates and put his and my plate and cup onto the tray.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry?\u201d He nods toward my plate that\u2019s neatly arranged with shredded croissant.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d And I ignore the inquiring look he gives as I hasten to make my exit back into the house before he can question me further.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Teardrops</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>He looks up from the bowl he\u2019s filling with crisps. His eyes instantly widen in his gaze. \u201cWow. Look at you. I mean you look . . .\u201d He shakes his head, seemingly lost for words. \u201cYou look great \u2013 really great.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of utter bliss trickles through me, setting my skin aglow. I glance down at the dress I\u2019m wearing, the beautiful blue dress that James picked out that day he took me shopping.</p><p>\u201cI knew it\u2019d suit you,\u201d he adds nodding. \u201cThe colour really brings out your eyes.\u201d He shakes his head and laughs. \u201cAnd I also know how incredibly lame that just sounded.\u201d</p><p>I smooth my hand over the silky fabric. \u201cNot lame \u2013 nice. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I run my eyes over him, taking in the black v-neck jumper he\u2019s wearing down to the dark blue jeans cut up the leg to accommodate his pot, us both dressed in our best clothes ready for his birthday party. \u201cYou look \u2013 well . . . great too,\u201d I add, as my eyes travel back up to his face to find his still on mine and, when they meet, he grins and we both laugh.</p><p>But although we're laughing, I know it\u2019s forced, manufactured in some way, because if truth be told things have been \u2013 well strange between us for the last few days, and I\u2019m not really sure just when, or why, it started \u2013 I simply all of a sudden realised.</p><p>I can\u2019t even put my finger on exactly what it is that\u2019s changed because, on the surface, we talk as normal and spend time together as normal. Everything as normal. But underneath all the normality there\u2019s an obvious layer of tension. The air between us is so thick and dense, I\u2019m sure if I just reached out and poked at it with my finger, I\u2019d make a dent. I have no idea where it\u2019s come from or how to make it go away.</p><p>I\u2019ve wanted to say something to him, wanted to ask him if he feels it too, but every time I\u2019ve attempted to do so, something\u2019s stopped me, held me back.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else that needs doing?\u201d I ask, knowing there probably isn\u2019t as I helped him prepare earlier - well I mainly did the shopping for the food and alcohol.</p><p>He shakes his head as he rips open a bag of peanuts with his teeth and pours them into a waiting bowl. \u201cNope, all sorted.\u201d He picks some peanuts out of the bowl and pops them in his mouth.</p><p>I lean against the edge of the kitchen cupboard, arm resting on the cool marble surface. Our eyes meet. I look away, suddenly feeling jittery, and the only sound in the room is the crunch, crunch of the nuts as he chews them.</p><p>Like I said, things are \u2013 strange.</p><p>At that moment, thankfully, the doorbell rings.</p><p>He looks past me toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll get that.\u201d He throws the empty peanut wrapper into the bin on his way and brushes past me heading through the door, his arm stroking mine, setting off such a combustible amount of heat and energy surging through me that it nearly knocks me off my feet. I curl my fingers around the edge of the work surface to steady myself and glance down at my bare arm, feeling sure for a moment there that my skin was actually on fire.</p><p>James introduces me to his friends \u2013 Jack, Lewis and Anna. As I discover, James plays Sunday football with Jack and Lewis, and Anna is Lewis\u2019s girlfriend \u2013 or a football widow as she puts it. We all make our way out into the garden as it\u2019s such a warm summers evening, and it\u2019s not long before more people arrive and the garden is buzzing with the sound of music and chatter.</p><p>I\u2019m stood lingering near the rosebushes, holding a half empty glass of wine pretending to drink it, when Neil comes through the back door with a bottle of beer in his hand. I had been talking with Anna but she went off to use the bathroom.</p><p>He smiles widely when he sees me. \u201cHey, Lucyna, nice to see you again. So how\u2019s our lifesaver doing?\u201d He walks over to me, covering the gap in a few strides.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really well, thanks. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, ta.\u201d He takes a swig of beer. \u201cHow you finding it living here with James? He as much a slave driver at home as he is at work?\u201d He grins, brushing his blonde hair out of his eyes.</p><p>I shake my head and smile up at him. \u201cNo, James is really great to live with.\u201d</p><p>We fall silent. I glance down at my wine glass. Neil takes another drink of his beer. \u201cSo whereabouts is it you\u2019re originally from then, Lucyna?\u201d he asks, and puts the bottle back to his lips, this time taking a long drink, all the while keeping his friendly blue eyes on mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile, pressing my lips together, attempting to conceal the dismay I feel when the dulcet tones of James\u2019 voice come from behind me, blanketing me with their warmth. \u201cIgnore everything he says, \u2018cause whatever he\u2019s telling you, it\u2019s probably a lie.\u201d He laughs, resting his arm loosely around my shoulders. My whole body stiffens. I glance up at him to see him smiling, eyes moving between me and Neil. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying your crap one liners out on her are you, mate?\u201d he says dryly, eyes now on Neil.</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones you taught me.,\u201d Neil banters back, eyebrow raised, pushing his tongue between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou got me there, mate. I\u2019ve got no come back,\u201d James raises his hand in mock surrender and takes a drink from the bottle of beer in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you remember that one you used on that girl when you, me and Sonny were in Ibiza,\u201d he says to Neil, as his hand rests back on my shoulder, fingers lightly trailing over my bare skin. My whole body instantly responds to his touch. I tighten my grip around the glass. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d he says to me. \u201cCasanova here went up to this girl in the bar we were in and said \u2018We're not gonna be able to have sex if you\u2019re sober\u2019, handed her over the half full bottle of tequila we\u2019d been drinking and said \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to catch me up \u2013 drink this, then call me when you\u2019re ready.\u2019 James laughs, louder this time. \u201cIt was fucking hilarious! And the worse thing was it bloody worked as well!\u201d</p> <p>Neil shrugs, lips pursed, eyes twinkling. \u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m a charmer. The ladies just can\u2019t say no.\u201d He grins, eyes fixed on me. James\u2019 hand grips my shoulder harder.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d We all turn at the sound of Sara\u2019s voice. I can see her eyes resting on James\u2019 arm, the one sitting around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he smiles at her, removing his arm from around me. And I know the disappointment is obvious on my face, so I look away hoping no-one noticed.</p><p>A smile appears on her face as she quickly moves toward him. \u201cHappy birthday,\u201d she says, kissing his cheek. And I stand there beside Neil feeling like I\u2019ve just been hit.</p><p>\u201cI brought you this.\u201d She pushes a small gift into his hand.</p> <p>He looks down at it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She smiles, tapping him lightly on the arm.</p><p>And I inwardly cringe at the realisation. A gift, of course it\u2019s customary for humans to give one another gifts on their birthdays and what did I get him? Absolutely nothing.</p><p>\u201cHi Neil,\u201d she says sweetly. \u201cLucyna.\u201d Her tone hardens on my name.</p><p>Both Neil and I say our hellos but Sara\u2019s already turned her attention back to James. \u201cSo you gonna get me a drink, or what?\u201d she says, hand on hip. \u201cSome host you are.\u201d She laughs but I can hear the edge to it.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, 'course.\u201d He turns to me and Neil. \u201cEither of you need a top up?\u201d</p> <p>I glance down at my half full glass of wine and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me mate,\u201d Neil says swilling the remaining liquid around the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll get myself a cold one out the fridge in a min.\u201d</p><p>Sara links her arm through his and starts to walk away but James doesn\u2019t move. I see out of the corner of my eye that his eyes are on me.</p><p>She pulls on his arm and rolls her eyes dramatically. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m gonna die of thirst here.\u201d She laughs again, trying to sound light-hearted but now there\u2019s too clear an edge for it to go unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch you both later, then.\u201d He turns and lets himself be led off by Sara toward the table where all the bottles of wine and spirits are.</p><p>\u201cIt always surprises me them two have never got together.\u201d Neil\u2019s voice comes from beside me, suddenly sounding closer.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask, even though I know full well who he means.</p><p>\u201cJames and Sara,\u201d he says in an obvious tone. \u201cI think they\u2019d make a good couple.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, yes,\u201d I say, non-committal, unable to say anything else because now all I feel is edgy. I look over at the two of them and, at that same moment, James looks in my direction and catches me staring at him. I look away.</p><p>Neil leans closer to me, his arm pressing against mine. \u201cI think Sara would like it that way as well,\u201d he says in a conspiratorial tone.</p><p>I look up at him to find him considerably closer than I\u2019d realised. \u201cHas she said this to you?\u201d I ensure my voice comes out lighter than I currently feel.</p><p>His blue eyes pierce mine. He shakes his head. \u201cNah, I can just tell. She dotes on him.\u201d</p><p>I glance at them again from the corner of my eye. James has just said something to Sara and she\u2019s laughing loudly, head thrown back, her hand on his chest. My skin is prickling with discomfort. \u201cDo you think James feels the same?\u201d I ask, maintaining the same light tone.</p><p>He drains his bottle and shrugs. \u201cDunno. He says they\u2019re just mates, but who knows. To be honest I don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s a real nice girl and pretty to boot \u2013 but I suppose they have been mates forever, so maybe he doesn\u2019t want to spoil it. And it\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever been able to stick with one girl for too long.\u201d He smirks. \u201cHe gets itchy feet, does our James.\u201d</p><p>Then it\u2019s almost like I see what Neil sees and the world closes off, and all I\u2019m aware of is this insistent buzzing in my head. Almost as if all my thoughts have just come to life at one.</p><p>\u201cCan you excuse me,\u201d I say, barely managing the words. \u201cI just need to use the ladies' room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no worries, was gonna go grab myself a bottle anyway.\u201d</p><p>Neil follows me into the house and I just concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other, then we split off in different directions, him to the kitchen, me to the downstairs bathroom.</p><p>I lock the door behind me, rest my forehead against the cool glass, close my eyes and try to line up my thoughts into an orderly manner.</p><p>What am I doing here? Hoping against hope that James might one day love me whilst I carry on pretending to be human, when all I really am is a fraud, a walking, talking lie? And now, as I\u2019ve just discovered, my only reason for being here is quite possibly a philanderer \u2013 and one very likely to end up with Sara which, if I\u2019m being truthful with myself, is the way it should be.</p><p>The absurdity of it all actually makes me laugh out loud. But it\u2019s a laugh tinged with sadness. For all I really feel is hurt and confused. Because to want something so badly as I want James, and to know I\u2019ll never have him, is causing an actual physical ache inside me, and I truly wonder what I\u2019ve done to deserve this kind of torture.</p><p>My head is throbbing with the pain. I grip my fingers tight around the basin.</p><p>I want to go home, go back to where it was simpler, back to when I didn\u2019t have to feel any of this - where I was happy. Okay, well I wasn\u2019t happy because I didn\u2019t know what happiness was but I must have been content in some way.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, all this time I\u2019ve spent worrying about how long it will be before the Elders find me and praying they won\u2019t, and now I just wish they would. Because no matter how I may feel, no matter how much it hurts, I know I\u2019ll never be able to leave him of my own accord. The only time I\u2019ll ever go is when they take me, or James definitively tells me to.</p><p>I hear the handle try on the door, then a knock. \u201cYou gonna be long in there?\u201d comes a woman\u2019s voice from the other side of the door</p><p>I open my eyes and move my head back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m all done,\u201d I say to the mirror.</p><p>I unlock the door and open it to reveal a woman with red hair who I met earlier but whose name I\u2019ve now forgotten. \u201cThanks, hon,\u201d she says, bouncing on the spot. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely busting.\u201d She rushes past me into the toilet, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Putting a smile on my face, I venture back into the party even though I feel like I\u2019m dying inside.</p><p>I spend the rest of the night avoiding James and desperately trying, albeit not successfully, to not look at him or anywhere in his vicinity, which is not such an easy feet, especially in such a small space. But then he hasn\u2019t come to talk to me either, or looked in my direction that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m trying to ignore the fact, knowing that his time has been mainly consumed by Sara and his other guests. Well, Sara mainly. So I\u2019ve spent most of the night talking to Neil who seemed happy enough to keep me company.</p><p>Finally finding myself alone, I go into the kitchen to rid myself of this hours-old wine. I watch as it paints the running water with its golden honey like colour. I put the glass down on the drainer and turn around to find Sara stood in the doorway eyeing me closely.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say in the most pleasant voice I can muster when I feel anything but.</p><p>Without speaking, she closes the door behind her and moves into the room, leaning forward onto the free-standing island. She begins tapping her long pink nails on the marble counter. \u201cLook, Lucyna, I won\u2019t beat about the bush here. We're both intelligent women and I think you\u2019d appreciate my honesty, as I would yours.\u201d</p><p>This time I\u2019m the one who doesn\u2019t speak. Her prickly tone is sitting distinctly uncomfortable. I wrap my arms around myself.</p><p>\u201cOkay so you\u2019ve probably guessed I don\u2019t like you,\u201d she continues when she sees I have no intention of responding. \u201cI think you know why. And I don\u2019t know what your game is with James, but he\u2019s been through a lot recently and doesn\u2019t need someone like you messing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I say, my voice oddly coming out sounding hoarse.</p><p>She sneers. \u201cYes, you do. You\u2019re after something and I want you to tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not after anything.\u201d Well aside from James\u2019 love \u2013 but I omit that from my sentence, knowing that wouldn\u2019t go down well.</p><p>She stands upright, hands on her hips. \u201cI know you are. I can tell. I\u2019ve met your type before. Its money, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she says with bite. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re after. I mean, come on, you and I both know that James is pretty well off.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to speak but no sound comes out.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah, you saved his life and we're all grateful, really. But then apparently you have nowhere to live and James being James offers you a place to stay because he feels obliged to, then you just rock on up here and walk about like you own the place.\u201d She runs her fingers through her smooth blonde hair. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t imagine anyone like you being homeless for starters and, yeah, I think you probably do fancy James because, well, you\u2019d have to be blind not to. But there\u2019s something more here, something not right about you, something that doesn\u2019t sit right about this whole situation. I don\u2019t know what, but I\u2019m gonna find out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s this strange feeling stirring deep inside me that\u2019s quickly bubbling to the surface, rushing up fast. My face is tingling, my throat constricting and my lips are trembling.</p><p>\u201cDid you find out that he\u2019d come into a lot of money after the death of his dad. I mean the business alone is worth quite a bit and this house \u2013\u201d she gestures around, \u201c-well it\u2019s not exactly a two up two down in Brixton, is it?\u201d Her eyes narrow onto me. \u201cDid you think you\u2019d target a rich, unhappy guy who\u2019d just lost his dad, seeing him as an easy target and get all you could from him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Really she couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If only she did know.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want James\u2019 money.\u201d My voice sounds thick and wobbly.</p><p>She laughs caustically. \u201cWell for someone who doesn\u2019t want his money, you\u2019ve done a pretty good job of spending it so far.\u201d She points a long nail at my dress, trailing the length of it.</p><p>I glance down at it. Then my eyes blur and I feel water trickling down my cheek. I touch my fingertips to my face. There\u2019s water coming from my eyes.</p> <p>I\u2019m crying.</p><p>\u201cOh god, don\u2019t start the waterworks,\u201d she says callously. \u201cI\u2019m not James. Tears won\u2019t work on me.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my hand to see the tears running carelessly down my fingers.</p><p>So this is how it feels to cry. Funny, really, that Sara\u2019s the one who manages to make me cry for the first time, the one whom I vie with for James\u2019 affections. Quite poetic really.</p><p>She\u2019s glaring at me with utter impatience, her foot tapping against the wooden floor. I find my voice and, even though it\u2019s weak, I manage to get out, \u201cNo, Sara. You\u2019ve got it all wrong. Really I don\u2019t -\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d she chides, sweeping her blonde hair off her face, in that one motion managing to make me feel like I imagine a child might, even though I\u2019m years - far beyond her imagination \u2013 older than she is. \u201cIf its money you\u2019re after, I\u2019ll give you some and you can be on your merry way and leave James the fuck alone. How much will it take to get rid of \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d I jump at the sound of his James\u2019 fury and my eyes snap up to see him stood in the doorway.</p><p>Sara spins around at the sound of his voice. He looks angry, really angry, and Neil is stood behind him looking really uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Sara, what is with you,\u201d James says, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s all I hear from you at the moment. Just what the fuck have you got against her?\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart between James and Sara who has now sidled around the island putting a bit of distance between her and James. I really don\u2019t want to here, to be part of this. I want to move, get away but I can\u2019t, I\u2019m rooted to the spot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just using you James, can\u2019t you see that?\u201d she says, face red, voice slightly unhinged.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not using me, you idiot. She\u2019s just living in my house and, really, what the fuck has any of this got to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has this got to do with me?\u201d Her eyes widen and she grips her head in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s got everything to do with me! You\u2019re my best friend, you\u2019re like my family and I won\u2019t stand by and watch this little bitch bleed you dry because you\u2019re blinded by a pretty face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d He shakes his head with disbelief. \u201cI just don\u2019t fucking believe you! She. Saved. My. Life.\u201d He enunciates every word, singly and distinctly. \u201cWhat is it that you don\u2019t get about that? I owe her everything! I\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for her! She pulled me from a burning car, risked her own life to save me! I\u2019d give her a fucking million quid if I could! So trust me, giving her a roof to live under until she gets back on her feet doesn\u2019t seem that big a deal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know anything about her \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough.\u201d His voice comes out as sharp as a knife.</p><p>I see the tears welling in her eyes that she\u2019s furiously blinking back. That\u2019s also when I notice a few people standing behind Neil, obviously hearing the commotion, come to watch the show, a show I do not want to be a part of.</p><p>My legs finally obey the commands my brain is giving them. I take a side step edging toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lucyna. Stay where you are.\u201d James points me to the spot. And yet again I freeze. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one who should be leaving,\u201d he says forcibly, eyes narrowed and fixed on Sara.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d she cries. \u201cYou\u2019re choosing her over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never a choice,\u201d he says coolly.</p><p>I see her flinch as his words hit her, and honestly the level of hostility in his voice takes me by surprise too.</p><p>Neil sidles past James heading straight for Sara. \u201cCome on, Sara, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d He puts his arm around her shoulder and steers her away. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had a bit too much to drink. Talk about it tomorrow when you\u2019re sober.\u201d</p><p>As they both move past where I still stand, Sara\u2019s eyes dart over at me, giving me a parting look of such anger, such resentment, it blankets my skin with a chill.</p><p>James comes over to me now everyone\u2019s left the kitchen and places his hands on my shoulders, his fingers gently gripping me. My skin burns under his touch. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into her. She shouldn\u2019t have spoke to you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d My voice comes out a shaky whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d He wipes away the teardrops that have once again started to cascade down my cheek with his thumb, his hand encompassing my face. His thumb traces down my jaw, lightly brushing over my lips. I glance up at him. His eyes are on my lips, lips that want the feel of his on mine. His eyes move up to mine, dark pools that are now flickering and flaming, and I couldn\u2019t move even if I wanted to. There\u2019s something in the way he\u2019s looking at me that\u2019s makes my legs feel wobbly, that look eliciting all those feelings for him I\u2019ve hidden, all quickly bubbling up to the surface.</p><p>My skin is prickling with desire. He holds my face in both his hands, his fingers tenderly invading my hair, eyes set on mine, unwavering, as he leans closer to me, my eyes closing in anticipation . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, mate.\u201d</p><p>James instantly steps away from me, turning to the sound of the voice. My body wilts with disappointment. I look past him to see Joe, one of the men that works for him, stood in the doorway.</p><p>Joe looks uncomfortable, about as uncomfortable as I feel when I notice the three other people hovering behind him, my cheeks instantly colouring as to the size of our audience.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, just \u2013\u201d Joe thumbs over his shoulder at the others, \u201c-well we\u2019re \u2013 er \u2013 well we\u2019re gonna head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right, yeah, no problem, mate. I\u2019ll see you out,\u201d James says. He glances back at me, his look unfathomable. Then he\u2019s turns and leads his friends out the door.</p><p>And I\u2019m left there feeling alone, and very, very confused.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Starry Eyed</p><p>James hasn\u2019t said anything about the almost-kiss and neither have I.</p><p>Well truthfully we\u2019ve barely spoken to each other since.</p><p>Not long after Joe and the others left, the other party guests pretty much followed suit and the party soon dwindled to a close.</p><p>Now it\u2019s just me and James left cleaning up the debris in complete and utter silence.</p><p>And the tense atmosphere is back, with a vengeance, almost as if whatever\u2019s been brewing in the air for the last few days has now hit boiling point.</p><p>James drops a bag of rubbish into the bin with a clang and then, taking some time to do so struggling with his leg, awkwardly sits himself down on the blanket that\u2019s laid out on the grass. He rests back on his hands, legs stretched out in front of him and looks over at me.</p><p>\u201cSo, did you have a good night?\u201d he asks, voice normal, as though nothing nearly happened between us just under an hour ago, making me momentarily wonder if I imagined it. \u201cWell apart from when Sara flipped out on you, that is,\u201d he adds.</p><p>I refrain from thanking him for the reminder, and skipping over the addition, I say, \u201cYes. I had a really lovely time. Your friends are all very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from Sara.\u201d</p><p>I look down and shuffle on my feet.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to like her. I wouldn\u2019t if I was you.\u201d</p><p>I take a moment to process my feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t dislike her. I think I\u2019m just confused by her.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to put it. A hell of a lot nicer than I would have.\u201d He rubs his forehead and pushes his fingers into his hair. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s with her at the moment? Why she\u2019s got it in for you?\u201d</p><p>I drop my bag in the bin and go sit beside him, crossing my legs in front of me, and rest back on my hands. \u201cDoes it make you sad?\u201d</p><p>He turns his head to me, gaze fixed on mine. \u201cIt only makes me sad because she\u2019s hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be if someone said those things to me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug because right now all I can think about is how close my hand is to his. Really close. I could literally just reach out my finger and touch him. And with all these intense feelings floating around me, it\u2019s very hard to resist the urge to do so.</p><p>James shuffles his position and his fingers lightly stroke against my hand. My skin prickles. He doesn\u2019t move them away.</p><p>\u201cAnd just for the record,\u201d he says, voice deep and sure, \u201cI don\u2019t think a word of those things she said is the truth. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re after my money.\u201d He nudges my arm with his. I look at him to see he\u2019s now grinning. \u201cNot that I have as much as she seems to think I do. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a millionaire or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter to me if you were.\u201d</p><p>He rests his chin on his shoulder, regarding me closely, eyes curious. And my whole body shivers, though I\u2019m not cold. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you, Lucyna. You don\u2019t seem to care about money or material things. You just seem so . . . relaxed with who you are. \u201c</p><p>\u201cIs that wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, smiling. \u201cNo, it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p><p>He rests his head back and gazes up at the night sky and I follow his gaze. The stars are out in force tonight, twinkling down on us, leaving me feeling very starry-eyed, or maybe that\u2019s just from the effect his touch is having on me.</p><p>James\u2019s quietly shuffles closer to me and lays his fingers over mine, gently gripping them with his. He\u2019s practically holding my hand and all my thoughts have gone fuzzy.</p><p>In attempt to clear my mind I say, \u201cJames, I wanted to say I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get you a gift for your birthday \u2013\u201d</p><p>He waves me away with his free hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I know you\u2019re not in a position to be buying me stuff \u2013 and I don\u2019t need anything anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but still . . .\u201d My voice peters off.</p><p>We lapse into silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get to talk much at the party,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t seem to get a minute to myself. But I saw that Neil kept you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s nice,\u201d I say struggling to concentrate as he now traces his fingertip in concentric circles across my hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Neil\u2019s a good bloke . . . so what did you guys talk about?\u201d he asks, his voice suddenly quieter.</p><p>And Neil\u2019s words come flooding back to me. I press my lips together, suddenly feeling nervous, anxious, tempted . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames, why aren\u2019t you and Sara together like a couple?\u201d I blurt out. I honestly have no idea where I\u2019m going with this line of questioning.</p><p>He sits up, his hand moving from mine. \u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>Keeping my eyes straight ahead, I say, \u201cJust when I was talking to Neil earlier he said that he thought you two, I mean you and Sara, should be together as a couple, and I thought well . . . maybe he was right.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cSara\u2019s my friend \u2013 well she\u2019s skirting on pretty thin ice at the moment, but still, I\u2019d never see her as anything more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she\u2019s very beautiful and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Sara,\u201d he cuts me off, his insistent tone forcing me to turn to him. His serious eyes roam my face and he leans closer to me. He\u2019s so close I can feel his hot breath on my skin. And for a moment I\u2019m transcendent. Then his voice, the only sound in this still night, says, \u201cI\u2019ll never be interested in Sara because I\u2019m only interested in you.\u201d</p><p>Then he leans forward and kisses me and nothing else matters.</p><p>His lips touch mine, so gently at first, but then very quickly the kiss intensifies. His stubble grazes against my face sending shivers rippling through me, the heady scent of his aftershave intoxicating me. This is beyond amazing, so beyond anything I could have ever dreamt up. All I feel is complete and utter euphoria. Then like a bolt out of the blue, I suddenly get a sense of familiarity. Like I\u2019ve done this before. With him. Which is obviously impossible. It must be all my dreaming and wishing that\u2019s caused a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>Then, without warning, James breaks away leaving me cold. He moves back from me breathing heavily. My lips are throbbing and I\u2019m so charged, so heated, I can\u2019t form words.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d he says, breathing hard.</p><p>And just like that the atmosphere has disintegrated, the happiness of the moment snatched away from me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry you kissed me?\u201d My voice sounds unnaturally high.</p><p>\u201cNo! Well yes \u2013 I mean no. I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d He shakes his head, and glances up at me through his lashes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would want me to . . . I thought maybe you might but \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my reaction not tell you I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I guess so . . . I just \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just?\u201d</p><p>He brings his knee up to his chest, wrapping his arms around his leg and rests his chin on it. \u201cLook, Lucyna, I know you said the other day that you still love your ex, and I also know I was the one who just kissed you \u2013 but I really don\u2019t want to come in the middle of something, because when we spoke it sounded like you had unfinished business with your \u2013 your ex, and well if we started something and then you decided to get back with him then \u2013\u201d He shrugs, eyes away from me.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even consider how he would interpret my words. How could I be so stupid? How on earth am I going to get around this?</p><p>Of course I want to tell him the truth. I want to tell him he is the guy, that he is the only reason I feel love, the only guy that I ever have \u2013 and ever will love. But how do I manage that without telling him the rest, without telling him I\u2019ve lied about everything.</p><p>I look down at my hands as though they can somehow help me, whilst desperately trying to search for the right words. \u201cJames, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>But he cuts me off before I can even make an attempt. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, Lucyna. You don\u2019t need to say anything.\u201d He tries to get up but struggles, so in the end I help him to his feet.</p><p>He stands before me, affliction in his dark, brooding eyes. \u201cSeriously, I get it. It\u2019s fine. And it doesn\u2019t change anything about you living here, honestly. Look, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m gonna go to bed,\u201d he adds, before walking away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the rest of the mess. I\u2019ll sort it in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>I stare after him, watching as the light at the end of the tunnel dims, flickers, then goes out completely, wondering just exactly how I went from complete euphoria to complete misery in the space of five minutes.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>All The Time In The World</p><p>Two minutes later, and I\u2019m still stood here in the garden on the same spot where James left me, still feeling the wake of his departure, still trying to fathom what just actually happened.</p><p>It\u2019s at times like these when I see why we Bringers aren\u2019t supposed to feel. There would be no way we would cope with death in the manner we have to when feelings are so complex, so intense, so imperious . . . so raw.</p><p>Everything insistent. Everything urgent.</p><p>Emotions discharge like rockets, change course and then change again within a matter of seconds and, honestly, I struggle to keep up. My head feels like its spinning on my shoulders.</p><p>The only thing I can register right now, which thankfully is the most important thing, is that James has feelings for me. And these are not just feelings of friendship or because I saved his life, but they are those kinds of feelings, the feelings I have for him.</p><p>Actual, real, one hundred percent feelings. For me.</p><p>My whole body is tingling in the knowledge and I would be jumping up and down on the spot with elation if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that things aren\u2019t exactly turning out as I would like.</p><p>Because James thinks I love someone else, this being purely down to my idiotic way of trying to subtly tell him that I\u2019m in love him.</p><p>It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so tragically ironic for me.</p><p>\u2018He gets it,\u2019 he said. I wanted tell him that he really doesn\u2019t get it, that he\u2019s so far from getting it he may as well be on a different continent. I wanted to tell him that I have spent the last four weeks dreaming that he would feel this way about me, dreaming that he would kiss me.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t because I can\u2019t.</p><p>I put fingers to my lips to the place where I can still feel his kiss.</p><p>I have to correct my mistake in some way. I don\u2019t know exactly how or what I\u2019m going to say to him, but I\u2019m sure the right words will come when I need them to. I\u2019m so adept at lying now and, really, what\u2019s another one to add to my ever-growing collection.</p><p>Before I know it I\u2019m stood outside his bedroom door. The lights are out in his room and all is quiet. Nerves ripple through me.</p><p>I lift my hand to knock on his door. Nerves withdraw my hand. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. I take a step back.</p><p>No, I\u2019ve come too far, given up to much, to just chicken out, especially when I\u2019m so close to having my dream, so close to having him.</p><p>I lift my hand and quickly knock on the door before I can change my mind.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d James\u2019s deep voice comes from the other side.</p><p>I push the door open. He\u2019s sat up in bed, duvet covering his legs, his chest bare, back resting against the headboard, the room now aglow with the light emitting from the lamp on his bedside table.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>He pushes his fingers through his hair. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I close the door behind me, and linger there. I never felt so nervous since, well . . . since I started feeling. I clasp my hands together and stare at the wooden floor that sits cold beneath my bare feet.</p><p>It\u2019s so silent in the room, neither of us speaking, and I know I should be the one to speak, but I can\u2019t find my voice. Then, oddly, I realise this is the first time I\u2019ve been in his bedroom since I changed form.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His warm voice caresses me.</p><p>I shake my head and glance up meeting his dark eyes. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d I wrap my arms around myself. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His lips curve ever so slightly. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pats the space on the bed beside him.</p><p>Nervously I go and sit down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve complicated things between us,\u201d he says regretfully.</p><p>My eyes flick up at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t complicated things. If anything, I have.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head ruefully. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. I knew how things stood with you and your ex and I shouldn\u2019t have kissed you. But I just couldn\u2019t help myself \u2013 and, honestly, I\u2019ve been really trying not to act on how I feel \u2013 but it\u2019s just tonight you looked so . . .\u201d He sighs and rests his head back against the headboard. \u201cAnd then when you were talking to Neil, I guess I . . .\u201d He glances over at me, his expression forlorn. \u201cLook, Lucyna, I like you \u2013\u201d He rubs his hand over his face. \u201c\u2013 a lot.\u201d</p><p>He likes me. A lot. Maybe it\u2019s not exactly the three words I want him to say but it\u2019s a start. A very good start.</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d he adds, and my theoretical heart sinks. He\u2019s looking anywhere now, but at me.</p><p>I take hold of his hand. He glances at me, eyes a mosaic of emotions and I hold his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong, James. I don\u2019t love my ex in that way. I love him purely platonically because he meant something to me once, but I don\u2019t feel about him anymore \u2013 in the way I feel for you.\u201d Where is this stuff coming from? Well honestly I don\u2019t care as long as it works. \u201cJames, I like \u2013 \u201clove\u201d \u2013 you too. A lot. And I\u2019m never going to get back with my ex. I\u2019m only interested in you. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curl around my hand and for a moment we just sit eyes locked together, neither of us speaking.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally says. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when I know my words have worked. I twist my lips together suppressing the enormous smile I feel. \u201cWell I was kind of hoping you\u2019d kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>He grins, reaches over and plunges his fingers deep into my hair, pulling my face to his. He kisses me, so intensely, so passionately, that my whole body trembles.</p><p>When he finally releases me, I feel light, like I\u2019m floating on air.</p><p>He smiles at me and I smile back. Then he runs his fingers between mine, gripping hold of my hand again, bringing it to his mouth, pressing it to his lips, resting our entwined hands against his bare chest.</p><p>I glance down at our hands, my eyes lingering on his chest. When I drag my eyes back up to his face, his are still on mine.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna stay in here with me tonight?\u201d he suggests, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the look on my face that prompts him to add, \u201cNo funny business, I promise. I\u2019ll keep my hands to myself.\u201d He looks at me seriously but he\u2019s unable to hide the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>I quickly consider my options. A night alone in my room wiling away the hours, or a night in here with James?</p><p>Hmm, let me think . . .</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p><p>He grins sheepishly, his face suddenly colouring. \u201cEr . . . I\u2019m kinda naked under here. You mind passing me those boxers?\u201d He points to a pair of black boxer shorts hanging over the edge of his laundry basket.</p><p>My face instantly flames. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I retrieve them for him and look away, giving him some privacy whilst he struggles to get them on under the duvet; assumedly his pot is causing him problems. I\u2019d offer to help but it really doesn\u2019t seem appropriate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll done,\u201d he says after what seems a long time, sounding somewhat breathless.</p><p>I turn to see he\u2019s moved over to make room for me and is holding the duvet back.</p><p>I climb in beside him. His body is so warm. He lays the cover over me, and reaches over and switches the lamp off, plunging us into darkness.</p><p>I turn onto my side, facing him. James stays on his back but turns his head towards me.</p> <p>\u201cHow many woman have you had?\u201d What is wrong with me? Why do I keep blurting these clumsy questions out at him?</p><p>A snort of laughter comes from him. \u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d he says, still laughing, but I can hear the surprise in his voice.</p><p>And I\u2019m truly thankful it\u2019s dark in here, so he can\u2019t see just how red my face has gone.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I mumble, embarrassed. I turn my head burying it into the pillow, realising where that question\u2019s come from. Neil\u2019s words have been playing on a constant loop in my mind ever since he uttered them to me earlier.</p><p>He strokes my arm with his finger. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have asked if it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I lift my face up and push my hair back. Then, feeling like a broken record, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s just Neil said, well kind of implied, that you\u2019d had a lot of women \u2013 that you were a womaniser \u2013 I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little shit.\u201d He laughs. \u201cHe\u2019ll be lucky if he still has a job on Monday.\u201d He cups my chin and brings his face closer to mine. His eyes are glowing at me in the dark. \u201cHe was having you on, Luce.\u201d His voice sounds more intense, more serious. \u201cI\u2019m guessing to lead you away from me and straight to him. Trust me, I\u2019m not a womaniser. I\u2019ve had a fair few women in my time, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019m certainly no womaniser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuce?\u201d I say with surprise, suddenly distracted.</p><p>He runs his hand down my neck and over my shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I call you that, do you?\u201d He leans over and presses his lips to mine.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmur, our lips touching.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cI know I should have said this earlier but you looked \u2013 look incredibly beautiful tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Beautiful. James thinks I\u2019m beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou think I look beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always think you look beautiful.\u201d He kisses my forehead, my cheek, my jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the very first moment I saw you,\u201d he groans, voice low as he kisses my neck.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, mainly because I can\u2019t. I\u2019m so overawed by what\u2019s happening right here, right now. Things only my dreams were made of.</p><p>His lips find mine again. At first he kisses me slowly, then more passionately. My body is heating, responding to his touch. His hands go around my waist and he pulls me on top of him. A bolt of desire shoots through me. Our bodies are pressed together, his pot coarse against the bare skin on my leg, but I don\u2019t care. His hands are on my back, slowly moving lower, as he devours me with his lips. I put my hands on his bare chest. I can feel his fingers inching my dress up.</p><p>Then suddenly he brings his hands up to my face, cupping it and gently pushes me back, away from him.</p><p>He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths, whilst I look on at him in confusion, my lips throbbing, my body aching.</p><p>He blows out a final breath, opens his eyes, a serious expression now on his face. \u201cGetting a bit carried away there. But I promised you no funny business and I meant it.\u201d He tips the end of my nose with his finger. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the time in the world for that.\u201d</p> <p>I lay down beside him, disappointed, but knowing he\u2019s right, even if his reasoning is far different from mine.</p><p>Because no matter how badly I may want him, I know it\u2019s not right. Not when he doesn\u2019t really know me.</p><p>He slides his arm under my shoulder and pulls me closer. I rest my head on his warm chest and listen to his heart beating.</p><p>But even the warmth of his body and the comforting thump of his heart can\u2019t take away the chilling effect his words have left on me.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve got all the time in the world.\u2019</p><p>If only we did.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Guardian Angel</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>James regards me with his intense brown eyes, his lips curving into a heartbreaking smile. \u201cOf course I am,\u201d he says. \u201cHow could I not be when I\u2019m with you?\u201d The smile suddenly drops from his face. \u201cYou\u2019re happy aren\u2019t you \u2013 with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I beam. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s early Sunday morning, a few days since we first kissed. We\u2019re laid in his bed. And no, it\u2019s not how it sounds. We haven\u2019t done that. All we\u2019ve done is talk \u2013 in-between all the kissing, that is.</p><p>James hasn\u2019t attempted to move things any further which I\u2019m pretty relieved about. I\u2019m fairly sure he would like to but I know he\u2019s been respectful. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to have sex with him because if it\u2019s anything like the kissing, well . . . let\u2019s just say if it is then I most definitely want to.</p><p>But I also know it wouldn\u2019t be right. How could we make love when he doesn\u2019t even know who I truly am.</p><p>Its bad enough how much I deceive him already, but really, that would be just taking it to the extreme.</p><p>I know I\u2019m running out of time. He is going to want to have sex soon. It\u2019s only natural. And I have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m going to do or say when the time does finally arrive.</p><p>\u201cI love this, you know,\u201d he says trailing his fingers across the exposed skin on my back where my vest has ridden up, \u201cwaking up beside you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I smile warmly.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d he says moving closer to me. \u201cLet\u2019s just stay in bed forever, never get up, just the two of us cocooned here in our own little world. We could get takeaway delivered three times a day . . . obviously you\u2019d have to get out of bed to go get it from the front door.\u201d He grins.</p><p>If only he knew how much I wish that could be true. But instead of saying the truth, I just laugh and say, \u201cYou\u2019d go stir crazy stuck inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I had you to keep me company.\u201d He kisses the bare skin on my shoulder, his two day old stubble scratching against me.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I\u2019d go stir-crazy,\u201d I smirk.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he mock chides. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m gonna have to hold you hostage in here with me, then.\u201d He laughs and lays back, arms folded behind his head, eyes on the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you get away, Luce.\u201d</p><p>And I say nothing.</p><p>Because I know one day soon I will have to go and there will be nothing either of us can do about it.</p><p>I prop myself up on my elbow and put my hand on his face, our skin so different in contrast. His dark, mine light. He glances at me and closes his eyes. I run my finger over the scar on his eyebrow. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d I ask</p><p>He opens his eyes. \u201cThe scar?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI did it when I was seven. I was going through my superman phase and I told my mate Carl that I could fly just like the man himself. He said I was a liar \u2013 which obviously I was.\u201d He smirks. \u201cAnd, well, Carl said he\u2019d only believe me if I showed him. He dared me.\u201d He glances at me, eyes amused, and shrugs. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t like I could back down even if I was totally shitting myself.\u201d</p><p>I touch the scar again. \u201cI take it it didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d He laughs, his expression soft. \u201cI went for it, though, put my superman cape on and everything. You\u2019d have been impressed. I got up on our extension roof, nearly puked a few times when I saw the drop,\u201d he laughs, \u201csomehow managed to contain myself, and after a few deep breaths, I just closed my eyes and went for it.\u201d</p><p>I sit up aghast. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you tried to fly.\u201d</p><p>He stares up at the ceiling and laughs.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . what happened?\u201d I ask tentatively, lying back down on my front propping myself up on my elbows.</p><p>He grins sideways at me. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t fly, obviously. I just kinda dropped and landed right on Carl\u2019s bike which was sitting directly below. I was lucky it was there \u2018cause it broke my fall. Carl wasn\u2019t so chuffed \u2013 I broke his bike.\u201d He lifts his right arm up. \u201cBroke my arm in a couple of places and cut my head open. Hence the scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have died.\u201d</p><p>He widens his eyes in mock-seriousness and chuckles. \u201cYou look so cute when you\u2019re concerned.\u201d He runs his fingertip down my nose.</p><p>I bat his arm away. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>He catches hold of my hand and lifts it to his lips and kisses my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He tries to say it soberly but I can still hear the snigger in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what my dad said \u2013 not sorry, that I could have died \u2013 well amongst many other things.\u201d He presses his lips together, stifling a grin, knowing I\u2019m not in the mood. \u201cThe doctor said I\u2019d been incredibly lucky, said I must have a guardian angel watching over me.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the bed sheet as though it\u2019s suddenly the most interesting thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the quack was right,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cI mean think about it, Luce, that\u2019s two pretty serious scrapes I\u2019ve survived now. Shame you hadn\u2019t been there to save me back then, though, inside of Carl\u2019s bike.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, seeing my expression. He chucks my chin with his finger but I don\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cHave I upset you?\u201d he asks, voice soft.</p><p>I lift my head up and find myself gazing straight into the depths of eyes. \u201cI just don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>He wraps his arms around me, pulling me closer. I rest my head on his chest. \u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d he says earnestly, kissing the top of my head, \u201cespecially not whilst I\u2019ve got my very own guardian angel around keeping me safe.</p><p>I close my eyes, concealing the truth in them.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m starving.\u201d He stretches his long, lean body out obviously done with the conversation. \u201cYou want some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay thanks.\u201d</p><p>He shuffles down the bed, forcing me off him so we\u2019re laid face to face. \u201cYou\u2019re not hungry, eh?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cNo surprise there, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you never eat.\u201d</p><p>Okay so now I wish I\u2019d never asked. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I sit up. \u201cYes. I. Do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DO!\u201d I yell, wide eyed with exasperation, even though he\u2019s right, I don\u2019t.</p><p>He shuffles up the bed, resting up against the headboard and rubs his hand over his face.</p><p>We both sit in a stony silence.</p><p>Then finally he says in calm voice, \u201cLuce, you can talk to me, you know. About anything. I won\u2019t judge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo go on, then.\u201d He gestures with his hand. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>He sighs loudly, eyes fixed on me and shakes his head. \u201cDo you have an eating disorder?\u201d he asks bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A burst of laughter explodes from me. It quickly dies out when I realise from the look on his face that he\u2019s not joking. And now he looks kind of annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an eating disorder, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never eat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.</p><p>I shake my head and look away, refusing to get dragged into this again.</p><p>\u201cLook it doesn\u2019t matter to me if you do,\u201d he says voice softer. \u201cI just want to help.\u201d</p><p>And for a moment I actually consider just saying I have, at least it\u2019s a way to explain why I don\u2019t eat, but then, knowing James, he\u2019d watch me even more hawk-like than he obviously already is, trying to ensure I eat. And when I don\u2019t, because I can\u2019t, the questions I\u2019d have to face would be far worse.</p><p>I look directly at him, face as serious as I can muster. \u201cJames, I don\u2019t have an eating disorder.\u201d</p> <p>He frowns, eyeing me suspiciously then his gaze suddenly softens. He takes my hand in his, interlocking our fingers. \u201cLook, Luce, I know you said you left home because of a guy, but, well, you never talk about your past at all and I was thinking \u2013 well I thought that maybe the truth was that you\u2019d been in a clinic for treatment because, you know, you were ill \u2013 with like anorexia or something, and that you\u2019d run away and didn\u2019t want to tell me because, well \u2013 because you didn\u2019t want me to know the truth, so you made up the story about the guy and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left because of a guy,\u201d I say shortly, which for once is the absolute truth. He just doesn\u2019t know that he is the guy. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have anorexia,\u201d I add.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to get really uncomfortable at his line of questioning and I know it\u2019s only because he\u2019s skirting kind of close to the truth.</p><p>He sighs and let\u2019s go of my hand and pushes his fingers through his hair. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen you eat, Luce. Honestly, I\u2019ve really thought about it and I can\u2019t think of one single time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I just don\u2019t like to eat in front of people.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a big eater,\u201d I add for extra effect.</p><p>He shakes his head, disbelievingly.</p> <p>I really don\u2019t want to have this conversation anymore. I get up off the bed to leave but he grabs my arm and pulls me back down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you, babe. I\u2019m just worried about you.\u201d His face so sincere, so caring.</p><p>The guilt washes over me like a wave and I still it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be. I\u2019m fine. If I had an eating disorder I would tell you. I promise. Scouts honour.\u201d I do a two finger salute and add a smile. It feels awkward and clumsy but I hold it there, unable to do anything else.</p><p>He twists his lips. \u201cSo that\u2019s it, you\u2019re telling me you're just not a big eater and that you don\u2019t like to eat in front of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d I nod.</p><p>I hate this. I hate having to lie to him, again, but what other choice do I have other than to tell him the truth, that is?</p><p>He looks down, examining his nails. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says slowly and shrugs. \u201cYou say you don\u2019t have a problem, then I believe you.\u201d</p><p>I know he doesn\u2019t believe me. He knows he doesn\u2019t believe me, but thankfully he doesn\u2019t push it any further. And honestly it makes me love him even more, if that\u2019s at all possible.</p><p>He reaches over and grabs one of his crutches from beside the bed and stands, tucking it under his arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go down. You coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019s gone I flop back onto the pillows and stare up at the ceiling. I turn my head and press my face into the pillow. It smells of him, his scent setting off an ache deep inside me.</p><p>This is too hard, harder than I ever imagined it could be. I hate deceiving him all the time. And, as I\u2019ve just discovered, he\u2019s starting to notice things are different about me. But I guess it was only a matter time; he\u2019s not stupid.</p><p>And for how long do I think I can keep up the pretence? I mean, really, how long it will be before he also realises I never sleep, or that I don\u2019t breathe, or have a heartbeat, or do any of the things that define being a human.</p><p>And, really, does he not deserve the truth before he figures it out for himself.</p><p>But is that a risk I should take, exposing myself to him like that? And if I did, would he even believe me? Humans are nothing if not sceptical, generally refuting what they don\u2019t know or understand \u2013 it\u2019s in their nature to do so.</p><p>But what about when the Elders finally find me? Do I really just want to up and disappear without a word, leaving him to think that I just left him without him ever knowing the truth? Knowing how much I love him. Knowing what I sacrificed to be with him.</p><p>And part of me wants him to know me. The real me.</p><p>I feel a sudden burst of urgency.</p><p>I have to tell him. I want to tell him. He\u2019ll understand, I know he will. This is James. He\u2019s wonderful and caring. Once I explain everything, he\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019m sure of it. And if he isn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get to it.</p><p>All I do know is that I have to tell him \u2013 now.</p><p>Shoving all my misgivings aside, I jump out of bed and practically run out of his room and across the landing toward the stairs.</p><p>I\u2019m just going to go downstairs, sit down and calmly tell him everything, reveal the whole truth about myself and then deal with the consequences.</p><p>I suddenly feel very liberated at the thought.</p><p>As my foot hits the bottom step I become aware of voices talking in the kitchen.</p><p>Someone\u2019s in there with James. But who would be here this early in the morning?</p><p>A few worrying scenarios skip through my mind as I walk down the hall toward the closed door, sending a chill shuddering through me.</p><p>I prepare myself for the worst and very slowly push open the kitchen door.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Disruptions</p><p>It\u2019s Sara.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know who I was expecting, to be honest. It\u2019s not like it would have been one of the Elders turning up to collect me, stopping off to have a chat with James first.</p><p>I am surprised to see her here, though. James hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the party, since the argument.</p><p>He\u2019s ignored her calls and deleted the many text messages she\u2019s sent him. And I\u2019ve just stayed neutral saying nothing. I haven\u2019t encouraged him to speak to her. And maybe that\u2019s wrong of me but I really didn\u2019t want her to come here and launch another attack on me. And selfishly I\u2019ve just been too revelling in our togetherness to even bother to think about anything else.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lucyna.\u201d She glances up at me, nervously fiddling with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. My skin feels like it\u2019s got bugs crawling all over it.</p><p>I straighten up preparing myself for another battle and then I notice how dark the skin around her eyes is. Also her eyes themselves look red and puffy and her face is looking much paler than I remember. Actually she doesn\u2019t look like her usual radiant self at all. She looks unhappy. Miserable in fact.</p><p>And I instantly feel responsible for her unhappiness.</p><p>Her and James are only having problems because of me. They were close friends before I arrived, I know this because I saw it for myself and they have been for a long time. And now faced here with it, it\u2019s impossible to ignore. The guilt practically drenches me, soaking into my skin</p><p>How would I feel if someone came between Arlo and me in that way?</p><p>Arlo.</p><p>I feel a sudden pang of longing for him.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realised how much I have missed him until just now. I\u2019ve been so wrapped up in James I haven\u2019t even thought about him since my change. I\u2019m sure he will be concerned in his own unfeeling way over my disappearance. I wish I could see him.</p><p>I take the seat opposite Sara. All the determination I\u2019d built up to tell James the truth has disintegrated. My urgency has gone.</p><p>James carries over three cups of coffee, hands one to Sara then puts one down purposefully in front of me. He takes the seat between us.</p><p>Sara picks her coffee up, blows on it a couple of times, then takes a sip and places it back down on the table. I can see her hands are shaking ever so slightly and she grips hold of the cup again, wrapping her hands around it. James doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>She clears her throat and glances at me. \u201cLucyna, I want to apologise for my behaviour on Friday night. I\u2019d had a lot to drink, although that\u2019s no excuse, I know that.\u201d She takes a deep breath. I can see how hard this is for her. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said the things I did. I don\u2019t know what came over me and I hope you can accept my apology.\u201d</p><p>I glance at James out of the corner of my eye, seeing the hopeful look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Just think of it as if it never happened.\u201d I run my fingertip around the rim of the cup. The hot steam billows up, caressing my fingers.</p><p>She smiles and visibly relaxes, sits back in her chair and sips her coffee.</p><p>James gently squeezes my leg under the table, his dark eyes smiling gratefully at me. I smile at him, but don\u2019t really feel good.</p><p>I\u2019m not naive enough to think Sara meant a single word of what she has just said. I know she\u2019s only done this because she loves James and wants him to forgive her, not me. But for that to happen she had to apologise to me. I\u2019m fine with that really. I can\u2019t fault her for wanting to make James happy, because ultimately that\u2019s what I want for him. And I know by accepting her apology that it will make things okay between them.</p><p>He\u2019s happy; so am I.</p><p>But that still doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to feel elated about the situation as a whole.</p><p>\u201cSo what you been up too?\u201d Sara says, focussing all her attention onto James, and they launch into conversation.</p><p>I stay for a short while, smiling and nodding in all the right places. Making an excuse about needing to have a shower, I take my coffee upstairs with me so I can dispose of it down the bathroom sink.</p><p>I have a lovely hot steaming shower. I would never, ever tire of these if I was human. I\u2019ll really miss them when I\u2019m gone. Home. I shudder at the thought of leaving James, so I lean my head back, letting the water wash over my face, rinsing away all the tainting thoughts down the plughole.</p><p>After a while, and very reluctantly, I get out of the shower, dry myself off with a towel and put on a skirt and vest top.</p><p>Assuming Sara will probably have gone by now, I head back downstairs to see what James is up to, taking my empty cup with me.</p><p>I reach the bottom of the stairs and turn the corner seeing straight into the kitchen and that\u2019s when everything starts to feel like it\u2019s moving in slow motion as I see something that freezes me cold.</p><p>James is kissing Sara. Or Sara is kissing James.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure which. But what I do know is he\u2019s backed up against the kitchen cupboards, her in front of him with her hands on his face and their lips are pressed together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel like I\u2019ve been physically hit.</p><p>I stumble backwards, tripping over a pair of James\u2019 shoes and drop the cup.

She just grabbed me and kissed me! I swear I didn\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Sara callous voice addresses me. A smirk stretching right across her pallid face, it makes her look almost haunting as she casually walks down the hall behind James. He\u2019s almost reached me by this point, his face taut with worry.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to kiss me,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou see James loves me. He wants to be with me.\u201d</p><p>He turns on her. \u201cAre you seven shades of crazy? I don\u2019t even fucking know you anymore, let alone love you!\u201d</p><p>For a moment she looks as though he\u2019s just slapped her but she quickly regains composure. \u201cJames, I know you love me. You just can\u2019t admit it to yourself\u201d</p> <p>He glares at her, eyes hard, and shakes his head. \u201cNo, Sara, I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>Her composure instantly disintegrates. \u201cBut, James, I love you.\u201d There\u2019s a low desperation in her voice, it\u2019s uncomfortable to hear. She reaches for him, but he moves away closer to me, leaving her grabbing at air.</p><p>Anger covers her face. \u201cYou should be with me!\u201d she spits. \u201cNot her! It\u2019s what your dad would have wanted!\u201d</p><p>James\u2019 face freezes at the mention of Max. \u201cYou need to go.\u201d He sounds oddly composed, his tone not matching his face at all.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stands firm. \u201cYou know he would. He\u2019d be disappointed that you\u2019ve got this bit of trash living in his house.\u201d She jabs a finger at me. I recoil backwards, feeling stung.</p><p>\u201cSara. Go. Now.\u201d His composure has gone, his face a mask of anger, his voice detached, cold. I can see he\u2019s struggling to control his rage.</p> <p>She shakes her head, balling her fists at her sides. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of my house!\u201d he roars, tone savage, and I nearly jump out of my skin</p><p>He grabs her by the arm and, opening the front door, roughly shoves her out of it, ignoring her protests, then slams it loudly in her face.</p><p>He leans back against the door, chest heaving up and down, his eyes flashing anger.</p><p>I hear the sounds of Sara\u2019s defeated heels as they click slowly away against the pavement outside.</p><p>My legs give out on me and I crumple down onto the bottom step. Leaning forward I put my head in my hands. My whole body is trembling. I don\u2019t know what to do? What I\u2019m supposed to do in a situation like this? I\u2019m completely out of my depth here. I have no idea what to do with these raw emotions which are coursing through my body like a poison.</p><p>I never once imagined something could hurt as much as this.</p><p>And just like that, I\u2019m hit again with that feeling of familiarity, that sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as if I\u2019ve felt it before in some other time, some other place. Just the same as when James first kissed me. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p> <p>James comes over and struggles to sit at my feet. I don\u2019t look at him, and I don\u2019t help him.</p><p>In the end he just kind of drops himself down to the floor with a thud.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss her back,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing. I just stay as I am, leant forward, head in my hands as silent tears roll down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLucyna, please.\u201d</p><p>I look up at his imploring tone. He looks anxious and saddened. I move my eyes past him and look at the door. I\u2019m half-expecting Sara to burst back through it at any minute.</p><p>\u201cI know how it looked,\u201d he says frankly, palms spread out, \u201cbut honestly it wasn\u2019t that way at all. It just all happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him and he holds my gaze. \u201cWe were talking like fine and then I made the mistake of telling her that me and you are together.\u201d He shakes his head and sighs. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t know \u2013 it was like a switch flipped in her and she went fucking mental, started saying that she loves me, that she always has, that we were meant to be together. And then the next thing I know she was just on me, trying to bloody kiss me \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like she succeeded to me.\u201d Tears are dripping off my face onto my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss her.\u201d He looks as determined as he sounds. \u201cChrist, Lucyna, I wouldn\u2019t do anything to risk losing you. You mean too much to me. I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d He lifts his hand up to my face but I move away from him.</p><p>I see the hurt plainly in his eyes which only makes me feel worse. And, honestly, I don\u2019t even know why I just reacted like that.</p><p>He lets his hand fall into his lap and looks down. \u201cIf I was gonna cheat on you, would I really do it whilst you were only upstairs?\u201d</p><p>I see the logic in his words and I already know he\u2019s telling me the truth \u2013 I knew the instant I looked into his sincere eyes.</p><p>But I just feel so confused, nothing's tying together properly. The pain is still here, not easing one iota.</p><p>He sighs disconsolately and rakes his fingers through his dark hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what more I can say to make you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me, the relief on his face palpable. He reaches for me and taking hold of my hand, gently pulls me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d He takes my face in hands, his callous skin is rough against mine. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into her. She\u2019s never done anything like this before. It\u2019s just not her. She\u2019s like a different person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only behaving this way because she loves you,\u201d I say, sounding oddly rational when it\u2019s the last thing I feel at the moment. \u201cJust give her some time and I\u2019m sure things will be okay.\u201d</p><p>He regards me questioningly. \u201cHow can you be like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo understanding? Sara\u2019s done nothing but treat you like shit since the first day you met her, and all you\u2019ve ever done is be nice about her.\u201d</p><p>I just shrug because I\u2019m unable to say the real reason why I\u2019m like I am is that I\u2019ve spent many years studying human behaviour to better understand why they behave as they do. But mainly it\u2019s because I know first hand how love can make you do crazy things, things you never thought yourself capable of. And really I\u2019m no better than Sara is \u2013 in some ways I\u2019m worse. Far worse. At least she\u2019s honest, which is lot more than can be said for me.</p><p>I\u2019m the worst kind of coward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so great,\u201d he says, pulling me close, burying his face into my hair, \u201cand I\u2019m so lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>His words do not make me feel better.</p><p>\u201cThis thing with Sara,\u201d he murmurs into my hair, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to come between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d I discreetly brush the tear from my face, knowing this to be the least of my problems. Sara won\u2019t be the one to come between us, I will.</p><p>He pulls back and brushes his lips against mine, my woe momentarily disappearing, only for it to return the instant our lips part.</p><p>\u201cHow do you fancy going out for the day?\u201d he says brightening up. \u201cWe could go into town? Do something touristy like go on the London Eye? I know I\u2019m not fully mobile but we could do with getting out of the house, especially after that.\u201d He nods toward the door.</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cSounds like a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He presses another kiss to my lips and I lean into him, prolonging the kiss for as long as I can, not wanting the unhappiness to return to me. I slide my arms around his neck, pulling him close, not ready to let him go just yet.</p><p>He pulls away breathless, chuckling. \u201cWe won\u2019t be going anywhere if you kiss me like that again.\u201d His eyes glisten.</p><p>I get up off his lap and offer my hand to him, ignoring the disappointment in his eyes. He takes my hand and I attempt to pull him up but I\u2019m a lot smaller than he is and I nearly end up toppling onto him instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d he laughs and shuffles himself up onto the bottom step, lifts himself up to the next one and I help him up from there.</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just go have a shower and shave.\u201d He rubs his rough chin. \u201cThen we can get off.\u201d</p><p>I help him up the stairs and leave him by the bathroom. I turn to go back downstairs.</p><p>\u201cLuce?\u201d he calls, pulling me back. \u201cYou fancy getting a takeaway tonight? We could get a film, a bottle of wine and curl up on the sofa together. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I smile.</p><p>He smiles warmly at me, then taps his hand on the door with an air of finality and disappears into the bathroom.</p><p>I lean my back up against the wall and let the smile drop from my face.</p><p>I can\u2019t let this go on for much longer. I have to tell him the truth. It\u2019s the very least I owe him.</p><p>We\u2019ll spend the day together as planned, and tonight I\u2019ll tell him everything. I just pray that he\u2019ll understand.</p><p>At least one upside is I don\u2019t have to worry about how to dodge eating in front of him tonight, as he\u2019ll soon know the real reason as to why I don\u2019t.</p><p>But the thought doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>I push off the wall and head downstairs to wait for him, ignoring the tiny voice in my mind that\u2019s nagging to be heard, desperately trying to tell me that it\u2019s not a good idea to tell him, that no good can come of telling James that I\u2019m not the human he believes me to be.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Candour</p><p>I\u2019m sat on the chair in living room, trying not to think about the wonderful day I\u2019ve just spent with James, but now instead focussing on what I have to tell him.</p><p>My hands start to shake. I clasp them together.</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely terrified but I can\u2019t back out. I have to do this.</p><p>He might accept what I am about to tell him, accept who I am. I know it\u2019s a long shot but it could be a possibility \u2013 a small one, but still.</p><p>Of course I\u2019m not naive enough to think he won\u2019t be surprised at my revelation, to say the least. But he cares for me. That has to count for something \u2013 doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou ready to order this food?\u201d I look up to see James coming into the living room with a takeaway menu in his hand. \u201cAnd no fobbing me off with you're not hungry. I know you\u2019ve eaten nothing all day, so . . .\u201d He lifts his shoulders, his lips curving upwards.</p><p>He looks so incredibly beautiful with an expression of such happiness on his face, and he has such trust in me, trust I\u2019ll shatter if I tell him truth.</p><p>This is too hard. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll tell him tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you fancy having, then?\u201d he asks whilst perusing the menu. \u201cI was thinking we could get some starters and a couple of mains to share \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I realise I\u2019m speaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glances up from the menu. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I smile. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for a moment, then back to the menu. \u201cSo, I was thinking maybe some spring rolls, and chicken satay \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually,\u201d I say cutting him off, this unknown strength suddenly spurring me on. \u201cIt does matter. I have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay . . .\u201d He comes and takes a seat on the sofa opposite me.</p><p>I press my trembling hands together, palm to palm. I can\u2019t bring myself to look at him, so I keep my eyes on the floor but I can feel his gaze burning into me.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is . . . I have to tell you that . . .\u201d And now the words won\u2019t come. My throat is so clogged up with them I\u2019m practically choking.</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d his voice comes softly, \u201cwhatever it is, you can tell me. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p> <p>I know what he\u2019s thinking. He thinks I\u2019m about to confess that I have an eating disorder. If only it was that.</p><p>I look up, staring directly into his warm, trusting eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s something about me that you need to know \u2013 have a right to know.\u201d I instantly correct myself.</p><p>He smiles tenderly. \u201cBabe, don\u2019t worry, its okay, I know what you\u2019re going to say. I know you have a problem \u2013 with food.\u201d He lingers over the word. \u201cI\u2019d have to be blind not to. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you all the help you need, I promise, and I\u2019ll be right by your side all the way.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when I realise just how much he truly cares for me. Making this so much harder for me to say.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says, beckoning to me.</p><p>I shake my head, briefly closing my eyes. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to tell you.\u201d</p> <p>His brow furrows. \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I\u2019m . . .\u201d my voice trails off into oblivion. A tears rolls down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cLuce \u2013 what is it?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him with helpless eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to fucking guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo \u2013 I \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>I look at him with complete surprise. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you got kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you born a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Just stop, James!\u201d I hold my hand up. \u201cGive me a minute, please.\u201d</p><p>He goes silent and begins rolling the menu up in his hands. I can see just how frustrated he is.</p><p>I bring my knees to my chest hugging them. \u201cThis is a really hard thing for me to say and it\u2019s going to be even harder for you to hear.\u201d My voice is barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cJust say it.\u201d His tone is harsh, impatient, taking me by surprise</p><p>I quickly recover and, finding my backbone, I put my feet down to the floor, look him in the eye and say, \u201cI\u2019m not human.\u201d Then I prepare myself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he says, without a trace of humour, \u201cyou\u2019re really starting to piss me off now. Will you just say whatever the fuck it is and get it over and done with!\u201d</p><p>I look at him feeling wrong-footed. \u201cI just have \u2013 I\u2019m not human,\u201d I repeat calmly even though I feel anything but.</p><p>He sighs and starts to get up off the sofa. \u201cIf this is your way of getting out of eating then \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, James\u201d</p><p>I think it must be the tone of my voice that stops him because he hesitates. So I seize the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Bringer \u2013 well I was \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure what I am now,\u201d I ramble. \u201cBut I \u2013 well, we Bringers take human souls to Heaven when they\u2019ve died. It\u2019s what we exist for. My home is a place called Pure Land. It lies on the Astral plane between Heaven and earth . . .\u201d And now I\u2019m actually saying these words, I can hear just how very unreal they sound, and just exactly how they must sound to him.</p><p>He probably thinks I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe,\u201d I add with emphasis. \u201cBut I am telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>I can see his mind working, quickly, trying to processes what I\u2019ve just told him. His face obtuse, uncomprehending. Then he laughs, awkwardly. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously expecting me to believe that you\u2019re - what - an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, no.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not an angel. But I am sort of the conception that you have of them. Angels do exist, but well I\u2019m what is called a Bringer.\u201d</p><p>He taps the rolled up menu against his knee. \u201cRight. Okay.\u201d He pauses pushing his tongue between his teeth, making a kind of hissing noise. \u201cSeriously, Luce, this really isn\u2019t funny. I know you have an odd way but honestly \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny. I\u2019m trying to be honest with you.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward, forearms resting on his legs and crushes the menu between his large hands. \u201cOkay, and let\u2019s just say for a minute that I believe you \u2013 which right now I\u2019m having a really fucking hard time doing, then what are you doing here with me? Why aren\u2019t you off in Heaven \u2013 erm \u2013 doing whatever it is you Bringers do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t go back \u2013 well I mean I could \u2013 I think, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d I say, feeling discomfited. \u201cJames, the night of your accident, I was there to take you to \u2013 well I mean \u2013 you were supposed to die that night.\u201d I glance over at him to see his eyes flicker and I know there\u2019s some tiny part of him that maybe kind of believes me, even though his common sense is strongly telling him otherwise. I press on, \u201cI was there to take you to Heaven. But I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t let you die, I had to save you and somehow I changed \u2013 to this human form, and I could touch you and you could actually see me, and I didn\u2019t want to let go of that and lose you and \u2013\u201d I peter off.</p><p>He rubs his head. \u201cHang on, so what you\u2019re saying is I was supposed to die and you were there to take me to Heaven but you changed into a human and decided to save me instead?\u201d he says this with a really patronising tone to his voice and a smile creeping onto his lips.</p><p>\u201cYes \u2013 well there\u2019s a lot more to it than that, but essentially \u2013 yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nods his head disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cI am telling you the truth,\u201d I reiterate.</p><p>He sits back in his chair. \u201cYeah, sure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Max.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flick up at me.</p><p>\u201cMax, your dad,\u201d I reaffirm.</p><p>\u201cI know what my dad\u2019s name is,\u201d he says coldly. \u201cHow do you \u2013\u201d He swallows loudly, \u201c\u2013 how did know my dad?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when I know he\u2019s finally listening to me, that I\u2019ve finally got his attention.</p><p>\u201cI was his Bringer. I took him to Heaven. That\u2019s how I first met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2013\u201d He shakes his head and rakes his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day Max died \u2013 July second, at three fourteen pm. I was there in the hospital room with him, well his soul \u2013 and you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow to confusion but I keep mine fixed on his.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Max, trying to help him come to terms with his death when you came in the room and something happened to me that had never happened before \u2013\u201d</p><p>He suddenly sits forward, angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, James, you need to hear this and I need to say it,\u201d I continue on, not giving him a chance to respond. \u201cI didn\u2019t have feelings \u2013 emotionally or physically. It\u2019s just the way we are. But from the very moment I saw you, I started to have them, feelings, I mean, and I was so confused and curious . . . about the feelings \u2013 about you. And then Max asked me to watch over you and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to watch over you. He was worried about leaving you alone, he said you wouldn\u2019t take care of yourself properly and he asked me to look in on you to make sure you were okay, so I visited you to fulfil my promise to him. And also I wanted to understand them \u2013 the feelings, understand what was happening to me and then I discovered that mainly the feelings I was having, well they were for you, and then I couldn\u2019t seem to stay away. And on the night of your accident, fortunately out of all of us it was me that was called to be your Bringer and \u2013\u201d My throat closes and tears suddenly spill from my eyes. The enormity of it all dawning on me. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t let you die.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing you again \u2013\u201d</p><p>He rubs roughly at his face, and laughs discordantly. \u201cI just can\u2019t fucking believe I\u2019m hearing this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to take,\u201d I say through my tears.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d He looks at me sharply. \u201cYou have no fucking idea how I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d He gets up. \u201cThis is just \u2013 fucking ridiculous! It\u2019s too much . . . I can\u2019t listen to this shit \u2013 I have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He hobbles quickly out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I scamper after him, the panic audible in my voice but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer and I get in the hall to find him already at the door.</p><p>The panic grips a tighter hold of me. \u201cJames?\u201d I cry. I know how frantic I sound but I can\u2019t seem to control it. It\u2019s like the fear\u2019s taken over and I no longer have control.</p><p>He turns abruptly. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Everything was going so great and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth and because you have a right to know.\u201d I wipe the tears off my face. \u201cAnd I knew I couldn\u2019t hide it for much longer. You were already starting to notice things, like how I don\u2019t eat \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there was me thinking you had fucking anorexia!\u201d he yells fiercely.</p><p>His tone hits me like a slap across the face.</p><p>\u201cAnd I \u2013 I wanted you to know me,\u201d I say in a quieter voice. \u201cThe real me. Before anything happened between us, I mean before we were intimate \u2013 I didn\u2019t think it was right \u2013\u201d</p><p>He laughs hollowly. \u201cHaven\u2019t we been intimate enough already?\u201d His voice is like ice, coating me with its horrifying chill and I just want to shrink down and be invisible.</p><p>\u201cI know, I meant \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I wrap my arms around myself.</p><p>I\u2019m too afraid to look at him, afraid of what I\u2019ll see on his face, afraid that he\u2019s repulsed by me now he knows who I really am.</p><p>I could hear the disdain in his voice. I don\u2019t want to see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is just too \u2013 too fucking weird,\u201d he says uncomprehending, clutching his head. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He presses down on the handle.</p><p>I grab hold of his arm. \u201cJames, please don\u2019t go!\u201d I say, my tone desperate. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He spins around. His face is livid. \u201cLove me \u2013 fuck!\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDo you even know the meaning of the fucking word?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI \u2013 I \u2013 please if you\u2019d just listen to me, let me explain \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d his voice like thunder, eyes blazing. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to you anymore!\u201d</p><p>I start at level of his rage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I sob still desperately clinging to his arm. \u201cBut I\u2019m still me.

Well, three hours and thirty five minutes, to be exact.</p><p>And I just sat there on the sofa for all of those three hours and thirty five minutes, waiting, torturing myself, crying my eyes dry.</p><p>And now, finally out of tears, I\u2019m stood here in the garden, contemplating what I know I have to do.</p><p>It\u2019s time for me to go home. I have to go to the one place I know Arlo will visit, so he can take me back.</p><p>I can\u2019t continue on like this. I\u2019m not human. I\u2019m just residing in the shell of what represents one, and no matter how much I may want to be human. I never will be.</p><p>It was a really nice dream to have whilst it lasted, but now it\u2019s time to let go \u2013 let him go.</p> <p>The pain tightens around me, confining me to it, and I know this is how I will always feel from now on, so I had better get used to it.</p><p>The night sky is casting its shadows across James\u2019 beautiful creations.</p><p>I usually love the night, the glowing moon, the twinkling stars, but now it just seems so black, so bleak \u2013 so utterly, compellingly depressing, and I fit right in to it like the missing piece of a puzzle.</p><p>I gaze at the spot where James first kissed me.</p><p>I close my eyes and let the memory blanket me, remembering exactly how his lips felt on mine, how his touch warmed and fired inside me, how one smile on his lips sent every particle of me into a complete frenzy and how, when I was with him, when he was near, he was all I knew, was all that mattered.</p><p>From the very first moment I saw James, he changed me irreversibly, turned me from an empty shell, into something more. He made me someone, someone that mattered \u2013 for a time.</p><p>Nothing will ever be the same again and I don\u2019t regret one second of it.</p><p>I can\u2019t even begin to think about how much I\u2019m going to miss him, and no matter how much this is crushing me, I know it\u2019s time for me to go.</p> <p>I force my feet to move, and turn to see James lent up in the doorway, watching me.</p><p>I falter at the sight of him. \u201cI \u2013 I thought you weren\u2019t coming back,\u201d I stammer. My voice sounds hoarse like it hasn\u2019t been used for days.</p><p>\u201cWell I do live here,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI had to come back sometime.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing, feeling foolish.</p><p>We stand in silence just looking at one another. He looks exhausted. I debate with myself whether I should just leave but now, faced with him, I can bring myself to move.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I finally ask, even though I know have no right to.</p><p>\u201cSat in the work van across the road.\u201d He laughs self-mockingly, tapping the pot on his leg. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get very far with this thing on.\u201d</p><p>Across the road in his van. Why didn\u2019t I even consider that he hadn\u2019t gone far, that he couldn\u2019t? I feel like kicking myself.</p><p>\u201cJames, I want to say I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 for everything \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the truth,\u201d he cuts me off. \u201cAre you absolutely one hundred percent telling me the fucking truth?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He regards me for a moment, eyes intense on mine.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you,\u201d I say, knowing my words are as feeble as my voice sounds.</p><p>He rubs his hands over this face, and sighs. \u201cI\u2019ve been going over, and over this in my mind and I just can\u2019t get my head round it. It\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 really fucking surreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how hard it must be for you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snap up at me. \u201cDo you? Do you really? Because honestly, I don\u2019t think you even comprehend just how big a fucking bombshell this is to drop on me, especially after everything we talked about, after everything we\u2019ve said to one another.\u201d He closes his eyes, pinches the bridge of his nose and takes a deep breath.</p><p>My eyes start to sting.</p><p>\u201cI have some questions,\u201d he states calmly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say nervously, unsure as just what to expect.</p><p>He crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cYou said you were with my dad after he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he \u2013 is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s fine.\u201d I wipe away a stray tear. \u201cHe loves you a lot, you\u2019re the most important thing in the world to him, and he just wants you to be happy. He stayed there with you, James, in the hospital room, for as long as he could, until it was time for him to go.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. It\u2019s a long moment before he speaks again. \u201cAnd the night of the crash, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there when you actually crashed, I arrived just afterwards. I mean I didn\u2019t know it was you until it had already happened, that\u2019s how it works \u2013 we don\u2019t receive the name of the hu\u2013person we\u2019re to go to until a few minutes before they\u2019re, well \u2013 before they\u2019re supposed to die. But I had to save you. I couldn\u2019t just leave you to die. And, like I said earlier, I somehow took on this human like form and pulled you from your car, and I have remained the same ever since, not returning to how I was before. And . . . the rest you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018human like form\u2019 what exactly do you mean?\u201d His questioning stare is staid fixed on me.</p><p>I look down, feeling unnerved. \u201cI mean I\u2019m here, I\u2019m me, I look just like I did to others of my kind \u2013 I think. But whilst my body looks human, essentially I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t \u2013 can\u2019t sleep, or breathe, or eat. I don\u2019t have a \u2013 heartbeat.\u201d I cringe as I say those words. \u201cI\u2019m not mortal like you are. I don\u2019t need those things to sustain myself.\u201d I glance up at him. His eyes are still on me, unmoving.</p><p>\u201cBut all those things aside,\u201d I add quietly, \u201cI feel human. I mean I have feelings like you do. I can touch things, and be touched, and feel all the sensations that brings \u2013\u201d I tail off.</p><p>He says nothing. Just continues to stare at me, an unfathomable expression on his face.</p><p>I feel awkward, unsure what to do. And even though we're only a few feet apart, the space dividing us feels heavy and fraught, like a deep dark chasm that\u2019s pulling me in.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>His expression goes blank. \u201cWhat do mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean should I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d I cry. Tears once again prick at my eyes. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do or say \u2013 what I can do or say to make this better. You tell me and I\u2019ll do it. If you want me to leave, then I will. I just want you to be happy, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. And if my leaving will do that, then I\u2019ll go.\u201d I look around the empty space surrounding me, needing support, needing something to cling to, so I cling to the only thing I can \u2013 myself.</p><p>For a moment James just stares at the ground, then he looks up at me and shakes his head.</p><p>I shrug, exasperated. \u201cNo? No \u2013 you don\u2019t want me here, or no \u2013 you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck's sake!\u201d He slams his hand on the door frame, and looks away angrily. I daren\u2019t speak for fear of reprisal, and just like that I\u2019ve had enough. So I make the decision for him but he\u2019s blocking my exit.</p><p>I walk toward him, gesturing for him to move, but he doesn\u2019t. He stands there, his stare intense.</p><p>I\u2019m instantly weakened but I hold my nerve. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask again, my voice filling up the silence surrounding us.</p><p>His eyes move to my lips. My whole body starts to tremble.</p><p>He moves closer to me and puts his hands around my face, cradling it. I can feel the heat from his body flowing straight into mine and it\u2019s like the entire world has shrunk down to this one moment.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he simply utters. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019s kissing me, and this kiss feels different, more intense. Everything seems magnified. I\u2019m aware of absolutely everything. Every single subtle move he makes.</p><p>He pulls me into the house, us stumbling awkwardly, but not once do his lips leave mine. He backs me up against the kitchen table and effortlessly lifts me onto it as if I\u2019m made of air, and places himself between my legs. Then his mouth moves from mine, to my neck, his tongue searching over my skin, then he\u2019s kissing me again. His hands run down my back. My entire body\u2019s aching for him.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I pull back in shock. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicker and flame as he traces my lower lip with his finger. \u201cHow could I not.\u201d</p><p>His lips are on mine again and we\u2019re kissing intensely. His touch becomes more urgent, frenzied. He pulls me closer. His hips are pressing hard into mine.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he says hungrily into my ear and, for the first time, I can honestly say I\u2019m hungry too.</p><p>\u201cI want you, James.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need a second invitation. He pushes my skirt up. I pull his t-shirt over his head, only breaking from our kiss to do so. My hands roam his smooth firm chest, the contours of his muscles defined with every movement he makes.</p><p>Everything about this is right. He loves me. I love him. And nothing else matters.</p><p>I trace my fingers over his stomach. A low groan emits from deep within him. I reach down to unbutton his jeans. He kisses me harder.</p><p>I want him so much. I feel like I\u2019ve spent an eternity waiting for him, waiting for this, and I don\u2019t want to wait a moment longer.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the window starts to rattle.</p><p>James stops, startled, and glances around the kitchen. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I look around. The whole room is vibrating now. A glass falls off the kitchen surface smashing loudly against the hard floor.</p><p>Then I feel it.</p><p>Something\u2019s forcing its way into my body and it\u2019s painful, really painful. I cry out.</p><p>James\u2019s wide eyes are on me. He looks afraid. \u201cLuce?\u201d He takes a step back.</p><p>I follow his stare, looking down at my body.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>I\u2019m changing. I\u2019m losing solid form. I can see a sparkle beginning to escape from me. I\u2019m going back to how I used to be. They\u2019ve found me. They\u2019re taking me home.</p><p>Panic stricken, I look back up at James. His eyes are on full alert.</p><p>\u201cLuce . . . what\u2019s happening?\u201d he says voice shaky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve found me.\u201d I sob.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s found you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Elders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy family. They\u2019re taking me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He reaches for me as I do him but our hands pass right through one another\u2019s. \u201cNo Luce! I can\u2019t lose you!\u201d The fear as evident in his voice as it is on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His hands are in his hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d His voice breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. I can\u2019t say goodbye to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t say goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay what, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I\u2019ll find a way back to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes on his face, ensuring he\u2019s the last thing I see.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m in a meadow, the grass green and lush beneath my old sparkly feet. But it\u2019s not home.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Lucyna.\u201d I hear a voice I know so well come from behind me.</p><p>I spin around, startled. \u201cArlo?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>No Going Back</p><p>Arlo stands before me, looking just as glorious as the last time I remember seeing him.</p><p>\u201cArlo,\u201d I repeat, this time more insistently. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where are we? Where are the Elders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d he says voice cold, detached. \u201cThe Elders sent me to retrieve you from Earth to inform you that you are no longer allowed back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>His words sting me. He sounds so cold. So . . . inhuman. I know this is just his way but that knowledge doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less.</p><p>Then I realise this is how I used to sound, how I used to come across to all those suffering humans, all of those who were drowning in their grief and loss. And I instantly feel glad that I\u2019ve changed to who I now am. But then the reality of his words hit me, pulling me right back down with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m banished?\u201d I stare at him, troubled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nods formally, setting his golden hair shimmering around his face.</p><p>Banished.</p><p>I never even considered the possibility. Obviously I knew there would be consequences to my actions, but I was expecting an eternity stuck in Pure Land being kept away from all humans, being kept away from James. But never for a moment did I think they would banish me.</p><p>And suddenly I feel very alone.</p><p>I look into is bright green eyes. \u201cWhy are you here telling me this? Why not one of the Elders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did not wish to see you,\u201d he says holding my stare. \u201cThey requested I come to inform you. You are advised that you will still exist as you are, but you are no longer a Bringer or granted access to Pure Land. The privilege has been taken from you. It was taken the moment you chose to save the humans life.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I feel very angry. I straighten myself up. \u201cWhy did you bring me here to tell me this?\u201d I gesture around, wondering just exactly where it is I am. \u201cWhy not tell me on earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told not to leave you on earth in your prior state. I had to bring you back to your true form so you could see me.\u201d He holds his hands together in front of him. \u201cIt has taken us some time to find you, Lucyna. There was no trace of your essence once you\u2019d changed.\u201d</p><p>Then I ask him the question I have pained over since it happened. \u201cHow did I change?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cWe are not sure.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a long moment before either of us speaks. Then I say in a small voice, \u201cSo I can never again go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s it \u2013 final. The end of everything I know.</p><p>I\u2019m panicked. I feel like I\u2019m freefalling into a giant black hole. I have no home. What am I going to do? It\u2019s one thing to not want to go back, but another thing entirely to have the choice taken from me.</p><p>And then it hits me. Why am I even concerned with this? I can finally have what I want; I can return to earth and be with James. Of course I will miss Pure Land, miss being a Bringer. But really what did that hold for me anyway? Just a sterile, cold, empty existence.</p><p>I think of James at home stood there in the kitchen and the sense of urgency I now feel for him relinquishes any other thoughts I could have, and there\u2019s only one thing left for me to say.</p><p>\u201cI want to go back to earth, Arlo,\u201d I state boldly. \u201cChange me back to whatever I was before and send me back.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly to me, his brow furrows and a look of unease sweeps his face. His action not tying in with who he is \u2013 what he is.</p><p>\u201cArlo?\u201d I look at him confused.</p><p>He presses his lips together and smiles gently. \u201cLucyna,\u201d he says voice suddenly sounding harmonious and caressing, like a melodic song, no longer cold and hard. \u201cI had always hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this.\u201d He spreads his palms out. \u201cI had hoped to somehow spare you all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat \u2013 what are you talking about?\u201d I\u2019m well aware of how shaky my voice sounds but I\u2019m not currently in a position to be able to disguise it.</p><p>He closes his eyes briefly whilst drumming his fingertips on his forehead. \u201cThere are some things you need to know before you make any decisions about where you want to be . . . and who you want to be with.\u201d</p><p>My head is swimming with thoughts, questions. Disquiet bathes me and I instantly feel the need to get out of here because one thing I am absolutely certain of is that something is very wrong.</p><p>I take a step back, increasing the distance between us.</p><p>He smiles gently. \u201cLucyna, I\u2019m only here to help you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any help,\u201d I cut him off, trying to project sternness into my weak voice, attempting to make my intentions clear, even though all I feel is edgy and worried. \u201cI just want to go to earth and be with James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand how you\u2019re feeling,\u201d he says softly, fingering the lapel on his black jacket.</p><p>My eyes narrow onto him. \u201cAnd just exactly how would you understand what I\u2019m feeling, Arlo?\u201d</p><p>He brushes his hair back, and stares at me with eyes full of regret. \u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m having a weirdly vivid sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu here, this being not too dissimilar to my conversation with James, except now it\u2019s me on the receiving end.</p><p>I can feel nerves creeping over me, so I steel myself. \u201cAnd just who exactly are you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak for what seems like a long time but, in reality, it\u2019s probably only a matter of seconds. Anxiety quickly fills me up, and just when I don\u2019t think I stand the silence anymore, he speaks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Bringer,\u201d he says voice firm, sure. \u201cI\u2019m an angel.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen with disbelief.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re an \u2013 angel?\u201d I feel totally blind-sided. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. You can\u2019t be. We don\u2019t mix, angels and Bringers don\u2019t mix. We never cross paths, never . . . and you\u2019ve always been with me in Pure Land, with me . . .\u201d My weak voice peters off.</p><p>Arlo sweeps his hand behind him, manifesting a bench. He sits down on it and motions for me to join him.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay where I am.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fill with sorrow and I feel a huge twinge of guilt, obviously not enough to encourage me to move because I stay right where I am.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to begin,\u201d he says dolefully.</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cThe beginning is usually a good place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could take me a while,\u201d he chuckles softly, quickly drying up when he sees the unrelenting look of impatience on my face.</p><p>He leans forward, arms on thighs and gazes up at me. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a Bringer. I just made myself appear as one. I did it so I could be with you. I needed to be there to watch over you and that was the only way.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, I tense up. \u201cAnd why did you need to watch over me?\u201d</p><p>He presses his hands together, palm to palm. \u201cLucyna, you have what you could call . . . a complicated past and I don\u2019t really know how to tell you all of it without \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get to the point, Arlo\u201d I hiss, surprising myself at how incredibly harsh I sound. And I can tell he\u2019s surprised too, by the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks calmly. \u201cAre you sure want to know everything?\u201d</p><p>His green eyes are fixed onto mine and I don\u2019t look away, can\u2019t look away. It\u2019s like we\u2019re locked in a game of truth or dare, and the first to look away is the loser.</p><p>I hold myself firm. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though there may be things you would rather not hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I gesticulate, impatiently. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He spreads his hands out and rests back against the bench. \u201cYou used be an angel.\u201d</p><p>If I thought I\u2019d been blind-sided before, this definitely champions it.</p><p>\u201cI was an angel?\u201d I can barely get the words out.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYes. We were close friends. And for a very long time we resided together in Heaven, with all the other angels, of course.\u201d He glances at me knowingly before continuing, \u201cAnd there are many of us, Lucyna. Mainly we are of God's initial creation, but sometimes a lower being will have served for the greater good and be given the privilege to rise up and be anointed as one of us. It does not happen often and when it does it is truly an honour of the highest degree.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where Arran comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Arran?\u201d I manage to ask, even though my mind is such a jumble of thoughts I can barely focus.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the angel you were in love with \u2013 and he loved you too, for a time,\u201d he adds, seemingly oblivious to my internal affliction. \u201cOr so we believed, but unfortunately, unbeknown to the rest of us \u2013 to you \u2013 Arran was unlawfully revealing himself to humans whilst on earth, well only one actually, a human woman \u2013\u201d His eyes flick to meet mine. \u201cIt happens, immortals falling in love with mortals. It\u2019s rare but not impossible, as Arran proved \u2013 and as you well know.\u201d He gives me a pointed look.</p><p>I instantly feel ashamed and very uncomfortable. I look down, away from his enervating stare.</p><p>\u201cThen one day, without warning, Arran told you he was leaving you, leaving Heaven. That he had fallen in love with this human and he was leaving to be with her.\u201d I look up, instantly meeting his solemn green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were devastated, Lucyna,\u201d he adds.</p><p>I sink to the floor, suddenly feeling very weighed down. When I look up, Arlo is sitting there in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to talk him out of leaving,\u201d he continues, his voice speeding up, \u201cbut nothing could change his mind. And to place cruelty upon cruel, he made the wish on you, forcing you to make him mortal and send him to earth so he could be with his human. As angels, Lucyna, when a wish is placed upon us we have no choice other than to fulfil it \u2013 and you fulfilled his wish. It destroyed you to do so . . . and he knew that.\u201d His eyes seek mine, locking onto them. He holds my gaze, projecting as much warmth as he can until I feel like I\u2019m literally coated in it. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the same after that day. It was almost as if something inside you had died.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel numb. I bring my knee up to my chest and wrap my arms around it. I feel like I\u2019m listening to someone else\u2019s story . . . which to me I am . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I remember any of this?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he looks caught off guard, but then he calmly says, \u201cI took your memories away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d My voice hitches up a couple of octaves.</p> <p>His eyes harden and focus off somewhere else, as though he\u2019s seeing another time, another place. \u201cI only did what you asked of me,\u201d he says, his voice slightly raised. \u201cYou told me you couldn\u2019t bear the pain of losing Arran and you wanted me to take it away. You said you wanted me to erase your memory, remove everything and make you a Bringer so you would never again have to feel. I tried to reason with you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen. I told you I wouldn\u2019t do it, so you took it out of my hands and you wished it on me.\u201d His hard eyes refocus back onto mine, sending a chill shivering through me. \u201cYou did to me what he\u2019d done to you.\u201d</p><p>His face is suffused with anger and, even though I know nothing of what I\u2019ve done, I still find myself looking away, guiltily.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you did that,\u201d he adds, a touch bitterly, \u201cit was out of my hands, there was nothing I could do other than to fulfil it. So I erased your memories, turned you into a Bringer, and took you to Pure Land.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNot my finest hour but, like I said, not my choice either.\u201d</p><p>I pull my other leg up to my chest and rest my head on my knees, avoiding his stare and gaze out at the grassy meadow that seems to roll on endlessly.</p><p>Everything is upside down and I have no idea what to think about first.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just leave you there, though,\u201d he says, his voice suddenly soft but so very intense, \u201cno matter how angry I was with you.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s the intensity in his tone that makes me look up at him.</p><p>He moves closer to me and takes hold of my hand, staring down at it. And I instantly realise this is the first time Arlo has ever touched me. I follow his gaze, no longer seeing what he sees, now only seeing my old sparkly self. My ability to feel his touch no longer there, back to the old desolate way I used to be. And all I feel inside is complete and utter sadness, mourning the loss of what I so briefly had.</p><p>\u201cYou were my friend, Lucyna.\u201d He sounds determined. \u201cI had to do something, so I did the only thing I could and I stayed there with you in Pure Land and passed myself off as a Bringer too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly struck with a thought. I look up at him. \u201cHow did the Elders not know you weren\u2019t a Bringer. They must have sensed you were an angel \u2013 and for that matter, why didn\u2019t they question my sudden appearance?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, a very regal smile, straightening his back as he does so. \u201cI am an angel, Lucyna\u201d he says in a condescending tone. \u201cA higher being. We have great powers at our disposal. I can make myself appear as I wish.\u201d He sweeps his hand down himself with a flourish. \u201cMake anything appear as I wish. Neither the Elders, nor any of the Bringers, would have ever questioned our appearance because, to them, we had always been there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd just how long have we been there?\u201d</p><p>He bows his head. \u201cThree hundred years . . . and it was three hundred years of plain sailing. I didn\u2019t even see what was happening to you until it was too late. I never saw it possible that he would come back into your life and \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArran?\u201d I say with confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand? When did he come back?\u201d</p><p>He keeps his sorrowful, green eyes fixed on my blue ones. \u201cJames is Arran.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m fairly positive that for a moment, time actually stops as his words resonate through me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Arran\u2019s soul that resides in James\u2019 body. He just doesn\u2019t know it \u2013 doesn\u2019t know who he used to be.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand from his, ignoring the look of hurt on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I repeat, voice trembling.</p><p>He sits back, resting on his hands. \u201cWhen Arran eventually died in his mortal body all those years ago, he couldn\u2019t gain access to Heaven as a normal human soul would because his soul was cast as an angel \u2013 he may have had a mortal body but his soul will always remain the same. That\u2019s something only God has the power to change. And when Arran decided to abandon us, abandon Heaven, it meant he could never again access it.\u201d He presses his hand to his chest. \u201cSo each time his mortal body dies, he is instantly reborn into another, he can\u2019t just be left to wander earth as a soul. It\u2019s been this way for the last three hundred years and he will continue to do so for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>I sit in shock, struggling to comprehend what I\u2019m hearing, unwittingly watching Arlo as runs his hand over his hair, mesmerised by the efficiency of his movement, following it until it finally finishes its journey resting back in his lap.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re saying James knows nothing of this?\u201d I ask not moving my stare, my voice sounding as empty as I feel.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHe has no idea. Arran\u2019s soul only reawakens at the point of death, but as soon as he\u2019s reborn he instantly forgets. That is how all rebirths work, even for human souls . . . well except they come to Heaven before rebirth.\u201d He lifts a hand and unbuttons his jacket. \u201cAnd for the last three hundred years your paths have never crossed. And, as I incorrectly assumed, why would they ever? Out of all the soon-to-be seven billion humans on earth, it was very unlikely that you would ever meet. Well, currently, it would have been a . . . one in, six point eight billion chance to one, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>My head is buzzing with all this information. It\u2019s just too much. It can\u2019t be true. I don\u2019t want to listen to this anymore.</p><p>I jump to my feet. Arlo looks up at me startled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d I say resolutely, admonishing him with my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any of this.\u201d</p><p>He looks stricken. \u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d I say bitterly. \u201cApparently you\u2019ve been lying to me for the last three hundred years so . . .\u201d</p><p>Anger skims his brow and he lithely gets to his feet. \u201cRight. Fine,\u201d he says in a controlled voice, re-buttoning his jacket. \u201cYou can just see it for yourself then.\u201d</p><p>He starts to move toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say, holding my hand up, taking a big step back.</p><p>He laughs softly, shaking his head. \u201cCalm down, Lucyna. I just meant I\u2019ll return your memories to you, then you\u2019ll know the truth for yourself. I can also return you to your angelic form if you wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me as though I\u2019ve just asked the most stupid question ever. \u201cOf course I can. All you have to do is wish it and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs easy as that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs. Easy. As. That,\u201d he affirms.</p><p>I think quickly. If what Arlo is saying is true, then is this what I want? Do I really want to know who I used to be? I must have been in an inordinate amount of pain to want to forget it and never feel again.</p><p>But then that also means I\u2019ve spent the last three hundred years hiding from who I truly am.</p><p>I look at Arlo. He has his arms folded across his chest and the impatience is clearly stamped on his face.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hide anymore.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say tentatively. \u201cChange me back and return my memories, Arlo. I wish it so.\u201d</p><p>He comes over to me until we\u2019re a breadth apart, and cups my face with his hands. \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he instructs.</p><p>I do as I'm told.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel anything for a long moment \u2013 then I suddenly feel it.</p><p>My head is all warmth and fuzziness, my whole body tingling, and then a white noise rushes through my mind, filling every crevice. Doors that were once sealed shut are now opening, the memories flooding back to their rightful place.</p><p>Scenes begin to flash through my mind like an old movie, and I have to work quickly to catch hold of them.</p><p>Mainly I see Arran. His face fills out my mind. The lazy smile he used to wear on his lips, his light brown hair that always fell messily around his face, his dark, penetrating eyes . . . and that\u2019s when I see James. It\u2019s the eyes. They have the same eyes . . .</p><p>I can hear Arran\u2019s soothing voice so clearly, it\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s standing here before me now, telling me he loves me and he will until time ceases to exist. I remember how happy I was. Then I feel it, the pain I felt the exact moment he told me he was leaving me for her. Oh God, it hurts . . . it hurts so much \u2013 too much.</p><p>I feel desolate, alone, wretched. It\u2019s like I\u2019m been crushed by it.</p><p>I see it all. I remember it all.</p><p>\u201cLucyna.\u201d I open my eyes to a very concerned Arlo, his hands gripping my arms, us both sitting on the floor. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cOf course you\u2019re not. I should have known this would be too much for you to take all at once.\u201d</p><p>I stare blankly at him, wincing as the memories continue to wash over me like a tidal wave. The pain is so raw, it\u2019s like a darkness taking me over.</p><p>\u201cSay something, Lucyna. Please.\u201d</p><p>I steel myself, seeing how worried he is, and force myself to speak. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say.</p><p>He moves to sit beside me and puts his arm around me, pulling me to him. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take. I should have warned you how overwhelmed you\u2019d feel, especially with the memories I\u2019d concealed. Even though they are hundreds of years old, right now, to you, they\u2019ll feel fresh. They\u2019ll very quickly dull, I promise you.\u201d He sounds so sure, so confident and I want to believe him.</p><p>I lean into him, needing comfort. Then I notice my body. I look just as I did when I was on earth. No more sparkle, just creamy white skin. I should be elated at the sight, but nothing can overtake this pain I feel.</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d he says sorrowfully. \u201cI should have handled this better. I shouldn\u2019t have just given you your memories back like that.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at him and he regards me warmly, his green eyes gazing down at me. But for some reason I find myself shifting back slightly, away from him. If it bothers him, he doesn\u2019t show it.</p><p>\u201cNo, Arlo, I asked you to do this. None of this is your fault. I\u2019m the only one at fault here.\u201d I look down at my hands, feeling like I barely know myself anymore \u2013 which is odd considering the barrage of memories I\u2019ve just received back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says sternly. \u201cThe only one ever at fault was Arran.\u201d</p><p>I can see it so clearly now. I can now see why I was instantly drawn to James, why my feelings returned the moment I met him. My memories may have been buried, but my love was just hiding, waiting for his return. James and Arran may look and be different in so many ways, but the eyes clearly show they are one in the same person. The same dark, unfathomable pools I fell in love with all those centuries ago. And now, here I am, once again in love, once again in unimaginable pain.</p><p>\u201cLucyna?\u201d Arlo squeezes my hand. I can hear the concern lacing his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Really,\u201d I add, seeing the look of doubt on his face. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to process everything.\u201d</p><p>He reaches his hand up and brushes my hair back. I quash my instant urge to move away, not understanding why I feel the need to do so.</p><p>Arlo is my friend, the only one who has cared for me unconditionally. It must be because I\u2019m not used to him touching me, especially not in such a caring manner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for doubting you, Arlo,\u201d I say sincerely. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for everything I\u2019ve put you through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is. You\u2019ve done everything I have asked of you. You\u2019ve cared for me even when I didn\u2019t know it. I can never thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>He smiles warmly, then his face turns serious. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He looks past me. \u201cWell do you still want to go back to earth . . . back to James?\u201d he asks the latter part in quieter voice.</p> <p>I shift uncomfortably as a wave of anger pulses through me at the mention of his name. I never knew I could feel such furore, especially not in relation to him. But it\u2019s the thought of what Arran did to me that\u2019s spurring it on, the thought of seeing those eyes again. James and Arran are melding together in my mind, and there is not a thing I can do to stop it. That\u2019s when I know there\u2019s no going back.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t ever want to go back there,\u201d I say vehemently, surprising myself at just the level of resentment in my voice. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can . . . well you can stay here \u2013 if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whereabouts is here?\u201d I ask distractedly.</p><p>\u201cShangri-La\u201d</p><p>I look at him and laugh. He\u2019s certainly got my attention now. \u201cArlo, be serious. Where are we really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShangri-La,\u201d he says again, stressing the words to really drive his point home.</p><p>\u201cBut Shangri-la doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d I say pedantically. \u201cIt\u2019s just a myth, invented by a human, a supposed realm for immortals. And if it did exist, then surely I would have known . . .\u201d I peter off at his steady expression.</p><p>\u201cIt very much does exist,\u201d he grins, waving his hand around. \u201cBut only a chosen few know about it, know how to access it.\u201d He winks at me.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you know?\u201d I ask, still feeling sceptical. \u201cWhy are you one of the chosen few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m special,\u201d he chuckles and taps his nose with his long pale finger. \u201cIt really is a beautiful place. It will make a great home for us both \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs both?\u201d I say with open surprise.</p><p>His green eyes sparkle at me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was going to leave you alone here did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I didn\u2019t expect \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t expect, Lucyna,\u201d He smiles. \u201cbut I have already spent forever with you. I\u2019m not about to ditch you now.\u201d He rises to stand and holds his hand out for me to take.</p><p>I waver, again not knowing why. All I do know is there\u2019s a reluctance coming from deep inside of me.</p><p>\u201cUnless you don\u2019t want me to stay with you?\u201d he adds, looking shyly down, his golden hair partly obscuring his perfectly sculptured face.</p><p>I look up at him, my only true friend, all I have left, and I brush my stupid hesitation aside. I smile brightly. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d I say, clasping hold of his hand, allowing him to pull me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great,\u201d he says happily, leading me along by my hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be just like old times . . .\u201d</p><p>I continue to smile, pretending to listen as he talks on, but I can\u2019t concentrate because right now all I can see in my mind are those eyes, those dark brown eyes.</p><p>And I know I\u2019m doing the right thing by staying here but that doesn\u2019t stop the hurt and regret from steadily flowing through me like a poison.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Guises</p><p>It hasn\u2019t worked.</p><p>All the pretending I\u2019m okay, all the ignoring my pain.</p><p>No, it hasn\u2019t worked, not one single iota.</p><p>Arlo was very wrong when he said the pain would dull. It hasn\u2019t. Not in the slightest.</p><p>If it\u2019s at all possible, I\u2019m actually even more miserable than I was the day I got my memories back. Which was what . . . two weeks ago, give or take a day or two? Time has become pretty irrelevant whilst I\u2019ve been here.</p><p>For all I think about every single second, of every long day, is him.</p><p>And even though I may appear to the outside world \u2013 well Arlo as he\u2019s the only one I see \u2013 that I\u2019m happy, with not a care or concern, the truth is I\u2019m unhappy, sad, forlorn, mournful, afflicted and all of those things combined in one, to create the ultimate, most wretched misery you could ever imagine, that horrific it makes me want to hide away and lick my wounds for all eternity to come.</p><p>I wear this happy guise because I\u2019d thought by doing so, by pretending I was okay, that it would somehow make it true . . . only it\u2019s not really working out that way. It was always going to be impossible for me to forget when the luggage of my past was hot on my trail.</p><p>And I can\u2019t tell whether the misery I feel is solely because of the pain Arran caused me all that time ago or because I miss James so much that been away from him is starting to cause me what can only be described as actual physical pain.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what to do, well except for to continue on as I am. Which isn\u2019t looking too promising, all things considered.</p><p>I can quite clearly see why I had Arlo wipe my memories and change me all those years ago. I\u2019d be tempted to ask him to do it again, if I didn\u2019t think that\u2019d be the final straw for him when it comes to me.</p><p>I look up at the bright blue sky, watching it wink down at me through the green leaves that sit high above, the hammock I\u2019m laid on swaying gently in line with the warm breeze. Then, without warning, an image of James kissing me flickers through my mind, the sight so clear, so intense, I feel like I\u2019m going to explode from the agony that accompanies it. I clutch my arms across my chest, hoping to somehow compress the pain.</p><p>I miss him. So much. Too much.</p><p>My minds starts to drift, remembering the way he would touch me, kiss me, his smell, his laugh . . . his infectious laugh. I wonder what he\u2019s doing right now . . . if he misses me . . .</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>I made the decision to stay away and I have to stick to it. Going back to James would ultimately only lead me straight back to hurt. That\u2019s what Arlo says, and he\u2019s right, I think.</p><p>James is Arran. James is Arran. James is Arran.</p><p>I sit up in the hammock, swinging my legs over the edge and try to block my mind from my memories. Then an image of purple asters, just like the ones from James\u2019 garden, appears in my mind. I open my eyes up to see hundreds of them all sprouting out of the ground before me. Great, now I\u2019m manifesting without even meaning to.</p><p>What was it he said they stood for . . . a symbol of love and patience?</p><p>And that\u2019s when I know it\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t go on like this.</p><p>I love him, I miss him and there\u2019s not a single thing I can do about it.</p><p>What\u2019s the point of being here wallowing in eternal misery, hiding myself away from love, when if I just give myself up to it, even with all the risks that accompany it, at least I\u2019d finally be living, even if only for a short time.</p><p>What is life without love? A hollow empty existence and haven\u2019t I already done that one for long enough.</p><p>James isn\u2019t Arran, he\u2019s simply James, and he\u2019s who I want to be with. I have to go back. . . . no I want to go back.</p><p>Now I just have to find a way to tell Arlo.</p><p>I start, when I look up and see him walking toward me. Well I suppose now is a good a time as any . . .</p><p>\u201cAsters . . . nice.\u201d He nods down at them. \u201cI was looking for you. I\u2019ve got something to show you.\u201d He turns and starts walk away as though it\u2019s a given I\u2019ll follow him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Arlo, wait . . . I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He stops and turns back to me, a sudden curiosity stamped on his face.</p><p>I glance down at the trampled asters he\u2019s just waded through, stalling, feeling fearful for what I have to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asks quietly, slowly. The disappointment evident in his voice.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I utter, sounding as guilty as I feel.</p><p>He says nothing, just glares at me, a look so icy it cuts right through me, a silence so strong it\u2019s practically deafening.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about everything he\u2019s done to you?\u201d he asks stonily.</p><p>I curl my fingers around the thick edge of the netting and shake my head, unable to meet his eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t James that hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He grips his head, frustrated. \u201cJames is Arran, what do you not understand about that? And we all know what Arran was, what he did, what he was capable of.\u201d He sounds so condescending, so belligerent, that it enrages me.</p><p>I jump to my feet. \u201cWhat Arran did!\u201d I expostulate. \u201cNot James. He doesn\u2019t know any of this. Nothing of who he was, what he did.\u201d</p><p>I so desperately want him to understand my decision, understand how I feel. I want him to be okay with it.</p><p>He turns and walks away from me and for a moment I think, that\u2019s it, argument over, but then he turns back.</p><p>\u201cJames is Arran, Lucyna, irrespective of what you may say or want to believe. He might not know it, but he is. It\u2019s in him to hurt you again. And he will, trust me. If you go back to him, it\u2019ll only be a matter of time . . . and do you really want to go through all of that again?\u201d</p><p>I sit back down on the hammock. \u201cNo, but \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no buts when it comes to him, Lucyna. You know this better than anyone.\u201d He comes and sits beside me. \u201cI only want what\u2019s best for you,\u201d he says gently, looking sideways at me with his vivid green eyes. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. You\u2019re better off here with me where it\u2019s safe, where he can never hurt you again.\u201d He reaches over and pats my hand.</p><p>I can feel myself weakening to his words. I close my eyes and count to ten. Then I open them back up.</p><p>\u201cI know you want what\u2019s best for me, but he is what\u2019s best for me. I know you don\u2019t understand that but I want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>He stiffens beside me, then abruptly stands, and when he finally looks down at me, I see a rage in his eyes so fierce it actually unnerves me.</p><p>\u201cAfter everything I have done for you!\u201d he suddenly bellows, his voice so thunderous it startles me. \u201cAnd this is how you choose to repay me! By throwing it back in my face and returning to him. He destroyed you, Lucyna, made you so completely miserable you felt that you had no other choice than to change who you were so you wouldn\u2019t have to feel the pain that he left you with.\u201d</p><p>I scream. I actually scream.</p><p>Arlo looks visibly shocked and I know how he feels. Even now, I sometimes have no idea where some of these emotions come from.</p><p>I get to my feet. \u201cI will not have this argument with you, Arlo. I\u2019ll do as I wish.\u201d I know how petulant I sound but I can\u2019t help it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut look at what happened to you because of him,\u201d he says scornfully. \u201cYou chose to become a Bringer, of all things, because of him.\u201d And the disdain in his voice shocks me, which I think is plain enough on my face, as he very quickly changes his demeanour.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says urgently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded. I just meant that he\u2019d changed you and not for the better. You know this yourself.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest and, feeling as sure as I look, say, \u201cArran may have changed me, but James brought me back to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about me?\u201d he remonstrates. \u201cMe. The one who has cared for you, done everything for you. I\u2019ve never hurt you . . . never abandoned you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say softly, quickly changing my tone, \u201cand I am, and will always be, eternally grateful to you, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I want to be with him. I can\u2019t just stay here with you out of some misplaced sense of loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so I\u2019m not quite sure why I just said that and, honestly, that sounded a lot better in my head. But it\u2019s too late now, I can\u2019t take it back.</p><p>His face hardens. \u201cSo go, then,\u201d he says, his voice devoid of feeling, and turns away from me.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d I cringe as I say the words but know I have no other choice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve helped you enough?\u201d he says this without turning around.</p> <p>\u201cI know you have, and I wouldn\u2019t ask if I had any other choice . . . if there was any other way.\u201d</p><p>He turns around, and folds his arms across his chest. \u201cAnd just what is it you now require of me?\u201d</p><p>He knows exactly what I need, he\u2019s not stupid \u2013 he\u2019s just going to make me say it out loud.</p><p>I hold my nerve. \u201cI need you to make me human and send me to earth.\u201d</p><p>He unfolds his arms and laughs hollowly. \u201cAnd why would I do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>I stare calmly into his bright green eyes. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p> <p>He seems to falter but then he shakes his head resolutely. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Arlo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I look at him steadily. \u201cDon\u2019t make me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t . . .\u201d He frowns. \u201cPlease, Lucyna, don\u2019t make me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re giving me no other choice!\u201d I suddenly yell.</p><p>\u201cYou have another choice!\u201d he yells back, angrily shaking his head.</p><p>We glare at each other for a long moment.</p> <p>He pushes his hands through is golden hair. \u201cJust stay here, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to be with James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are being idiotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d I shrug, \u201cbut I love him.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me fiercely. \u201cIf you place this wish on me, then you will be on your own, Lucyna.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the edge of the hammock.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to lose Arlo and I really don\u2019t want to hurt him, but I can\u2019t just stay here with him out of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you but \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish it,\u201d he says cutting me off, voice hard, eyes like slits.</p><p>I brace myself, gripping my fingers into the netting and lift my head high. \u201cI wish to be human and for you to send me to earth.\u201d</p><p>He glances down to the ground, and when he looks back up his eyes are different. Yellow. Bright yellow.</p><p>I feel a beat of alarm. Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Then everything seems to slip into slow motion.</p><p>My eyes move downwards to see all the asters surrounding me have all withered and died. The sky suddenly pulls in dark. And then Arlo utters those immortal words, and I know it\u2019s too late.</p><p>The next thing \u2013 pain, such pain. It\u2019s excruciating. I\u2019m screaming. I know I am, I can hear it clear in my mind, but there\u2019s no sound coming. Just nothing. Blackness. Total and utter black, surrounding me everywhere.</p><p>I\u2019m falling. Fast and hard.</p><p>Then -</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Forgotten</p><p>Oww, my head hurts. Really hurts. It\u2019s practically throbbing off my shoulders.</p><p>I\u2019m aching all over and my mouth is parched. I\u2019m so thirsty. I feel like I haven\u2019t had a drink in, well \u2013 a really long time.</p><p>I reach my hand up to my head. It feels all woozy and foggy \u2013 what is wrong with me? I can\u2019t even open my eyes because they feel so heavy and tacky.</p><p>Hey, hang on, what\u2019s that sound? It sounds like . . . water?</p><p>Where am I?</p><p>With a huge amount of effort, I wrench my eyes open and, squinting in the bright light, I somehow manage to lift myself up slightly, and I find myself face-to-face with the ocean. The frothy waves are washing up onto the shoreline before me.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>I prod my brain for the answer but none comes. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a dense fog covering everything and I can\u2019t seem to penetrate it.</p><p>I sit myself up further and rub at my pounding head. Then I slowly glance around my surroundings taking in the beach spread out all around me. There\u2019s a couple of people further up walking a dog, then I clock a man quickly approaching from my right, jogging quickly along the shoreline.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, but my voice comes out scratchy and hoarse and he doesn\u2019t hear me. I manage to kneel myself up onto my protesting limbs. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d I say more loudly, waving my hand about.</p><p>Thankfully I catch his attention and he stops just past me and turns back, continuing to jog on the spot, looking at me questionably.</p><p>\u201cErm, can you tell me where I am?\u201d My voice still sounds as rough as sandpaper.</p><p>He glances around and then back at me, a smile creeps onto his lips. \u201cThe beach,\u201d he says flippantly.</p><p>I rub my forehead, frustrated. \u201cI mean which beach? Whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>He peers at me curiously, still continuing to jog on the spot. \u201cBondi.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightens, like a hand\u2019s just grabbed hold of it. Something doesn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>I sit back onto my haunches, my heart pounding. \u201cBondi?\u201d I say my voice jumping about with apprehension. \u201cAs in Bondi beach in Australia?\u201d</p><p>He laughs condescendingly. \u201cYes, as in Bondi beach in Sydney, Australia.\u201d He accentuates each word as though I\u2019m the most stupid person he\u2019s ever met.</p><p>Bondi? Australia?</p><p>No that\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I throw my mind back as hard as I can, trying to catch hold of something, anything, but there\u2019s nothing, nothing at all, just an invariable . . . nothingness. Not a single tangible memory for me to grab hold of. It\u2019s like trying to wade through mud. Everything\u2019s all muggy and cloudy. My memories are out of my reach, almost as if I no longer own them, no longer have a right to them. Because no matter what angle or route I try to take in my mind, I keep drawing a blank, a big, fat blank.</p><p>Oh God, what\u2019s happened to me? Why can\u2019t I remember anything?</p><p>I feel a massive stab of panic.</p><p>\u201cHeavy night, eh?\u201d the jogger says jeeringly, grinning down at me, and I think it must be the look of absolute horror on my face, that changes his to concern. He stops jogging, comes over, and crouches down in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asks, wide eyes peering at me.</p><p>My eyes start to sting and a big fat tear suddenly trickles down my cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I gulp, twisting my hands together in my lap. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know how I got here.\u201d</p><p>A look of surprise flickers across his face. \u201cOh, erm, what? You don\u2019t know how you got here?\u201d he echoes my words, as though he barely believes them.</p><p>I shake my head numbly as another tear rolls down my cheek. I roughly wipe it away. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing here . . . I don\u2019t know how I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, erm, right, well, it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d He pushes his blonde hair off his damp forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll, erm, I\u2019ll . . .\u201d I can see his eyes scanning around and then he fixes his sight onto something. \u201cJust wait here a sec,\u201d he says, quickly rising to stand, \u201cI\u2019ll just go get some help.\u201d He dashes off, leaving me alone.</p><p>I wrap my arms around my trembling body.</p><p>Less than a minute later, the jogger arrives back with a dark haired, very tanned guy who\u2019s wearing sunglasses, black shorts and a white polo shirt emblazoned with the word \u2013 Lifeguard.</p><p>The lifeguard crouches before me but the jogger stays standing, hanging a bit further back.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the lifeguard says, \u201cyou okay?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He hands me a tissue he just pulled from his shorts pocket.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble. I take it gratefully and wipe my eyes.</p><p>He pulls off his sunglasses, revealing the bluest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 well I mean, I think they are.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I sniffle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothin\u2019 to be sorry about.\u201d He smiles, eyes warm. He sits down in front of me, crossing his legs.</p><p>\u201cMy names Fen. I\u2019m a lifeguard \u2013 obviously.\u201d He grins down at his chest and I force a weak smile in return. \u201cSo, this guy here \u2013\u201d He thumbs over his shoulder glancing back at the jogger.</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d the jogger affirms.</p><p>\u201cPaul, right \u2013\u201d Fen the lifeguard says with a nod, then looks back to me. \u201c\u2013 said you might need some help, that you\u2019re a bit confused, that you don\u2019t remember how you got here. That right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a lowered tone.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, tucking his chin length dark hair behind his ears. His phone starts to ring and I jump at the sound. My eyes follow his hand to his belt where his phone is clipped. He switches it off without looking at it, all the time keeping his bright blue eyes fixed on me. \u201cWere you drinking last night?\u201d he asks. I see his eyes quickly sweep over my clothes as though his answer lies there. I follow his gaze down to my jeans and white t-shirt.</p><p>Was I drinking?</p><p>I push my hair back off my face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t think I was . . . I \u2013 I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he nods. \u201cDid you maybe have anything else, something a bit \u2013 stronger?\u201d he asks this in a quieter voice.</p><p>\u201cStronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs.\u201d</p><p>Erm . . .</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so . . .\u201d I shake my head, leaving my brain feeling like its still swishing about inside. \u201cWell, I mean . . .\u201d I sigh and shrug helplessly, looking straight into his eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He rubs his forehead with his knuckles. \u201cSo can you tell me the last thing you do remember?\u201d</p><p>I curl my fingers together, clasping hold of the tissue in my hand.</p><p>Taking a deep breath I close my eyes and try again. I push my mind back really hard, as far out as I can, but again all I draw up is a blank. Panic quickly rises in me.</p><p>I flick my eyes open. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d my voice shoots out in terror. \u201cI can\u2019t remember! I can\u2019t remember anything!\u201d</p><p>I can see the shock reverberate through his eyes but he still manages to hold a calm, warm exterior. His look is so warm and so calming that for a split second I actually feel comforted. It doesn\u2019t last long when the present slams straight back into me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you can\u2019t remember anything?\u201d I can hear the tinge of disbelief in his voice.</p><p>And I don\u2019t blame him.

His brow is all furrowed. I can see his thoughts furiously flicking away behind his insanely blue eyes and I know what he\u2019s thinking. He\u2019s thinking I\u2019m either an alcoholic, a drug addict or just plain crazy . . . or maybe actually all three combined.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t feel crazy - slightly hysterical maybe, but not crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d I hear myself saying, \u201cI just can\u2019t remember.\u201d I cover my face with my hands, pressing the soggy tissue up against my cheek.</p><p>He inhales deeply. \u201cI never said you were crazy. I just wanna help you.\u201d</p><p>I peer out from in-between my fingers to see him looking at me sincerely.</p><p>He pushes his hand through his dark hair. \u201cHave you got anything with you, like a purse, a phone . . .\u201d A quick glance around me answers his question. \u201cNo, okay.\u201d He drums his fingers on his bare knee. \u201cWell, can you give me a number of someone I can call for you and we\u2019ll go from there?\u201d He reaches for his phone.</p> <p>I flick a quick glance over at the jogger, then back to Fen. They\u2019re both staring at me expectantly and I don\u2019t know how to answer.</p><p>I feel like my heads short-circuiting or it\u2019s possibly about to explode because the more I try to force the memories, the worse it gets, the higher my level of panic rises. I try to search my brain for a telephone number, reaching to the outer edges of my mind, but there\u2019s nothing there except for a vacuous void where my memories should have been. No telephone numbers, just absolutely nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any numbers.\u201d I can feel the blood pumping furiously through my veins and my face is getting hot.</p><p>A look of frustration flickers over Fen\u2019s face. He clips his phone back to his belt and folds his arms and stares at me. \u201cCome on, you must know one, how about your mum\u2019s or \u2013\u201d</p><p>I shake my head furiously, forcing his words to come to an abrupt end. And as I look at his bewildered and frustrated face, I suddenly feel powerless and so completely and utterly vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI. Don\u2019t. Know,\u201d I say, my voice snapping and unable to avoid it doing so. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, just try to keep calm,\u201d he says in a composed voice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I cry. \u201cHow can I keep calm? I\u2019m here and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, or how I even got here and . . . and . . .\u201d I tail off breathlessly as the realisation drenches me. I have to bite my lip to stop from crying. My stomach is churning about in dread and my heart is beating so fast I feel like it\u2019s going to jump out of my chest as I comprehend just how very bad this actually is.</p><p>Because the truth is even when I try to think of the most basic things about myself, nothing comes. It\u2019s like I know everything and absolutely nothing. I know this is sand here below me and that\u2019s the ocean over there, and that\u2019s a seagull hovering in the sky just there, and I know what a lifeguard is, but for some terrifying reason I know absolutely nothing about myself, not one single thing.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared,\u201d Fen says, his voice controlled, deep, \u201cbut you\u2019re gonna have to try and stay calm because I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t.\u201d I can see his hand clasped around a radio that\u2019s attached to his belt.</p><p>I close my eyes, taking a few deep breaths. Blood is beating in my ears and my heart is pounding so loudly I\u2019m sure he must be able to hear it.</p><p>I open them again to see Fen looking at me with uneasy eyes. The radio is in his hand now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologise, pulling my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. My eyes are swelling with tears again.</p><p>I see Fen exchange a look with the jogger who\u2019s actually moved further away from me.</p> <p>Fen moves round and sits beside me. \u201cLook, what I\u2019m gonna do is radio to my colleague and get her down here to cover my patch so I can take you to see a medic. I think that\u2019s the best thing to do. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>I rest my cheek on my knee and glance sideways at him. \u201cYes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He puts the radio to his mouth, pauses and looks back at me with questioning eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I tighten my arms around my legs and take a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know my name.\u201d I push the air from my lungs and a stray tear trickles from the corner of my eye.</p><p>I see the shock reverberate through his face. \u201cBugger,\u201d he murmurs quietly.</p><p>Yeah, bugger. That just about covers it.</p><p>He puts his arm around my shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says in a soft voice, patting my shoulder gently, \u201cit\u2019s all gonna be okay. I\u2019ll make sure your okay.\u201d He puts the radio to his lips and starts talking quickly into it.</p><p>I sigh heavily and another tear breaks free, followed by another, then another.</p><p>And I know it\u2019s not going to be okay. How can it be when I don\u2019t even know my own name?</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Desolate</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re seeing Mark Rogers at two pm for some tests, is that right?\u201d Dr Woods asks. His grey eyes are peering out from over the top of his glasses as he looks enquiringly at me.</p><p>I repress a sigh. More tests. Great.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d he mutters. \u201cWell I\u2019ll pop back afterwards to see how you got on.\u201d He pushes his glasses up his nose, gathers his papers up and shoves his pen into his jacket pocket. He gets up from the chair beside my bed and heads for the door.</p><p>He stops just shy of it and turns back to me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay, you know,\u201d he says in a well-meaning voice.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all here to help you. I\u2019m here \u2013\u201d He pats his chest. \u201c\u2013 anything you need, you just have one of the nurses beep me \u2013 anytime,\u201d he adds with a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say forcing a smile in return.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, then.\u201d He sweeps through the door which closes behind him with a thud.</p><p>I flop back onto my pillows and sigh loudly into the encumbering silence.</p><p>I\u2019m sat on my bed in my room in St Vincent\u2019s Hospital. I\u2019ve been here for six days. Mark Rogers is the neurologist who\u2019s coming to see me this afternoon, just in case you were wondering. I\u2019ve seen him once before, on the day I arrived here. Dr Woods, he\u2019s the specialist who\u2019s been taking care of me since I arrived.</p><p>And well, Dr Woods and Mark Rogers, and several other brain doctors have all concluded, after a lot of tests and CT scans, that I\u2019m suffering from some severe form of focal retrograde amnesia.</p><p>Amnesia, I know \u2013 great huh? The worst case they\u2019ve ever heard of, apparently, which is comforting to know.</p><p>You see, after all the extensive tests they\u2019ve done, they have only managed to discover what I already know, which is that I don\u2019t remember anything about anything.</p><p>Well what I mean is I know the sky is blue and the earth revolves around the sun, and that the wall over there, well it\u2019s really bland shade of yellow. But when it came to them asking me what year it is or who the current prime minister of the country is, or well basically anything about myself \u2013 I couldn\u2019t answer because I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I know absolutely nothing about me, not my name or where I live, or how old I am.</p><p>Zilch. Zero. Nada.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to terms with it, sort of. Well as much as you can after six days.</p><p>After that day on the beach, when Fen had radioed through to his colleague, he took me to see their medic who advised that he bring me straight to the hospital, and here I\u2019ve been ever since.</p><p>Fen has been really wonderful to me. He was amazing on that first day. He stayed with me the whole time, keeping me company, waiting patiently whilst I had test after test done. And he\u2019s been visiting me every day since, bringing me things like magazines and chocolate, which is really kind of him because he doesn\u2019t have to. All I am to him is just some weird girl who rocked up on his beach, putting a dent in his otherwise normal working day, declaring to him that I have no memory of who I am.</p><p>And that\u2019s the really weird thing about my amnesia, you see, the doctors can\u2019t seem to figure out how I\u2019ve come to acquire it. Generally it\u2019s caused by a trauma to the head of which I have shown no visible signs. And normally people who have amnesia lose a few months, a few years maybe, at the most, but it seems I\u2019ve lost everything which rarely happens, if ever.</p><p>The only other possibility Dr Woods could offer was that an emotional trauma had triggered it. That can happen, as I\u2019ve been told. Post-traumatic stress disorder, Dr Woods called it, when something so horrific happens to a person they block it out and their memory just kind of switches off. Dr Woods said he thought it unlikely in my case due to the extent of memory loss, but he didn\u2019t want to rule it out.</p><p>So he said, in quiet undertones, he thought it best that I had a \u2018physical\u2019 examination done.</p><p>I lay there whilst Dr Woods and the attending nurse did the examination, feeling sick to the pit of my stomach every time I thought of the many different possibilities of what could have happened.</p><p>And after what I can only describe as the most humiliating experience I\u2019ve had to endure so far, Dr Woods assured me everything seemed fine. He said if something emotional had happened to trigger my memory loss, then it most certainly wasn\u2019t anything sexual because my hymen was intact, meaning I\u2019m a virgin. And, if I\u2019m as old as I look, that makes me a mid-twenty-something year old virgin.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>Another piece to add to the ever growing puzzle that is me.</p><p>Mark Rogers, the hippy neurologist in his brown cords, flowery shirt and long brown straggly hair, comes to see me at two, as arranged. We go into the family room which is a welcome change of scenery from the drab four yellow walls of my room. We sit at a table and do some tests where he has me drawing pictures from memory, recounting a short story that he reads to me, remembering fifteen words in a list, that sort of thing. The tests are pretty much the same ones as he did the last time I saw him, barring the physical examinations he did to my head and eyes. I don\u2019t see the point to it in all honesty. It\u2019s not like recounting words are gonna bring my memories back but I dutifully play along.</p><p>I remember exactly how his face lit up like a Christmas tree when he first discovered the extent of my memory loss. He was looking at me like I was the cure for cancer, and he could see the Nobel Peace Prize in sight (and yes I do know what that is; Fen told me about it the other day).</p><p>Mark said, in an excitable voice, that my case was extraordinary and that someone (I\u2019m guessing him) would want to write a paper on me at some point.</p><p>I felt like slapping him.</p><p>He\u2019s a nice guy, don\u2019t get me wrong, but that was the last thing I needed to hear.</p><p>I know to him I\u2019m just an interesting case that might boost his career, but to me this is everything, this is every memory I\u2019ve ever made that\u2019s gone missing. All of them vamoosed, just like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mark does tell me, though, what exactly it is that has happened to my brain. He says, in simple laymen terms, for some reason my warehouse of memories has shut down, the door is locked tight, for want of a better word. They\u2019re all in there and intact but they\u2019re hidden behind this hermetically sealed door and, unfortunately, I appear to have lost the ability to unlock said door. Or maybe, as he put it, for whatever reason I just don\u2019t want to.</p><p>I felt like telling him, if I could open it I would, but for some reason I held my tongue.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried, believe me. I\u2019ve raked through my mind until my head starts to pound and my eyes blur, and I can\u2019t take it anymore. But every single time I come up dry.</p><p>Dr Woods popped back in as he said he would. He really is a great doctor. He didn\u2019t stay long, though, as there really wasn\u2019t anything to say because the tests with Mark had identified nothing.</p> <p>He did let me know the DNA swab the police took from me didn\u2019t show up any results in their I.D. system. You see, Dr Woods informed the police about me on the day I arrived, and the next day a female police officer came to see me. She took my fingerprints and a DNA mouth swab to see if I would show up on their files to help identify me. The fingerprints came back the next day with no results but I was really hoping the DNA would. Well, to be honest, I was pinning all my hopes on it. I did my best to hide my disappointment from Dr Woods when he told me, but I think he knew.</p><p>The press have also been notified about my \u2018story\u2019, so that\u2019s been running in the paper and it\u2019s also been on the local news.</p><p>It hasn\u2019t been big news, though, because on the day I was found, there was a bus crash and a lot of people died, so that kind of overshadowed my story, which of course it should. But I am praying that someone will see my picture and recognise me.</p><p>Fen comes at dinner time. He\u2019s snuck in a McDonalds meal for us both. We eat together and he tells me about his day and the waves he caught this morning \u2013 he went surfing before work which he does nearly every day. Apparently his day was pretty standard. You see, as he puts it, nothing has yet trumped finding me on the beach, which is a good thing, he assures me, as he\u2019d be pretty busy with two amnesiac\u2019s to visit. My response \u2013 \u2018Ha, bloody ha\u2019.</p><p>I like Fen. He\u2019s easy to talk to, he makes me laugh and he takes my mind off all of this. He gives me a sense of normality which is exactly what I need right now.</p> <p>He\u2019s also taken to calling me Pommie. Apparently I don\u2019t sound Australian. No one could seem to place my accent, but concluded that if anything I sound English which, if I\u2019m from England, makes things even more confusing as to why I ended up on a beach here in Australia. Obviously I don\u2019t know my name, and Dr Woods had said it would be a good idea to give myself one, help to start me off with some form of identity. I refused. I told him the only name I want is the one I had and, when I remember that, I\u2019ll let him know. No one knew what to call me, so Fen started calling me Pommie and it stuck.</p><p>So here I am all alone now. Fen left not long after we finished our dinner as he\u2019s going out with friends. I\u2019m sat in the dark after another long day of tests, still no better off, staring out the window whilst the lights from the city glitter down below.</p><p>I feel so alone, so completely and utterly alone. And I don\u2019t mean physically. There could be a hundred people in this room and I\u2019d still feel alone. This kind of solitude comes from deep inside and I have no way to fill it.</p><p>How can I not know who I am? How could I have forgotten everything about myself?</p><p>I need to remember. Something. Anything.</p><p>But what if I can\u2019t \u2013 what then?</p> <p>I\u2019m just praying someone comes for me. There has to be someone out there who knows me, knows who I am, where I come from. I can\u2019t just have appeared out of thin air. And all I need is one person, just one person to tell me who I am.</p><p>And if no one comes, then . . . well, honestly, I try not to think about that because the thought scares the hell out of me.</p><p>I look into the window, my reflection gazing back at me. I feel like I\u2019m looking at a stranger. Almost as if I\u2019ve accidentally landed in this body that doesn\u2019t really belong to me, and the owner's going to turn up any minute and take it back.</p><p>I move closer to the glass. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I whisper to my reflection, my breath steaming up the glass. My eyes stare knowingly back at me as though they hold the answers to everything but refuse to tell.</p><p>I bang my fist frustratedly against my head, my eyes suddenly hot with tears. I withdraw from the window, get up from the chair and climb into bed, pulling the covers over me. I curl myself up into a tight ball as the loneliness presses into me silently, devastatingly, and I let the tears flow like I have done every night for the last six nights.</p><p>You don\u2019t have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body.</p><p>CS Lewis</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>James</p><p>It\u2019s been six weeks. Well, forty-three days to be exact, forty-three excruciatingly long days since she vanished from right before my eyes. Funny, six weeks is actually longer than I had her in my life. It\u2019s crazy how I can be so in love with someone I\u2019ve only known for such a small amount of time. And I know to some it might seem impetuous and foolhardy, but I didn\u2019t stand a chance. How could I not love her? She\u2019s amazing and beautiful, and quirky, and different, and . . . well you get the picture.</p><p>She saved me and I don\u2019t just mean on the night of my accident.</p><p>My life was pretty crap and I was fast heading down the road to Shitsville until the moment I saw her, then everything changed, it all just clicked right back into place. I started to feel normal again, like I used to before dad died, and I knew everything would be okay from there on out as long as she was around.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter to me who she is, or where she comes from, I just want her.</p><p>I know it might not make sense. Nothing about this whole situation makes any sense, but it doesn\u2019t change how I feel, and right now I just need her back here with me. I\u2019m kind of finding it hard to breathe without her.</p><p>It\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s driving me insane, not knowing where she is, if she\u2019s okay . . . if she\u2019s ever coming back.</p><p>The thought of never seeing her again makes my head feel like it\u2019s going to implode, so I try not to think about it. I have to stay positive. She said she\u2019d find a way back to me, so I just have to hold onto that.</p><p>I will see her again.</p><p>When she first disappeared, I didn\u2019t know what to do \u2013 what I could do. I just stood there in the kitchen, paralysed, eyes transfixed on the spot where she\u2019d been. I literally couldn\u2019t breathe. It was like someone had a tight grip on my lungs and was expelling every bit of air from them. I felt powerless. There wasn\u2019t a single fucking thing I could do. Every instinct was telling me I should look for her, tear the streets up searching, but I\u2019m guessing where Lucyna\u2019s gone is not somewhere I have ready access to.</p><p>All I\u2019ve done since is to try to keep myself busy with anything and everything, pretending to the outside world all is okay so I don\u2019t have to think about how much I miss her. Trust me, it\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s the night time that gets me. When I\u2019m alone. That\u2019s when I feel it. When I feel all sore and empty inside.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to lie to everyone about where she is. I said she\u2019s gone to visit her family and I suppose in a weird sort of way it\u2019s true \u2013 and, really, what else could I say, that she\u2019s a heavenly being and was taken back to Heaven?</p><p>Hmm . . . I think not. I\u2019d probably end up been committed.</p><p>A couple of times I\u2019ve woken up in the middle of the night, panicked, thinking it was all a dream, she was a dream, but my heart beats her name too loudly for her to have never been in it. She made me feel alive again and I\u2019m not ready to let go of that just yet, or maybe ever.</p><p>And even though, once again, I wish I could hide here in my bed all day, I know I can\u2019t. I have another day I have to get through, a business to run.</p><p>I push myself up, swing my good leg over the side of the bed, and drag my potted leg over to join it. My feet touch the oak floor. Bloody hell that\u2019s cold. I should really get a carpet put in here, but Lucyna did say she liked the feel of the cold beneath her feet. She said it made her feel alive. Now I know her, I know exactly what she meant.</p><p>With a sigh I reach over and turn the radio on the alarm clock on, anything to fill up this silence. It springs to life with exactly what I didn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u2018Show me the meaning of being lonely,</p><p>Is this the feeling I need to walk with?</p><p>Tell me why I can\u2019t be there where you are,</p><p>There\u2019s something missin\u2019 in my heart.\u2019</p><p>Fucking Backstreet Boys.</p><p>I grab the clock, yanking the plug out of the socket and hurl it across the room. It smashes against the wall, shattering to pieces. And once again the room is silenced to deafening. I hobble over to the bathroom, slamming the door loudly behind me.</p><p>The shower does nothing to make me feel better. It\u2019s nothing but a bloody chore at the moment. I\u2019m perched precariously on the side of the bath, pot covered with a plastic bin bag, trying not to get it wet. I swear the minute it\u2019s off, I'm getting a long, hot shower.</p><p>When I\u2019ve finished, I clamber out of the bath, wrap a towel around my waist, rip the bag from my leg, and wipe the condensation from the mirror above the sink with my hand.</p><p>Jesus, I look like shit.</p><p>I reach for my toothbrush and, without warning an image of her appears in my mind. I close my eyes and try desperately to hold onto it. It\u2019s not clear. I can\u2019t see her as I used to. She\u2019s starting to fray around the edges. I rest my forehead against the cool glass, hoping in some way that will make it clearer. It doesn\u2019t. And it\u2019s too late; she\u2019s gone.</p><p>What if I forget what she looks like? What if one day I just wake up and I can\u2019t see her anymore?</p><p>The loss slams into me hard.</p><p>I feel so completely and utterly alone, and I have to hold my breath just to stop myself freaking out, because this is a different kind of loneliness. It hurts so much that my heart actually aches with physical pain.</p><p>Come on, James, focus. It\u2019s just another day. You\u2019ve done forty-three so far, what\u2019s another?</p><p>I take a deep breath, pull back from the mirror and set about brushing my teeth.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I open the door leading straight into my bedroom, the steam following me out and . . . \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I yell, jumping in shock. There\u2019s a woman stood by my bed and she\u2019s definitely no woman I know.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d she smiles lightly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel. You\u2019ve no need to be alarmed, James.\u201d She lifts a calming hand. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d I say agitated and confused. \u201cWhat makes you think I need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLucyna? What about her? Is she okay? Where is she?\u201d And the words just keep on tumbling out of my mouth.</p><p>She holds up a firm hand, cutting me off. \u201cLucyna\u2019s fine \u2013 well sort of.\u201d</p><p>Fear grips a tight hold of my stomach. \u201cSort of? Sort of!\u201d My voice is starting to sound slightly unhinged. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll explain all. But please dress first,\u201d she says, gesturing to me.</p><p>I glance down at my half-clad body and tighten the towel around my waist. I grab the t-shirt that\u2019s hanging on the radiator beside me. \u201cTell me,\u201d I say, dragging the t-shirt on over my head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a hospital in Sydney \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustralia?\u201d I say incredulously.</p> <p>She nods curtly, her red hair falling across her face. She pushes it back. \u201cShe\u2019s fine physically. She\u2019s human now, but she has no memory of who she used to be, of anything . . . of you.\u201d</p><p>I rest up against the wall, my body suddenly weary, all my urgency halted. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She sits down on the edge of my bed. \u201cFrom what I\u2019m guessing she was made a mortal by Arlo and he took away her memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArlo? Who the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArlo is an angel like me \u2013 like Lucyna used to be, and well . . . also like you once were.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh awkwardly. \u201cWhat? I used to be an angel?\u201d</p><p>She nods casually.</p><p>I feel nothing if not casual. Uncomfortable \u2013 yes. Casual \u2013 not so much.</p><p>I make a noise that was supposed to be another laugh but this time it comes out sounding strangled. Nothing\u2019s registering at her words. I mean you would think if I used to be something like that it would spark some sort of recognition, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>I push my damp hair off my forehead. \u201cYou must have got it wrong \u2013 I can\u2019t have been an \u2013 an angel.\u201d</p><p>She regards me silently for a moment. \u201cNo, I am correct,\u201d she says, certainly. \u201cYou were Arran. You and I knew one another. You look different now, but you were definitely him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou left behind your immortality to become a mortal three hundred years ago at your own request, so you could be with a mortal woman.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel jittery. Circuits are firing off in my brain. And this conversation is making me feel distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cWas Lucyna the women I left to be with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head irritably. \u201cLucyna was an angel at that time too.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrows. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I knew Lucyna all that time ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cWell you and Lucyna were together, but you left her to be with the human. And not long after you left Heaven, she disappeared along with Arlo. I have not seen any of you since, well until six weeks ago when Lucyna\u2019s essence registered with us on the day she changed form \u2013 from, surprisingly to me, a Bringer \u2013 to save your life.\u201d</p><p>I listen intently as she continues.</p><p>\u201cI was sent here to monitor her, well the both of you \u2013 I must say I wasn\u2019t in the least bit surprised the moment I realised who you were, that she had saved you from that car wreck. Lucyna loved Arran immensely. And when she vanished again a few weeks ago without trace, I was concerned, so I have been searching for her ever since. There has been nothing, well not until yesterday when I fortunately became aware of a story being broadcast by the humans about a woman found in Australia recently with no memory of who she was \u2013 and low and behold it was Lucyna.\u201d</p> <p>After hearing that you'd think I\u2019d be shocked, stunned in fact, but with all I\u2019ve heard and seen recently, I\u2019m way past the element of surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow did she end up in Australia?\u201d I ask this calmly, and God knows how, because I feel anything but.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure but I believe Arlo may be somehow responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Arlo \u2013 why would he do this to Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>Her face falls. \u201cI have my own theory . . . but I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my gaze. \u201cAnd your theory is?\u201d</p><p>She looks out of the window. \u201cInconsequential.\u201d Her tone is brisk. \u201cThe important thing is that I find him which I can\u2019t do.\u201d Her voice trails off and she is silent for a moment. She looks back to me. \u201cIt seems he doesn\u2019t want to be found and that he didn\u2019t want Lucyna to be found either as her essence is being masked. Her mind has been blanked of all memories. I can\u2019t see anything, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s been a wall built up in there and it\u2019s too dense for me to penetrate. The only way I\u2019ll know anything is if she\u2019ll allow me to try and release the memories locked in her mind. But she has to consent to this, and even then I still may not be able to break through because the magic Arlo has worked \u2013 if it is him, is strong.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window at the cool clear day, my mind frantically working away, trying to figure this all out.</p><p>I take a deep breath, looking back at her. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, crossing my arms over my chest, \u201cso let me get this straight in my mind. You\u2019re telling me I was an angel called Arran, and me and Lucyna were together, but three hundred years ago I left her to be with another woman, and then she left Heaven with this Arlo, became a Bringer, found me \u2013 Arran . . .\u201d shit this is confusing. \u201c. . . disappeared again possibly thanks to Arlo, and has now turned up in Australia, human, with no memory of who she was.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips turn up. \u201cBasically, yes.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together. It all sounds so . . . hmm . . . confusing, mind-bending, a bit on the crazy-side . . . need I go on?</p><p>I suddenly have a thought. \u201cWho was the woman?\u201d</p><p>Isabel looks at me inquisitively.</p><p>\u201cThe woman, Arran \u2013 I mean, I \u2013\u201d I shake my head, \u201cfuck, this is confusing! Sorry,\u201d I add when I realise that I just cursed in front of an angel. Isabel looks at me blankly and says nothing, so I carry on. \u201cWho was the woman I left Lucyna to be with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says indifferently, crossing her ankles. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter I cared to look into. You made your decision, end of story.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So that\u2019s me told.</p><p>\u201cHas it ever happened before, an angel becoming mortal?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips and nods formally. \u201cIt has happened, not many times. Arran was one of a few. We don\u2019t really spend time around the living to attach ourselves emotionally, but sometimes curiosity can get the better of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>She laughs, a genuine laugh. \u201cNo. I hadn\u2019t been to earth in a very long time, not until I was sent here to watch you and Lucyna. There\u2019s nothing here of interest to me.\u201d</p><p>I uncross my arm and rub my forehead with my fingertips. \u201cHave you spoken to Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wanted to speak to you first. I didn\u2019t want to turn up there and scare her with this announcement. She\u2019s unlikely to be reasonable, as she\u2019s already feeling very scared and alone.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s words make me feel sick to the pit of my stomach. I can\u2019t bear the thought of her being there all alone and frightened, and also very fucking angry at who put her there.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought if you came with me \u2013\u201d Isabel continues, breaking me out of my pensive thoughts. \u201c\u2013 it could be the key to help me unlock her mind. She might not be aware of it, but the emotional tie she has to you is undeniably strong, that\u2019s been proved once already. She may listen to you because I can\u2019t even attempt to return her memories without her consent.\u201d</p><p>I meet her eyes. \u201cThere would never have been a moment I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She rises gracefully to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but there something I need to ask her first. It won\u2019t make a difference to anything, but I have to know. \u201cIsabel.\u201d I pause. She looks at me curiously. I clear my suddenly hoarse throat. \u201cDid Lucyna know who I used to be when she saved my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she had no clue of who you were, who she used to be, or of your history together.\u201d She regards me warmly for a moment. \u201cAt that point she loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I used to be him?\u201d I think out loud.</p><p>She flashes me a tight smile. \u201cMaybe . . . partly.\u201d</p><p>Now I know I\u2019m not so sure how I feel about it but I push it aside as there are far more important things to think about, mainly how quickly I can get to Lucyna. The rest I can sort out later.</p><p>I push off the wall. \u201cRight, I\u2019ll just pack some clothes and get my passport \u2013\u201d</p><p>She laughs condescendingly, halting my words. \u201cJames, we\u2019re not travelling by human transport. I will take us.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so now I feel stupid for even speaking.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to need you a bit more mobile than that,\u201d she adds, pointing a finger at my leg.</p><p>Almost immediately I feel a warm tingling sensation running through my broken leg and hear a crack. I watch in astonishment as the pot crumbles to the floor. I look down at my bare leg in shock. The pain is gone. I bend it slowly. It feels fine, well better than fine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fixed,\u201d she says off-hand, like she\u2019s just glued a cup back together, or something trivial like that. \u201cAnd put some trousers on. I don\u2019t think turning up to see Lucyna in a towel will help matters.\u201d</p><p>I grab my jeans off the chair by the window and pull them up under the towel, instantly realising the ludicrousness of the situation I\u2019m in. I\u2019m half-naked dressing in front of an angel. Hmm? I twist my lips, forcing the smile from my face, as I button up my jeans. It must be hysteria or something which, given the situation, I think is a perfectly reasonable thing to feel.</p><p>I push my feet into my trainers. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d I say fervently.</p><p>Isabel comes over and holds her hands out. I take hold of them. \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d she instructs, \u201cand don\u2019t open them until I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, a touch apprehensively. Well, truth be told, I\u2019m absolutely shitting myself but if it gets me to Lucyna, then I\u2019m prepared to do just about anything. I close my eyes and open them straightaway. Isabel sighs, impatiently.</p><p>I look straight into her green eyes. \u201cLucyna\u2019s not going to know who I am, is she?\u201d I say, my voice sounding tinny as I suddenly realise the calamity of the situation.</p><p>She looks back at me regretfully. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to get her memories back?\u201d I ask, hopefully.</p><p>She smiles a tight smile. \u201cI can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. I compress the pain down and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Isabel asks softly.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d I instantly feel a shuddering sensation run through my hands, up my arms, spreading throughout the whole of my body.</p><p>Within a matter of seconds I hear Isabel\u2019s whispering voice say, \u201cYou can open your eyes, James. We\u2019re here.\u201d She releases my hands.</p><p>Nervously I peel my eyes open and sway slightly on my feet, feeling unsteady. I press my feet into the floor whilst quickly casting my eyes over the moonlit room.</p><p>Isabel silently points over my shoulder and I turn to see Lucyna. She\u2019s asleep in bed. My heart nearly explodes with relief. Six weeks I\u2019ve waited for this moment. Six fucking weeks. And now I daren\u2019t move.</p><p>I force my feet forward and, very nervously and very quietly, I tread over to the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gaze down at her. She looks just as I remembered, if not more beautiful. She\u2019s breathing deeply. The rise and fall of her chest is mesmerising, her face so peaceful, I\u2019m almost afraid to wake her.</p><p>Carefully I perch on the edge of her bed and glance down at the book in her hand. She must have fallen asleep reading. I feel an instant rush of love for her. I gently pull it from her hand and reach back, placing it on the table by her bed. Then I brush her hair off her face with my fingers. \u201cLuce, wake up, baby,\u201d I say quietly, cradling her face with my hand.</p><p>She murmurs in her sleep and turns her face into my hand, nuzzling it. I stroke the length of her nose with my thumb. \u201cLuce baby, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing suddenly halts and her eyes flick open, bright blue and filled with panic. I withdraw my hand. She leaps backwards in her bed, her back pressed up against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cWho \u2013 who are you?\u201d she says, wide eyes flicking from me to Isabel, then back to me again. There\u2019s not a trace of recognition in them.</p><p>Okay, so I wasn\u2019t as prepared for this as I thought I might be. I know I was aware she wouldn\u2019t know me, but Jesus, it really fucking hurts \u2013 A LOT \u2013 to have her looking at me like I\u2019m a stranger. It\u2019s like a knife in the chest.</p><p>Pushing all my pain aside, I focus on her, focus on how she must be feeling right now. Pretty freaked out I\u2019m guessing.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I say gently, raising a calming hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe.

I hope.</p> <p>Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.</p><p>Wuthering Heights \u2013 Emily Bronte</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>A New Beginning</p><p>\u201cHey Pommie.\u201d</p><p>I look up from my magazine to see a smiling Fen coming through the door and my spirits instantly lift.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, surprised. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you. I thought you were going out for dinner tonight for your mum\u2019s birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I had to come past the hospital on my way to the restaurant so I thought I\u2019d drop this in for you.\u201d He hands me a battered looking book and sits himself down into the chair by my bed.</p><p>I notice he looks different. What is it? I eye him carefully, but I can\u2019t see anything specifically standing out. Understandably he looks a little smarter than usual. He\u2019s wearing black jeans and a fitted grey shirt. And his hair\u2019s tidier than he normally wears it. It's usually all mussed up. Actually, he looks quite handsome. I mean, I know Fen\u2019s good looking, I\u2019d have to be blind not to notice, but tonight he looks, dare I say it, hot? Nerves flutter through my stomach at the thought. Okay, that was weird.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say with a delay and begin to examine the front cover of the book. \u2018The Beach\u2019 \u2013 oh it\u2019s the one he was telling me about yesterday \u2013 and, no, he\u2019s not being ironic. Apparently it\u2019s really good and has nothing whatsoever to do with amnesiacs turning up on it. I\u2019m reading a lot at the moment, anything I can get my hands on really. Well, it\u2019s not like I have much else to do and it\u2019s nice to escape off into someone else\u2019s fantasy for a while. It distracts me away from my own depressing reality.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bring it now, though,\u201d I say putting the book down on the bed. \u201cI could have waited till tomorrow. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t got plenty to keep me busy.\u201d I point towards the stack of books piled up on the table.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d He kicks his shoes off, puts his feet up on my bed, rests his head back on the chair and closes his eyes.</p><p>\u201cComfortable there?\u201d I chuckle, nudging his foot with mine.</p><p>\u201cHmm, very.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHard day at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d A lazy smile forms on his lips and he opens his eyes. It still surprises me just how blue they actually are. They\u2019re striking in contrast with his black hair and olive skin. They look almost luminous in this fluorescent lighting. \u201cI had the early shift,\u201d he tells me, \u201cthen ended up having to stay late \u2018cause there was a problem with one of the boats.\u201d He yawns loudly. \u201cCould really do with going home to bed but it\u2019s my mum's birthday, so what can you do?\u201d He stretches his arms over his head. His shirt rides up and I find myself involuntarily glancing down. Wow, his stomach is really smooth and toned . . .</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your day been?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said \u2013 how\u2019s your day been?\u201d</p><p>I realise I\u2019m staring and instantly come to my senses. I see a flicker of amusement pass over his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, good,\u201d I smile.</p><p>He picks the remote off the table and turns the TV on. I glance back down at my magazine.</p><p>Actually that was a lie.</p><p>It\u2019s just been another pointless day of nothing. I\u2019ve been here four weeks now, and after all the testing and neuro-psychotherapy sessions, there\u2019s still absolutely nothing happening in this stupid brain of mine. I\u2019ve not even had one meagre, teeny tiny little memory resurface. So, yes, I still have absolutely no idea who I am \u2013 was \u2013 or whatever.</p><p>The only memories I do have are the ones I\u2019ve made since I arrived here. And the only good ones I've made are when Fen visits, which he does everyday, and has done since that day. We\u2019ve become really good friends and, honestly, I don\u2019t know what I would do without him. I would never tell him this, mainly because it sounds so lame, but seeing him is the only good part of my day, the best part, in fact, because the rest of the time I\u2019m miserable and lonely.</p><p>I know I need to start moving forward and I have been thinking about the future a lot lately. I can\u2019t spend the rest of my life like this, I can\u2019t keep hanging out for the past, hoping it\u2019ll return. I need to start living for now.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks. I look up from my magazine to find his eyes surveying me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I close my magazine and chuck it onto the table. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with interest. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe Dr Woods is right, you know, maybe it is time I start moving forward and I thought the best way to do that would be to \u2013 you know give myself an identity like he said \u2013 give myself a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, but I like 'Pommie'.\u201d He flashes me a cheeky grin.</p><p>I give him a wry look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding!\u201d He holds up a hand. \u201cNo, that\u2019s really great,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cSo, do you have one in mind?\u201d</p><p>I nod but then instantly wish I hadn\u2019t. I suddenly feel shy and embarrassed. What if he laughs? What if he thinks it\u2019s a really rubbish name?</p><p>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he asks, pulling a packet of mints from his jeans pocket. He opens them up, pops one in his mouth and offers them to me. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I backtrack. \u201cI mean I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure that I might go for it anyway, so . . .\u201d</p><p>He gives me an inquisitive look. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>I look away from him, fully aware of how stupid I\u2019m being and how I\u2019ve now managed to make it more of a deal than it actually ever was.</p><p>I begin fiddling with my hair. \u201cYou might laugh,\u201d I say quietly, my eyes averted.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I laugh?\u201d He crunches his mint. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s gonna be something horrendous, like Gertrude or \u2013\u201d He claps a hand over his mouth. \u201cShit, it\u2019s not, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>He chuckles and puts his feet down into his shoes, then he leans forward, resting his forearms on his thighs, blue eyes fixed on me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to tell me now, \u2018cause I\u2019m really intrigued.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at my long hair that I\u2019ve started to plait. Why do I suddenly feel so shy around him?</p><p>He points the remote at the TV, switches it off, gets up from his seat and sits down on the bed beside me. I glance up at him and meet his eyes. My heart does this weird fluttery thing and my mouth suddenly dries.</p><p>This is getting really weird. What is going on with me?</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I told you my name?\u201d he says, pushing his hand through his dark hair.</p><p>\u201cI know your name \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he butts in. \u201cFen\u2019s not my actual name.\u201d</p><p>I stop plaiting. Now I\u2019m intrigued. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>He rubs his hand over his mouth. \u201cPromise not to laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I begin untangling my hair.</p><p>He eyes me suspiciously. I maintain steady contact, widening my eyes. \u201cI promise,\u201d I emphasise, jokily holding my hands up.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cOsvaldo,\u201d he finally says, face deadpan.</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He pokes me in the arm jovially. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, trying to keep a straight face \u2013 unsuccessfully, might I add. \u201cWow, erm, Osvaldo, its erm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortuguese,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cMy mum\u2019s Portuguese. It was my grandfather\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so now I feel mean for laughing. \u201cWhere does Fen come from?\u201d I ask, feeling tense, worried I\u2019ve offended him. I tuck my hair behind my ears.</p><p>\u201cMy surname's Fenn, and it\u2019s what all my mates have called me since school \u2013 and anything\u2019s gotta be better than Osvaldo,\u201d he adds grinning, eyes twinkling at me, and I instantly relax.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were from Portugal,\u201d I say, but now I look at him I can see it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I was born here, my dad\u2019s Australian but my mum\u2019s originally from Portugal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, right. So can you speak Portuguese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFluent.\u201d He nods.</p><p>I lean forward, excitedly. \u201cOoh, say something to me in Portuguese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says coyly.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I urge.</p><p>He sighs, defeated. \u201cAlright, but on one condition \u2013 you have to tell me the name you\u2019ve picked for yourself?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips. \u201cOkay. Deal. But you go first.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, shaking his head. He fixes his insanely blue eyes on mine and says in a lightly accented voice, \u201cEstou t\u00e3o feliz que voc\u00ea veio em minha vida linda menina.\u201d</p><p>A shiver runs through me and my heart does this little flip-flop. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask, my voice suddenly sounding hoarse.</p><p>\u201cNothing of importance,\u201d he brushes me off. \u201cSo, go on then, it\u2019s your turn and I promise not to laugh \u2013 unlike some people \u2013 scout's honour.\u201d He does a two finger salute.</p><p>And something flashes through my mind, like, I don\u2019t know \u2013 recognition \u2013 a memory \u2013 maybe. I close my eyes and try to grab hold of it \u2013 but no, it\u2019s gone. Dammit!</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I hear the sound of Fen concerned voice.</p><p>I open my eyes. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I rub my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, just when you did that \u2013 that salute, it seemed really familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like a memory?\u201d he asks, looking hopeful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shake my head, frustrated. \u201cMaybe.

It\u2019ll come if it\u2019s meant too.\u201d He rubs my arm and I suddenly feel really irritated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say!\u201d I snap, instantly regretting my outburst when I see the look of sadness on his face.</p><p>What is going on with me today? Now I\u2019m picking a fight with the only friend I have.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he replies kindly.</p><p>I flop back against my pillows. My head feels like it\u2019s going to explode with frustration. I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably tell Dr Woods what happened,\u201d he says tentatively, in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I sigh. \u201cNot that there\u2019s really anything to tell him but I\u2019ll mention it tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>We lapse into silence. I feel Fen shuffle on the bed and open up my eyes to see that he\u2019s turned away from me and is staring out the window.</p><p>I sit up and cross my legs in front of me. \u201cSo you were a boy scout, then?\u201d I ask, wanting to go back to how we were before I ruined it.</p><p>He glances sideways at me, looking puzzled, but then his face suddenly clicks into understanding. \u201cOnly the Joey\u2019s. Didn\u2019t make it further than that. Discovered a surfboard, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I nod. \u201cShame, I bet you looked real cute in your little uniform.\u201d I laugh and tug on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI look better in my board shorts,\u201d he grins cheekily and catches hold of my retreating arm.</p><p>My eyes are instinctively pulled to his and something passes between us. The air thickens. Everything seems heightened. I feel a pull to him I\u2019ve never felt before and I\u2019m lost for words. All I can do now is breathe. The smile drops from his face and we hold eye contact for several seconds before I finally break it. He releases his hold on my arm but I can still feel his touch there.</p> <p>He clears his throat. \u201cSo, anyway, enough of you trying to distract me from the original convo.\u201d He turns his body around to face me, bending his left leg up onto the bed to rest it lightly against mine. \u201cTell me what this elusive name is?\u201d</p><p>But now I\u2019m finding it really hard to concentrate because all I\u2019m aware of his that his leg is touching mine, and how he\u2019s so close I can smell his aftershave entwined with the scent of the beach. He smells safe and I finally realise exactly just what it is that\u2019s going on with me.</p><p>I meet his steady gaze and butterflies take flight in my stomach. I take a deep breath and concentrate on my words. \u201cI was thinking, maybe . . . Lucy?\u201d I bite down on my lower lip, waiting for his approval.</p><p>He tilts his head to the side and regards me for moment. My face instantly heats under his gaze. \u201cI like it.\u201d He nods. \u201cLucy. Yeah, it suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d I say, feeling secretly pleased.</p><p>\u201cYup, I think it\u2019s perfect.\u201d He smiles and I realise that I\u2019m actually struggling to breathe steadily.</p><p>I wonder if he can tell? Surely he can. I look down at my hands.</p><p>There is a silence for a moment between us. He\u2019s the first to break it. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing great, you know.\u201d I look up at his words. His face is candid, sincere. \u201cBetter than I ever would. Picking a name is a real step in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>I blow out a breath, suddenly feeling aggrieved and very frustrated with myself. Hell, if picking a name is a step in the right direction, then that makes me just about the most tragic person in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d I say, rattled. \u201cI think I\u2019m tragic, Fen. I mean, look at me,\u201d I sweep my hands down myself, \u201cI have absolutely no clue who I am and I don\u2019t know if I ever will. I live in a hospital because I don\u2019t know where my home is. I\u2019m like some old lady that\u2019s lost her way \u2013\u201d My eyes are hot with tears. What the hell is wrong with me? And it\u2019s like now I\u2019ve started I can\u2019t seem to stop, and on I ramble, \u201c \u2013 and I can\u2019t stay here forever and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m gonna go, what I\u2019m gonna do, and the thought scares the hell out of me, and the best I\u2019m getting is what might not even be a teeny tiny glimpse of a memory. Great! Actually, no, its crap and I\u2019m a freak! And I\u2019m all alone in this! I have no one! Absolutely no one!\u201d I pause, breathing heavily. My face instantly flames with embarrassment at my outburst. I daren\u2019t look at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I utter, pressing my fingers under my eyes to catch the falling tears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for. And you\u2019re most definitely not a freak.\u201d I glance up at him through my lashes. His face is turned away from me and he\u2019s staring out the window. I can\u2019t make out his expression. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wrong, you know,\u201d he says after a moment, his voice deep, \u201cyou haven\u2019t got no one,\u201d he turns his head back to look at me and I\u2019m taken aback by the intensity of his gaze, \u201cyou\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>And I suddenly feel very nervous. He lifts his hand and tucks my hair behind my ear. My heart starts beating like a jackhammer. I\u2019m sure he must be able to hear it. He runs his fingertips down my jaw, his eyes never leaving mine, then he takes my face in his hands, leans forward and kisses me.</p><p>And it\u2019s good. Really good.</p><p>He kisses me gently, his tongue touching mine ever so slightly. He tastes of mint. He runs his fingers into my hair and I start to lose myself in him. In the kiss. My body floods with feelings for him I hadn\u2019t even realised I had until now. I want this so much . . .</p><p>Then, without warning, I\u2019m hit with a sharp stab of guilt, right smack bang in my chest. It literally knocks the wind out of me.</p><p>I pull away and push him from me, so hard he nearly falls off the bed.</p><p>Fen looks as surprised as I feel. I don\u2019t even know why I just did that. All I do know is that my face is prickling with guilt and I feel like I\u2019ve just betrayed someone by kissing him, by feeling this way about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, breathless, my heart pounding, \u201cI just \u2013\u201dI shake my head at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s me who should be sorry,\u201d he says, voice quickly switching to detached, eyes avoiding mine. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. It\u2019s far too soon for you \u2013 for anything like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He stands up abruptly and walks over to the window, resting his arm up against the frame.</p><p>I stare at his back, feeling at a loss. What is wrong with me? I have this wonderful guy here who likes me and I like him, really like him, yet I push him away the minute he gets close. Maybe I\u2019m right, maybe I am a freak</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Fen,\u201d I say in a quiet voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I really wanted you to kiss me but . . . I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d I shake my head, despairingly.</p><p>He turns and rests his back up against the window, crossing his arms over his chest. He looks at me and his tense features soften. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you,\u201d he says gently, \u201cyou\u2019ve been through a lot. It\u2019s understandable.\u201d He unfolds his arms and pushes his hands into his jeans pockets. \u201cI should go, though.\u201d He jerks his head in the direction of the door. \u201cIf I\u2019m late for dinner, my mum\u2019ll kill me.\u201d He smiles but I can tell it\u2019s forced.</p><p>I feel a shot of dismay. I don\u2019t want him to leave, not like this, but it\u2019s not like I can ask him to stay after what I\u2019ve just done, and I bet he can\u2019t wait to get away from me anyway, and I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d I say, trying to sound light, twisting my hands in my lap. \u201cAnd thanks \u2013 for being so understanding.\u201d I force a weak smile.</p><p>He shrugs lightly and pulls his hands from his pockets. \u201cBye, then,\u201d he says, holds his hand up in a half wave and heads for the door.</p><p>I stare at his retreating back suddenly feeling like I\u2019m drowning. What if he never comes back? What if I never see him again? I really don\u2019t want him to go. So say something for God\u2019s sake! Don\u2019t just let him leave thinking you don\u2019t want him.</p><p>\u201cFen, wait!\u201d I jump up off the bed.</p><p>He stops and turns back, eyes full of surprise. I walk toward him, my pulse quickening, my whole body trembling. I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m going to say, I\u2019m just hoping something will come, fast.</p><p>I lift my hand up to his face and stroke his smooth olive skin with my fingers. He really is gorgeous and he wants me. Happiness bubbles up inside me and I somehow manage to keep the smile from my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you know,\u201d I say tenderly.</p><p>His eyes flicker. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s too soon,\u201d I trace my finger over his beautiful mouth, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>A smile sneaks onto his lips. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>He takes hold of my hand and kisses it, then slides his arm around my waist and pulls me to him.</p><p>And this time when he kisses me I don\u2019t push him away.</p><p>It\u2019s deep and passionate. My head tingles with anticipation. I slide my arms around his neck. His hand trails down my back, sending electric sparks shooting through my stomach, heading straight toward my heart.</p><p>\u201cMinha linda menina,\u201d he murmurs, his lips grazing against mine.</p><p>I move back to scrutinise him. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He smiles shyly. \u201cMy beautiful girl.\u201d</p><p>I feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I lean forward and kiss him again.</p><p>When we finally break away, he slides his arms around me, pulling me close to him. I rest my head against his chest, breathing him in, listening to his beating heart. I feel safe. Happy. And I shove that horrible prickling sense of guilt away that\u2019s threatening to engulf me. I don\u2019t understand it and I certainly don\u2019t want it.</p><p>After a minute, he loosens an arm from around me and he lifts it to look at his watch. He sighs heavily. \u201cI\u2019m really gonna have to go this time,\u201d he says looking down at me regretfully. \u201cTables booked for eight.\u201d</p><p>I look at his watch. Seven forty-five it says. \u201cHmm, you better get a move on,\u201d I say and release myself from him.</p><p>He catches hold of my waist and pulls me back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go either.\u201d</p><p>He holds my chin with his thumb and forefinger and gazes down at me with his beautiful blue eyes. God, I really could get lost in them, in him.</p><p>\u201cAt\u00e9 amanh\u00e3,\u201d he says. I look at him quizzically. \u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . will you teach me some Portuguese \u2013 amanh\u00e3?\u201d I say, my eyebrow raised as I try to mirror his beautiful accent. It doesn\u2019t come off so well.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cSure.\u201d He presses his lips to my forehead with an air of finality and releases his hold on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pauses by the door, holding it open. \u201cAmanh\u00e3, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>My heart does a little somersault. \u201cAmanh\u00e3, Osvaldo.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me with those beautiful bright blue eyes of his, then retreats through the door.</p><p>I flop down onto my bed, my skin still tingling from his touch, a huge smile plastered on my face. I cover my face with my hands and simply concentrate on remembering the experience for a moment. Now that\u2019s a memory I\u2019ll definitely be holding on to . . .</p> <p>Okay, it\u2019s no use, it\u2019s still there. No matter how I may try and pretend it isn\u2019t, that annoying little feeling of guilt is insistent on prickling away at me.</p><p>Why do I feel so guilty about being with Fen?</p><p>Unless ..... no, that can\u2019t be right, but wait, maybe \u2013 I mean it could it be possible, possible that I have someone, someone like Fen who\u2019s out there looking for me, who misses me. Is that why I pushed Fen away, because my subconscious knows the truth?</p><p>I feel a rush of anger. Well, if I have, then where the hell is he, why hasn\u2019t he come for me? I\u2019ve been in the papers and on the television . . . unless he hasn\u2019t seen the press about me. Oh, come on, who am I kidding, he\u2019d have had to live in a hole not to have seen my face somewhere.</p><p>Conversely, if I am right and there is someone, why has he just left me? Maybe he doesn\u2019t want me anymore.</p> <p>I feel abandoned, alone. A lump forms in my throat and tears well up in my eyes. I swallow them back.</p><p>This is crazy! Why am I getting upset about an imaginary boyfriend I most likely don\u2019t even have? Stop being so stupid. I laugh out loud at the absurdity of it.</p><p>And I\u2019m not alone, I have Fen, and he\u2019s most definitely the future I want.</p><p>Brushing my stupidity aside, I pick the book up off the bed Fen brought me and flick to the first page.</p><p>I\u2019m three pages in, and I\u2019m not taking in a single word because my mind keeps drifting to Fen. I can\u2019t wait to see him tomorrow. I close my eyes and remember how he looked just before he left and how it felt to have his body pressed up against mine, and how very sexy he sounded when he spoke to me in Portuguese . . . Minha li - Minha lind- oh, whatever he called me, \u2018his beautiful girl\u2019. That\u2019s all I need to know. A shiver goes through my entire body. Oh and that kiss . . .</p><p>I think at some point I must have fallen asleep because I\u2019m not in my room anymore, I\u2019m in the most beautiful garden I\u2019ve ever seen and there are these purple flowers everywhere. I sense someone behind me and turn to see a man. Even though he\u2019s only standing a few feet away, I can\u2019t make out his face. It\u2019s all blurry and unclear. But I know in his presence I\u2019m safe. I feel happy and loved. He motions for me with his hand. I walk toward him until I\u2019m standing right before him. I look up at his face but it\u2019s still fuzzy. He lifts his hand and brushes my hair off my face. His hand feels so real, like he\u2019s actually here with me now. I can feel his skin on mine and he feels like heaven. Wherever his hand touches, it leaves a delicious trail of warmth in its wake.</p> <p>\u201cLuce, wake up, baby,\u201d he says, his tone deeply melodic.</p><p>Hmm, his voice blankets me . . . I feel so warm, so safe, and he smells familiar. What is that scent? Hang on \u2013 smell? - how can I smell him?</p><p>\u201cLuce baby, wake up,\u201d he says again.</p><p>That\u2019s when I feel the hand on my face and my mind instantly clicks in. I\u2019m not dreaming anymore, I\u2019m awake, and that voice I can hear \u2013 well it\u2019s here in my room with me right now. My breath catches in my throat as panic zips through me and my heart starts to beat wildly.</p><p>I don\u2019t recognise the voice. Something\u2019s not right. Why would someone be here in my room at this late hour except the nurses? And that voice most definitely does not belong to any of them. Instinctively I know something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>I flick my eyes open to find a man with dark hair, and even darker eyes, gazing down at me. And it\u2019s the intensity of his stare that unnerves me.</p><p>He slowly withdraws his hand away from my face and I\u2019m sure I see a trace of sadness in his eyes, but I\u2019m far too freaked out to register it properly.</p><p>I jump back in bed, practically climbing up the wall. Then I spot a woman standing in the corner of the room. I don\u2019t recognise her either. This only helps to raise my panic levels a good couple of notches.</p> <p>\u201cWho \u2013 who are you?\u201d I say, voice trembling, eyes flitting between the both of them.</p><p>I see a look of shock reverberate through the man\u2019s face but his features quickly soften.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he says, raising his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe. We\u2019re here to help you get your memory back.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Remember Me</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to help you,\u201d the dark haired man repeats softly.</p><p>I notice how dark it is outside and my eyes immediately flick to the clock. Ten thirty pm.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here? No visitors are allowed in after nine and there\u2019s no way the nurses would buzz you in . . .\u201d My stress level is rising along with my voice. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>The dark haired man glances back at the woman standing in the corner and looks back to me, his gaze wary. \u201cI\u2019m James and that\u2019s Isabel,\u201d he says thumbing over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m . . . well, I\u2019m your . . .\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who I am,\u201d he adds quietly, \u201cbut Isabel ,well, she\u2019s an . . . well, she\u2019s here to help you and \u2013\u201d He pauses and takes a deep breath. \u201cIsabel an . . . an . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an angel,\u201d she says.</p><p>I splutter out a laugh. I\u2019m looking at the both of them, expecting their serious faces to crack into humour any second now . . .</p><p>They don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously expecting me to believe you\u2019re \u2013\u201d I point at Isabel. \u201c\u2013 an angel.\u201d I can barely keep the grin off my face or the haughty tone from my voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says stringently.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to absorb,\u201d James intercepts, his voice warm, steady, \u201cbut it is the truth. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>And right here and now I\u2019ve decided that out of these two loons, I prefer talking to him.</p><p>He seems the nicer loon.</p><p>\u201cSo who are you then, the Easter Bunny?\u201d I deride, my eyes fixed on James as I very slowly and very quietly slide off my bed.</p><p>James raises his eyebrow and I can see his mouth twitching with amusement. I can tell he\u2019s struggling to keep the smile from his face which makes me warm to him, slightly, and I mean only slightly because obviously the guy is as crazy as hell.</p><p>I stand tall trying to exude confidence even though my body feels like it\u2019s made of rubber. \u201cOkay, so you both need to leave.\u201d I jerk my head in the direction of the door.</p><p>James stands. I see just how tall and broad he is. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, hands spread, palms down, \u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling right now. I\u2019ve learnt a lot of things recently I never would have believed possible, but we are telling you the truth.\u201d He presses a hand to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna just have to trust me on that one.\u201d</p><p>I let out a half-hearted laugh. \u201cTrust you? I don\u2019t know you to trust you. You two just appear here in my room whilst I\u2019m sleeping and wake me up telling me she\u2019s \u2013\u201d I jab a finger in Isabel\u2019s direction. \u201c\u2013 a bloody angel! Seriously, I want you to leave now.\u201d I point firmly toward the door, \u201cand if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m gonna . . .\u201d I stall trying to think of a good enough threat that will get these two nutters out of my room, \u201c\u2013 scream bloody murder!\u201d My whole body is trembling as I sidle toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJust wait a minute, please!\u201d And I can only assume it\u2019s the desperate tone in his voice that makes me stop because I can\u2019t think of any other reason why I would. \u201cI know I\u2019m not handling this very well \u2013\u201d He puts his hands up and looks pained, \u201cbut if you\u2019ll just stay and hear me out, Luce, I can explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Time clocks off for a moment. I\u2019m stock-still, wide eyed, mouth open.</p><p>Luce . . . Lucy? There\u2019s only one person who knows I was going to call myself Lucy and it\u2019s definitely not him.</p><p>\u201cLuce?\u201d I say my voice wobbling all over the place. \u201cWha- why . . . why did you call me that?\u201d</p><p>He looks momentarily confused before his face snaps into understanding. \u201cLuce is your name \u2013 well Lucyna\u2019s your actual name,\u201d he corrects himself, \u201cbut I always call you Luce.\u201d</p><p>My head\u2019s buzzing. Luce . . . Lucyna . . . Lucy. That can\u2019t be, can it? It could just be a coincidence, one hell of a coincidence, mind. But if it\u2019s not and he\u2019s telling the truth, that means he knows me. He could be the key to my past.</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2019s my \u2013 it\u2019s the name I \u2013\u201d I pause, my hands fidgeting with thin air. I stare at James, seeing in him my glimmer of hope, my chance to finally access the past I\u2019ve so desperately longed for. \u201cDid \u2013 do you know me . . . know who I am?\u201d</p><p>His expression softens. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d He pauses as though considering his words, then he says, \u201cWe were \u2013 are together.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in shock. \u201cTogether? Like boyfriend and girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. It reaches all the way up to his dark eyes. \u201cYeah, you could call us that.\u201d</p><p>And my blood begins to boil, so hot I can barely contain all the rage bubbling up inside me. All I see is red. \u201cSo where the hell have you been for the last four weeks?\u201d I yell.</p><p>James\u2019 face jolts in shock.</p><p>\u201cI woke up on that beach on my own with no memory of who I am! I was all alone! Why haven\u2019t you come for me before now? Four weeks! FOUR BLOODY WEEKS!\u201d I pause, chest heaving, my eyes hot with tears. Then I remember the nurses and other patients, and quickly rein in my anger.</p><p>The room is silent to the echo. Questions are uncontrollably spooling through my mind. James looks like he\u2019s not sure what to do and Isabel is stood there looking bored and untouched by my outburst. Finally I speak, in a voice now barely registering above a whisper, addressing James, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come for me sooner? Didn\u2019t . . . didn\u2019t you want me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wanted you!\u201d He clutches his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how much I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d He comes around the bed toward me but I back away from him. He stops in his tracks, hurt etched all over his face, but I\u2019m too consumed by my own grief to care. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where you were,\u201d he says, his voice quiet, regretful. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to go through all of this, Luce, really I am, but there was nothing I could do. One minute you were there, the next you were gone.\u201d</p><p>He fixes his pained eyes on mine and they\u2019re so intense I feel like they\u2019re burning into me, but even still, I can\u2019t seem to look away. \u201cIf I had known where you were I would have jumped on a plane and come here straight away, I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when I notice his accent. English. Like they said mine is. \u201cPlane?\u201d I repeat, confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI . . . we \u2013\u201d He points between the both of us. \u201c\u2013 live together at my house in London.

It doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s confusing,\u201d he says hurriedly, his face taut, \u201cbut, Luce, you\u2019re different to other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d I exclaim horrified. A hundred scenarios of 'different' flash through my mind, none of them good.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so different probably wasn\u2019t the best word.\u201d He smiles sheepishly. \u201cWhat I mean is you\u2019re special, Luce, and in a very good way. But it\u2019s all a lot to explain, too much, and you probably wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway if I told you. That\u2019s why Isabel\u2019s here. She\u2019s going to try and retrieve your memories for you, if you\u2019ll let her, and then you\u2019ll remember everything for yourself.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Isabel. Her eyes are already on me and she nods in agreement with James. My mind is still racing. I begin pacing around in attempt to try to gather my scattered thoughts. I mean this is all just crazy. CRAZY. But, if one ounce of what they\u2019re saying is the truth, it means I can finally find out who I am.</p><p>I stop and turn to Isabel. \u201cJust how exactly are you proposing to get my memory back \u2013 when all the doctors haven\u2019t been able to, and four weeks of intense therapy hasn\u2019t revived one single memory \u2013 just what makes you so special that you\u2019re gonna be able to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you what makes me special,\u201d she says simply.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, course!\u201d I scoff and slap my hand on my forehand, \u201cyou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p> <p>She rolls her eyes at me. She actually rolls her eyes. \u201cOkay, enough of this,\u201d Isabel says. She claps her hands together and everything stops. James stops moving. The look of stress that was furrowing his brow is now permanently fixed on his face. He\u2019s looks inert. And the room is so still and serene it seems as if even the air has stopped circulating. The only things that are animated are Isabel and me.</p><p>My head is prickling and my every instinct is on high alert. My mind is telling me to sprint from this room but, unfortunately, my legs don\u2019t seem to be agreeing as they\u2019re not going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what . . . have you done?\u201d I stammer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just frozen time \u2013 temporarily,\u201d she explains in a casual tone.</p><p>\u201cFr-frozen t-time? H-how?\u201d My voice is shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>She closes her eyes briefly and shakes her head. \u201cYou know how, Lucyna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou-you're really an angel.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cIs-is everyone frozen?\u201d</p><p>She throws her head back and laughs. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not that powerful. I\u2019ve just suspended time in here, except for you obviously.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick to James. \u201cIs he . . . is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d She waves her hand dismissively in James\u2019 direction. \u201cIt\u2019s just like he\u2019s taking a nap. Anyway, to more pertinent matters, I am sorry to have scared you, Lucyna, but James wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. I did think you\u2019d listen to him but obviously not \u2013 so I thought I\u2019d cut to the chase and, instead, show you that I am who I say I am. Do you now believe me?\u201d</p><p>My mind is frantically trying to keep up and I\u2019m unavoidably distracted by the statuesque sight of James. I swallow hard before managing an answer. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says with a brisk nod of her head. \u201cSo, as James said, I\u2019m here to help you try to retrieve your memories. We don\u2019t need to go into the whys and where-fors, it\u2019ll all be clear when you get your memories back \u2013 well if I can manage to get them back, but if it doesn\u2019t work then I will explain everything to you \u2013 is that okay?\u201d</p> <p>I nod slowly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get on with this, then.\u201d She claps her hands together and James is instantly reanimated.</p><p>He looks confused. He opens his mouth to speak but Isabel cuts him off with a wave of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, James. Lucyna understands now \u2013 don\u2019t you?\u201d Her green eyes are looking pointedly at me, \u201cand we\u2019re going to try to retrieve your memories, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper in my weak voice.</p><p>My eyes move to James. He keeps looking between Isabel and me. He is confused, to put it mildly, but he says nothing.</p><p>And now I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. It\u2019s like I\u2019m seeing him for the first time. Isabel has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt what they\u2019ve been saying is the truth. Which means he and I were together. He was my boyfriend. I must have loved him. And if Isabel can do what she says she can, then I\u2019ll remember that. And it feels . . . strange. He\u2019s really good looking, I can\u2019t deny that. But to know that very soon I will feel overwhelming love for this stranger standing in front of me is . . . well it\u2019s just plain weird.</p><p>\u201cLucyna,\u201d Isabel\u2019s voice pulls me back to the here and now, \u201clet\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly I pull my eyes from James to her. \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>She positions herself on the edge of my bed. \u201cSit down.\u201d She pats the space in front of her. Gingerly I climb onto my bed. James, seemingly coming to his senses, sits himself down in the chair.</p><p>\u201cI need you to give me access to your mind,\u201d she says. \u201cYou grant me permission and I\u2019ll do my best to see if I can penetrate this wall that\u2019s been put up to shield your memories from you.\u201d</p><p>I feel a stab of panic. What if I don\u2019t like what I remember? I must have forgotten everything for a reason \u2013 mustn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cHow did I lose my memory?\u201d I ask, my voice jumping about with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole it from you,\u201d she says in a calm, even voice.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips together in tight line. \u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Her words do nothing to appease me or answer my question, but I find myself agreeing to do as she asks.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Her voice suddenly sounds very businesslike, \u201cfirstly you need to give me your permission.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cYou have my permission, Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow give me your hands . . .\u201d I place my hands in her already outstretched ones, \u201cand close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Before I do, I glance over at James. His eyes are fixed intensely on me.</p><p>\u201cLucyna, close your eyes,\u201d Isabel repeats, somewhat impatiently.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d I blink myself free and close my eyes, but not before I catch the heart-warming smile that appears on James\u2019 lips.</p><p>\u201cNow, Lucyna, I need you to focus on that dense wall in your mind and push as hard as you can against it.\u201d</p><p>I go to the blackness I\u2019ve been inanely fighting against for all of this time, and do as she says.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Just keep doing that,\u201d Isabel encourages me. But now, the words I hear are not shared, they\u2019re inside my head.</p><p>She begins chanting in my mind, \u2018Memoria solvo . . . memoria solvo\u2019 over and over again.</p><p>I wait with bated breath for something to happen, and I wait, and wait.</p><p>Nothing\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no sudden return of my memories. Maybe it\u2019s me. Maybe I\u2019m not doing enough. I squeeze my eyes tighter shut, scrunching up my face and shove all my mental strength at the wall. I feel warmth trickle through my head but it disappears as quickly as it arrived.</p><p>Isabel releases her grip on my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d she says, sounding frustrated.</p><p>I open up my eyes, feeling incredibly despondent.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something else you can try?\u201d James asks hopefully.</p><p>She glances sideways at him. \u201cMaybe.\u201d She pauses, pondering a thought. \u201cWell, I could try and use your energy to increase the power, James. But if I do, you\u2019ll be weakened and feel unwell for quite some time afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he says without hesitation.</p><p>Compassion wells up inside me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>\u201cYes I do.\u201d He looks at me with those dark, unfathomable eyes of his and my stomach flips. \u201cI want you back, Luce, and I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say to that, so I say nothing.</p><p>Isabel gets up off the bed, walks around to the other side of it and stays standing. \u201cSit with your back to me,\u201d she instructs. I do as she says, so now I\u2019m sat facing James, my legs crossed in front of me. \u201cJames, take hold of Lucyna\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his chair up close to the bed and puts his hands out for me to take. I slip my hands into his. And the instant my skin touches his, my whole body ignites and I know we fit together. My mind may not know him but my body most certainly does, and it\u2019s telling me he is right. My skin is tingling and prickling. It\u2019s a powerful and overwhelming sensation. I lift my blue eyes up to meet his dark ones and I see how they carry my reflection. And more than anything I desperately want to remember, for James\u2019 sake as much as my own, because I know hidden somewhere in my mind are my feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cJames, Lucyna, close your eyes.\u201d Isabel\u2019s voice comes from behind me, breaking the spell. She places her hands around my head. Reluctantly, I tear my gaze from James and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow, James,\u201d Isabel says softly. \u201cFocus all your energy onto Lucyna, think about how you feel for her, think of the happy times you shared together, and let those thoughts flow from you straight into her. And, Lucyna, I need you to do as you did before, focus on breaking through that wall.\u201d</p><p>Right, focus . . . focus. Break through that wall . . .</p><p>James does seem really lovely, nothing like the nut job I first thought he was. I mean, look at what he\u2019s doing for me. And I wonder how we were together. I think we must have been happy. He seems to like me a lot. Well, hopefully I\u2019ll know soon enough. Nothing seems to be happening in my head, though, just like before. I bet we look really weird, the three of us in this position. We probably look like we\u2019re doing some form of weird meditation.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate, Lucyna!\u201d Isabel's strict voice commands in my head. I feel like a naughty child that\u2019s been caught out daydreaming in class by the teacher.</p><p>I snap myself out of my reverie and slip my mind into gear, focussing all my energy on getting my memories back and, at the click of a finger, I feel it. The warmth I felt before is rushing through my head but it is more intense this time. And it\u2019s not only in my head, its flowing all around my body, coming up through my hands from James. His hands tighten around mine. I wonder if he can feel it too.</p><p>Isabel begins chanting in my mind again. This time the words are coming quicker and an accent is lacing her voice, \u201cMemoria Solvo. Memoria Solvo. Memoria Solvo.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I too find myself too echoing her words, and my head instantly feels very hot and light. I feel sick. And that\u2019s when it happens. The wall starts to crumble and the memories flood into my mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I know.</p><p>Who I am \u2013 was. I know James. I know everything.</p><p>My head is aching and my eyes feel heavy, but I force them open. James is the first thing I see. And the relief I feel at seeing him is immense, to say the least. I feel like I haven\u2019t seen him for an eternity.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d His eyes flick open and I see how drained he looks. \u201cI remember,\u201d I say, and the relief that washes into his eyes makes mine fill with tears.</p> <p>Isabel removes her hands from my head and I sense her stepping away from the bed. I launch myself into James\u2019 arms and he holds me tight to him. I bury my face into his neck and breathe him in.</p><p>I\u2019m finally home.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you for good,\u201d he says, his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>I lift my head up to look at him. His eyes are shining. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Tears are now running down my face. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He holds my face in his hands, smoothing my tears away with his thumbs. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be sorry for.\u201d Then his hands are in my hair and he\u2019s kissing every part of my face, my lips, my cheek, my forehead, my nose, every inch of my skin covered with his touch. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you, Luce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper. Then I suddenly remember Arlo. My thoughts escape me. \u201cArlo,\u201d I say bitterly. James looked confused. \u201cI asked him to send me to earth and make me human so I could be with you and he went mad, but I forced him to do it, and I knew there was something wrong but it was too late, and then I was in so much pain and he must have taken my memory away and . . .\u201d The words are just tumbling incoherently out of me.</p><p>\u201cSsh, Luce, calm down. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He smooths my hair with his hand. \u201cTake a deep breath and start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>I sit back onto the bed but keep a firm hold of James\u2019 hand, afraid that if I let him go I might lose him again. Then I start at the moment Arlo took me from James\u2019 kitchen and I recount the events leading up to this moment. Both James and Isabel listen intently as I tell my story.</p><p>Then I reach the hard bit.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d I fix my gaze on him. I know what I have to say, but I\u2019m worried about how he\u2019s going to react to it. I take a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know . . . about us . . . about you \u2013 our history together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Isabel told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout Arran?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look away. He squeezes my hand and I bring my eyes back to his.</p><p>\u201cYou love me \u2013 don\u2019t you?\u201d I can hear the doubt faltering his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I say, determinedly. \u201cI love you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d He smiles hesitantly.</p><p>I hold his gaze, willing him to see the truth I know he doubts. He\u2019s the first to look away. I don\u2019t push it any further. Right now I\u2019m just happy to be here with him.</p><p>So, on I continue with my story. I\u2019m just at the part about Arlo\u2019s eyes changing colour and the pain I felt when he changed me, when Isabel interjects. \u201cWe should go now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll take you both back to James\u2019 house.\u201d</p> <p>I spin round to Isabel. \u201cLeave? Now? But I can\u2019t! What about Fen?\u201d My breath catches in my throat and a sick feeling washes over me like a tidal wave.</p><p>Fen. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t thought about him until now. I can see from the corner of my eye that James is looking at me curiously thanks to my unscheduled outburst. My face instantly heats under his stare. I swallow down. \u201cAnd Dr Woods and all the nurses,\u201d I add albeit a little belatedly, but hoping it will add the right effect, \u201cI can\u2019t just leave without a word to any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to,\u201d Isabel says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to speak to anyone. Questions would be asked that you can\u2019t answer. It\u2019s best if we leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Fen?\u201d James asks with an inquisitive tone to his voice.</p><p>Oh no. What do I say? I don\u2019t think James will take the fact that only a few hours ago I was in Fen\u2019s arms kissing him very well at all. Memory or no memory. And really it\u2019s just not the time with Isabel here and everything that\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll talk to him later about it.</p><p>I plaster a smile onto my face and turn to him. I can see in his eyes he knows something\u2019s amiss. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend,\u201d I say in the calmest voice I can muster. \u201cHe\u2019s the lifeguard who helped me that day on the beach and he\u2019s been watching out for me ever since. He\u2019s been really good to me.\u201d</p><p>He pauses for a moment before speaking. \u201cRight,\u201d he says with a nod and appears to let it go, saying nothing more on the subject. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because he\u2019s so drained or because he actually believes me. I glance over at Isabel and I know she knows differently. She says nothing.</p><p>So I\u2019m back to lying to James again. Great. And the guilt I now feel is nothing compared to the guilt I was feeling earlier when I was memory-less. Now it\u2019s of epic proportions.</p><p>Arlo. This is all his fault. I can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s done to me. I thought he was my friend. If it wasn\u2019t for him I would never have met Fen and I would never have developed these feelings for him, causing problems between James and me. But is that what I would really want \u2013 to never have met Fen? I can\u2019t think about that now. The main question here is how did Arlo manage to take my memory? He doesn\u2019t have the power to overcome free will. Well, he must have, because he overcame mine. None of this makes any sense. But these are questions I\u2019ll have to deal with later because right now I have to deal with the fact that Isabel wants me to up and leave without saying goodbye to Fen. He\u2019ll be worried if I just disappear. I can\u2019t do that to him.</p><p>I feel like the worst person in the world for saying this, but I have to do something. \u201cI just can\u2019t leave without a word,\u201d I say meekly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel\u2019s right,\u201d James assures me. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, these people are your friends, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any other choice.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, defeated. Then I have a thought. \u201cCan I leave a note?\u201d I look at Isabel hopefully.</p><p>Her brow furrows and she takes a moment before answering. \u201cOkay. As long as you don\u2019t say who you really are or where you\u2019re going \u2013 then yes.\u201d</p><p>I climb off my bed and retrieve a pen and rip out a piece of paper from my notebook. I press the pen to paper and start to write . . .</p><p>Fen,</p><p>I have to leave. I\u2019m so sorry to go without saying goodbye.</p><p>Thank you for everything. Truly. I would never have got through these last four weeks without you. I want you to know how much you mean to me.</p><p>Please don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I pause, hovering over how to sign it. I glance back over what I\u2019ve already written and see just how ineffective these words really are. Then I suddenly recall Fen\u2019s earlier words to me - \u2018Estou t\u00e3o feliz que voc\u00ea veio em minha vida linda menina.\u2019 This time around my vast knowledge of languages allows me to know exactly what it was he said, what he didn\u2019t want me to know at the time \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m so glad you came into my life, beautiful girl.\u2019</p><p>My eyes start to sting with tears and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m turned away from James so he can\u2019t see. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, keeping them at bay. When I feel safe enough to do so, I open them and finish the note.</p><p>Estou t\u00e3o feliz que voc\u00ea entrou na minha vida, minha linda Fen.</p><p>Eu nunca vou te esquecer. Lembrar de mim.</p><p>Lucy</p><p>xx</p><p>I fold it over, sealing my pain inside, and stand it up on the table.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d James says. I turn around to see him standing before me. Concern is lining his face. He looks exhausted. His skin is considerably paler than normal and I know it\u2019s all because of what he did for me.</p><p>Guilt spikes me again and I quell it. With a smile I reach over and take hold of his hand. His warmth floods me. He smiles down at me with tired eyes.</p><p>I take a surreptitious glance around my home of the last month. I can see Fen everywhere. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m just leaving him like this. There\u2019s an ache now rooted deep within me which I don\u2019t think will ever go. But I have James back now and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Bad Penny</p><p>We\u2019ve been sitting together in the living room in silence, James and I, for oh . . . I\u2019d say about twenty minutes now. Not one single word has been uttered between us since Isabel left on her quest to try to locate Arlo. She said its imperative she finds him.</p><p>Me? Well the fact that Isabel thinks it\u2019s imperative to find him unnerves me undoubtedly, but I can\u2019t let myself think about him or why he\u2019s done what he\u2019s done. If I do, it\u2019ll open up a whole stack of questions my brain and my heart . . . well, mainly my heart, can\u2019t tolerate at the moment. It\u2019s trying to cope with enough, so to ask any more of it would be abject sadism.</p><p>James sighs heavily. His hot breath blows down through my hair, blistering over my skin. His arms tighten around me, pulling me closer. And even though we are close, about as close as two people can be, I know the issues sitting between us could span a distance the size of the Grand Canyon. He\u2019s bothered by our history. I can tell by every tap of his finger against my skin, by every deep breath he takes and every sigh he expels, that he\u2019s considering everything, considering us, considering me. He may as well have thought bubbles transmitting from his head.</p><p>But he\u2019s not ready to talk about it. Neither am I. Hence the silent reflection.</p><p>James\u2019 chest once again rises up as he draws another deep breath. I hold mine waiting to see if he\u2019s going to speak. He doesn\u2019t. I breathe out and wonder just how much longer this can go on for.</p><p>After a few more minutes of dead calm, I lift my head up and look at him, seeing his pallid exterior, the darkness sitting under his closed eyes. He doesn\u2019t look right. Isabel using his energy seems to have taken more out of him than it should have.</p><p>I reach up and gently brush his hair back off his forehead with my fingers. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d I say. \u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>He opens his heavy eyes and looks down into mine. \u201cI will in a minute. I just want to stay here for a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t argue. I rest my head back onto his shoulder and press my body closer to him, comforting myself in his scent, and curl my leg up against his.</p><p>Hang on, wasn\u2019t that his broken leg?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say surprised, \u201cyour pot\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, yeah, Isabel fixed it before we came for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, right . . .\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He begins stroking my hair. \u201cIt was really hard without you here, Luce. I don\u2019t ever want it to happen again.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to say anything more. The undertone to his voice has said it all. I know we\u2019re going to be okay.</p><p>I hold back my tears and press my lips to his neck. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not going anywhere ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it\u2019s at this exact moment I feel him. Arlo\u2019s here. How did I not anticipate this?</p><p>I pull away from James and turn to see him casually leant up against the wall across from us. He has a glow about him I\u2019ve never seen before. And when his lips form into a smile, it does nothing to calm my fears about his reason for being here.</p><p>\u201cArlo,\u201d I say breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lucyna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d James' confused voice comes from beside me.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk,\u201d Arlo says.</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes, talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>I look of anger flickers over Arlo\u2019s face. \u201cBut I want to talk to you.\u201d His voice comes out measured, controlled.</p><p>\u201cYou heard her,\u201d James says in a menacing tone. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, so why don\u2019t you just disappear back under whatever rock it was you crawled out from.\u201d</p><p>Arlo doesn\u2019t even bother to acknowledge James. His eyes are fixed on mine and, try as I might, I can\u2019t look away. I\u2019m held in his stare.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Arlo looks confused. \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t. The Arlo I know would never have taken my memory without my permission and dumped me off ten thousand miles away from where I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>He presses his lips together and has the audacity to look forlorn. \u201cI am sorry about that,\u201d he offers.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I jump out of my seat. \u201cSORRY! You stole my memory from me! And if it wasn\u2019t for Isabel I\u2019d still be stuck out there now without a clue! How could you do that to me?\u201d If looks could kill, Arlo would be dead to the ground right about now. If he was killable, that is. And my heart is pounding so hard it feels like it\u2019s about to burst out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry,\u201d His tone is impassive, not really giving the impression he is, \u201cbut I was angry and it\u2019s not exactly like you left me with any other choice,\u201d he adds. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit back and let you come here to him \u2013\u201d I see his eyes darken as he gestures angrily in James\u2019 direction, \u201cand live in your little happily ever after, not after all the hard work I\u2019ve put in.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, frustrated. \u201cHard work?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly, an earnest look capturing his face. \u201cDo you still not see it, Lucyna?\u201d</p><p>I feel angry, small, stupid and his calm confidence is unnerving me. I grit my teeth together. \u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with you.\u201d James\u2019 quiet voice comes from behind me.</p><p>Silenced, I glance down at James. His eyes are on Arlo. I follow his gaze over to Arlo whose expression is unreadable. But the moment my eyes meet his I see the adoration in them and the realisation comes screaming down on me.</p> <p>I sink back into my seat. \u201cYou love me?\u201d The words sound gloopy as they leave my mouth.</p><p>Arlo\u2019s features soften. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, dumbfounded. I grip my fingers into the plush sofa, suddenly feeling off balance. \u201cBut all this time and you\u2019ve never said anything \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to but there was always something, or someone, getting in the way.\u201d I see his jaw tense up.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2013but,\u201d I rub my forehead, \u201cwhy would you abandon me out there if you love me . . . I don\u2019t under\u2013\u201d And just like that I get it, like a slap across the face. I can\u2019t believe how stupid I\u2019ve been. My whole body stiffens. \u201cYou did it to keep me away from James.\u201d Then a chilling thought occurs to me. My eyes snap up at him. \u201cDid you have anything to do with Arran leaving?\u201d</p><p>He says nothing. He just mirrors my gaze. But then he doesn\u2019t need to say anything. I can see the answer in his eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m seething. White hot rage obliterates my common sense. \u201cAll of this has been because you love me!\u201d I mock the word, wanting to sound as condescending as possible. But the instant it\u2019s out I know I\u2019ve made a mistake.</p><p>Arlo\u2019s face hardens. His anger fills up the room. It\u2019s suffocating. I hold my breath waiting for him to erupt. Then I feel James\u2019s hand curl around mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Arlo says slowly, his voice cold.</p><p>James laughs, awkwardly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve heard that challenging tone in Arlo\u2019s voice before and I ended up in Australia with no memory. I panic. I know Arlo\u2019s capabilities and James is only human. For that matter, so am I. There is no way I can protect him. And even if I was still of my celestial form, I doubt I could measure up to whatever Arlo now is.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say calmly. I slide my hand out from underneath James\u2019. I can feel his eyes on me but I don\u2019t look at him. Instead I hold my hands together, resting them on my lap, and ask Arlo in an even voice, \u201cSo why are you here? What is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, let me think, what do I want?\u201d He thrums his fingers against his chin. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always wanted!\u201d he suddenly snaps. \u201cFor you to notice me. For you to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI do.\u201d I try to say this with as much sincerity as I can muster.</p><p>Arlo appraises me with his eyes. \u201cBut not like you do him, Arran \u2013 James or whatever it is he goes by these days.\u201d He waves a dismissive hand in James\u2019 direction. \u201cNo, right from the start I was always Arlo the best friend, Arlo the confidant. And I bided my time, thinking things would change, that you would one day love me in the way I do you and just when it seemed you were beginning to, that my time was finally coming, Arran showed up. And that was it. I became invisible. You didn\u2019t need me anymore . . . so I made it so you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurts her in the worst way possible,\u201d James interjects, \u201cso she turns to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharp, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Arlo rolls his eyes in James\u2019 direction. \u201cYou think he\u2019d have improved over the years \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t . . . and don\u2019t you mean you hurt her.\u201d Arlo\u2019s eyes narrow onto James.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2013I just don\u2019t believe this,\u201d I stammer, breaking into their angry stare.</p><p>Arlo raises his eyebrows at me. \u201cCome on, Lucyna. I wasn\u2019t going to give you up that easily. I had to do something, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t turn out quite as I had planned. Instead of seeking solace in me, as I figured you would, you wanted to run away, to forget \u2013 to become a Bringer.\u201d He shakes his head and quietly chuckles to himself. \u201cI certainly did not see that one coming. But then that\u2019s what I love about you, Lucyna, you never cease to surprise me, even after all this time.\u201d The way he\u2019s looking at me, with such intensity, makes my stomach curdle and it takes everything in me not to baulk.</p><p>\u201cSo I made the best of a bad situation,\u201d Arlo says, shrugging lightly, \u201cand I lowered myself to that realm to be with you, but that you know already. I always hoped you would one day feel again, but really I was just so happy for it to be the two of us as before. Then he goes and turns up like a bad penny and spoils everything.\u201d</p><p>Arlo bends his knee and rests his foot up against the wall. He looks so casual standing there, like he\u2019s merely a friend who\u2019s dropped by for a quick chat, not a heavenly being with a hidden, not to mention very dangerous, agenda.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d waited too long for you, Lucyna, invested too much time,\u201d he continues. \u201cLosing you was never an option. So I arranged his little car accident. And he was supposed to die there and be instantly reborn into another human being as always. You wouldn\u2019t know where he was, problem solved, but then, for some reason, you were called to him. I still don\u2019t quite understand how that happened because he should never have a Bringer. He can\u2019t return to Heaven, you know this. But I knew that night in the stadium there was something wrong, I could tell by your reaction. And if I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d think someone was working against me.\u201d He smiles wryly. \u201cSo I followed you, and there you were, saving him. Then Isabel showed up to keep tabs on you both and I couldn\u2019t do a thing. Seriously,\u201d he adds, addressing James, \u201cif there was some way for me to get rid of you permanently I would do it, and I mean that, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.\u201d He grins, menacingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 insane,\u201d James spits.</p><p>\u201cWhen love is not madness, it is not love.\u201d He taps his hand against the hollow expanse of his chest. \u201cPedro Calder\u00f3n. Not that I\u2019d expect you to know who he was.\u201d Arlo looks back to me. \u201cSo where was I? Ah yes, I had to leave you here with him \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are telling me all of this?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He smooths his golden hair back. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long time pretending to be someone I\u2019m not in the hope you\u2019d one day love me. That obviously hasn\u2019t worked, so I\u2019m giving the real me a try.\u201d</p><p>I honestly have no idea what to say to that.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish for me to continue?\u201d Arlo asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cRight, well I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with Isabel constantly around and, until I could figure it out, I thought I\u2019d use his little friend Sara to keep things interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d James splutters, aghast.</p><p>\u201cHmm, yes.\u201d</p><p>James stands up. \u201cIf you\u2019ve hurt her, I\u2019ll \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Arlo laughs, derisively.</p><p>My stomach drops hollow. I slowly stand up beside James. \u201cIs Sara okay?\u201d</p><p>He wafts a dismissive hand. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. All I did was magnify the girl\u2019s feelings for him, and I really didn\u2019t have to work that hard as she\u2019s already completely besotted with him.\u201d His face turns serious and his green eyes pierce straight into mine. \u201cHe did kiss her back that day, you know, the day you caught them, and he\u2019d have done a lot more if you hadn\u2019t have interrupted, no matter what he says.\u201d</p><p>James laughs. \u201cNice try.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s talking shit, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>But Arlo\u2019s picked at a weak spot in me and that is what he knows.</p><p>\u201cNo matter, I know the truth,\u201d he hums knowingly, and winks at me. I feel like I\u2019ve got bugs crawling all over my skin, \u201cbut that\u2019s the problem with you, Lucyna, you\u2019ve never been able to see straight when it comes to him. So I was forced to resort to desperate measures to bring you back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done, Arlo?\u201d I rub my bare arms, suddenly feeling cold.</p><p>And for the first time since he got here, he actually looks uncertain. His armour chinks and I see a glimpse of the Arlo I used to know. There's a gap before he actually speaks and, when he does, his voice sounds tight. \u201cI think you know.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cOh no, Arlo.\u201d I shake my head despairingly.</p><p>And just like that he turns black. \u201cHe owed me from a long time ago. I once helped him out of a tight spot,\u201d he confides, trying to feign nonchalance, but I can hear the pride in his voice. \u201cSo I called in the favour to get rid of Arran the first time, but then I was all out of favours and you know he won\u2019t do anything for free so . . .\u201d He shrugs, leaving his words hanging in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallow down hard. \u201cYou gave him your soul.\u201d</p><p>He strokes his hand down his jacket. \u201cSold. Not given. And yes, amongst other things. And I got a good price for it.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s the exact moment when I realise that I\u2019ve lost my best friend for good. I wipe the stray tear from my eye. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust before I brought you back \u2013 so I could bring you back.\u201d</p> <p>I rub my temples. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me sincerely. \u201cFor you, Lucyna. I\u2019ll do anything to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve wasted your time,\u201d James says, sounding surprisingly calm, \u201cbecause you\u2019re never going to have her.\u201d</p><p>Arlo glances in James\u2019 direction, a blas\u00e9 look on his face. \u201cAnd who says so \u2013 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I can hear from the tone in James\u2019 voice that he\u2019s picking a fight.</p> <p>Arlo laughs discordantly and raises an eyebrow. \u201cHmm, this could be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, James, this isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d I plead quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her,\u201d Arlo smarts, nodding his head.</p><p>James looks down at me. His dark eyes are blazing. \u201cI can\u2019t just do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d I say. \u201cGo to Sara\u2019s, make sure she\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll stay here and talk this through with Arlo.\u201d Okay, so I have no idea exactly what it is that I\u2019m going to say to Arlo, but I need to get James out of here quickly before Arlo does something to hurt him.</p><p>James looks at me, astonished. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here alone with him!\u201d Then he makes a show of taking hold of my hand, the hand that\u2019s been nervously pulling at the hem of my t-shirt.</p> <p>I see Arlo\u2019s eyes harden. The green in them quickly disperses, to be replaced with the bright yellow just like before. He rests his foot back on the floor and straightens himself up.</p><p>I have to stop this, now.</p><p>\u201cJames, please, you can\u2019t win this,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he states angrily, \u201cbut there is no way I\u2019m leaving you here with him, so we\u2019re leaving together.\u201d He turns to go, taking me with him.</p><p>I make to speak but I\u2019m too late.</p><p>The energy in the room ramps up so high I feel like every hair on my body is stood on end. It all happens in a nanosecond. James\u2019 hand pulls from mine and I watch helplessly as his body flies at high speed across the room and smashes straight into the wall. I hear the sickening crack of his bones. He drops to the floor, debris cascading down over him.</p><p>\u201cThe only person leaving here is you, Arran,\u201d I hear Arlo mutter through my muted screams.</p><p>Chapter 24</p> <p>The Art of Delusion</p><p>It\u2019s strange how a second can feel like an hour, and even stranger is how many thoughts can rush through your mind in that one second.</p><p>Stupid, irrelevant thoughts.</p><p>Like how James has only just got his pot removed, and how that\u2019s his favourite t-shirt he\u2019s wearing. And the picture frame that\u2019s laid on the floor, broken beside him, contains a photo of him and Max, the last one they had taken together before he died. He\u2019ll be devastated if it\u2019s ruined.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t moved yet. I know it\u2019s only been about two seconds since he collided with the wall, but he would move if he was okay, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Should I panic?</p><p>Or maybe I already am, because something is tearing up in and around my veins, and I have this odd constricting pain in my heart, like there\u2019s a hand gripping hold of it.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t seem real. None of this seems real. Maybe disbelief has taken me over and paralysed me, or maybe it isn\u2019t real. Maybe this is just a really, really bad dream.</p><p>My eyes wash down, shutting it all out. Everything\u2019s eerily silent, almost as if the world's holding its breath, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen next.</p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>No, it\u2019s real. He\u2019s still laid there on the floor, motionless, blood trickling from his head down onto the wooden floor.</p><p>Come on, James, move baby, you can do it.</p><p>Four seconds.</p><p>No, it\u2019s been too long now.</p><p>And in the snap of a finger, I\u2019m running toward him, crying out his name. The words are tearing up in my throat.</p><p>Please, be okay. Please, be okay.</p><p>Then I stop.</p><p>I\u2019m all but a foot away from James and I can\u2019t move. And it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to because, believe me, I want to. I\u2019m trying but I\u2019ve lost all control over my body.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Lucyna,\u201d Arlo commands.</p><p>And like an obedient animal, I do. I can\u2019t not. He\u2019s controlling my body, governing every move I now make.</p><p>I glance across at James. Tears spill from my eyes, running in quick succession down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes involuntarily move to Arlo. He looks calm, impeccable. Not a golden hair out of place, not a sliver of emotion showing on his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d I gulp back the tears, I\u2019m unable to wipe away.</p><p>He sits down in the chair opposite me, relaxed, arms spread out across the back of the seat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucyna, but you always knew how this was going to go. I was never going to allow you be with him. You belong to me.\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019m filled with a rage I didn\u2019t even know existed. I feel like there\u2019s fireworks\u2019 going off in my head, firing about every which way. And all I know is that I hate him. Hate him. HATE HIM.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong to you,\u201d I spit, venom snaking my voice. \u201cYou disgust me. I hate you.\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back and roars out a laugh. \u201cWell, there is a fine line between love and hate, so I\u2019m half the battle won.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>I stare at him speechless. Does he have no feelings left in him at all? How can this be the Arlo that I\u2019ve spent the better part of an eternity with? No, I can\u2019t accept that he\u2019s totally gone. There has to be some goodness left in there somewhere.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten who you are \u2013 were - your very reason for being?\u201d I implore.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d he throws back at me. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you didn\u2019t think twice before turning your back on our home for your own selfish reasons . . . and on more than once occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2013that was different,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You left home and changed all in the name of love, Lucyna, and that is all I\u2019ve done. We\u2019re not so different, you and I. And that\u2019s why we belong together. I understand you better than you do yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like you! I would never do what you\u2019ve done, become what you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you? Not even if it meant you could have the one thing you wanted above all else . . . not even if it meant you could save your precious James by doing so?\u201d</p><p>I glance over to James. He\u2019s still not moving. Tears fill my eyes. I blink them back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, but even I can hear the doubt in my voice. \u201cPlease, Arlo, just let me get James some help.\u201d I look deep into his calm yellow eyes, pleading for compassion.</p><p>He looks past me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames doesn\u2019t deserve this \u2013 this isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about me and you \u2013 he\u2019s done nothing wrong \u2013 he desperately needs to see a doc\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d he roars, jumping up out of his seat. I flinch. \u201cIt\u2019s always him, him, him! What about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all about you!\u201d I fire back. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of you!\u201d</p><p>I stare at him hard, my chest heaving. I can see his jaw working angrily and his eyes look like they\u2019re on fire.</p><p>After a moment he sits himself back down in the chair and begins tapping his fingers on the arm rest. \u201cTell me about the lifeguard,\u201d he says.</p><p>My stomach tightens. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to live?\u201d He inclines his head toward James.</p><p>I sigh, defeated. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him \u2013 the lifeguard?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to answer this. I know he\u2019s tricking me in some way. There\u2019s a catch in it somewhere. And if I give the wrong answer, I could be putting Fen in danger too.</p><p>So I do the only thing I can, evade it. \u201cHe was good to me,\u201d I say. \u201cHe helped me when I needed help.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really answering my question, though, is it?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not in love with him.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m falling into his trap but I can\u2019t but help ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs lightly. \u201cBecause it sure felt a lot like love when you were kissing him . . . or should I say me.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick. And dizzy. I stare at him, dumbstruck. \u201cYou\u2019re Fen?\u201d I exclaim, finding my voice.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nods. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to realise, Lucyna. I\u2019m always there. Wherever you are, I will always be alongside you. You can never get away from me.\u201d His lips curve up. \u201cAnd did you really think I\u2019d leave you out there all alone? What do you take me for? The only regret I have is that when we shared our first kiss, I had to be in the body of that dim-witted mortal.\u201d</p><p>My stomach turns over and, for a moment, I actually think I\u2019m going to throw up. I feel wounded. And violated. I need to scrub him off me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you \u2013?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it?\u201d he interrupts.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I can do anything I want now,\u201d he says proudly. He has this really smug look on his face which, if I wasn\u2019t human and immobile, I would really love to wipe off.</p><p>\u201cI just \u2018borrowed\u2019 him for a while, well, his body. It was an easy way for me to stay off Isabel\u2019s radar and mask your essence at the same time, by being so close to you, you see. Every day I spent with you I could see your feelings growing for me. I always knew you loved me deep down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have feelings for you!\u201d I rage. \u201cI had feelings for Fen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was him. And your kissing me told me everything I needed to know.\u201d</p><p>I laugh hollowly. \u201cIt told you nothing except that I was lonely and I was drawn to his . . . his looks. And if for one second I had known it was you, I would never have touched him.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t flicker. \u201cI beg to differ,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cYou have feelings for me. You\u2019re just not ready to admit them to yourself yet. But that\u2019s okay because we\u2019ve got plenty of time for you to come to terms with them. I\u2019ve waited this long. I can wait a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>I look at him with utter disgust and contempt. I can\u2019t believe I once thought this thing was my friend. He\u2019s so self-serving, so callous.</p><p>\u201cI think you just manipulated the situation to your advantage, Arlo. I think you manipulated me into having feelings for Fen.\u201d</p><p>He actually looks like I\u2019ve hit him really hard. \u201cI didn\u2019t manipulate you. It\u2019s the one situation where I actually didn\u2019t have to do anything. Everything you did, Lucyna, you did of your own free will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know I would never have done anything with him freely, and I\u2019ve had enough now. I\u2019m done with his games. The more time races on, the less chance James has.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d I ask, ensuring to keep my voice firm and steady.</p><p>He looks at me confused. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning \u2013 have you achieved what you came here to achieve or are we going to sit here forever and a day discussing your delusions? Because if we are, then please just put me out of my misery now.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs loudly. It echoes around the room. \u201cYes. We are just about done. We can go now if you want . . . or do you want to stay and watch your boyfriend take his final breath.\u201d</p><p>My heart constricts. \u201cOh no, no, no, don\u2019t kill him,\u201d I say panicked. \u201cPlease. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll come with you wherever you want. Just don\u2019t kill him, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice of you to offer,\u201d he muses, smoothing his hand over his hair. \u201cBut you were always coming with me. And he \u2013\u201d he points a finger, and glances over at James, a smile playing on his lips, \u201cwell, that\u2019s out of my hands. It\u2019s the blood that\u2019s been trickling into his brain that\u2019s been doing the trick.\u201d His eyes flash victory.</p><p>I stare at him James, transfixed. \u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, my eyes blurring with tears. I blink them away furiously, angry they\u2019re blocking my vision.</p><p>He\u2019s been here dying right before my very eyes and I\u2019ve not done a single thing to help him.</p> <p>Hold on, baby. Please. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . he\u2019s gone. Finally,\u201d I hear Arlo say. He doesn\u2019t bother to hide the glee in his voice. \u201cSo you see, Lucyna, you only have me left now. Looks like your all out of options.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Bloodied Hands</p><p>\u201cAaaarrgghhh!\u201d Is that me screaming?</p><p>It must be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lucyna.\u201d I hear Arlo\u2019s dispassionate voice come from across the room. The sound is like hot needles piercing my skin. \u201cThe pain will pass soon.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I\u2019m being crushed. This is agony. Somebody help. Please.</p><p>I open my eyes and I\u2019m looking at Arlo. He has his perpetual air of unconcern, calm. He doesn\u2019t look like he's just killed James.</p><p>James is dead.</p><p>Oh no. No. No. No. No.</p><p>I stare blankly ahead, tears flooding from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cause you pain but it has to be this way,\u201d he says indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best. You\u2019ll see this soon.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth but nothing happens. I\u2019m empty of words. I\u2019m hollow. I\u2019m dead inside.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now,\u201d Arlo tells me. \u201cI can\u2019t release the bind I have on you as I don\u2019t think I can trust you not to try and run. Not that you\u2019d get far.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cBut best not to take any chances \u2013\u201d</p><p>And you\u2019d think the next voice I hear would fill me with relief, but how can I feel relief when I feel nothing.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Arlo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Isabel,\u201d he says, seemingly unperturbed at her appearance. He gets up out of his seat. \u201cBeen a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long enough.\u201d She smiles sweetly.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d He laughs. \u201cSo your here to save the day?\u201d he adds with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cAnd to take you home.\u201d She is watching him as a human being would watch a snake. As I would now.</p><p>He laughs again, louder this time. \u201cReally? And you think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>As he says this I see other angels appear. Three of them, evenly spaced around the room. I don\u2019t know any of them.</p><p>Arlo runs his eyes over them and raises his eyebrows. \u201cAre you really sure you want to do this?\u201d he says to Isabel.</p><p>\u201cNo, but there\u2019s no other choice. You\u2019re obviously not going to come willingly and I can\u2019t allow you to do this.\u201d She moves a hand in my direction. \u201cSo . . .\u201d She leaves her words hanging in the air.</p><p>Then, in the blink of my eyes, the room is mayhem and I\u2019m sat on the sofa, paralysed, in the middle of it all.</p><p>The energy in the room is so high it could light the whole city for a year. My skin is tingling from it. Arlo is really strong. His target is Isabel, and even though the other angels are all around him, he seems unfazed, able to keep them back with ease. I pray that Isabel is going to be okay.</p><p>But really all I care about is getting to James. I might be able to save him if I can get to him. It might not be too late. Because if I don\u2019t, he will be reborn and then I may never find him again. But even if I did, he wouldn\u2019t be James anymore. He\u2019d be different.</p><p>Isabel manages to toss Arlo away from her, and the instant she does so he must have lost his focus because I can move. I\u2019m up and off that sofa in an instant. Arlo doesn\u2019t seem to notice that his hold on me has gone or that I\u2019ve moved, because he doesn\u2019t stop me.</p><p>When I reach James I drop down onto my knees beside him. I lean over and carefully pull him onto his back, laying him flat. His eyes are closed. There\u2019s blood matted in his hair and on his forehead.</p><p>I have to help him. How? CPR. I\u2019ve never done it before. So, do it now. Okay. He\u2019s laid flat. Next tilt his head back. What is it, ten compressions? Fifteen? Anything for God's sake, Lucyna. Just stop wasting time.</p><p>I put my hands on his chest and begin CPR, not caring what\u2019s unfolding behind me.</p><p>\u201cSix \u2013 seven \u2013 come on baby wake up \u2013 nine \u2013 ten.\u201d I stop pumping and blow my breath into his mouth, once, twice. His lips feel cold on mine. I wait a second. Nothing. I start pumping on his chest again.</p><p>\u201cCome on James \u2013 three \u2013 you can\u2019t leave me here alone \u2013 six \u2013 seven . . .\u201d Tears are streaming down my face. I wipe them away on my sleeve. Tears are an added irritation I don\u2019t need. Right now, I need to concentrate on saving James. I breathe into his mouth again. Once, twice.</p><p>Then I hold my own breath.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re not leaving me!\u201d I bang my fist on his chest. \u201cI saved you once before. I can save you again!\u201d I begin pumping harder down on his chest. \u201cOne \u2013 two \u2013 three, you\u2019re not leaving me, not after all of this. Not after everything I\u2019ve gone through to be with you. Come on, James! This isn\u2019t you! You\u2019re a fighter! Fight, baby, fight! Nine \u2013 ten.\u201d I blow as much of my warm air into his lungs as I can. I stare at his face, willing him to breathe. \u201cBreathe, James,\u201d I plead. \u201cYou can do it.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I drop my head on his chest, gripping my fingers into his t-shirt. \u201cPlease don\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019m angry. Angry with him for giving up, angry with me for letting this happen, angry with the God for not stopping this from happening.</p><p>I beat my hands on his chest. \u201cWake up!\u201d I cry. \u201cFight to stay! Don\u2019t let him win!\u201d</p><p>I stare down at his unmoving face, my chest heaving up and down, the words cutting up in my throat and a sudden calm washes over me. I notice I\u2019m crying again and my tears are dripping onto his t-shirt, spoiling it. I dry my face with my hand. Then I pull his limp body up onto my lap. I try to wipe away the blood on his forehead with my hand. It smears.</p><p>His blood is on my hand. I stare numbly down at it.</p><p>This is my fault. He would never have died if I hadn\u2019t been so selfish. If I had just left him alone in the beginning, Arlo would never have done all of this. He would still be alive now. James died because of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whisper as I trace my finger around his face. His perfect face. He looks so peaceful, like he\u2019s sleeping.</p><p>Did you know, James? Did you know you were going to die? You didn\u2019t cry out for help or say 'stop', or scream, or anything. You were just so silent. So quiet.</p><p>My eyes move to the picture of James and Max on the floor. I wipe my bloodstained hand on my t-shirt, and reach over and pick up the broken frame. I tip the shards of glass out onto the floor.</p><p>I study James\u2019 face in the picture. He looks happy. He was happy, before me, before I came and ruined his life. Before I ended his life.</p><p>This pain inside me is a burning agony filled with a sense of loss and regret which is never going to go away. I can\u2019t change any of it. I can\u2019t take it back. How am I supposed to go on living like this without him?</p><p>How did all those people I used to see when I was a Bringer do it? How did they go on? I press my arm across my chest trying to contain the wretchedness I feel. I can barely breathe. Nothing will ever make it go away.</p><p>Funny how when I was a Bringer, all I wanted was to be able to feel, and I remember how I used to wonder what was worse \u2013 to feel the agonising pain of loss or to have never felt it at all. At least now I know the answer.</p><p>And it\u2019s clear to me what I have to do.</p><p>I smooth James\u2019 dark hair away from his beautiful face and press my lips to his one last time. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I rest him gently back to the floor and place the photo of him and Max on his chest.</p><p>Then I rise calmly to my feet and walk into the still ongoing fracas, right into the direct line of fire.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Live Forever</p><p>So this is what dying feels like.</p><p>It\u2019s nothing like I thought it would be. I feel like I\u2019m being pulled through a wind tunnel backwards and at high speed. It shouldn\u2019t be like this, should it? Or maybe I\u2019m being reborn. Maybe this is what rebirth is like. Of course, I won\u2019t die like a normal person \u2013 meet my Bringer, go to Heaven. I\u2019m like James.</p><p>James.</p><p>Oh God, it hurts. It hurts too much. The sooner this rebirth happens the better. Then I won\u2019t remember anything.</p><p>Wait, didn\u2019t I do this before, choose to forget. Isn\u2019t that taking the easy way out? Am I a coward? Probably. I know it\u2019s harder to stay and fight but I can\u2019t do it, not without him.</p><p>Well I guess it\u2019s too late now anyway.</p><p>I knew the instant I was hit. I walked straight into the fight between Arlo and Isabel. The look in his eyes, the moment he saw that his bolt of energy aimed at Isabel had hit me, was poetic. I\u2019m glad it was him that killed me. He\u2019ll feel that pain forever \u2013 unless Isabel couldn\u2019t overcome him and he finds me again. Oh God, what if he finds me and then I won\u2019t know it\u2019s him or what he\u2019s up to. Oh no, what have I done? I should have waited to see if Isabel was okay, I shouldn\u2019t have just left her or the other angels there with him. But if I had stayed and Arlo overcame them, I would still have been his. He would have taken me with him. Maybe it really is better this way. I had it right first time. Or maybe there was no right way. Honestly, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care, I just want to stop feeling this way. Why haven\u2019t I forgotten yet? And what is that light? Where am I?</p><p>I blink open my heavy eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m still in James\u2019 living room and I\u2019m back sitting on the sofa.</p><p>Is this Heaven? Was I allowed back in after all? Have they forgiven me my misdemeanors and given me another chance? My heart lifts. If so, they couldn\u2019t have got my version of perfect more right. James\u2019 home. My haven. I feel so close to him here, surrounded by all his things. And they\u2019ve got it spot on. Everything looks just like it used to before Arlo tore it all up. The only thing missing is James. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bleakness wraps my heart.</p><p>\u201cLuce?\u201d It's the sound of a voice that I never thought I\u2019d hear again. My heart nearly explodes with relief.</p><p>I spin around to see James sitting beside me. \u201cJames!\u201d I breathe out in a flurry of relief and disbelief.</p><p>He smiles confusedly at me.</p> <p>Are we in Heaven together? Really, it doesn\u2019t matter where we are. He\u2019s here. I feel like I\u2019m going to burst with happiness. But wait, what if he\u2019s not real. What if he\u2019s just a figment of my very desperate imagination? I want to reach out and touch him to check if he is, but what if I do and he disappears. No, I\u2019ll just keep him here as he is for now.</p><p>I clasp my hands together. My palms are slick with sweat. Would I sweat if I was dead? My mind is trying to work it out but it\u2019s all too messy to make sense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both alive.\u201d I hear Isabel\u2019s voice come from behind me. \u201cI\u2019ve taken time back. About an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>I turn sharply to find her sitting in the chair Arlo was in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d is all I can manage.</p> <p>Isabel looks at me like I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cYou\u2019re both alive,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI reversed time to bring you both back.\u201d</p><p>I blink a few times.</p><p>James is alive. He\u2019s real. He\u2019s really here.</p><p>Complete euphoria floods me and I launch myself at him, throwing my arms around him. I feel his arms vice around me. I squeeze him as tightly in return</p><p>\u201cLuce. I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he gasps, laughing. I loosen my grip on him. I pull back, hold his face in my hands, and stare into his dark, dark eyes. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s really here. I don\u2019t ever want to be deprived of looking at him again.</p><p>He smiles a lopsided smile and bites down on the corner of his lip. He is beautiful. My heart is hammering against my ribcage.</p> <p>\u201cNot that that enthusiastic greeting of yours wasn\u2019t great,\u201d he says, brushing a stray tear from my eye, \u201cbut, erm, I\u2019m a bit confused as to what the hell is actually going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArlo killed you,\u201d Isabel says very matter of factly. \u201cAnd then I, thanks to Lucyna, accidentally killed her, so I reversed time to bring you both back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed me?\u201d I gasp as I nearly twist my head off my neck in my attempt to look at her. \u201cI thought it was Arlo.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips tightly together. \u201cNope. That was me, I didn\u2019t see you coming. I was too focussed on Arlo. Sorry. It helped though, you getting yourself killed, it distracted him for long enough for us to bind him.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Glad to have helped.</p><p>\u201cWhere is . . . Arlo?\u201d I ask tentatively, sucking my breath in.</p><p>\u201cAt home where he belongs. He can\u2019t get back out. We\u2019ve bound him, in a \u2013 let\u2019s say, \u2018restricted area\u2019 until we can figure out a better way to help him. Don\u2019t worry he won\u2019t get free. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring us back?\u201d I have to ask the question. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful,\u201d I add quickly, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not, honestly. I\u2019m more grateful than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p> <p>She sits forward, bridging the gap between us. \u201cI like a happy ending. what can I say?\u201d She shrugs lightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Isabel, for everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d James says, taking hold of my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I add, somewhat belatedly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She stands and my eyes follow her up. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, can I ask \u2013 Fen, the guy Arlo used, is he okay \u2013 do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Damage control done. He remembers nothing as do the rest of the humans at the hospital. It\u2019s as if you never existed.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and winks at me.</p><p>I have to stop myself from laughing with relief. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice to see you again Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd just so you know, you\u2019ve both been granted access back into Heaven . . . but I don\u2019t expect to see either of you anytime soon.\u201d She points an authoritative finger at James and me.</p><p>Before I get to thank her again, she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I rest back against James\u2019 chest. I can feel his heart beating against my back and his breath blowing down my neck, things I never thought he\u2019d ever be able to do again. I block out all horrendous memories and comfort myself in the fact there is nothing that can take him away from me ever again.</p><p>\u201cSo, you died,\u201d James says after a moment. His voice is rough and low.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer quietly. I really don\u2019t want to get into this with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Isabel mean when she said, \u2018it was thanks to you that she killed you?\u2019\u201d And there it is. He really doesn\u2019t miss a trick.</p><p>I shift uncomfortably.</p><p>He turns me round to look at him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly to me, tears spring to my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d died and I couldn\u2019t save you. I tried, but I couldn\u2019t bring you back. And it hurt too much. Then I . . . just kind of got in the way of their fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and look past him, staring at the wall. \u201cI walked into the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and holds my tear-streaked face in his hands, forcing me to look at him. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t bear the pain of losing you and I wanted it to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a really fucking stupid thing to do. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whimper.</p><p>He presses his forehead to mine, my tears running against his cheeks. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll never do anything like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I sigh. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we both just live forever as humans? Things would be a whole lot simpler if we could.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and moves back from me. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me that?\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip, saying nothing. I know it\u2019s a stupid thought, but it\u2019d be nice it if could be true.</p><p>\u201cWe might not live forever as we are, but you and me \u2013\u201d he points between us both, \u201cwe\u2019ll always be together. There\u2019s nothing to keep us apart now. And I, for one, think that\u2019s something to be very happy about.\u201d He wipes the tears from my face and smiles at me.</p><p>My skin burns from his touch. His hot breath is blowing over me, causing shivers to run freely down my spine.</p><p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d he asks. I can see his eyes are on my lips and I know exactly what he\u2019s thinking when he does that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug, feigning nonchalance. \u201cWe could go to bed, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed?\u201d His eyes suddenly look really opaque.</p><p>\u201cSleep seems like a really \u2018normal\u2019 thing to do after everything we\u2019ve been through tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, it does I suppose. But then normal\u2019s not so bad, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>He grins sexily and a bolt of desire zips through me. So I just have to lean forward and kiss him.</p><p>\u201cYou keep kissing me like that,\u201d he says drawing away from me breathlessly \u201cand I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to make it out of this living room with you, let alone up to bed.\u201d</p><p>I climb up onto his lap. \u201cI can live with that,\u201d I murmur, as I pull his t-shirt over his head and feel his hot body press up against mine. \u201cI can live with anything so long as I have you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
