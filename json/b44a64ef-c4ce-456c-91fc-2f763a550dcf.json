A hidden cavern near the waters of the Blue Grotto in Italy.</p><p>Tamar shivered with her twelve companions. They were about to attempt their most daring incantation. An opening at the top of the cavern allowed the light from the full moon to shine down on them, illuminating their secret gathering and adding its own power to the unfolding ritual.</p><p>Salt water splashed on her from a waterfall in the nearby pool. They\u2019d searched for the water of immortality, a legend that had spread since before her birth. Far and wide, people had spoken of water that could make a person eternal and young.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t the water that conferred immortality. It was the creatures that lived inside the water. They were transparent and hard to see, with spongy tops and long tendrils on the bottom that could sting if you got too close. They didn\u2019t die. Instead, they could age backward, reaching the end of their life, and then, without dying, start over again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll freeze to death if you don\u2019t hurry.\u201d Tamar glared at the man in the middle of the circle. The irony of freezing to death while seeking immortality caused her to stifle a dark laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe potion must be altered with other ingredients unless you want to come back as a newborn each time. You\u2019ll find that frustrating,\u201d Jacob said. He was their leader and the best with potions.</p><p>Tamar made a face, but huddled closer to her sister, Naomi, for warmth. A circle of salt had been poured around them. Candles were already lit. A large stone had become a makeshift table upon which the coven leader worked. The sea creatures had been pulverized and added to an iron pot. He poured the herbal infusions into the potion.</p><p>Jacob passed a sharp knife to the person on his left. \u201cEach of us must contribute blood to the potion or it will fail. The magic is in this creature, but they have no blood. Our blood must bond with this animal if we hope to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s necessary?\u201d Naomi asked. Tamar nodded her agreement. Cutting themselves and mixing their blood seemed extreme. What would be the consequences of linking together eternally?</p><p>\u201cI am sure,\u201d Jacob said, losing patience with their squeamishness. Magic like this had a price, and they all knew it. But the consequences always showed themselves when it was too late.</p><p>One by one they sliced the center of their palms with the ritual knife and added their blood. Jacob stirred the concoction with a wooden spoon; it smelled like death. When he was finished, he dipped a silver goblet into the brew.</p><p>\u201cWe each drink and then we chant,\u201d he said, passing the goblet.</p><p>Tamar couldn\u2019t help feeling pride at the chant she\u2019d written. When they\u2019d all drunk, they clasped hands and turned their faces up to the moonlight. The cavern echoed their words back to them. \u201cDa immortalitatem. Renatus sine oblitus. Numquam moriens. Da immortalitatem. Renatus sine oblitus. Numquam moriens...\u201d</p><p>And then they all died.</p> <p>Tamar jolted as oxygen flooded into her body. Something felt very strange. Had the spell worked? She glanced around at her companions, each of them coming back to life one by one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all children.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Golatha Falls, Georgia. The Present.</p><p>Tam perched on the bar stool in her kitchen, still as death. Her third cup of Earl Grey tea cooled on the counter, ignored. Normally the warm brew calmed her nerves, but nothing would comfort her today.</p><p>She\u2019d read her tarot cards, tea leaves, and scried with a bowl of water and sea salt. Everything she tried gave her the same morbid story. The death card glared back at her, mocking, and though she\u2019d told many others\u2014sometimes truthfully, sometimes not so much\u2014that the death card didn\u2019t always mean death, she knew this card said her number was up.</p><p>Jack\u2014as Jacob was called now\u2014was back, and he was after her. She fought to keep the tremor out of her hand as she raised the tea to her lips. He wouldn\u2019t offer her a quick death. It would involve a cold stone slab, bleeding to death, and having vital organs removed. Ritualistic, because ritual was how you got the most effect out of stealing a fellow magic user\u2019s power.</p><p>Tam had considered herself a cycler since the night she was reborn in that cavern nearly two thousand years ago. True to Jack\u2019s word, each time they died, they came right back in their own younger body, looking for all the world to be about twelve years old\u2014an inconvenience to say the least. Tam had been shuffled from orphanage to orphanage each time she began a new life cycle.</p> <p>This last time she\u2019d gotten lucky and been adopted by a well-to-do family who had taken her in and put her through a good school. The thought was nice, though pointless, given how many times she\u2019d already suffered through school.</p><p>Cyclers kept their memories, their sense of continuity. They were effectively immortal, just like the rare breed of jellyfish they\u2019d discovered so long ago.</p><p>Jack had only been actively hunting the other cyclers for a few centuries. He\u2019d gone power hungry, convinced he could stop the cycle altogether and achieve true immortality by draining the power of his coven. Magic users aged differently\u2014the more magic, the longer they could live. But it wasn\u2019t just that. She knew him. He had an angle\u2014something more than a personal quest for immortality.</p><p>If murder was his new hobby, his purpose for gaining all that power couldn\u2019t be good. If he was going to get her anyway, suicide seemed the smarter option. It would free her to be reborn the normal way and keep her safe from a more brutal death at Jack\u2019s hands.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t so simple. There were two ways she could die for real\u2014and two ways only: at the hands of another cycler, or through magical means by a very old preternatural being, such as a demon or vampire at least a few thousand years old. Those were hard to come by, and their killing methods were usually too creative for Tam\u2019s taste. She wanted to break the cycle, not be tortured.</p><p>Either way, she\u2019d managed, through this latest cycle, to stifle the suicidal urge. Until now.</p><p>The image of the demon she\u2019d chosen formed in her mind. Cain. The very first incubus. If he couldn\u2019t kill her, nobody could. And he hated her. It should be simple enough to get him to agree, assuming she could find him. She\u2019d dropped him in front of his badass pals a couple of times already with energy balls. He was probably plotting her death at this very moment.</p><p>Anna might know where to find him, since she was mated to a demon, but Tam hadn\u2019t seen her best friend in three months. It wasn\u2019t as if Tam had directions to the demon portals or a way to get through to their dimension even if she did. If Anna surfaced in the human dimension, Tam could do a spell to locate her, but who could say when that would happen? And would it be before Jack reached her?</p><p>Deep in her gut, she knew she was going to die\u2014either by Cain\u2019s hand or by Jack\u2019s. As arrogant as the bastard was, Cain\u2019s methods would at least be pleasurable. Bleeding out and organ removal versus orgasms. Gee, how do I decide? They both sound so glamorous and exciting.</p><p>Cain snarled as he passed through the portal point into Cary Town, Washington. The filmy dimensional doorway shimmered and then fizzled out of existence as he moved through the forest away from it. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d allowed himself to be summoned by the vampire king. Half-breeds.</p><p>He\u2019d thought his business with Anthony was finished when Cain had delivered his don\u2019t mess with us again or there will be a war speech the last time they\u2019d met. But now there was a bigger evil brewing, something that risked the living standards of all the factions\u2014and possibly their lives.</p><p>Even his newly turned succubus and her werewolf mate would be at the meeting, which was going to be awkward to say the least, given that they all hated Anthony. And the feeling was mutual. How this was going to go with everybody in one room, he couldn\u2019t say. Officially, the werewolf pack was banished from Cary Town. If someone saw them slinking through the night to Anthony\u2019s penthouse, things would get entertaining.</p><p>The demon nodded at the guardian in the lobby of the Cary Town Luxury Apartments. This meeting was being kept on the down-low. The Preternatural Council had been shut out. Even most of the vampire king\u2019s coven didn\u2019t know he was fraternizing with the enemy and holding a secret meeting in his former penthouse residence. Cain stepped onto the elevator and pulled out the key he\u2019d been given to gain access to the sixth floor.</p><p>The door at the end of the hall was answered by a vampire who looked more like a butler. \u201cThey\u2019re on the roof by the pool, sir.\u201d</p><p>Cain took the stairs two at a time. His presence announced itself as the metal door clanged against the brick. All eyes went to him, and he smirked.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, looks like the gang\u2019s all here.\u201d And what a motley crew they were.</p><p>Anthony stood at one end of the table beside an overhead projector and portable screen that had been plugged into an outlet embedded in the brick.</p><p>At the table were several familiar faces. Beside Anthony was his human mate, Charlee. Coming around the table was Cain\u2019s brother, Luc, and his annoying mate, Anna. Then there was Jane, the new succubus who was mated to Cole, the Cary Town werewolf pack alpha. The rest, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Anthony said, bristling. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting, and Charlotte needs her rest. The baby takes a lot out of her.\u201d</p><p>Cain\u2019s eyes cut to the vampire\u2019s mate. She was so pregnant she\u2019d pop any day now. If this meeting was about her and her spawn, heads were going to roll. If he didn\u2019t care about a half-breed, he sure as hell didn\u2019t care about a quarter-breed.</p><p>\u201cI was detained. These things happen. Lovely little school teacher. I made some third graders very happy today. Or they\u2019ll be happy tomorrow, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Cole growled from his seat beside Jane. \u201cYou killed a woman, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Cain chuckled. \u201cMy god, man, what is it with you and this obsession with killing? Which one of us is the demon? Perhaps amongst your kind third graders are happy when their teacher dies. She\u2019s... just a little spent. She\u2019ll have to take a sick day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He dropped into a chair at the end of the table where he could most easily glare at and annoy Anthony. Since Cain wasn\u2019t killing him right now, annoying him would be the second best thing. He didn\u2019t like that Anthony was in charge of this meeting. The vampire king was practically a child next to Cain\u2019s eight thousand years. It should be seniority rule.</p><p>The vampire cleared his throat. \u201cSitting next to you is Father Hadrian who is one of mine... And over here is our resident sorcerer, Dayne, and his lovely werecat, Greta.\u201d Anthony leered at the brunette beside the sorcerer and Greta gripped Dayne\u2019s hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cTherian, not werecat! You know I hate that term,\u201d Greta hissed.</p><p>\u201cWhether you like it or not, it\u2019s accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Anthony?\u201d Charlee said, an irritated expression on her face at her mate\u2019s goading.</p><p>The vampire chuckled. \u201cWhat? Is it my fault your friend is so easy to mess with?\u201d</p><p>He took a clear plastic sheet with writing on it and placed it on the overhead projector. \u201cI apologize for being so vague as to the purpose of this meeting. Half of you are officially enemies, but if I go to the Preternatural Council with this, my vampires will all know, and I\u2019m not prepared for it to go public yet. We can go back to hating each other after we\u2019ve eliminated the threat.\u201d</p><p>Anthony flipped on the light of the projector, and an electric buzz filled the silence. \u201cI had this letter reproduced onto a transparency for our purposes. In case the context doesn\u2019t spell it out to you, we\u2019ve been contacted by Jack the Ripper. He\u2019s still alive, and he\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t just use a computer program?\u201d the werewolf asked. Cole was the most tech-savvy of the group.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try, it won\u2019t get you anywhere,\u201d Charlee said.</p><p>Dear Boss,</p><p>I\u2019m back. You didn\u2019t take the threat seriously last time. Shame on you. Did you not understand my joke? It wasn\u2019t for the common people. It was for the others. Was \u201cfrom Hell\u201d not a big enough clue? It\u2019s where we all are, after all.</p><p>When I\u2019ve killed the other cyclers, I\u2019ll change the world. There are 13 of us, a perfect coven. The first kill was an accident, the second an experiment. Whitechapel was only three. You were wrong. It wasn\u2019t five. Those and others were copycats all wanting Ripper\u2019s glory.</p><p>Since then, there have been four more, but I\u2019ve been quiet as a mouse, giggling at my funny little games. With you in power, I thought I\u2019d make this interesting. Only three left to kill; catch me first or Hell is mine.</p><p>Yours Truly,</p><p>The Cycler</p><p>Don\u2019t mind the new trade name. The old one was stale, and this one will give you something new to chew on. A new mystery to solve. Do better this time. The stakes are higher now.</p><p>P.S. Have fun when the human media gets this letter. I\u2019ll give you a head start. Tick, tock.</p><p>Cain read the letter on the projector once, twice, and then a third time. \u201cWhy did he send this to you? And addressed the same as the original letters? And what the fuck is a cycler?\u201d</p><p>Anthony seemed annoyed by Cain\u2019s tone, but he answered anyway. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve met him before. At previous points in my history, I\u2019ve chosen to blend with the humans, exploring various ways of living to satisfy my boredom. During the Whitechapel murders, I worked for the London police department under an assumed name. But a few decades before that, I owned a small fish shop. All my other employees called me by the name I was using at that time, except one. He just called me \u201cBoss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was something off about him. I suspected he was a magic user, but it was more than that. The way he gutted a fish... it was so clean. Surgical, almost. Even being a vampire, this guy gave me the creeps. But I never realized he knew I\u2019d joined the London police or that the letters might be for me. He must have discovered what I was. He was playing games then; now I think he\u2019s ready to end this. Which brings me to your other question. Does anybody besides Hadrian know what a cycler is?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a consensus of head shaking.</p><p>\u201cFather Hadrian, perhaps you could tell us about your experience.\u201d</p><p>The priest poured a glass of wine from a bottle on the table and took a leisurely sip. \u201cWhen I was turned in 1955, my first meal was a blonde witch\u2014maybe in her twenties. Her name was Tamara. I left her corpse and went to hunt for more. When I returned to the church, there was a young girl, maybe eleven or twelve or so with the same blonde hair and the same eyes, wearing the same dress as the woman I killed. She told me she was a cycler. She was powerfully magical, much more so than I thought even a woman in her twenties should be.\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of Cain\u2019s neck stood up. There were millions of women with that name, and probably plenty of blonde witches with it as well, but his experience with Tam had always been one of confusion over how she could take him down so easily with a flick of her wrist.</p> <p>The demon glanced at Anna, wondering if she\u2019d made the connection, but the idea that Father Hadrian was speaking about the Tam they both knew hadn\u2019t penetrated for Luc\u2019s mate.</p><p>\u201cAnna, do you understand yet why this involves you?\u201d Anthony asked.</p><p>Her eyes widened but she maintained her denial. \u201cNo... I... Why would it involve me?\u201d</p><p>The vampire laughed and shook his head. \u201cI forget how recently you were introduced to our world. Your friend has been keeping a monumental secret from you. Tam is the woman Father Hadrian met in the fifties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I mean... we grew up together. Since we were kids...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince you were about twelve?\u201d</p><p>Anna shut her mouth and looked down at her hands.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. She must have died and started a new life cycle right around that time. We\u2019re still not sure exactly what that means.\u201d</p><p>The vampire king turned to the sorcerer and werecat. \u201cDayne, Greta, did you do the research I requested?\u201d</p><p>Dayne nodded. \u201cI might have a theory. Since magic users are human, we\u2019ve always been a wild card. Up until now, we\u2019ve kept ourselves mostly secret from normal humans and considered ourselves part of the preternatural world, but if Jack gets enough power, he could sway magic users to his side. I think he wants to expose the preternaturals and fight. He\u2019s absorbing power from his kills to make it easier.\u201d</p><p>Greta interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone considered there could be magical and ritual significance to the way Jack the Ripper was killing. The killings got more complex, but if he was experimenting with the most potent methods for power absorption, that would happen. He could become unstoppable if he kills the other cyclers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll also be a true immortal,\u201d Dayne said. \u201cThe more power a magic user has, the more slowly they age. Considering the nature of what he is already, my suspicion is that he\u2019d become unkillable. He wouldn\u2019t have to start over in a younger human body like what Hadrian observed with Tamara.\u201d</p><p>Cain squeezed his eyes shut as images flashed in his mind of Tam being ritualistically and gruesomely murdered. He didn\u2019t know why it pissed him off so much.</p><p>\u201cCain?\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>The demon looked up, startled at being included in the discussion. He tried to maintain a bored mask, but he couldn\u2019t keep the hot glow from his eyes, nor stop his hands from balling into fists. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you to protect the witch in your dimension. It\u2019s the only place we\u2019re guaranteed she\u2019ll be safe. If he kills all the cyclers, and magic users come out of the closet, they\u2019ll band together, which risks your demons as well.\u201d</p><p>Magic users were a demon\u2019s one weakness. Demons were exempt from death and could heal any injury\u2014true immortals, but they could still be trapped by a curse. They could still feel the suffering of starvation. They could still be hurt.</p><p>All eyes were on him, waiting for his response. He didn\u2019t know how he felt about the little blonde witch, but if anybody was killing her, it was going to be him, not some cheesy magical serial killer with a world domination plot, and not one of Anthony\u2019s thugs, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect her,\u201d Cain said, avoiding eye contact with the others. This was killing the shit out of his reputation. There were dramatic gasps and whispering, but he ignored it.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, killing her would be more expedient... if you could find a way to make her stay dead.\u201d The vampire king\u2019s tone was bland.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Anna said.</p><p>\u201cAnthony!\u201d Charlee said.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d protect her,\u201d the demon snarled, finally meeting the eyes of everyone at the table. He dared them to start something with him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also need you to get her to tell you everything about being a cycler. We still don\u2019t understand how or why they exist or the extent of their powers,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>Cain growled. \u201cWatch yourself, half-breed. I could take you out without blinking. I\u2019m sure you want to survive to be a daddy.\u201d</p><p>Charlee\u2019s hand went protectively over her pregnant belly, as if the child were in danger instead of the cocky vampire standing beside the projector screen.</p><p>Anthony glared. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I have magic users in my employ. I have a coven of vampires that stretches across North America and contacts with vampire leaders all over the world. Our numbers are far greater than yours. Let\u2019s not make this personal. We\u2019ve got a bigger enemy to fight.\u201d</p><p>Cain was bored now. \u201cAre we done here? I\u2019ve got a witch to collect.\u201d He stood, already turning toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCain...\u201d It was the first word Luc had spoken since the demon had arrived. \u201cTake Anna with you. She knows where the witch lives.\u201d</p><p>That would make things easier.</p><p>Luc\u2019s mate recoiled, gripping tight to his arm. \u201cWhat? No! Come with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI should stay for the rest of the meeting. My brother can\u2019t harm you, remember? You can\u2019t hold a solid form without me,\u201d Luc said.</p><p>When she\u2019d given her soul and became a demon\u2019s mate, she\u2019d had to die first. It made her existence somewhat ghostly. Only her mate could give her a full, solid form. Gradually, she would gain the same powers as Luc, but it was a lengthy process\u2014centuries. Anna looked from Cain to Luc a couple of times. She finally sighed and let go of her mate.</p><p>Cain headed for the door. He didn\u2019t bother waiting for her, assuming she\u2019d follow. And if she didn\u2019t, he\u2019d just have to find the infuriating witch on his own.</p><p>Tam had everything she was taking packed in several bags: clothes, magical tools, books. All the things that meant something to her. She stood in front of a large bird cage, a tear tracking down her face.</p><p>Henry had died three years ago. He\u2019d been her best friend and sometimes lover for almost two centuries. A raven therian, he\u2019d always had her back. She\u2019d come to think of him as her familiar, and his blood was powerfully magical, second only to cat blood. He\u2019d taught her more about her gift for reading the future than anybody else she\u2019d encountered. She\u2019d known he was going to die at some point. She lost everybody. Always.</p><p>It\u2019s time to let the cage go. Though it was her own mental self-talk, she heard it in Henry\u2019s voice instead of her own. But whoever the message ultimately came from, it was right. Even with magic, it would be too much to travel with, and all it could be now was a painful reminder of her loss.</p><p>She wiped her face and put the cover over the cage, taking one last look at the door they\u2019d made for him to easily open so he could come and go as he wished. He\u2019d preferred being in his bird form when he needed to think, and it was always handy to shift to it when people came over.</p><p>Tam turned back to the piles of bags and boxes in the middle of her room and created a circle of salt. She lit candles at the four directional points and sat in the middle with her spell book open. Even with her power, she wasn\u2019t sure she had the energy to perform this spell alone, but she had to try. For all the flashy magic she could do by herself at her age, changing the molecular structure of several bags of her stuff was still a tall order.</p><p>She closed her eyes and focused, then raised her arms and intoned the chant over and over until she crumpled to the floor and everything went dark.</p><p>The raven flew a couple of times around her. His shrill call was like laughter. Henry? He landed on the ground at her feet, then shifted into his human form, the call turning into a human laugh.</p><p>\u201cTam, I swear, what is wrong with you? You should have called the coven to do that spell. At least this gives me a chance to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t involve them. It\u2019s too dangerous. Is this really you? Or is it a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said enigmatically, a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, the back of his hand brushing her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m always watching out for you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back?\u201d She was asking if he planned to reincarnate.</p><p>\u201cAt some point.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m with my soul mate right now. We have limits here, but we still don\u2019t want to be separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re with her.\u201d And she was. Though they\u2019d had their occasional fling, it had been friends with benefits with Henry. Besides Anna, he was her best friend. But they\u2019d both known their love wasn\u2019t that kind of love. \u201cI love you...\u201d she said.</p><p>He smirked and finished her sentence \u201c... but not that way. Right back at ya.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into a hug and whispered in her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again, but you may have to find me and remind me, I don\u2019t know how many memories I can pull through.\u201d He turned serious. \u201cTam, listen to me. Don\u2019t leave the house. Wait. He\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, panic gripping her. \u201cJack? If Jack\u2019s coming, why would I wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone else. Follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Stop speaking in riddles.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou know there is only so much I\u2019m allowed to interfere. Read your cards again, and really see them this time. The whole spread.\u201d</p><p>Tam opened her eyes and sat up inside the circle. The candles still burned, and she quickly blew them out. Then she laughed. The energy required for the magic may have knocked her out, but her spell had worked. She was two thousand after all. Her bags were tiny now, each hardly bigger than a thimble. She gathered them up and put them into a freezer bag, then put them, along with the magic book, candles, and salt into a shoulder bag. Nothing beat traveling like a witch.</p><p>Her cards were packed already or she\u2019d do another reading. She turned away from the cage and took her single bag to the kitchen to make another cup of Earl Grey and wait for whoever he was.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long. Half an hour later there was a knock on the door. She slung her bag over her shoulder and went to answer. Standing on the other side were an unlikely pair: Anna and Cain. Death and her best friend, delivered right to her door. Anna was looking mildly transparent and ghostly without her demon mate there to keep her solid. She was also looking mildly angry.</p><p>\u201cDoes our friendship mean nothing to you? How could you keep a secret like this from me?\u201d She attempted to smack Tam on the arm, but her hand went right through. Sometimes that ghost thing was a good thing.</p><p>Tam decided to play dumb, even though there was only one giant secret she\u2019d been keeping from her friend. \u201cWhat secret?\u201d</p><p>Anna rolled her eyes. \u201cSeriously? We\u2019re really doing this? I know what you are.\u201d</p><p>The witch couldn\u2019t help a quick glance at Cain. Why did the foul, evil demon have to be so hot? He had that dark, savage look going. Long, dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin. Her rational mind told her he was hot to catch prey and she was falling right into his web, but damn, she was human and he was... Wait, did he just arch an eyebrow at me? She was probably telegraphing her emotions right at him.</p><p>\u201cTam!\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Anna. \u201cOkay, great, you know what I am. You couldn\u2019t even handle basic witch stuff. You said you didn\u2019t want to know about it. How would this truth-telling experiment have gone down?\u201d Tam put on an affected mock-voice, \u201cSo, Anna, I know you hate hearing about magic stuff because you\u2019re a pansy, but I\u2019m really almost two thousand years old. Ask me anything about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just felt like I should have known. What about when you told me the other magic stuff? You couldn\u2019t have told me then? Or when we were together in Cary Town around Halloween? What about then? You couldn\u2019t have found an opening to tell me the truth?\u201d</p><p>Tam looked down. \u201cMy coven doesn\u2019t even know. Anna, I have to hide and lie to live. Okay? Not everything is about you.\u201d Though she was debating the point of living again, lately. Was Jack even after her? Maybe it was just a danger with Cain in her cards. He was evil. And a killer.</p><p>\u201cGirls. Please. We have to move now. The Cycler could be hunting her as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Cycler?\u201d Tam asked.</p><p>Another eye roll from Anna. \u201cAre you going to playact like you don\u2019t know you\u2019re being hunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but, how do you guys know about him?\u201d</p><p>Cain pulled her out of the house, ignoring her question. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to pack. You\u2019ll have to make do. You\u2019re coming to the demon dimension, and don\u2019t try your little energy ball trick. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>Wait, he wanted to protect her? Since when?</p><p>When he touched her, she thought she\u2019d swoon right there like some damsel in distress. Nobody should have that kind of sexual magnetism. At least it would make dying in his arms less repulsive. But she couldn\u2019t bring that up now, not with Anna here. She wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>For now, Tam had to just go along. They might think they could protect her, but staying in one place was unsafe, and if Jack succeeded... No. Tam wouldn\u2019t let him. It was best to end the cycle. What they\u2019d done was unnatural. It went against the order of things. One of them going mad and the others becoming his victims was nature\u2019s way of righting that wrong. Who was she to call foul? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tam pulled away, and to her surprise, he let her go, a wary look on his face. She gestured to her shoulder bag. \u201cAlready packed. I\u2019m like twelve steps ahead of you.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that she could have already left and been out of Cain\u2019s reach. Her curiosity over Henry\u2019s words had won out over personal safety. The raven had never led her wrong before.</p><p>Was Henry confirming her suspicion that now was the time to go, and she\u2019d chosen her executioner wisely? Any other interpretation was unthinkable.</p><p>She took one last look at her house and locked the door behind her, even though everything of value\u2014real and imagined\u2014was in her shoulder bag.</p><p>They walked a few blocks until they reached the Golatha Falls forest. Once inside the woods, Anna spilled everything about the meeting. Cain remained uncharacteristically silent. Tam couldn\u2019t help looking over her shoulder as they went, as if Jack could somehow track them if he was being talked about. His power must be that dark and strong by now.</p> <p>When the portal shimmered in front of them, Cain took her hand and pulled her through. The portal only recognized demons and apparently demon mates, since Anna had no trouble herself, but then she was linked to Luc through strong blood magic, her soul tied irrevocably to him.</p><p>Tam\u2019s eyes widened when she entered the demon dimension. She\u2019d heard about it, but she\u2019d never seen it. Her mouth dropped open. \u201cThis place is so beautiful.\u201d Certainly not what she expected, even if she\u2019d always known it wasn\u2019t full of fire and brimstone.</p><p>Cain smiled with something like pride as Tam continued to take in the scene before her. The weather was perfect, the sky dark and clear with brilliant stars shining overhead, glowing with brightness equivalent to the moon. There was no moon, but then, this wasn\u2019t Earth. For all she knew\u2014and she highly suspected this was true\u2014the stars were some kind of illusion made entirely from magic. Though maybe technically everything in existence was an illusion made from magic.</p><p>Stretching endlessly before her was sand and cobblestone streets lit by torchlight. Colorful tents made of rich, expensive fabrics lined the streets as far as the eye could see. There was a marketplace and music and laughter. Seductive laughter.</p><p>A scantily clad woman danced to the music while a couple of males encouraged her. The woman felt human; the males, demon.</p> <p>Tam turned sharp eyes on the demon leader, suspicion growing over what she was witnessing.</p><p>\u201cJackson likes to play with his food,\u201d Cain said with a shrug. \u201cHe likes to make them dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened. \u201cDon\u2019t come to my dimension and judge us. I should kill you rather than protect you. Do you know how much trouble your kind causes for mine? You represent our one true enemy, and I\u2019ve chosen to keep you safe from the temporary, bigger threat. I might not continue to feel so generous if you don\u2019t watch that mouth.\u201d</p><p>Anna was still with them, so she couldn\u2019t tell Cain what she really felt. She closed her eyes and dropped the shields she used to protect herself from demon thrall and sent a strong wave of feelings to him. He couldn\u2019t read her exact thoughts, but he\u2019d get the gist of her death wish.</p><p>The demon\u2019s eyes widened, but he gave nothing of the exchange away. \u201cYou will have your own tent,\u201d he said, stopping in front of a exquisite purple tent that must be hers. His gaze shifted to Anna and then back to Tam. \u201cI\u2019ll have a couple of my demons guarding you around the clock. They\u2019ll go in shifts. Anna, you can go back to your mate now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No. I can\u2019t leave her here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a big girl. She doesn\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Tam said. \u201cAnd I have to speak to him privately, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I need to learn more about The Cycler,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>\u201cBut why can\u2019t I stay for that?\u201d</p><p>The demon leader took a threatening step toward the brunette. \u201cYou are one of us now. That doesn\u2019t just mean the perks of this world, but the responsibilities as well. When I say jump, you ask how high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc wouldn\u2019t let you hurt me. And... y-you can\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really want to be on my shit list? I\u2019m eight thousand. Waiting for you to come into your powers is nothing to me. When that happens, your mate won\u2019t be able to stop me. Or I could just take it out on him. Now run along to my brother and cry about what a Big Bad Wolf I am.\u201d</p><p>Anna looked over at Tam, her eyes revealing her internal struggle.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>When Anna was a safe distance away, the witch turned to Cain and looked him right in the eyes. \u201cI need you to kill me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed as much. Care to tell me why\u2014not that I\u2019d ever turn down such a powerful meal. You weren\u2019t suicidal the last time I met you. You were prepared to back us up in a war against Anthony.\u201d</p><p>Tam flopped down on one of the thick, cushioned pillows on the ground, preparing to be much more honest than she was comfortable with. If she wanted him to agree to this, she had to lay all her cards out on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different now. Jack will find me. It\u2019s not a question. What you said about the meeting only confirms it. You may think I\u2019m safe here, but anything could happen to end that safety. You\u2019re old enough and strong enough to kill me. I may be strong, but he\u2019s stronger. He\u2019s killed so many of us now that I can\u2019t fight him by myself. And I\u2019m so tired of running and cycling. I didn\u2019t know what I was asking for when I asked for eternal life.\u201d</p><p>Cain crossed to a side bar and poured himself a drink. He raised the decanter and arched a brow in question, but Tam shook her head. The demon shrugged and put it down. He extended a hand and she took it, allowing him to guide her to the couch where they could sit together.</p><p>As his hand trailed along her collarbone, she tried not to pull away and equally not to want him so much. His gaze was assessing, evidence he\u2019d done this millions of times.</p><p>\u201cExactly how old are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cClosing in on two thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He took a drink.</p><p>She fought to keep the tears at bay. She wouldn\u2019t display such weakness in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do this. This is hell. I can\u2019t imagine as long as you\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference in you and I is that I didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d</p><p>Tam looked away. \u201cAre you going to lecture me now on my foolishness? I was young and stupid. I\u2019d been taken into a secret magical order and was so proud of myself and what I\u2019d achieved. I had no concept of the powers I was playing with or what I was asking for.\u201d</p><p>Cain downed the rest of the brandy and put the snifter on the ground, then eased closer. His nearness made her heart flutter. He was the perfect predator, with prey that begged to be taken. She\u2019d put her shields back up\u2014force of habit. But even without thrall, his effect on a mere human could still be intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cI prefer longer hair,\u201d he said conversationally, his hand moving to the back of her neck.</p><p>She got chills as he stroked her skin, but she couldn\u2019t let that comment lie there. \u201cWell, let me grow it out real quick while we wait for a psycho to gruesomely murder me and take over the world. I\u2019m glad to see you have your priorities in line.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I hate you or admire you. I don\u2019t normally let anyone speak to me like that.\u201d</p><p>Tam flicked her wrist, turning her palm up, and focused her energy into a point of purple light that grew into an energetic ball that hissed like live electricity. \u201cYou think you can take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been touching yourself since the day you met me, dreaming about it,\u201d the demon said, switching to innuendo that would have made him sound like a self-important jackass except for the fact that he probably brought to the table everything he implied and more.</p><p>She swallowed around the lump in her throat and found herself captured in his dark gaze. The energy ball whimpered and died in her hand. At least she hadn\u2019t whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve managed some manners in light of this favor I\u2019m doing you.\u201d</p><p>In any other situation, it would have been about the most offensive thing he could say, but he was doing her a favor. It wasn\u2019t the favor of his precious presence or sex with him; it was the favor of a painless death to help her escape her pursuer and break the cycle she\u2019d been trapped in for so long she wanted to stop counting the years.</p><p>\u201cTell me, to satisfy my curiosity before we do this, how exactly did you pull it off? How did you become immortal?\u201d</p><p>She had no choice but to tell him. If she didn\u2019t tell him, he wouldn\u2019t give her what she wanted. \u201cJack was our leader. He was the one who was obsessed with it. We call it the fountain of youth now, but even before that version of the legend, there were stories about waters that gave eternal life. We found it, deep inside a cavern: a saltwater pool. Down in the depths, in the dark, we found this jellyfish that didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Cain nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But back then, nobody knew about them. That was where the species started. They\u2019ve spread since then. The water at the bottom fed back into the ocean. Jack was convinced he felt the energy we were looking for there, but when we did a spell to reveal it, it was in the sea creatures, not the water. The whole coven worked together to create the ritual. I wrote the chant.\u201d</p><p>She may as well have said I bear more responsibility for what has happened than most. And she knew Cain could surely read her well enough to know that. Demons could read emotions, after all. But he\u2019d gone quiet, missing the opportunity to throw condemnation.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t interrupt her with a smartass retort, she continued. \u201cMagic like this usually requires blood of the creature to seal it. We used the jellyfish itself, but they are bloodless, so we sealed the magic with our own blood. It may be another reason Jack is after us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain better,\u201d he said, growing impatient with what he must have thought was a coy explanation.</p><p>\u201cThe power of immortality was diffused to all of us. If I were crazy like him, I\u2019d think I could stop the cycle altogether if I could kill everyone else in the coven. You don\u2019t know who the other two are, do you?\u201d</p><p>Cain shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tam stood and paced in front of the couch, unable to concentrate with him so close. \u201cI could give you names of everyone, but we\u2019ve all lost touch. After Whitechapel it was safer not to congregate together. We were too easy to track that way. Everyone has probably changed their names dozens of times, perhaps even the way they look. I have no doubt Jack has. And I don\u2019t know which of us he\u2019s already killed and which remain. Even I changed my name, though not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your name before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamar. It\u2019s a biblical name. In the first few centuries I was so enamored with myself and my new ability\u2014to cycle and not lose memories\u2014that I renamed myself Tamara. In certain areas of India it means lotus flower, a symbol of rebirth. I was being ironic. But I\u2019m fresh out of irony now. Now I just want to end it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Anthony and the rest that I\u2019d protect you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped pacing. \u201cAnd you are protecting me. Killing me protects me and everybody else. You and I both know this whole death thing is a sham. It\u2019s not real. We get it. I don\u2019t need to prolong a life that has run on far too long. Don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>Cain smirked. \u201cSo no sex games, then?\u201d</p><p>Tam\u2019s face scrunched at that. \u201cYou\u2019re so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say it, but you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>She would have argued with him, but he\u2019d already moved in to capture her mouth in a kiss, pulling her back onto the couch. Startled, she let out a sigh against his lips.</p><p>\u201cLet down your shields,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Tam pulled back, suspicion in her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about what it\u2019s really like to die in the arms of an incubus? Don\u2019t you want the whole show? What other danger could I possibly pose for you if you\u2019re embracing your own demise?\u201d</p><p>She was curious.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to relax, breathing deeply. The shields stubbornly stayed in place, as if they were arguing with her\u2014her last bit of self-preservation instincts coming in to protect her. After her periodic searches for someone to end this, she\u2019d finally found the one who could do it. Cain was old enough and strong enough. As much as she disliked him, he could give her the best death. It wasn\u2019t possible to go out of this world in a more pleasant way.</p><p>Still, a small part of her rebelled against the idea of so willingly going into Cain\u2019s arms, sleeping with a monster she didn\u2019t trust, and ending her life. The shields had to go, or she\u2019d end up fighting him with magic until she was tapped. Tam focused more intently, calming her mind until she felt the mental defense system go down around her.</p><p>The moment the shields were down, pornographic images of the two of them together filled her mind, and she wanted him like he was oxygen itself. She gripped the sides of the couch as she felt the effects of his thrall. It was a potent cocktail of warmth and arousal. Like an orgasm and alcohol buzz rolled into one.</p><p>\u201cHold onto me, instead.\u201d He gripped her wrists and moved her hands to his shoulders. His well-muscled, firm, solid shoulders.</p><p>She held his gaze, trying not to be taken by smoldering black eyes, so dark\u2014like pools she could drown and die in. And very soon she would. He looked at her so intensely, she thought she might expire from the power of that stare alone. At some point while she\u2019d been busy dropping her shields, he\u2019d divested himself of his clothing. She\u2019d had a dim sense of it when she\u2019d touched him and was disappointed she\u2019d been too overwhelmed to enjoy the show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tiny voice way far away knew everything about this demon was an illusion to seduce her, but he was perfection. He looked perfect, he smelled perfect, and his voice was a perfect, haunting melody that would sing her to sleep.</p><p>The only thing that existed in this moment was desire. It was a desire so strong it was beginning to cause physical pain. She needed him inside her now.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cain,\u201d she whimpered, hating the lost, desperate tone her voice had taken.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. I knew you\u2019d see things my way and beg.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe with her shields up, she could have thrown an appropriate retort or energy ball to wipe the smug look off his face. God, she hated him. But the only thing that would travel along her vocal cords and out her mouth was, \u201cPlease, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMaybe I should toy with you a bit first. You have been quite an annoying little shit. You\u2019ve thrown energy balls at me twice. Both times were inopportune. You made me look weak in front of my people. And now... here we are.\u201d</p><p>Tam pushed through the haze of images of groping and body parts sliding against each other\u2014his hypnotic, seductive voice, the eyes that occasionally flickered with fire and so much heat she thought she might combust\u2014and said, \u201cEight thousand years and you still have the ego of a human.\u201d</p><p>Cain\u2019s eyes glowed dangerously. He pushed her back on the couch, his hand wrapped around her throat. \u201cI could kill you the old-fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged\u2014or did a bad impression of a shrug, since it was hard to do that with the way he had her positioned. He\u2019d pulled back on the demon mojo enough for her to stop squirming against him. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t care what you do, Cain. But I don\u2019t think killing me in a mundane way will work. You have to use your magic. So I guess you\u2019re stuck fucking me, unless you want an annoying child following you around and kicking your ass. That\u2019ll look great on your ego.\u201d</p> <p>Several things happened at once. He growled, ripped her shirt off her, sent a burst of images and desire her way, and captured her mouth in a kiss so hot she nearly melted. The onslaught was too overwhelming to fight. She was thrown down a dark hole of lust from which she didn\u2019t think she could escape.</p><p>Her mind emptied itself of all its contents except the demon in front of her. The way he smelled, the way he felt as his hands slid over her. She couldn\u2019t separate what was in her mind from what was actually happening. She felt drugged with him, and she never wanted to come down from the high.</p><p>Somehow, in this state, the rest of her clothes had been taken from her. Nothing could have prepared her for the feel of him inside her. The warmth of him, the arousal that came partly from what was happening and partly from the images he kept sending.</p><p>Even through the haze, knowing what he was, she felt him pulling the energy from her, the warm tingling as it moved over her body, so comforting and pleasurable and deadly. The orgasm hit her like a wave trying to pull her under, but she rode it until she was wrung out and certain she was about to die. If she\u2019d wanted to turn back now, it would\u2019ve been too late. She was irrevocably caught in his web, and all she could do was moan in his arms like the uncountable number of unfortunate souls before her.</p><p>But then it stopped. Cain\u2019s weight lifted off her. It took her a moment to fight through the disorientation, the hazy mix of sexual feelings and idle thoughts about the end. As she came back to herself, she looked around, convinced someone must have interrupted them and pulled him off her. Probably Luc.</p><p>But there was no one. Only them. The demon stood a few feet away: naked, dark, and beautiful, looking at her as if she were a poisonous snake.</p> <p>\u201cWhy am I still here?\u201d</p><p>He just watched her.</p><p>Tam felt her energy growing, her life force mending itself, and with it, her anger rose. She put her shields back up, stood, and stormed toward him, flicking her hand up to form a glowing purple ball of energy as she went.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Cain? You promised me! How hard can it possibly be to kill a woman you hate?\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t say anything. He just stood there, continuing with that inscrutable stare.</p><p>She threw the energy ball at him, but he seemed braced and ready for it. He went noncorporeal, the purple ball going through him to hit the fabric of the tent instead. A few seconds elapsed, and she created and threw another one. This time he was solid, and he did fall. He glared up at her from the ground, but he didn\u2019t seek to restrain her.</p><p>The third energy ball she threw called in several of his demons. One gripped one of her arms, another grabbed the other. A third stood behind her and held a hand over her mouth so she couldn\u2019t chant to protect herself.</p><p>Cain rose slowly to his feet, brushing sand off that perfect body. \u201cTake your hands off her.\u201d His voice was deadly, and Tam regretted throwing the magic at him. She might end up with a horrific death at his hands after all.</p> <p>\u201cBut boss, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled one of the demons off her like he was a rag doll and growled. \u201cI said, take your hands off her. No one touches her but me, do you understand? No feeding, no playing, no harming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep arguing with me, Jackson. Find out where it leads.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked at the ground and took a step back from the demon. \u201cMy apologies, sir.\u201d</p><p>The other two demons released her and backed away. Tam was too stunned to throw any more magic, and a little wiped after what had transpired between the two of them. She wished he\u2019d put some clothes on, because residual lust still hung in the air, and now was a stupid time for that.</p><p>\u201cGet out. All of you,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI don\u2019t want a single demon in this tent unless I specifically call for one.\u201d</p><p>Quick nods all around, and they backed out of the tent, keeping a wary eye on their leader in case he should retaliate anyway.</p><p>Tam took a step back as the demon leader stalked toward her. She held her hands up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Was she? She wasn\u2019t sure, but the look in his eyes was terrifying. She\u2019d signed up for a quick end from a strong being that wouldn\u2019t hurt\u2014not torture. As fun as it was to kick his ass, she was outnumbered by his kind here.</p><p>His eyes weren\u2019t on hers, they were on her arms, both of which were already forming angry bruises from the way the demons had manhandled her. He rubbed the dark marks. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and went to put his jeans back on. Tam\u2019s clothing had been destroyed in the fight. Noting her dilemma, he crossed to an elegant trunk and pulled out something gold and shimmery and tossed it to her.</p><p>Tam held the dress away from her as if it might bite. It was long and flowy and made of lightweight material that was the slightest bit transparent. Very sexy. She\u2019d look like a goddess descending from Mount Olympus in it, but if he didn\u2019t want other demons touching her, this wasn\u2019t the outfit. \u201cAre you freaking kidding me?\u201d she said, still holding it like it might be coated in a deadly toxin.</p><p>\u201cNo. I am not kidding you. You wear that, and the demons here know you\u2019re somebody else\u2019s meal. We don\u2019t steal from each other. It\u2019s one of my rules. Demons don\u2019t break my rules or they pay.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue. She didn\u2019t understand why he hadn\u2019t killed her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. I obviously don\u2019t trust you, but I thought you wouldn\u2019t turn down the opportunity to kill me. This doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the dress on, Tamara,\u201d he said ignoring her lame attempt at stalling.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she put it on.</p><p>Cain nodded his approval and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait! Don\u2019t turn your back on me. Are you really that stupid?\u201d She had an energy ball ready to go when he turned back around.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is how you want to engage with me, Tam? Do you know what my demons would have done to you if I hadn\u2019t stopped them? They are very loyal. You don\u2019t attack me here. Maybe in your silly human world, but not here.\u201d He spoke without raising his voice at her. His tone was level. His eyes didn\u2019t even glow, but they didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>The energy ball faded and died in her hand. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d kill me. Before you got to my house, I was going to come find you because I thought you\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>A look of surprise crossed his face, but he covered it. \u201cAnd that promise still stands.\u201d He moved toward her and stroked her cheek. \u201cI will kill you when I tire of you. And there is nothing you can do about it. Throwing energy balls at me will only make me disinclined to put you out of your misery. Just enjoy the ride, sweetheart. You\u2019ll die soon enough... when I get bored. Believe me, that\u2019s never taken longer than a week. Surely you can struggle through a week of passion with me.\u201d</p><p>Every fiber in her being screamed to kill him, not that she could. The second best option would be to seal him in a jar and bury it in the middle of his desert where no one would ever find it\u2014an option she was considering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your concubine.\u201d</p><p>A smirk. \u201cOf course you are. What other option do you have?\u201d</p><p>Smug bastard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get another demon to do it.\u201d Though any demon she asked could just do what Cain had done. Before long she\u2019d be the demon slut with a death wish. Gross. And anyway, there were no guarantees any given demon would be strong enough. Some might be too young. Did she really want to risk starting a new cycle? Cain was a sure thing.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t do it. They\u2019re afraid of me. You should be, too. I can do a lot more interesting things than kill you.\u201d</p><p>He left before she could form a retort. She hated that demon.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>When Cain stepped outside the tent, a group had gathered, murmuring and whispering. \u201cThat witch is mine. Anybody who touches her will face imprisonment. And I\u2019m not in the mood to make it a light sentence.\u201d</p><p>A few throats cleared and a couple of Yes sirs filled the air.</p><p>\u201cGood. Spread the word. Nobody touches her.\u201d He selected two demons from the group for the first guard duty and left the city to go to the one place he always went to think: the caves that served as the dimension\u2019s prison.</p><p>Each disobedient demon was in his own pod, the stone sealed tightly around him, starving and going mad. But anyone stumbling upon the caves wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>It was silent and peaceful in the dark, twisting caves. It was a place Cain could wander to think without fear of being disturbed. No demon in his right mind came near this place. They all feared it. It was their one symbol of abject terror, much like the humans feared Hell. No one walked in willingly, except the man with the keys to the place.</p><p>Cain sat on a large rock and put his head in his hands. He shed the glamour he always wore to attract prey and ran his fingers along the scar on his forehead. He was so good at betraying and killing people, so why hadn\u2019t he killed her?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a simple motivation to untangle. Part of it was jealousy\u2014the fact that she could waltz in and demand freedom when he had no such recourse. He was stuck in this form for eternity, why shouldn\u2019t someone else who\u2019d made that bed lie in it? Why should she get off so easily? The witch had actively chosen this.</p><p>Another, more subtle reason pushed from beneath the surface like grass fighting through the cracks in concrete. It was a reason he didn\u2019t want to analyze too deeply. She was two thousand years old. He might have six thousand years on her, but at some point the years blended together. It wasn\u2019t as if he wanted to make her his mate, but if he ever wanted something like that with someone, Tam represented the only woman who could be remotely suitable. Killing her before he was sure he never wanted that didn\u2019t seem prudent.</p><p>Human women now were such silly things. But he could feel the age on the witch in big and small ways: her nonchalance at the prospect of death, the deep wisdom in her eyes, her unconcern with her own nudity in the presence of strangers. Most women\u2014without thrall\u2014would have rushed to cover up if they weren\u2019t playing the role of seductress. They couldn\u2019t have just been there with him and the other demons and it not even occur to them that they should cover up. Tam had stood there in all her naked glory, too old to have sexual hang-ups.</p><p>She\u2019d also been strong enough that she could fight his thrall\u2014to some degree. That had never happened. The fact that she could make a snide remark in the middle of everything... it was hard not to respect that. How could he just snuff that out? He sighed. Within a week, I\u2019ll be bored, then I\u2019ll be able to do it. And if he couldn\u2019t? He might as well seal himself in a magic bottle. Getting involved with a witch was too dangerous.</p><p>He wandered the caves, not ready to go back to town. He didn\u2019t want to look at her or deal with demon whisperings about why he\u2019d kept a powerful witch alive in their camp. They surely knew by now why she was here. It had to have crossed all of their minds that it was simpler and safer to kill her than to protect her. As long as it wasn\u2019t by The Cycler\u2019s hand, it was a clear win.</p><p>But despite the things that made him want to kill her, she\u2019d fought with him\u2014on his side. She\u2019d pledged allegiance to fight with his kind and bring her coven with her. He hadn\u2019t felt such conflicting emotions about a human in a long time, so long he thought he\u2019d lost the ability to think of them in any terms but feeding. Disposable microwavable dinners in flesh cartons. A bit cuter, but that was the basic way he classed the species as a whole. Now he had a two-thousand-year-old, magical gourmet feast and he\u2019d just left the table.</p><p>He needed a drink.</p><p>Tam posed in front of a freestanding, antique mirror. The reflection was cloudy, like old mirrors are, but she could see enough. She\u2019d be lying if she said she didn\u2019t like the dress, but no way was she flouncing about looking like some Underworld God\u2019s concubine. She wouldn\u2019t give Cain the satisfaction.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t need protecting from the other demons. She had magic. The only reason she\u2019d been subdued by his thugs in the first place was that three had rushed her all at once right after she was depleted and disoriented from screwing Cain. Plus there was the earlier packing spell. It was a lot of energy to use all at once, ungrounded by other magic users\u2014even with her age. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a face at the mirror, angry with herself for sleeping with him. She should have known he\u2019d go back on his word. But why? What purpose could it serve? She had no illusions that she was some amazing sex bomb. He\u2019d had so many women that the odds there was something magical about her lady parts were so slim as to be idiotic. And at nearly two thousand, Tam didn\u2019t harbor those kinds of female delusions.</p><p>Even so, sex with the demon was everything she\u2019d ever thought it would be. She hated that he\u2019d been right about the fantasy thing. Yes, Cain had starred in a few, but he was just so hot and evil. That was like moth and flame with her. After all, once upon a time, she and Jack... She squeezed her eyes shut. Not thinking about that.</p><p>Their past affair wouldn\u2019t stop him from hunting her, but she\u2019d also known he might save her for last. She made a valiant effort, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking about it.</p><p>Tam rolled over, wrapping the sheets around herself. She smiled when she saw Jack standing in the doorway. He was fully dressed, like he\u2019d been out. She frowned. Was that blood on him? There was a dark gleam in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI killed Michael,\u201d he said, his voice flat of emotion even as his eyes danced with glee.</p><p>One of the coven.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a fight. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuried.\u201d</p><p>The word held so much finality.</p><p>\u201cBuried? Why? He\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cNo. He isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the loophole, Tamar. The one I didn\u2019t think about when we all bound our blood together. We can kill each other. Really kill. No more cycling.\u201d</p><p>If that were so, shouldn\u2019t he be grieving? Shouldn\u2019t he display some sign of remorse or guilt?</p><p>Tam got out of the bed slowly. With that crazed look in his eyes, bolting like a spooked deer would do her no favors. But surely he didn\u2019t want to kill her, too. There had always been a darkness in him, one she\u2019d ignored... or been drawn to. But things had changed.</p> <p>\u201cI feel different,\u201d he said. \u201cVery different.\u201d He crossed the room and pulled her into an embrace. \u201cSomething is happening,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want you to scry and find out what.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d done as he\u2019d asked and still wished she\u2019d refused and found a way out of there. Once he\u2019d known killing the others could make him stronger, he\u2019d promised they could still be together. He\u2019d let her have some of the kills, split his power with her, then they\u2019d do another spell to boost it. But she\u2019d been disgusted by the idea of going on a killing rampage for power, especially killing those who had stayed near and dear to her for centuries. They were the only people she didn\u2019t lose. Her only true family after everybody else had died off.</p><p>She\u2019d fled and warned the others to disperse and hide. A few of the women had come together again in London in the early 1800s, missing each other and convinced they were stronger together\u2014especially with the unlikely identities they\u2019d created. But he\u2019d sensed their combined power and hunted them like dogs.</p><p>Tam stood frozen as Jack looked up. She retched when she saw the bloody tableau in front of her. He put the knife down and smiled, his creepy gaze panning her body as if they\u2019d been lovers only yesterday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fast little rabbit, but not fast enough. We can still be together. I\u2019ll let you have the other kills.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and bolted down the alley, fighting to erase the image of her friend from her mind, Jack\u2019s horrible laughter following her well past the point she should have been able to hear it.</p><p>Tam couldn\u2019t look at herself in the mirror again. She didn\u2019t want to see the guilt or the tear streaks. All of it was her fault. She\u2019d used her gift to find the cavern. She\u2019d written the chant. She\u2019d scried for Jack after his first kill. Her evil former lover was hunting her, and the evil lover she\u2019d just been with wanted to keep her around until he got bored. No matter how many times she and Cain slept together, she wouldn\u2019t fall for a pretty monster again. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Once she\u2019d recovered enough power, she put her things in the middle of a circle on the ground, opened her magic book, poured the salt, and lit the candles. It took less energy to undo a spell than to create one\u2014at least when you were the creator of the spell. Undoing another witch\u2019s magic was a near impossibility half the time.</p> <p>Just as she finished, a demon burst into the tent. She summoned an energy ball and threw it at him, scorching him in the shoulder before he could go noncorporeal.</p><p>He growled. \u201cWhat are you doing, Witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpacking my things, Demon.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her and the pile of boxes and bags in the circle suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cGo get me something to eat,\u201d she said, suddenly famished. Well, yeah... running and sex with a demon and all that magic. Anybody would be ravenous. \u201cI\u2019m human. I still need food. Did you think I survived off sex with your evil leader?\u201d</p><p>He grumbled but left the tent, presumably to address her food demand.</p><p>She stepped outside to yell after him, \u201cOh, and I better see a cheeseburger and some fries when you get back\u2014nothing stupid an herbivore would eat like an apple or vegetable.\u201d Who knew what demons thought most humans ate?</p><p>When he\u2019d gone, she peeled the dress off and returned it to the trunk, then changed into something less slutty: jeans and a T-shirt.</p><p>Tam sat back down in the circle and pulled her tarot deck out of a bag. She unwrapped the red silk, shuffled the deck, and laid the cards out, focusing on her intent as best she could at the moment.</p><p>Not good. The death card was still in there, and the tower, and the lovers. The pretty epic major arcana cards. Ick. It looked like the kind of reading Romeo and Juliet would have gotten before that poisoning episode. The tower usually represented a rude awakening, war, or some type of dramatic shake-up in one\u2019s life. The lovers, of course, were self-explanatory. And the death card... in this spread? Well, it didn\u2019t seem like just a big change. But then, if death was her goal, why was she filled with so much foreboding over it?</p><p>It could mean anything. The cards could mean Jack was going to kill her, or Cain was. It could mean any kind of struggle or fight or revelation was soon to go down. It could be about her former relationship with Jack or sleeping with Cain now.</p><p>Tam made a frustrated sound and scattered the cards, not wanting to look at them anymore. In the scatter, they all turned face down\u2014except the death card. It was hard to read one\u2019s own cards anyway. You couldn\u2019t be as objective, always seeing what you wanted instead of what was there. Though there was no interpretation of those cards that sounded like a fun time.</p><p>There was a disturbance outside the tent, raised voices. Tam gathered the cards and wrapped them back in the silk before moving toward the doorway. She heard Cain and a demon guard on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhy is only one of you still here?\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhat is with this sudden rash of disobedience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat witch of yours was doing magic in there. Mace went in to check it out and came back with a scorch mark on his shoulder. She sent him on a cheeseburger run. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re keeping her alive. She\u2019s a danger to us. We should kill her now. We don\u2019t owe the other preternaturals anything.\u201d</p><p>Cain growled. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one to kill her. There is no we in this equation. And I\u2019ll kill her when I\u2019m good and damn ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sir,\u201d the demon said, losing his bravery.</p><p>Tam stumbled back as Cain ran into her. He arched a brow in that sexy way she didn\u2019t want to overthink.</p><p>\u201cYou sent one of my demons on a cheeseburger run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Do you understand humans eat food?\u201d</p><p>He looked sheepish but quickly recovered his badass demeanor. \u201cWhat kind of magic were you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust unpacking my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean for what purpose? To fucking have them. To wear normal freaking clothes! You think I want to flounce around here wearing something a micro-step above a negligee? Are you for real?\u201d</p><p>Cain pushed past her and emptied the bags, sorting through her things. \u201cI\u2019m taking the books and all magical tools and herbs and potions. You\u2019ll have no use for them here, and if you think I\u2019m sitting around while you concoct some incantation to seal me in a jar for all eternity, you\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t tell him that she hardly needed any of that to incant. She was far past that level. All she needed was her mind and voice. Even so, it took everything in her to keep her anger at bay. If Cain intended to kill her, taking her books and tools away was like he was taking her identity with him. Asking him to kill her had seemed like a smart option, but if she was going to just sit on death row waiting for him to lose control with her while everything that held any meaning in her life was taken away... It made her blood boil.</p><p>She struggled with the last energy reserves she had to throw a ball of gleaming purple energy at him. He dropped the books and rounded on her, his eyes glowing red, fangs descending. He let the demon come out and shifted fully, letting his true face and form out. He was larger as a demon, with reddish-brown-scaled skin. Deadly claws forced their way out of larger fingertips, and horns popped out of his shoulders like antlers. His clothing ripped from the transformation like a cheesy Hulk movie. In his true form, he oozed menace and fear and hatred and anger and every bad feeling in the universe.</p><p>His voice was distorted when he spoke. \u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201d</p><p>Maybe someone else would have huddled in a corner and cried, but Tam wasn\u2019t someone else. \u201cDo you have a thirty-second memory? We\u2019ve had this conversation. I want you to take me out of this world. Are you tired of me yet? Bored yet?\u201d</p><p>She threw another ball of energy. It had formed much more slowly than the others, but she didn\u2019t care. She threw it anyway. Cain leaped out of the way and charged her. He gripped her wrists so she couldn\u2019t throw any more. The joke was on him, because she was tapped out.</p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he growled. He was still in the demon form, looking her over like she was prime rib. \u201cLet me tell you how it\u2019s going to go, little girl. You\u2019ve pissed me off for the last time. I will take you out when I\u2019m good and ready, but before I do, I vow I\u2019ll make you love me. You\u2019ll beg me to keep you. And then I\u2019ll laugh and kill you.\u201d</p><p>Tam was out of magic, but not out of stupidity. She spit in his face.</p><p>He let go of her and glared. Tam rubbed her wrists where he\u2019d held them so tightly.</p><p>\u201cLet me let you in on a secret,\u201d she said. \u201cIn order for me to love you, you\u2019d have to be charming and halfway decent. A task you\u2019re failing miserably at.\u201d She doubted he could pull off charming and halfway decent even on his best day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got more experience in the art of seduction than you\u2019re prepared to handle.\u201d He went back to the circle, packed up her stuff and lugged it out of the tent behind him. It took him three trips.</p><p>She rushed to the doorway and pulled the tent flap back to yell at him. \u201cOh, and taking all my shit? Brilliant first move. I\u2019ll be swooning by dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>The demon guard showed up with a bag from a fast food joint and a soft drink. She glared at him and ripped it out of his hands, then went back to her tent. First food. Then nap. Then she wasn\u2019t sure what, but something.</p><p>Cain returned to the caves to hide Tam\u2019s books and tools behind a natural rock formation. When he was sure they were secure, he headed back into town, still angry with the witch, but wanting nothing more than to take her again. With his age, he didn\u2019t need to feed every day, but he often did\u2014just like humans ate chocolate not out of hunger, but because it tasted good. Unlike his brother\u2019s situation with Anna when she\u2019d still been a living human, Cain was confident he could sleep with Tam more frequently without killing her.</p><p>To kill a two-thousand-year-old witch with the level of power she\u2019d acquired just from living and using it for so long, he\u2019d have to make an actual effort. He\u2019d have to gorge himself on her\u2014not an unpleasant way to spend an evening.</p><p>But before he killed her, he wanted to make good on his threat. Maybe it was the danger she posed to him, or maybe it was his own ego and the fact that he had to use a heavy dose of thrall to make her give in to him... and even then her smart mouth still fought to the surface. He would break her. By the time he was finished, she would be desperate for his approval. And then he\u2019d toss her aside like all the rest. It was what he had to do. There was no other acceptable option.</p><p>When he got back, Jane, Cole, Anna, and Luc were standing outside his tent looking impatient and worried.</p><p>\u201cDid the meeting run on this long?\u201d It seemed that a lot of time had passed, though it was so easy to lose track of it in the demon dimension with no day and no time keeping machines like clocks or watches.</p><p>\u201cWe should speak privately,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Cain nodded and led them into his empty tent. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be convenient if you had a cell phone,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cCell phones don\u2019t work between dimensions, and technology doesn\u2019t work here at all. This place is made of too much magic. The two interfere and the magic wins.\u201d</p><p>Jane and Cole both pulled out their cell phones only to discover them dead.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSo we can\u2019t have TV or Internet or...\u201d</p><p>Cain shook his head, amused. It was easy to forget Jane was still such a new demon. Of course she would have known by now that such things didn\u2019t exist in his dimension, but that they couldn\u2019t exist hadn\u2019t penetrated. But then, she\u2019d been preoccupied with raising her young pup back in the human realm.</p><p>\u201cBut cell phones are really convenient,\u201d Jane said, as if it were some arbitrary rule Cain could change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luc cleared his throat. \u201cNobody cares, Jane. We\u2019ve got more important matters to attend to here than your instant communication withdrawals. Some day you\u2019ll be glad there\u2019s a place you can go without those annoying things ringing for your attention.\u201d</p><p>Cole growled. The werewolf alpha didn\u2019t do well when anyone talked down to his mate. He lost all his sense and reason. Another thing Cain didn\u2019t find very attractive as a lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cWill somebody please tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Cain was growing irritated.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThe Cycler has struck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Only two little Indians left.</p><p>The pack leader continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hit the human media. It\u2019s bad. Come with us, we need to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with Tam,\u201d Anna said. Luc nodded and kissed her, then she left the tent, going right through it in her ghostly form without Luc to hold onto.</p><p>Cain looked away from the display of affection. There was no reason to be jealous of his brother. In the mating, Anna had fundamentally changed\u2014a slow transformation that, over time, would make her more demon than human, but changes had happened in Luc as well. He could only feed from her. Luc had given up the freedom of the hunt, the freedom to seduce and kill. He'd given up what he was as an incubus.</p><p>The demon leader growled, and they all looked at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luc said, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>But Luc knew him too well; the suspicion didn\u2019t leave his eyes. The man upstairs had royally fucked Cain and all the other demons he\u2019d created. They could either be free or happy. They couldn\u2019t have both. Maybe Cain would never be enslaved by his own guilt, but he\u2019d always known that if he took a mate, his freedom was over forever. Luc had known it, too. But he hadn\u2019t cared. That stupid witch had wormed her way into his heart. What was it with witches and their kind?</p><p>Luc couldn\u2019t play around with others. Not based on some internal moral code, but literally, it wouldn\u2019t work. If he tried to harm his mate in any way, it would only hurt him twice as much\u2014that was how tightly he and Anna were linked. Cain had discouraged his demons from mating, playing up the freedom they\u2019d lose. In truth, he didn\u2019t want the man upstairs to be right about anything. He didn\u2019t want to believe his punishment had been deserved or that it served any rehabilitative purpose. It made it easier to maintain the anger.</p><p>It was mid-morning when they reached the hive in Cary Town. Cole took the lead\u2014after all, they were his caves that his pack lived in. The pack showed deference to Jane and Cole, but pulled back when they saw Cain and Luc.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all right,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI told you, we have an alliance with the demons because of Jane.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the pack relaxed a fraction at the reassurance, but the rest drew back and tried to make themselves invisible against the walls.</p><p>\u201cMara, get the television set up, please,\u201d Jane said. The wolf disappeared down one of the cave\u2019s corridors. She returned several minutes later, rolling a large cart with a flat screen TV on it into the center of the main den which served as a rec room and meeting hall of sorts.</p><p>\u201cPlease remove all small children back to the living quarters. We don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>Mother wolves ushered children down a separate hallway. Whatever was about to be revealed, the pack hadn\u2019t seen it yet.</p><p>\u201cAll right, brace yourselves. There has been nothing but this on the news for the past hour.\u201d Jane clicked a button and the television blinked on.</p><p>A newscaster stared out at them with a blank look plastered on her face as she spoke. \u201cThe president has issued a statement asking that everyone remain calm. We don\u2019t know what this means yet.\u201d</p><p>Jane changed to another channel. This one showed an image of the crime scene. This time a man on the scene spoke into a microphone.</p><p>\u201cFull information of the state of the body is not being released, but if the killer is trying to emulate Jack the Ripper, it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to guess the grisly details. The alleged killer released a bizarre letter directly to the media only thirty minutes before the body was discovered. In this letter he seems to be implying that he is Jack the Ripper. Of course, this is quite impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot everybody is that skeptical,\u201d Cole said. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>On cue, Jane flicked past several more channels until she stopped on a news special that claimed to be covering all details on this fascinating case, up-to-the-minute and live.</p><p>\u201cThis is what we wanted you to see,\u201d Jane said. She turned the volume up, as if it were necessary. It seemed to be a weird quirk from her human days: if something is important, make it louder, even if everyone can already hear it.</p><p>\u201c... So you\u2019re in the process of analyzing the handwriting of this letter?\u201d</p><p>An academic type, with Einstein-crazy blond hair and thin-wire-rimmed glasses perched on his nose, nodded vigorously. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And what we\u2019ve learned so far is that the handwriting is remarkably close to the original Ripper letters. We\u2019ll need to do more intense study, of course, but if it\u2019s not him, it\u2019s a remarkable forgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Doctor Horner? It must be a forgery. Jack the Ripper has no doubt been dead for over a century.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looked at his hands, an embarrassed flush creeping into his cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the final tests say.\u201d</p><p>Jane flipped through the channels again, worry creasing her brow. \u201cYou know what they\u2019ll find when they run the final tests. Some will always think it\u2019s a forgery, of course, but you know how the media is. They\u2019ll amp the Ripper angle. And that\u2019s not even the worst of it.\u201d She stopped on another station where angry protesters gathered, chanting around a government building.</p><p>\u201cStop hiding the truth. We know what\u2019s out there!\u201d protestors chanted. They held signs that read things like: Demons among us, The Ripper is back, Tell the truth, We\u2019re not alone.</p><p>Over the din, a pretty brunette in a raspberry-pink suit and matching lips spoke into a microphone with the ringleader of the protest group.</p><p>The man she spoke with wore flannel and had wild eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known something like this would happen,\u201d he ranted, flailing his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time the people knew about magic and witches and demons and vampires and shapeshifters and all the rest. They\u2019re out there. They\u2019re all out there, and they\u2019ve been preying on us for years. It\u2019s time the truth came out.\u201d</p><p>The reporter raised an eyebrow. \u201cCould you elaborate on that thought, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. The world we live in isn\u2019t the world we think we live in. People need to wake up to what\u2019s out there and fight for their freedom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-and what do you think the killer is?\u201d The woman looked like she was watching a train wreck, too morbidly fascinated to look away or stop the cameras rolling.</p><p>\u201cHe could be anything. But he\u2019s evil. They all are. We have to rally the people together, make sure the world knows, and stop this. Stop it now.\u201d</p><p>Jane clicked off the TV and Cain just stared, trying to absorb it all.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t possibly take any of that seriously,\u201d he said, still not believing what he\u2019d seen. How could the human world become so unsettled in such a short period?</p><p>Cole ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s partly to do with this media clusterfuck over the letter. I don\u2019t think you get what a pop culture icon the Ripper has become. But I think it might be more. If Jack is old enough and has been absorbing the powers of others like him, he could have some magical control over individuals or even groups to induce panic. The letter itself could have some sort of enchantment on it. We\u2019d have to ask Dayne if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>The werewolves in the den murmured amongst themselves.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jane replied. \u201cWe\u2019re having a pack meeting in a few minutes, and Cole will get the word out through the theriantype.com network. We\u2019ve got a ton of magic users we can pull to our side if this thing turns into a full-scale war. Our therian donors will be on board and can speak to others they know. Charlee\u2019s called a meeting at the penthouse for after sunset tonight. None of the vamps here know about any of this yet. When they do, the shit is going to hit the fan. If they think the humans know, they may become less restrained and forget about the rule to cover their tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you and Luc can infiltrate the crime scene? Find out what they know, find out who the cycler he killed was, anything that might help lead back to him?\u201d Cole said.</p><p>Cain glanced over at his brother for the first time since the news. Luc looked pale.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cain said. Ordinarily he\u2019d argue about human dimension issues being none of his concern, but he could see how this situation could escalate\u2014and escalate fast\u2014without demon help. The entire preternatural world might have to unite on this one.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>After she\u2019d eaten, Tam decided to wander. If Cain thought she\u2019d stay in the tent indefinitely until he deigned to kill her or they caught Jack, she had a newsflash for him. The guards were terrified to let her leave, but she threatened to curse them and produced an energy ball scary enough for them to let her pass. They had no other option. With her energy recharged, they could hardly take her. If they went noncorporeal to avoid her energy balls, they couldn\u2019t touch her, either. Stalemate.</p><p>She\u2019d been here long enough that it seemed the sun should have come up by now. She was beginning to suspect there was no sun in this dimension. She hadn\u2019t seen anything growing\u2014a sure sign that the place was cloaked forever in darkness. But it was a peaceful kind of darkness, one she felt oddly safe in. And she hadn\u2019t felt safe in so long she\u2019d forgotten what it felt like.</p><p>She meandered down the cobblestone streets, watched the street performers, and stole fruit from carts\u2014since everything seemed to be free. The demons didn\u2019t have a concept or need for money. It wasn\u2019t a dimension of scarcity, but of plenty.</p><p>A female demon stood at one of the fruit carts, giving Tam the once-over. \u201cYou\u2019re Cain\u2019s new pet? The very old witch? I should warn you women don\u2019t last long with him.\u201d</p><p>Tam rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Cain\u2019s new prisoner because he won\u2019t kill me like I asked him to.\u201d</p><p>Violet eyes raised in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s a very odd human request. Most of you are terrified of death. I\u2019m Daria, by the way.\u201d She extended a bejeweled hand and Tam shook it.</p><p>\u201cTamara, but most people call me Tam.\u201d</p><p>Daria tossed her a peach, and Tam peeled off the soft, fuzzy skin, thankful for something familiar in the midst of everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill you, but if you need a magical death, it\u2019ll have to be one of the boys. And they won\u2019t go against Cain\u2019s orders. The feeling around here is that if anyone kills you but him, that demon might never be released from the caves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe caves?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s where the demons who defy Cain\u2019s laws are kept for years\u2014nothing but boredom and starvation. It makes us go mad. One just got out after a forty-year stint. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d Not that Tam had developed any illusions that Cain was anything more than a pretty monster like Jack.</p><p>Daria shrugged. \u201cMaybe. But we have fewer numbers than other preternatural species. Only a thousand or so. The man upstairs doesn\u2019t make demons frequently. It\u2019s got to be something personal with him. Sure, we can\u2019t die, but we can be tortured or cursed. We have a lot of skills that protect us, but the human dimension could become a dangerous place for us if we don\u2019t follow Cain\u2019s laws to the letter. Even with our powers, we can still be caught off guard or found out, which is why it shocks me he\u2019s keeping such a powerful witch alive. You could do real damage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to kill me. You see how well he listens. Not like I was begging and pleading for my life with the big doe eyes or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Tam turned to see Anna blazing a trail her way. When her friend reached them, she tried to grab Tam\u2019s arm, but her ghostly hand went right through.</p><p>Anna let out a frustrated sound. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how frequently I still forget about the noncorporeal thing.\u201d</p><p>Daria laughed. \u201cBe glad for it. It\u2019s a strength, not a weakness. It\u2019s one of the most useful skills our species has\u2014it protects you while you\u2019re waiting on your other powers. It\u2019s just the first one you get. The others will come.\u201d</p><p>Anna frowned. \u201cI thought I was a ghost or something.\u201d</p><p>Daria shook her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a ghost. Surely your mate explained it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, but...\u201d She appeared to be thinking back. \u201cI just assumed. Maybe when I said ghost he thought I was being sarcastic. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She turned back to Tam. \u201cCan we go back to your tent and talk?\u201d</p><p>Tam exchanged a look with Daria, unsure she wanted to hear whatever Cain-related lecture her friend had concocted in their time away from each other. The demon gave her a sympathetic look and tossed another peach. The witch caught it in midair.</p><p>\u201cSure, Anna,\u201d she said, feeling guilty the way she was thinking about her friend. She\u2019d practically tricked her into Luc\u2019s arms so she could have an immortal friend, and now she was planning on leaving her behind. The least she could do was have a conversation.</p><p>When they got back to Tam\u2019s tent, she parked herself on the couch. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have to talk to Cain privately about?\u201d</p><p>Tam shrugged and worked on her evasiveness. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Anna planted her hands on her ghostly hips. \u201cNo, seriously, what was so secret that you could tell the grand high evil one, but not me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Anna looked hurt. \u201cHave you guys bonded now because you\u2019re both ancient? I know I\u2019ve been away a lot, but I\u2019ve seen you since becoming Luc\u2019s mate. I\u2019m a part of this world now, so you could have told me.\u201d She hadn\u2019t sat down because an attempt would be pointless. She\u2019d sink right through the couch. She just sort of hovered.</p><p>Tam sighed. \u201cI know you think this is personal, but it isn\u2019t. I was trying to forget, myself. This new cycle has been the most normal I\u2019ve had in a long time. I usually hid and stayed in the shadows when a new cycle started. This time I got adopted. I kind of regressed. I wanted to forget everything and pretend I had a normal life, even with the witch stuff. You let me remember what childhood was like. And it was great. Sometimes I actually felt like I was your age and not just pretending.\u201d She paused to catch a breath and gather her thoughts to make sure she was saying it right. \u201cAs we grew up, I just wanted to keep the illusion alive. And since you seemed freaked out by basic witch stuff, it was another excuse. I know I could have told you, but until Jack started hunting me again, I wanted to keep my fantasy life. If I told you, then it was really real for me, and I wasn\u2019t just a regular witch that lived a long time.\u201d</p><p>Anna stayed quiet for several minutes, processing. Finally she said, \u201cDamnit, Tam. Why do you have to make it all sound so reasonable? I can\u2019t even be mad at you. At least I don\u2019t have to worry about you dying. It was something that bothered me a lot, that you\u2019d age and leave me behind.\u201d</p> <p>It was like a knife stabbing her in the gut. She couldn\u2019t look at Anna, not while plotting her own demise. \u201cYou know... something could happen. I could still die. I mean... Jack is hunting, and he seems intense about it if he\u2019s starting the letter charade again.\u201d</p><p>Her friend shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re safe here. Cain promised to protect you. No one can get into this dimension without permission from Cain or without being a demon himself. Even if The Cycler knew where to find you, he can\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>Tam very much doubted that was true. Anna hadn\u2019t been around in their world long enough. She didn\u2019t yet understand that there was no such thing as total safety in a world with so much magical chaos. The only way she would be safe was if Cain killed her like he\u2019d promised. She wondered what Anna would think if she knew he was playing both sides, giving out two contradictory promises. It was anybody\u2019s guess which, if either, promise he\u2019d choose to keep in the end.</p><p>\u201cTam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was it like when you died? I mean, that period of time before you came back again? Did you go to heaven?\u201d</p><p>The question made Tam\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cNo. Nothing happens. It\u2019s just a void. I die, and then I wake up\u2014like a dreamless sleep, except when I wake, for a second I can\u2019t catch my breath and feel like I\u2019m dying again. It\u2019s creepy. Sometimes I\u2019m afraid something will go wrong and I won\u2019t wake up. I\u2019ll just stop existing.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to become nothingness, she just wanted to break the spell and get out of the endless loop she was on.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Oh.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I should tell you,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>The brunette looked expectant. After a long pause, she said, \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t hate me but... I pushed you into the mating with Luc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! You offered to help me get Luc\u2019s mark removed before I completed the final ritual.\u201d</p><p>Tam peeled the second peach Daria had given her. It was something to focus on so she didn\u2019t have to look at her friend. \u201cThat was only after I saw how distressed it was making you. For a while I was intent on you becoming his mate for my own selfish reasons.\u201d</p><p>Anna looked like she wanted to hug her. It was the exact opposite reaction Tam had expected. She\u2019d been prepared for screaming and was thankful things couldn\u2019t be thrown at her.</p><p>\u201cI understand. I mean, you wanted us both to be immortal so we wouldn\u2019t lose each other, right? Why should I be mad about that? Besides, I love Luc. We were meant to be together in my last life, but I was too stupid and stubborn. Anyway, it was Cain that made me set the house on fire and trapped me inside. At that point I had to make a decision about where I wanted to spend eternity. I wanted to spend it with Luc. I don\u2019t regret that decision. I still could have chosen otherwise. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking about you when I acted like I did.\u201d</p><p>Anna nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Henry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat bird you had?\u201d</p><p>Tam got up to stretch her legs. \u201cYeah, only he wasn\u2019t exactly a bird. He was a therian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Seriously? I changed clothes in that room when we were teenagers.\u201d</p><p>Tam chuckled. \u201cYeah, he thought you were hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be glad I can\u2019t be solid right now. I\u2019d throw stuff at your head.\u201d</p><p>Tam grinned. Of all the things for her to get angry about. It wasn\u2019t being lured into mating with an immortal demon, it was that a raven therian had seen her in her underwear. Anna was always obsessed with the wrong things.</p><p>\u201cWait... how long do they live? How long was he with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies. From the late 1700s on. I\u2019d dispersed from the rest of the coven and was lonely. The bird came to me. We were really close.\u201d</p><p>A lightbulb seemed to come on over Anna\u2019s head. \u201cThat\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t come out of your house for three weeks after he died. I thought it was a bit much mourning over a bird, but I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you know. I still see him occasionally in dreams, but it\u2019s not the same. He was my best friend besides you.\u201d</p><p>Now she was about to do the same thing to Anna that Henry had done when he\u2019d died: rip up one of her anchors. But she had to. Anna would understand in time, and she wasn\u2019t alone. She was surrounded by others like her, and she had Luc. It was different.</p><p>Keep telling yourself that.</p><p>Cain and Luc moved through the human dimension just outside the crime scene, invisible and noncorporeal. As demons, they could sense each other even if they couldn\u2019t see each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to kill Tam,\u201d Cain said. He couldn\u2019t see his brother for a reaction, but he could guess at the disappointed and disgusted look he\u2019d find if he could. Luc was so predictably good that way\u2014hardly a demon anymore. He hadn\u2019t been the same since Anna. It was too much humanity for Cain\u2019s taste.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you\u2019d protect her... Though, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m shocked at this revelation.\u201d</p><p>Cain bristled at that. He\u2019d been loyal to Luc when he\u2019d been trapped in a house by a curse, bringing him his meals. And he protected his own. It was a low blow for Luc to act as if he couldn\u2019t be anything more than a Judas. He was still miffed about that. Hadn\u2019t Cain been the first true betrayer in their history? And Judas got all the glory.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to kill her. She wants out. She thinks it\u2019s safer, and I agree.\u201d Cain felt Luc stop moving, so he did, too. He knew he could get his brother on his side if Luc knew it was the witch\u2019s request.</p><p>\u201cSo why isn\u2019t she dead yet? You\u2019ve had plenty of time alone with her. You didn\u2019t take the opportunity to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Yet again he was glad for the invisibility that cloaked them. He couldn\u2019t tell anybody this if they could see his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s not dead because....\u201d Luc seemed to be taking Cain\u2019s decision to kill her well, especially since she was Anna\u2019s best friend. In the end, Luc could be a pragmatist if need be, and he was always interested in the greater good. And they were brothers. Despite their differences, there were some issues they were one on.</p><p>Cain fought with himself over whether to share the next bit, but the need to tell somebody won over the inner voice that urged him to keep quiet. \u201cLucien, she\u2019s two thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind.\u201d</p><p>They both materialized, hidden behind a copse of trees a few blocks from the small town Montana crime scene.</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me what this is about,\u201d his brother said.</p><p>Cain looked off into the distance. \u201cShe\u2019s just unique, all right? And she\u2019s strong. Did you know she can resist my thrall even with her shields down? Not a lot, but enough to make snarky commentary.\u201d</p><p>Luc laughed, the pieces coming together. \u201cYou want to keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I do not want to keep her. She\u2019s the enemy. I\u2019m not you. I don\u2019t fall for my food. I don\u2019t get involved with witches. I\u2019m just... not bored with her yet. She can\u2019t come in and demand I release her from what she is. I don\u2019t get that option. Why should she? Why should she get to do some magic of her own free will that makes her immortal and not have to deal with those consequences? I should torture the hell out of her for even asking.\u201d</p><p>Luc snorted. \u201cPlease. She\u2019d drop your ass with that energy ball magic she does. You can\u2019t take her if she doesn\u2019t want to be taken, and you like that. I know you. You like a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop psychoanalyzing me now? I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine spilling his guts to one of the other demons, not even Daria or Jackson. Daria would just blab. That succubus could be such a gossip.</p><p>Luc clapped a hand on Cain\u2019s back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you confided in me. It makes it feel more like old times between us\u2014before I was trapped in the house, I mean. Not old times when we were human.\u201d</p><p>The demon leader laughed, the memory of their human days fuzzy by now. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I cared so much what the man upstairs thought about me. You know if it was down to him and you again, I\u2019d pick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Anna about any of this. That\u2019s an official order.\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an official order. I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>With that off his chest, Cain went invisible again. Luc followed suit, and they made their way through the trees to the house with the police tape around it. A group of reporters had gathered and were furiously taking notes, their cameras recording.</p><p>Cain moved around the perimeter far from the mechanical eyes. Sometimes human cameras caught things\u2014not a full demon, but moving streaks or balls of light, or what humans who were into ghost hunting liked to called orbs. Who knew why a demon should show up as light on a human camera? One would think it would be puffs of dark smoke or something else sinister, but if this thing was going where the TV reports he\u2019d seen so far suggested, they didn\u2019t need more clues to fuel the fire.</p><p>The two of them passed through the wall into the house from the back, and made their way to the room where the body had been. The investigators were in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cGreat, the body\u2019s already at the morgue,\u201d Luc said, not at all happy about it.</p><p>\u201cProbably not much of interest on the body, anyway. Let\u2019s just search here. We might find something to give Anthony at the meeting tonight.\u201d He hated working with a half-breed. Hated it. But the winds were changing. It felt as if something dramatically bad was about to happen. As much as he loathed the idea, he couldn\u2019t afford to be too good to work with a vampire.</p><p>The investigators in the hallway talked for a few more minutes, then went outside to face the reporters, locking the doors behind them. When they were gone, the demons materialized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check this room,\u201d Cain said. \u201cYou check the rest of the house.\u201d</p><p>Luc gave a curt nod and went into the hallway. Cain was glad for the peace. Maybe telling his brother had been a mistake. Of course, Luc was going to see it differently from how he meant it. He didn\u2019t even know how he meant it. If he\u2019d waited, in a week Tam would be dead. Nobody would have had to know about any of it. But it was lonely keeping everything to himself. Luc was the one demon he could confide in without feeling weak.</p><p>Cain went through doors and closets, shuffled through some papers on the dresser, and took in the room in general. A Victorian-style lamp had been knocked over. Blood coated the bed. He moved closer. Something was off.</p><p>\u201cLuc!\u201d</p><p>The other demon yelled from down the hallway, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t killed here. It was somewhere else, then she was transported.\u201d In this neighborhood, how would he have accomplished it? It wasn\u2019t as if the house were isolated. Some type of cloaking spell or glamour maybe? \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to the neighbor next door. You keep looking here.\u201d</p><p>Cain dematerialized and went back through the wall where he\u2019d come in. The investigators didn\u2019t seem to realize the body had been moved. The difference in how the scene would appear was subtle, but he\u2019d seen thousands of years of human barbarism. Given the ritualistic nature of the killing, the blood patterns would have been different. It was a good misdirect, though. It would fool a human.</p><p>The killer had brought her in, arranged her, then messed up the room to make it look like the struggle had happened here. Given how convincing the scene was, who would assume a second location? The more locations, the more chances of getting caught.</p><p>Depending on time of death, anything that had happened more recently at the house might not have been considered important\u2014assuming the police had worked their way through canvassing the neighborhood. Since they\u2019d just finished with the house, interviews may not have started yet.</p><p>He slipped over to the house next door, noting the investigators dealing with the media out front. Cain rang the doorbell.</p><p>An older woman, maybe mid-seventies, answered and looked past him, confused by her empty front porch. \u201cH-hello?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The demon pushed into the house, his hand clamping down over her mouth. \u201cShhhh, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>But his words did no good. Who wouldn\u2019t be terrified of an invisible being grabbing them? When the door was shut, he materialized and put the whammy on her. It was better than a polygraph test.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I live by myself since Joe died,\u201d she said, relaxed, her eyes glassy and unfocused.</p> <p>\u201cHas anyone been by to question you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>Good. \u201cDid you see anyone next door at any point today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA delivery man. I was going to check my mail, but something made me stay inside. I looked out the window and there he was. He scared me for some reason, so I didn\u2019t go out.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Cain couldn\u2019t read minds exactly, but the vampires could. Anthony could go directly into her mind and practically get a photograph of The Cycler. If that was the delivery man\u2019s true identity. They could ask Tam for a description, of course, but Jack had no doubt changed his look over the years. What the woman had seen would be most accurate.</p> <p>His eyes fixed on the old woman\u2019s. \u201cYou will sleep until I come for you. You will not wake up otherwise, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>The woman went unconscious, and the demon caught her before she hit the floor. He took her back to her room, laid her on her bed, and locked the front door before going back to the crime scene.</p><p>\u201cCain? Is that you?\u201d Luc called from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You won\u2019t believe my luck. I found a possible witness...\u201d As he spoke he moved toward his brother\u2019s voice.</p><p>A door popped open with stairs leading down to the basement. Luc\u2019s eyes were wide when they met his. \u201cI hit the mother lode.\u201d</p><p>Cain followed his brother downstairs. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. The basement was filled with magical accoutrements of all sorts and an impressive array of books, some of them clearly from other dimensions. A few looked like some Cain had in the libraries of his own dimension.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got down here, it was just a musty old basement, but then this all appeared. Who do you think put up the glamour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be The Cycler,\u201d Cain said. \u201cAny glamour done by the deceased would have dropped as soon as she\u2019d died.\u201d Glamours took a lot of energy to maintain. It seemed a waste of good magical energy for the occupant of the home. \u201cWhy would Jack bother if he wants to reveal the truth to the world?\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s eyes lit with excitement. \u201cBecause he\u2019s having two different conversations. He left this clue for us. Maybe not us specifically, but someone from Anthony\u2019s group. I\u2019d put money on it.\u201d</p><p>In the center of the room, on a weathered wooden table, was a rolled out scroll of parchment. A magic book at the top and bottom of the scroll held it open and flat. It was a list of the members of Jack\u2019s coven with a line drawn through each name and a date beside it. The names were listed in the order they\u2019d been killed, with the newest addition at the bottom: a woman named Naomi.</p><p>Underneath Naomi\u2019s name were the names of the two remaining cyclers besides Jack. The last name on the list was Tamar. Little hearts had been drawn beside Tam\u2019s name in blood\u2014no doubt blood from the latest victim. Cain growled. Why were hearts beside Tam\u2019s name?</p><p>\u201cGo look for a plastic storage bag in the kitchen\u2014the kind that zips,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>While Luc was gone, Cain took in the rest of the basement. Would more investigators be by to find this? He couldn\u2019t imagine how someone wouldn\u2019t stumble upon it eventually. The basement had to be cleared out, especially the more esoteric books.</p><p>Most of the other things looked like your average occult-shop fare. Though, with the possible outing of the preternatural world, a complete absence of occult objects would be safer. When Luc returned, Cain carefully rolled up the scroll and sealed it in the bag. Then the two demons dematerialized, slipped out the back of the house, and woke the old lady.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very nice looking young gentleman,\u201d the old lady said, her fingertips trailing over Cain\u2019s cheek when he woke her. \u201cI bet you have a lot of lady friends.\u201d</p><p>The demon chuckled. \u201cMa\u2019am, you don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>When they got back to the demon dimension Cain said, \u201cTake her straight to Anthony so he can get a picture of who she saw. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d He\u2019d been in too many time zones today, but he was sure sunset would arrive soon in Cary Town. Either way, Luc could hold her at the penthouse until the vampire king rose.</p><p>Luc led the old woman away, and Cain stopped off in his tent and wrote down the crime scene address. When he returned, about fifty demons waited with expectant looks. It was nearing feeding time, and some of them lived in the human dimension, so getting this many together had been a near miracle, courtesy of Daria.</p><p>He handed the paper to the succubus. \u201cGo to this address and make sure you go in invisible. We don\u2019t need any witnesses. The victim\u2019s basement is filled with occult tools and books, some of them highly sensitive. Clear out the basement and bring it all to my tent. I\u2019ll deal with it. It\u2019s too dangerous for the humans to find. I don\u2019t want so much as a sage stick or jar of salt left behind. If any humans discover it, wipe their memories and relocate them, but don\u2019t kill. We don\u2019t need more attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, boss.\u201d She turned to the assembled demons. \u201cLet\u2019s move out.\u201d The others followed her to the dimensional portal.</p><p>Cain moved with purpose to Tam\u2019s tent, the ziplock bag clutched in his hand, careful not to damage the parchment inside. The tent was empty, but Jackson and Mace stood guard anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d he snarled at Jackson as he fought with the tent flap to get out.</p><p>\u201cAnna went to Cary Town for the meeting. I don\u2019t know where Tam is.\u201d</p><p>Cain felt the glow come to his eyes as the fire rose up in them. \u201cDo you understand the concept of what a guard does? Nobody goes in or out without my say-so.\u201d He had half a mind to put them in the caves, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. Jackson was loyal. It wasn\u2019t like him to defy orders. Cain took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the glow to go out of them so he could think straight.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, the last thing I want to do is cross you, but she\u2019s too strong. We can\u2019t control her. She threatened us with energy balls and curses. I could have rounded up more demons, but then we would have ended up hurting her, and you said not to. We figured it was better to let her wander and burn off some steam. She can\u2019t get out of the dimension.\u201d</p><p>Cain looked to the other demon, who only nodded to confirm the story. \u201cIf she comes back before I find her, tell her to stay put. I need her for something.\u201d</p><p>He wandered the desert for over an hour, moving at full demon speed but coming up empty. She couldn\u2019t have moved faster or covered more ground in the time he\u2019d been away. Had Tam somehow gotten a demon to help her? Because she wasn\u2019t in his dimension. If she was out, The Cycler would find her and they were all fucked.</p><p>There was only one place he hadn\u2019t checked, but surely the caves were too foreboding for her to enter. It was Cain\u2019s own private sanctuary, and the idea that the witch may have breached it made the fire glow in his eyes. Not only that, her magic stuff was there\u2014she\u2019d be armed. Or more armed than usual.</p><p>He put on another burst of speed to get to the caves, stopping dead in his tracks when he got inside. The witch sat on the ground in a meditative posture. Though the caves were dark, a light glowed out of her. Her eyes were closed, her face peaceful and turned upward. She looked like an angel. There was no sign that she\u2019d found her things, at least.</p><p>Cain\u2019s voice was a low growl when he spoke. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing in here?\u201d</p><p>The light that glowed around her faded and she jumped, her eyes opening wide as she scrambled back.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cScared of me now?\u201d</p><p>She got to her feet and produced an energy ball too fast for him to react and tossed it, narrowly grazing his ear. \u201cWhat do you think? I was deep in meditation. You startled me. This is the only place I can focus without interruption.\u201d</p><p>Cain concentrated and produced a ball of fire in his hand.</p><p>Tam had another energy ball ready. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to die. I\u2019m sure this counts as a magical death. We could find out if you like? Though I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to die by fire. I\u2019ve seen my share of witch burnings. It\u2019s a brutal death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Been there, done that.\u201d</p><p>The retort caught him off guard, and for some reason the images it produced bothered him.</p><p>Tam braced herself, ready to disarm him, but the fireball hadn\u2019t been meant for her; he just couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to screw with her head over the assumption. He stepped to the side and lit a torch on the cave wall. \u201cRelax, this isn\u2019t for you. Remember, I planned on seducing you first for the fun of watching you beg me to keep you. I continue to find that plan amusing.\u201d</p><p>She held the purple glowing ball steady in her hand, clearly not trusting his word. He didn\u2019t blame her. He wasn\u2019t all that trustworthy when it came to things he told humans. He moved through the main part of the cave, lighting torches on the wall, then he let the fire fizzle out of his hand. For a moment he assessed the space, worried about the ventilation with a human, but the cave was large. It should be fine.</p><p>He laid the bag with the scroll on the ground and peeled his shirt off.</p><p>Tam took a step back, the idea of being his toy on demand not yet having settled in her mind\u2014if her reaction to him was any indication.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know. You and me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wandered out here. Nobody dragged you. And as you said, we won\u2019t be interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>The chuckle turned into a full-bodied laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an incubus, sweetheart. I know that\u2019s not true. You\u2019re always in the mood when I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks turned an endearing shade of pink, visible even in the weak torchlight, but she quickly recovered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? You aren\u2019t going to kill me anyway. You\u2019re just amusing yourself with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the shields, Tam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Work for it.\u201d A smirk lit her face as she let the ball of energy burn out in her hand. \u201cSeduce me. No tricks.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her against the wall, using his larger size in an intimidation attempt, but she remained unconcerned. He tried not to think about how much he loved that about her. He almost pulled back in surprise when Tam kissed a trail from the side of his neck up to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI will never beg you to keep me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not one of these bubble-headed bimbos you take home every night. I have much more experience, enough to know the difference between sex and love. I don\u2019t have sparkly romance fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She did want him; he could smell it; he could feel it. Her energy pulsed with it. She may as well have been under his thrall, but her words still shook him because inside them, he felt the kernel of truth. It was the kind of truth that could be spoken because there was no danger in anyone believing it. But he believed it. God, she was just as jaded as he was.</p><p>He wanted to dampen her desire and end her game. \u201cOkay. No tricks, then.\u201d He couldn\u2019t feed if she didn\u2019t want him, but who said he had to feed? He had her alone out here in the caves in his dimension. He could do whatever he wanted with her, assuming he could stop her from hitting him with an energy ball or chanting him into a jar. Those were big assumptions, but right now all he wanted was to wipe out her upper hand.</p><p>He dropped his glamour, smoothing away all the perfection to leave someone who looked like a real man. A little less muscled, a few more lines, a scar across his forehead that marked him forever as a betrayer.</p><p>\u201cYou must be a mind reader. Rugged is just my type,\u201d she said, the coy taunt still in her voice.</p><p>Fucking witch. She was right. He really wasn\u2019t playing with his usual dimwitted bubble-heads.</p><p>She didn\u2019t resist when he pulled off her top. She fumbled with the buttons on his pants while he dealt with hers. They ended up in a tangle of limbs and clothes on the cave floor. Cain laughed. Laughed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh when he was with a woman. They were food for fuck\u2019s sake, not friends or companions.</p><p>The two of them struggled out of their pants.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he looked her over in the dim light. \u201cWhat\u2019s your angle?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged innocently. \u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap. Why so eager? No matter what your body wants, you\u2019ve made it clear you find me repulsive. I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to think my plan to seduce you is already working. I\u2019m good, but I\u2019m not that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that plan... if you keep bringing it up, it\u2019s hard to trick me,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to tell you, I guess. I think I can get you to lose control and kill me far before you make me beg for anything\u2014least of all you keeping me.\u201d</p><p>Cain scowled and scooted away from her. His eyes caught the scroll in the bag. If he slept with her so soon after the last time, it would deplete her energy, and she might actually get what she wanted. He put his pants on. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a baby. And a bad loser.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to ogle her as she stretched out her long limbs like a lazy cat\u2014no doubt for his benefit, trying to bring him back to her plan.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hunting for you to sleep with you. I need you to do a spell.\u201d I just got momentarily distracted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went down a small corridor to the large rock he\u2019d hidden her things behind. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her coming out to the caves. No one came here as a volunteer, and surely she could sense the anger and pain of the place. After this, he would put her stuff in a pod, something only he could open. He should have taken the extra precaution to begin with. She could probably curse him without tools as long as she had that mouth on her. But he had other uses for that mouth, so cutting out her tongue seemed extreme.</p><p>He returned a few minutes later with her bags of magical supplies, not sure what she\u2019d need to do what he asked. When he tossed them to her, she just stared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious. You really want me to do magic? After you\u2019ve spazzed out about it like you have?\u201d</p><p>The demon glared and tossed her the bag with the scroll in it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d She unzipped it and pulled out the parchment. When she saw what was on it, she dropped it like it was a bag of live snakes, hissing and waiting to strike.</p><p>She looked up, real fear in her eyes this time. It was a reaction he couldn\u2019t seem to inspire. Yeah, it wounded his evil pride a bit. What was so bad about this other guy that Cain couldn\u2019t match?</p><p>\u201cPlease, you have to kill me. If he\u2019s back to these games, he knows where the other one is. He may even know where I am. I know him.\u201d</p><p>Cain shook his head. \u201cHe can\u2019t know where you are. And even if he did, he can\u2019t get here. He has no access.\u201d</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t put on her clothes. Now that he knew, he could never forget how old she was. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her to be embarrassed, even after being rebuffed. She stood and moved toward him, determination in her eyes. Her arms went around his neck, her lips crashing against his mouth.</p> <p>This was new and intriguing. It was rare for a woman to be this aggressive with him without demon thrall involved. And he wasn\u2019t even in his super-pretty form. The fact that she knew what he was and was still throwing herself at him, even with a death wish, was almost too novel to cope with.</p><p>As offended as he was that she didn\u2019t seem scared of him, another part didn\u2019t want to kill her. It was hard to kill an equal you were growing to respect. If he succeeded and she begged him to keep her, would he? Of course not. She was a new flavor of candy. She\u2019d be stale within a week, just like the others.</p><p>Tam slid her hand down his pants while her mouth tangled with his. She pulled away, her eyes glittering with dark promise. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m so tired from all the magic I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m not fully recharged yet. It wouldn\u2019t take that much work to kill me.\u201d</p><p>At least one part of him was listening to her, standing at attention, ready to make good on the promise of death. But he pushed her away, his hands gripping her shoulders to keep her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cPut some clothes on.\u201d</p><p>She pouted. \u201cBut why? Is this much naked flesh upsetting you? Why should you deny yourself? I mean nothing to you. Forget your stupid plan. I won\u2019t ever beg you to keep me. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to shake the life out of her, but then he\u2019d be left with a much younger Tam in her place, a prospect that was less than appealing. \u201cLook at the parchment again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it!\u201d he growled. Even as he gripped her, he was shifting into his demon form. With every form but his true form shed, he gave off every negative emotion in existence. Tam shrank back from the force of it, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never successfully fed in this form, so it\u2019s pointless for you to taunt me\u2014not that you would. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to sleep with this.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze, getting her bravery back as she got used to the new energy around him. \u201cEh. I\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>He released her shoulders and took a step back. If she kept surprising him, he might make it his mission in life to keep her alive forever.</p><p>She glanced down and giggled. It wasn\u2019t the response a man was ever looking for, but when she spoke, he realized why.</p><p>\u201cYou must have seven hundred pairs of pants.\u201d</p><p>In the shift, he\u2019d ripped them. Again. Like some fledgling demon who didn\u2019t yet understand the size disparity between man and monster. She unnerved him too much to be concerned with wardrobe malfunctions.</p> <p>\u201cI need you to look at the bigger picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are going to get ugly with Anthony after this. He\u2019ll use this to push his control further\u2014in the name of safety. I\u2019ve seen humans do it a thousand times, and vampires are no different when it comes to this. I might need you in a war. You promised you\u2019d fight with me. If you do this spell, it might help us find The Cycler. If we destroy him, there\u2019s no reason for you to die.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. The moment of vulnerability took him aback, and he had to fight the urge to comfort her. Where in the hell had that urge come from?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. I\u2019m TIRED, Cain. I\u2019m so tired, I can\u2019t think straight. I can\u2019t stand this eternal cycle. It\u2019s so lonely. Every time I cycle, I have to hide and go somewhere different, uproot my whole life, meet new people. Everyone I meet, I know I\u2019m going to lose. I can\u2019t live like this anymore. I just want to be normal again. I just want to be happily oblivious to the truth. The only way out is Jack or you. Forgive me if I prefer your methods. I don\u2019t want him to win, you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t want me to win, either. I need out of this. I thought if I could get away from him, that I could do it. I thought if Anna became immortal I could do it, but it\u2019s not enough. I just want out.\u201d</p><p>Given her suicidal kick, if Cain managed to get her to beg him to keep her, to even want her life back, it would be a miracle. And then what was he going to do? Kill her anyway? He should. Even if she\u2019d be beneficial in a war, the temptation to get her out of her death wish and only then deliver it was the kind of temptation he was rarely successful at fighting. There was a reason he was who and what he was, after all.</p><p>He punched the cave wall, causing a mini-avalanche of little rocks in the space where he\u2019d cracked it. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same form for eight thousand years. You think I don\u2019t get how hard it is? But I don\u2019t get an exit ramp. Why should I give you one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. If you\u2019re not going to do something useful, just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Cain picked up the scroll and held it out to her. \u201cNo. I need you to do this spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat spell?\u201d she said, her voice rising in irritation.</p><p>\u201cLook at the scroll again.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, she took the parchment from his hands and unrolled it, looking down the list of names she\u2019d tried not to look at before. Blood. In the little hearts beside her name. A lump formed in her throat at the most recent name that had been crossed out. Naomi. Her sister. She still remembered standing beside her in the cavern, agreeing about not adding their own blood to the potion. It had been a smart gut instinct. Why hadn\u2019t she listened?</p><p>She\u2019d gripped Naomi\u2019s hand in the moonlight that had shone down, not realizing what they were about to do or the events they would set in motion, all over the na\u00efve belief that immortality in this place\u2014in this human form\u2014was a good thing.</p><p>Tears streamed down Tam\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t hold them back anymore. She\u2019d pushed her sister away so many times, trying to protect her from a brutal death at Jack\u2019s hands, but it had still happened anyway. All that time lost.</p><p>\u201cTam?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met Cain\u2019s. The fear and dread and hate and anger and all the scary emotions that swirled around his demon form had felt oppressive at first, but now she could get lost in them. She could pretend none of those feelings were her own. They were all the demon\u2019s fault. There was a look in his eyes that she wasn\u2019t sure how to classify. She didn\u2019t trust that it was true concern, but he was making an admirable fake.</p><p>\u201cThat last name he just killed? It was my sister. I know what you need me to do, but I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d Jack had used her sister\u2019s blood to make the little hearts around her name. Cain must have suspected the same thing.</p><p>Was Jack punishing her for leaving him? Would he have spared Naomi if she\u2019d stayed? But at what cost? Her soul? Blood was the most powerful magic activator there was, especially the blood of a magical being, and Tam and all the other cyclers definitely qualified.</p><p>She could use the blood, even dried, to scry into the past and see everything her sister had seen in her last moments. She could see the moments even right after her sister\u2019s death, because blood had its own life. What blood saw was sometimes more than what we saw.</p><p>\u201cI need you to do the spell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going to look at that. I can\u2019t look at it. It won\u2019t help. I can tell you what he did. He overpowered her and killed her and cut her open and took out organs and probably fucking ate one because isn\u2019t ingesting a part of your enemy the way to becoming a god? That\u2019s what he wants. He thinks he can be a god if he kills us all like this. If you think I\u2019m going to trance out and look into Jack\u2019s eyes while he kills my sister, you\u2019re insane. I won\u2019t do it, and you can\u2019t make me do it.\u201d</p><p>She shook with rage over the idea. Maybe she could see something helpful, something that could let her know if he had any accomplices, something that could give them a location, but if the price was living her sister\u2019s death vicariously and feeling all that pain and fear, she was just too selfish to go there.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Calm down,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>Before she knew what she was doing, she\u2019d moved into the demon\u2019s arms and laid her head against his chest. She didn\u2019t care that he was in the demon form. At least he didn\u2019t pretend he wasn\u2019t what he was. At least he wasn\u2019t ripping people up with knives. At least it was food, not sport or simply for power.</p><p>A moment later, his large hands stroked through her hair, his claws barely skimming her head. It was more comforting than it should have been. The scary feelings around him started to fade\u2014either that or she was becoming more acclimated. What was it with her and monsters? At least this time she didn\u2019t love one, and she knew going in what he was. But did that make any difference? She\u2019d still slept with him and was prepared to do it again and again, no matter how many times was necessary to get from him what she needed: her freedom.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he put hearts beside your name?\u201d Cain\u2019s voice rumbled over her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. You know why.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou were lovers. No wonder he\u2019s saving you for last. It\u2019s how I would do it.\u201d</p><p>Tam cringed at that, but if the demon noticed, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the meeting,\u201d he said after a few minutes of standing like that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Dayne can do the same magic, but I\u2019ll take the scroll and we\u2019ll find out. We might still be able to get what we need without your involvement.\u201d</p><p>He gathered the magical bags and placed his hand over a spot on the cave wall that jutted out in the shape of an egg. It opened and he tossed her things in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re going to be in my caves, I have to up the security on your supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019d go against you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you. You don\u2019t trust me. It\u2019s what we have in common.\u201d Even as he said it, Tam knew it wasn\u2019t all they had in common. Besides Jack and the other cycler that was about to be history, Cain was one of the very few beings in existence who could really understand.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Father Hadrian sat at the table, his expression blank of emotion. Anthony had started the meeting, and the demon leader was late again. Bringing Anthony down was the right thing to do. The vampire king\u2019s increasing control was worse than the sacrifice of the humans finding out. The humans had known hundreds of years ago, and the world had survived. It would survive again, and the vampires with it. Anthony had to be stopped, or Hadrian\u2019s race would end up slaves to their king.</p><p>\u201cFather Hadrian?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, not betraying his thoughts. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>An impatient expression painted the king\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did you get from the old woman Luc brought in? Anything?\u201d</p><p>Hadrian shook his head. \u201cShe remembered seeing a delivery man. It may have been The Cycler, but the details were too fuzzy. You know how fickle the memories of the elderly are. I erased her memory and sent her home.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie. She\u2019d seen Jack clearly. The rest, about erasing her memory and sending her home was true.</p><p>He would have had the old woman for dinner except she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. As a rule, he only fed from the guilty and then only killed the unrepentant. Everyone was repentant when their life was at stake, but Hadrian could see inside to their true feelings. He knew which ones to save and which to damn.</p><p>The vampire king nodded and went back to his presentation.</p><p>Hadrian had chatted with Cole while waiting for the meeting to start. The werewolf pack alpha was the key, the only person with a way into the demon dimension who wasn\u2019t an actual demon.</p><p>The rooftop door banged against the brick wall as Cain made his fashionably late entrance again. He carried a plastic storage bag with something that looked like old paper in it.</p><p>\u201cSo glad you could join us,\u201d Anthony said, \u201cI was just about to ask for Luc\u2019s report from your investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the witness?\u201d Cain asked.</p><p>\u201cFather Hadrian couldn\u2019t get a clear image of The Cycler\u2019s face, so he erased her memory and sent her home.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian held Cain\u2019s gaze steadily even though he felt the demon\u2019s suspicion. The guy was far too old to be tricked for long.</p><p>Cain broke eye contact first and put the scroll on the table, piercing the sorcerer with an intense look. \u201cDayne, can you do a spell on the memory of the blood?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t Tam do it? She\u2019s much stronger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt that\u2019s true, but...\u201d He faltered.</p><p>There was something in the demon\u2019s body language that sent Hadrian\u2019s flags up. Did Cain have some particular attachment to the witch? If so, it would make the plan more complicated.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Dayne prodded.</p> <p>\u201cShe refused for personal reasons. Can you do the spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrying isn\u2019t my strength. Seeing the past is far more difficult. The blood has dried and several hours have passed by now. It\u2019s a long shot, but I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d The demon passed the scroll across the table, right past Hadrian.</p><p>Dayne and Greta got up. Jack was slipping, taking too many risks. They were too close for that. If they were going to unseat Anthony from power, The Cycler had to be more careful.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go with them,\u201d Hadrian said, wanting to monitor the situation.</p> <p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d Anthony asked.</p><p>Cain\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Hadrian could practically see the wheels in his head turning.</p><p>\u201cFor muscle. They\u2019re carrying a sensitive document.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hadrian said, inclining his head.</p><p>He would happily die for the cause if necessary, but not until the time was right. If Dayne\u2019s spell succeeded, it would implicate Hadrian before he\u2019d reached his goal. He\u2019d been at Jack\u2019s hideout for the slaying. He\u2019d kept to the shadows, out of The Cycler\u2019s way, but if blood could have memories, he would be seen.</p> <p>The whirring of the overhead projector snapped Hadrian out of his thoughts. Anthony had a transparency up and was laying out a detailed plan\u2014for everyone\u2019s protection, supposedly. He\u2019d seen Anthony\u2019s interpretation of protection, and he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure many of you know, this has spread beyond just local media. A Jack the Ripper copycat is of interest to those not only in the UK, but around the world. He\u2019s become a cult icon of the unsolved mystery. He captures peoples\u2019 imaginations, so the whole world is watching. We don\u2019t know what kind of letter he\u2019ll send next, or when the next body will turn up, but this one has already caused an outright panic. Before the meeting, Dayne suggested Jack may have charmed the letter. If that\u2019s true, the lab techs analyzing it will know it\u2019s the Ripper and probably so will anyone else who touches it.\u201d</p><p>The pretty succubus sitting next to Cole spoke up. \u201cDo we have any idea when he might strike next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy theory is that he\u2019ll wait until the media is in a storm debating the meaning of the handwriting analysis. Any revelation he gives will serve him best at that time.\u201d Anthony cleared his throat and went back to the transparency.</p><p>If anything, Jack\u2019s plan seemed to be backfiring. Anthony had a full strategy to extend his control in Cary Town to the whole country and beyond. The only hope would be a war between the preternaturals and the humans. That carried risk. Anthony could end up completely destabilized or only stronger.</p><p>The vampire king continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone with vampire leaders all over the world, and in some cases their guardians due to time zone issues. Word has been sent out to therian leaders in this country\u2014those that are organized enough. I\u2019ll be meeting separately with the Preternatural Council since there is no way to keep them out of the loop any longer. For the safety of all and our way of life, we must raise security measures.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian took a measured breath. This reaction had been expected. It\u2019s only temporary. How long could Anthony\u2019s power stand in the face of worldwide chaos? If the priest knew vampires, he knew they\u2019d stop lockstepping when the first major panic set in. Once the word was out anyway, they\u2019d feed openly. They\u2019d resist the vampire king\u2019s control as well as if Hadrian had created an uprising from scratch. Only the results would be more predictable, the reaction stronger in the face of complete unrest.</p><p>Cain chuckled, interrupting the vampire king\u2019s monologue. \u201cYou\u2019re so predictable. Just like a human. Yes, let the sheep fall in line behind your bright, shiny police state. You must have such a hard-on over this. An opportunity falls right in your lap to justify what you\u2019ve wanted since you\u2019ve taken power.\u201d</p> <p>Hadrian arched a brow. If not for the demon\u2019s interest in Tam, he\u2019d have an ally.</p><p>Anthony stopped and glared at the demon. \u201cAnd what business or interest is it of yours? What do you care what I do here?\u201d</p><p>The demon shrugged. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t care what you do. I just find it all perversely interesting. Tell me, are they goose-stepping to your orders yet? Why don\u2019t we take a vote around the table? Who wants Anthony to rule the world? Raise your hands.\u201d</p><p>The assembled looked down at the table or their hands, whatever they could to avoid either Cain or Anthony\u2019s eyes. Hadrian was the only one who watched everyone. When Cain\u2019s gaze shifted to him, he looked at the table as well. Blend, Hadrian. For God\u2019s sake, blend. Now wasn\u2019t the time for discovery. But it was too late.</p><p>\u201cYour priest lapdog isn\u2019t on board,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI knew something felt off about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cHadrian has been nothing but helpful since I took control of the coven. We don\u2019t have time for you to sow discord for your own amusement.\u201d</p><p>The demon shrugged. \u201cI just call them like I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what you may think, this is for everyone\u2019s safety. The factions must band together. Our numbers aren\u2019t as great as the humans. If The Cycler succeeds, he could build a worldwide army. Let\u2019s not forget magic users are human. They may stick with their own if they\u2019re outed to the world. In a war, that kind of unified front against preternaturals poses a risk to you, too.\u201d</p><p>Anthony went back to the transparency. \u201cI\u2019ve called a summit for tomorrow evening with some of the top faction leaders and the local preternatural council to discuss how we can proceed and replicate what\u2019s been done in Cary Town. Cole, even though you\u2019ve been officially banished, we\u2019d like you there. This concerns the pack, too. You\u2019ll formally apologize, and I\u2019ll graciously pardon you.\u201d</p><p>The werewolf growled. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m here because of the danger The Cycler poses to our way of life. I\u2019m not on board with using it as a springboard to solidify your power base.\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes flashed red. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what this is about!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell it\u2019s not!\u201d Cole slammed a fist on the table and stood. \u201cCount me out of the rest of this charade. You all can deal with this mess on your own. Jane. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jane stood to follow her mate out, while the others at the table argued amongst themselves. Anthony was still yelling at Cole to try to bring him back to his side.</p><p>\u201cGuys...\u201d It was Anthony\u2019s human mate. Charlee had tried to stay out of most of it.</p><p>No one heard her.</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Everyone stopped. Anthony\u2019s blind ambition turned immediately to concern. In Hadrian\u2019s opinion, if they wanted to take Anthony down, all they needed to do was kidnap Charlee. But he\u2019d met Jack long before he\u2019d known about Charlee.</p><p>\u201cMy water just broke.\u201d</p><p>Jane rushed to her side and helped her get up from the table.</p><p>\u201cJane...\u201d Cole said, his tone warning.</p><p>The demon\u2019s eyes glowed dangerously red. \u201cNo. I\u2019m staying with my friend until she has her baby. I don\u2019t care what our issues with Anthony are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you alone with a bunch of vampires,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the meeting had turned from an initiation of Anthony\u2019s police state to a single-minded focus on bringing an abomination into the world. The vampire king kept his most trusted guards around his mate constantly. And no matter how much he tried, Hadrian was kept at arm\u2019s length where Charlee was concerned. He suspected Anthony was power-mad anyway, but his child was what drove him to diabolical greatness. Jack\u2019s plans drove the vampire king even harder.</p><p>Cain spoke up. \u201cWhile you all play nursemaid to the human mate, I\u2019m going to do something useful. Anthony, can we assume a war soon if we fail to find Jack in time?\u201d</p><p>Anthony had been leading Charlee toward the penthouse door to get her inside and comfortable. \u201cYes. And there is no guarantee we\u2019ll win. Especially as unorganized as we continue to be.\u201d</p><p>Their disorganization was a matter of opinion.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go talk to the angels and see if we can get more muscle behind us. The warrior class loves a good brawl. This could upset the balance enough to garner their involvement.\u201d</p><p>As the meeting dispersed into chaos, Hadrian slipped out to check on Dayne\u2019s progress with the blood.</p><p>Cain was irritated when he reached the lobby of Heaven. Of course Anthony would use this to benefit his personal agenda. The demon had seen it coming a mile away. Half-breeds were so unoriginal. How Cain had allowed himself to get dragged into all this, he\u2019d never know. With the demon abilities to be noncorporeal, use thrall, move things through telekinesis, shapeshift into nearly anything, and go invisible, they could operate as usual even if the world fell into total chaos and the magic users and humans overcame the preternaturals. They\u2019d just have to be more careful.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if the humans could follow him into his dimension. But he didn\u2019t trust witches and their ilk. If he\u2019d learned anything in his thousands of years of existence, it was that there was no end to the creativity that could be employed by a magic user to reach their ends. If the dimensional portals could sense a demon and let them pass through, was there any reason similar things couldn\u2019t be created in the human world that would identify demons for what they were and keep them out? They\u2019d suffer and starve in that case.</p><p>But if this thing went badly, the entire demon race could end up sealed in glass jars and lined up on shelves in some superwitch\u2019s basement. Their numbers weren\u2019t impressive, certainly not compared with human armies, magic users, or the other preternatural factions. Cain had no intention of ending up that way for all eternity.</p><p>The demon marched up to the reception desk. \u201cAre you aware of the war that may be brewing on earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... I\u2019m just the receptionist. I\u2019m not privy to...\u201d</p><p>He leaned over the counter, moving into her personal bubble. His voice came out low and deadly. \u201cThen go find somebody useful.\u201d</p><p>She shot out of her chair and scurried behind the gold gates. Several minutes later, an unfathomably beautiful male angel came out. It was one of the warrior angels. Created, not elevated. Cain wasn\u2019t particularly into men, maybe it was because food and sex were so intertwined for him, and he could only feed from human females. But he could appreciate the art of a perfect physical form, whatever gender it happened to be in. Thousands of years of existence made the idea of homophobia quaint.</p><p>The angel was tan, quite natural for a place with no darkness ever. He had long blond hair that seemed to radiate the light of Heaven itself, a strong jaw, and light blue eyes\u2014so light they seemed almost transparent.</p><p>He gave Cain a perfunctory once-over as if the demon were a shipment of something dreadfully boring. \u201cWho let the riffraff up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, nobody has to let me into the lobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should change that rule.\u201d</p><p>Cain rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you aware of the war that may break out on earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one? There are always wars. Humans live to torture and kill each other. Surely you know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know which war. The one that would include humans and magic users against preternaturals.\u201d</p><p>The angel shrugged. \u201cThere have been rumblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to get involved if it became necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so. The man upstairs wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Cain wondered if the Hebrew god actually resided in a tower at the top of some stairs. Nobody who knew the score referred to him as \u201cGod\u201d or \u201cHis imperial Majesty\u201d or anything else that seemed like a true sign of respect. It was always \u201cthe man upstairs.\u201d It had been so for as long as he could remember. As far as he knew, the Hebrew god wasn\u2019t crying himself to sleep over it\u2014assuming gods slept.</p><p>\u201cThis could upset the balance that\u2019s been created. It would be utter chaos.\u201d</p><p>The angel laughed. \u201cWe don\u2019t care. They destroy their world, and we\u2019ll find somewhere else to place them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the other gods will allow that? The man upstairs only has control of the one dimension and Heaven. I\u2019m not even allowed to feed in the other dimensions, even though I can get there. The man upstairs has burned his bridges quite well. Is he prepared to apologize for driving the other gods off? Will he make a peace offering so we have other places to go?\u201d Cain knew the angel had an opinion about it, but he\u2019d never get it out of him. \u201cWhat will you have to do if the world goes up in flames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. It won\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no idea how it would be. Humans are fueled almost entirely by fear. They have enough technology now to destroy the world a hundred times over. Add magic users and preternaturals to that mix, and there\u2019s no way to know what the state of the world will be, or if it will be in any state at all by the time it\u2019s over. Does the man upstairs want to create a whole other planet and erase everyone\u2019s memories? That seems like a lot of work to me. Since he doesn\u2019t ever want to lift a finger for anything else...\u201d</p><p>The angel\u2019s eyes glowed bright blue\u2014sending a gust of cold air at Cain. \u201cWatch your tongue, demon. He\u2019s still your sovereign.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cain laughed. \u201cHe gave up that right a long time ago. What can he do to me that he hasn\u2019t already done? Hasn\u2019t he made me a god as well? I may as well be the god of the earth, too, since I\u2019m the only one who ever goes there, and I\u2019m the only one who seems to give a shit about what happens to it. He\u2019s like a child who has built a city of blocks and gotten bored and walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Now. I can have your access to this area revoked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. If you change your mind and are in the mood for a fight, I\u2019ll welcome you and yours into my dimension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we act, there will be consequences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere always are. But sometimes it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Cain left the angel in the lobby. If they needed the warrior class, he\u2019d come around. The demon was sure of it. He winked at the reception angel on his way out, and a blush crept up her neck.</p><p>Hadrian found an unlocked window and crawled into Dayne\u2019s cottage. The wards he had weren\u2019t up to snuff to keep a vampire away. Instead, it had drawn him like a beacon. It was only the fact that vamps preferred the city to the forest that kept the sorcerer and his little kitty therian safe.</p><p>An orange cat sat on the kitchen counter, green eyes intense, hissing at him, but there was no magic coming off it. Just an average house cat. Hadrian put a finger to his lips. \u201cShhhh,\u201d he said. The cat glared but let him pass.</p><p>He crept down spiral stone stairs that got danker and darker as he went down. When he reached the bottom, he crouched by the door, looking through slats in the weathered wood. There was no need to get involved if Dayne couldn\u2019t do the spell, but from the looks of things, he was doing it.</p><p>The sorcerer\u2019s circle was set up, books and tools were out. The cute brunette with the short, choppy haircut stood to the side out of his way. It was anybody\u2019s guess how long Dayne had been chanting, but his energy looked depleted. Good for Hadrian.</p> <p>As the sorcerer continued to chant, a light emanated from the scroll, lighting up the room like a giant projector onto which images and dialogue appeared\u2014like a movie composed of magic. Greta gasped. Dayne opened his eyes to see the spell had worked and what had instigated the gasp.</p><p>Hadrian. Fully implicated, right there on the magic screen with Jack. It was now or never. The vampire ripped the door open and blurred in, grabbing Greta and holding her in front of him as if he were a bank robber. He didn\u2019t have a gun at her throat, but his fangs were out and ready should he need to call them into action.</p><p>Dayne appeared disoriented as the spell collapsed around him, but he didn\u2019t harbor any doubts about what he\u2019d seen. \u201cWhy have you betrayed us?\u201d</p><p>The vampire remained stoic. \u201cAnthony is the betrayer. He\u2019s clamping down on all of us. It won\u2019t be just Cary Town. It\u2019ll be this whole planet by the time he\u2019s finished. I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s world will be worse.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian shrugged. \u201cAnd we will deal with Jack. I don\u2019t want The Cycler in power either, but he has no organization. The vampires have been increasing in organization for centuries now. Our numbers are strong. Our leader is about to take away all of our freedoms for his own personal reasons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnthony has to protect his daughter,\u201d the sorcerer said. \u201cAnd now with the threat from Jack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two issues are simply convenient. You might not see it, but what I\u2019m doing is better for us all.\u201d</p><p>Dayne\u2019s face betrayed his fear for Greta, though he was trying to downplay it. For her part she\u2019d been extremely brave. Not a lot of tears or screaming or thrashing about, just still and quiet as if he might forget she was there and loosen his grip. Unlikely. But nice try. He was surprised she wasn\u2019t fighting him. Therians were stronger than humans.</p><p>\u201cJust let Greta go.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian gripped her tighter. \u201cI\u2019d erase both of your memories, but I don\u2019t have that ability with a therian. I want you to make a potion that will do that job for me. I\u2019ll check the spell and ingredients to make sure we understand each other. I hate misunderstandings.\u201d He flashed fangs at Dayne, as if he even needed to put a point on the threat.</p><p>The sorcerer was so depleted from doing such heavy magic alone that he couldn\u2019t even conjure an energy ball or a fireball, whichever his speed was. Even if he had that ability right now, he wouldn\u2019t use it. The werecat made a great shield.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, Dayne. If we\u2019re both dead, we can\u2019t warn Anthony, anyway,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe cat makes an excellent point.\u201d</p> <p>The sorcerer turned to collect the supplies he needed, and Greta shifted. In the change from human size to house-cat size, Hadrian lost his grip on her. She climbed over her pile of clothes and scurried toward the door. He went after her, but a fireball whizzed past his head. It hit the stone wall, fizzling with a hiss and puff of smoke. It had come from Dayne, but it was small and weak and probably the only one he had left.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to waste your magic right now,\u201d Hadrian said, scooping up the cat before she could get out the door. She dug her claws into his arms, hissing and biting. He growled and tossed her across the room. She let out a horrible feline shriek and hit the wall, then stopped moving.</p><p>He felt a flicker of guilt for harming her. She was an innocent, not someone meant for his special brand of punishment, but she was also caught in the crossfire of a greater good.</p><p>\u201cGreta!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. Make the potion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough energy left. I need to take a rest.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian shook his head. \u201cYou only need to make enough potion for one. I have to wipe your memory while you\u2019re weak, not after you\u2019ve had a refreshing nap to replenish your shields.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the unconscious black cat and sat on the floor with her in his lap. \u201cI could kill her quickly in this form. Don\u2019t test me. Two people failing to show up at Anthony\u2019s next meeting would be a minor curiosity in the face of everything going on. Maybe your magic drew Jack, and he killed you. Who\u2019s to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used strong protections. It\u2019s why I\u2019m so depleted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought of everything.\u201d</p><p>Dayne glared while Hadrian stroked Greta\u2019s back as if she were a normal house cat. Hadrian did it to unnerve him, but the act also allowed him to be assured she was okay. Her breathing seemed normal.</p><p>Twenty minutes later the potion was ready, a rolling, bubbling concoction of something dark purple the vampire wouldn\u2019t want to drink on his worst day.</p><p>\u201cLet me see the book.\u201d</p><p>Dayne brought it over, and Hadrian looked at the spell. It was a spell to take the memory of an hour. The listed ingredients looked about right as far as he could tell sitting across the room. Everything had been in cloudy jars after all\u2014it was like some mad scientist\u2019s basement. The vampire nodded and passed the book to the sorcerer who put it back on the table and chanted the spell over the potion. It was in Latin. Magic users and their dead languages. Hadrian was convinced it was for show to appear more mysterious. Wasn\u2019t that why the priests had used it for so long?</p><p>When Dayne brought the potion over, Hadrian took the goblet and held the cat\u2019s mouth open to pour it down her throat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be asleep for awhile. When she wakes, she won\u2019t remember,\u201d Dayne said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d better not. I\u2019ll stay to be sure. I\u2019ll be putting you to sleep as well. I\u2019ll make sure she wakes before you. If she remembers anything...\u201d It was unnecessary to expand on the threat. He laid the cat on the stone floor and moved toward Dayne. At least with all the magic the sorcerer had done, taking control of his mind would be easy. It was one memory he\u2019d know for sure had been properly erased.</p><p>\u201cLook into my eyes.\u201d He placed a hand on Dayne\u2019s shoulder to boost the effects of the thrall.</p><p>The sorcerer obeyed, his eyes becoming unfocused as he tried to maintain eye contact with the vampire.</p><p>\u201cGood. You came home and attempted to do the spell, but it failed. Some of the magic knocked Greta out, but she\u2019s fine now. You burned the scroll so the magical residue couldn\u2019t attract The Cycler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, sleep for a little while. When you and Greta wake, everything will seem normal.\u201d Hadrian caught the man as he fell and laid him next to the cat. Then he searched until he found matches and burned the scroll, so what had been seen couldn\u2019t be seen again.</p><p>He sat on the table and waited. As the potion took effect, the werecat shifted back to human. The vampire admired her sleeping form. He\u2019d love to taste her. A great time to accomplish that feat was while she was unconscious, but he couldn\u2019t justify the act. While he couldn\u2019t get inside her head, it only took one look at her to know she was kind and decent\u2014not someone who needed to be absolved, and not someone who needed to be punished.</p><p>After a while, Greta stretched and sat up, wary eyes darting around the room. She looked to Hadrian, then to Dayne, and her own nudity, which she intriguingly sought to cover.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What have you done?\u201d Her eyes held suspicion and more than a little fear. She scrambled to her clothing and rushed to get dressed.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear from me. What do you remember?\u201d Hadrian asked. He was more than a little curious over her modesty. It wasn\u2019t a common trait in therians.</p><p>\u201cYou could have at least had the decency to turn around,\u201d she said, as she pulled the top over her head.</p><p>The vampire had taken in every curve as she\u2019d moved, not missing a second of her in her unclothed form. \u201cI apologize. It was rude. I was caught off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong with Dayne?\u201d She moved behind him as if a sleeping sorcerer would have any effect on her safety.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Hadrian said, his eyes glowing, \u201cwhat do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d She appeared genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cDayne attempted to do a spell to help find The Cycler. The magic failed. I came by to check on things while he was still chanting. You saw me and got spooked and shifted, then sparks from the magic hit you and knocked you out. You must have mild amnesia. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She still looked suspicious but she was just disoriented and confused enough to buy it. \u201cW-what about Dayne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic knocked him out, too. He\u2019ll come around soon. I need to get back. You\u2019ll be okay here?\u201d</p><p>Greta nodded. \u201cYes. I mean, I think so. He\u2019ll wake up soon?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. Have a good night, Greta.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a reply.</p><p>The orange tabby glared at him at the top of the stairs as he brushed past her. He growled, and the cat shot off into the dark to check on her people, not trusting the vampire for a moment. Smart kitty.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Tam had been in the demon dimension for over a week without contact with the outside world. Her coven must be losing their shit wondering where she was. They didn\u2019t know what she was. No one had except her fellow cyclers and a few vampires over the centuries. And Henry.</p><p>She stood outside Cain\u2019s tent draped in one of the dresses from the trunk in her own tent. Two guards stood outside. One arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cShut up before I hex you.\u201d She and the demon leader had been carrying on what amounted to a full-on affair for the past week, but she hadn\u2019t been coming to his tent, and she certainly hadn\u2019t been dressing like his concubine. But she was ready to raise the stakes. The demon would crack soon, she could feel it.</p><p>The guard growled, but Tam was unfazed. Demons liked to talk and play at being scary, but even with her books and tools sealed up in the cave, she could still incant, and she still had energy balls to throw. She hadn\u2019t been left helpless. Far from it. It was hard to be too helpless with so much age on her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go in there,\u201d the other guard said. \u201cThe boss is having it out with one of the demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then he\u2019ll be in a killing mood.\u201d</p><p>Cain had been tense ever since the human body had been discovered. Every time he went through the human dimension he found out more news on the situation, mainly the constant recounting of the gory way the body had been found. So nothing useful. Just the kind of stuff that inspired morbid fascination and curiosity among her fellow humans.</p><p>Tam strode into the tent. Cain stopped yelling at the demon in front of him. It was one Tam didn\u2019t know. For a preternatural faction, the demon numbers weren\u2019t huge, but there were enough of them that the witch stumbled upon a new one on occasion.</p><p>Cain glared at her, but when he saw what she was wearing, something in his expression changed. Heat. Desire. That plus all the bottled rage from whatever the demon was in a snit about equaled a possible ticket out of all this.</p><p>He turned back to the other demon. \u201cLeave. We will discuss this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not my fault. This past week you\u2019ve been impossible to please. We\u2019ve all been walking on eggshells\u2014\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get another word out because Tam was tired of his whining. She hit the minion with an energy ball. He rounded on her, snarling.</p><p>\u201cI believe he told you to leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSee, Cain? This is the problem. This fucking witch who\u2019s got you all turned around.\u201d He rushed Tam at full speed before she could produce another energy ball, but before he could touch her, Cain had grabbed him and flung him away from her. He towered over the demon on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThe witch is my business. You try to harm her, and I\u2019ll let her seal you in a glass jar. It\u2019s far more cramped than the caves, I assure you. Scram!\u201d The demon pulled himself through the flap of the tent and hobbled away.</p><p>Cain advanced on her, fire in his eyes. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She batted her eyelashes. \u201cWhat the fuck was what?\u201d Okay, so the innocent damsel routine didn\u2019t come off quite as credible when she was dropping F-bombs. Still. She should get points for effort.</p><p>\u201cInterfering with my business with the other demons makes it look like I have a woman fighting my battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You\u2019re an even bigger Neanderthal than Anna\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eight thousand. Things are done how they are done.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, I\u2019m two thousand, and I managed to evolve. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d She changed tactics and pressed herself against him. If all she did was piss him off, he might just snap her neck, and that would do her no good. She needed to remind him why he liked her in an adult form. \u201cDo you like my dress?\u201d</p><p>He gripped her wrist and placed her hand over his erection. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI think you\u2019ll kill me this time. I don\u2019t get why you haven\u2019t. Maybe you have sparkly romance dreams? If you do, you can tell me, it\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d She never got tired of taunting him. Soon he would snap. She\u2019d alternated between pissing him off and seducing him every opportunity she got. She\u2019d be out of here before the next full moon, before the next body hit the ground, and Jack\u2019s game would be over.</p><p>The Cycler would still have enough power to start gathering an army to move forward with his plan, but this time she wouldn\u2019t help him. Her conscience would be clear, and she\u2019d escape his grip forever. She had no intention of leaving Heaven until things were put right. Her gods were in another dimension. She\u2019d been faithful to them. She\u2019d petition them to let her into the proper world for her next incarnation. Then she\u2019d be off Jack\u2019s radar forever. Truly free.</p><p>When Cain released her, she didn\u2019t waste the opportunity to unbutton his jeans and slide her hand inside.</p> <p>He growled. \u201cI won\u2019t lose control. I\u2019m not letting you out of my world. I told you, you\u2019ll be my toy until I get bored with you, or until you beg me to keep you\u2014and mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s bullshit. I think you like me. You don\u2019t want to kill me. Just admit it. Don\u2019t you normally get bored by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the caves.\u201d</p><p>It was as good as an admission from him.</p><p>\u201cWe never do it in your tent. Are you ashamed of me? Afraid we\u2019ll get interrupted?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d allowed her to continue stroking him, but he hadn\u2019t fallen completely under her spell yet. \u201cI\u2019d be greatly amused if we got interrupted. What about you? Does your little friend know you\u2019re screwing the demon who tried to kill her and would have succeeded if she hadn\u2019t given her soul to my brother?\u201d</p> <p>Tam pulled away. \u201cAnna wouldn\u2019t understand this. I know I shouldn\u2019t act like she\u2019s a child. She\u2019s got all her memories from her other lives, but it\u2019s not the same. They\u2019re isolated episodes of experience. It\u2019s different being in one body for as long as you and I have.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you saying I complete you?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes upward. \u201cHardly. I\u2019m saying she doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for me. She thinks she does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The demon pointed at the door. \u201cCaves. Now. I\u2019ll be along shortly.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cAnd to answer your other question\u201d\u2014his words stopped her\u2014\u201cthe reason for the caves is that tents are completely useless if I want to fuck you against a wall.\u201d</p><p>Her back was to him so he didn\u2019t see her facial expression. Given that edge, she wasn\u2019t about to turn around or pause, but she knew he had to sense the wave of desire his words had caused. Or maybe he\u2019d done it with demon thrall. Her shields had weakened in the time she\u2019d been with him. It was too exhausting being on guard twenty-four-seven, and if she wanted him to break the cycle, shields were pointless. Shields were to protect her, and she didn\u2019t want to be protected from him.</p><p>Cain watched her go. He\u2019d let her stew in the caves waiting for him like a schoolgirl. She was right, he should be bored with her by now. He didn\u2019t want to dig too deeply into his motivations. But he most certainly didn\u2019t like her. She was confusing him with someone who still could dig up those sorts of feelings. Killing her was the prudent choice. It was what she wanted, and it would make it easier to kill The Cycler if he didn\u2019t have her power absorbed into him, too.</p> <p>But a woman had never beaten him at his own game, and it wasn\u2019t going to happen now. If she didn\u2019t want to die, she\u2019d be easier to kill, but he still resented giving her the opportunity to escape the immortal bed she\u2019d made.</p><p>When he reached the cave, she was sitting on the ground. She probably couldn\u2019t see him, but with his acute night vision, he could see her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in the dark? We have torches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have energy balls, not fire, and all my tools are locked in a pod. You do the math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there is some chant you could use. How hard can it be for a witch of your caliber to produce fire?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t waste energy on things like that.\u201d</p><p>Cain lit the torches and sat beside her on the big rock. He began to stroke her back and pushed aside one of her straps to kiss her shoulder. She did look lovely in that dress, as if she could rule beside him. He cringed at that thought.</p><p>A suspicion eased into his mind, and he gripped her throat, his voice low and deadly. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done any magic against me, you will live to wish you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She struggled for air, and he loosened his grip a fraction to allow her to speak.</p><p>\u201cIf you kill me, and I revert to a younger body, I will seal you in a jar so fucking fast your head will spin. Don\u2019t threaten me. If you plan to take me out, take me out the right way so I can leave this forsaken place.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say what kind of magic he thought she\u2019d done. Accusing her was as good as admitting she was having unforeseen effects on him. She\u2019d take it as him admitting he liked her, then he\u2019d have to kill her just to shut her up. If he was wrong about her using magic against him to soften him up, then he wasn\u2019t giving her that weapon\u2014not when he\u2019d already said how things would go between them.</p><p>\u201cI could lock you in one of these pods. You\u2019re immortal, sort of, you\u2019d survive it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why he added that. What did he care what she could survive? \u201cI could leave you in there until the Jack problem is solved.\u201d He let go of her and stood, her nearness starting to unhinge him.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have put that much space between them, because she hauled back and tossed an energy ball at him, clipping him in the shoulder before he could go noncorporeal. She was so fast with those things. Two could play this game. He tossed a fireball, and she ducked behind the rock they\u2019d been sitting on.</p><p>Then she started chanting.</p><p>\u201cTam, stop chanting. You start using magic against me, and all bets are off. You have no idea the hell I can make your life.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, continuing her incantation. The air charged around them, and she stepped out from behind the rock that had been shielding her and threw a ball of energy at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever threaten me like that again. I\u2019m not one of your goons. If you even look like you\u2019re contemplating putting me in one of those pods for any reason, you will be sorry. I promise you. Like you said, the accommodations in little glass jars are less roomy than pods.\u201d</p><p>She threw another energy ball. This one he saw coming and dodged. He tossed another ball of fire, but it sizzled and bounced off an invisible bubble she\u2019d put around herself. He was so caught off guard by the new protection that he didn\u2019t get away in time when it came hurtling back toward him, burning him in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cOww... Goddamnit, Tam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re throwing fire. What I\u2019m throwing won\u2019t kill you. You want to burn me alive and send me back to a lesser form. I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cThat\u2019s not my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr am I too much of a temptation for you? Do I have too much power in this form?\u201d</p><p>She dropped the straps of the dress and the material fluttered to the ground. God yes, she had too much power in this form, but he\u2019d never say it. He stalked her and reached out to stroke her skin, glowing in the torchlight. His hand bounced off the barrier.</p><p>Cain\u2019s voice dropped an octave. \u201cHow can I help you if you won\u2019t help me? I thought you wanted me to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt seems pointless, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, what are the odds you\u2019re going to kill me this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta play to win, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she dropped the shields, he backed her against the wall and ripped his pants off. \u201cBe a good girl and wrap your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl? You must have me confused with somebody else.\u201d</p><p>But she did as he requested, and he lifted her like she was nothing. As he impaled her, she let out a gasp that drew a satisfied laugh from him.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to die and leave all this? That\u2019s a solid death wish you\u2019ve got there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d she tossed back.</p><p>But she\u2019d dropped her shields, all of them, and he knew the effect he was having on her. She wanted him almost as much as she wanted death. If he just held out a little longer, she\u2019d beg him to keep her, he was sure of it.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Tam tried to catch her breath. He\u2019d weakened her when he\u2019d fed, but he hadn\u2019t killed her. That would be too much to hope for. He seemed committed to this battle of wills. But she would win. If he thought she\u2019d ever willingly ask another monster to keep her, he didn\u2019t know her. And that was the point. He didn\u2019t know her. Though he knew Jack had been her lover, the realization that she wouldn\u2019t fall for that charming evil shit again hadn\u2019t penetrated his massive Neanderthal ego.</p><p>Cain wasn\u2019t a big cuddler. After he\u2019d finished with her, he\u2019d left her in the cave. Another woman might have been emotionally devastated or felt horribly used, but Tam was just annoyed he was holding out. She could attempt to use magic to get what she wanted, but there was a part of her that did genuinely fear him. The only kind of magic she\u2019d feel safe using against the demon was the kind that sealed him somewhere far away from her. And with her life span, even that wasn\u2019t a safe bet. Curses could be broken.</p><p>She pulled the dress on and made her way back into town. A few demons held her gaze then looked away quickly to whisper amongst themselves. She didn\u2019t have to hear them to have some idea of what they were saying. It was such cruel irony. Every single one of them wanted her dead because they felt she was compromising Cain and their kind. If only that were the case.</p><p>Many of them were probably old enough and strong enough to kill her, but even if she could get an accurate list of all their ages and strength levels, not one of them would double-cross Cain and get sent to the caves. He\u2019d been pretty intense about his threat.</p><p>His disdain for vampires ran deep. He wanted to use her in a future war with Anthony if it came to that. She had enough contacts that with her, her current coven, and the other magic users she knew, Anthony\u2019s victory wasn\u2019t a sure thing. In fact, between all of them, Cain\u2019s demons, and the Cary Town wolf pack, it would be a slaughter, no matter how many vampires the king recruited to fight his battles.</p><p>She was kidding herself if she thought Cain would put a petty vendetta against her above his personal ambitions. He had more self-control than she\u2019d anticipated. He was a complicated demon, and getting him to kill her involved more issues than she\u2019d wanted to admit. Plus he couldn\u2019t stand to lose ever, for any reason. But really, were they any different? They were both ruthless in their own ways. She should have known she wouldn\u2019t get him to snap and kill her. Damnit.</p><p>She was lost in her own world and didn\u2019t notice when Anna crossed her path.</p><p>\u201cTam?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been avoiding Anna because she was afraid if they spent too much time together, her friend would learn about her suicide mission. Plus, things felt distant now. Anna was so wrapped up in her new mate that things weren\u2019t the same anymore, no matter how much they\u2019d tried to force it or fake the easy way that had once been between them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tam said, trying not to look guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been? I hardly ever see you.\u201d</p><p>The witch shrugged. \u201cI wander a lot. I\u2019m pretty bored being stuck here.\u201d That much was true. Though she suspected a big part of the boredom was depression. Why else would she have such a death wish? Even if Jack could be caught and destroyed, and the threat from her life erased, she\u2019d hit her breaking point this time. The idea of sticking around sounded awful. She couldn\u2019t stand admitting that the brightest spots of the past week had been in Cain\u2019s arms. What did that say about her?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow herself to fall down that well again. He was just like Jack. He\u2019d turn on her and everyone she loved. There were no true consequences for him outside the inconvenience of a curse here and there. No one to answer to. No laws that bound him or his power. In a way, he was worse than Jack.</p><p>Anna stared at the dress. \u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d She asked the question as if she already knew but wanted to torture out a confession.</p><p>\u201cNot out here in the middle of the street,\u201d Tam hissed.</p><p>They were still surrounded by too many demons, and she didn\u2019t exactly want to have this conversation with an audience. She tried to grab Anna by the elbow to steer her toward her tent but her hand went through.</p><p>\u201cDamnit. I keep forgetting about this ghost-form thing. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not really a ghost, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I guess I thought since I gave Luc my soul and died, that I wasn\u2019t real or something. Now what about the dress?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You couldn\u2019t sidetrack Anna.</p><p>Tam glanced around. She wasn\u2019t sure if the demons edged nearer in fascination over the conversation in general or due to the upcoming big reveal over why she looked like she\u2019d joined a harem. Now that she thought about it, Cain probably had a harem. She had no delusions he was only sleeping with her, nor did she care. All she wanted was to wear him down to make him give her what she wanted\u2014a free ticket out without unnecessary horror or trauma. She\u2019d do anything he wanted to get that, though she wouldn\u2019t come right out and say it. It was smart to keep a few cards close to the chest. She was sure Cain could get extremely creative if he knew she\u2019d do anything.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk in my tent where the peanut gallery can\u2019t eavesdrop.\u201d She had half a mind to take Anna to the caves, but it could get her friend in trouble with Cain. He might see it as undermining his authority with the demons\u2014inviting them back to the punishment caves like it was an open house with tea and crumpets.</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem. I didn\u2019t mean to put you on the spot out here.\u201d</p> <p>The guards each arched a brow when they got to Tam\u2019s tent. She hadn\u2019t given them a backward glance when she\u2019d left. They\u2019d probably been waiting hours for her return so they could sneer and smirk at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? Twelve?\u201d she asked. \u201cGrow up.\u201d In point of fact, she probably was much older than her demon guards.</p><p>She motioned her friend into the tent. Once inside, Anna crossed her arms over her chest, her suspicion growing, waiting to explode like fireworks. They weren\u2019t going to be able to escape the elephant. \u201cIn the entire time I\u2019ve known you, I\u2019ve never seen you in a dress. Especially not one like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only known me a couple of decades. I used to wear dresses all the time. It used to be the only fashion option for women before they got all liberated. I just went for a change of pace this cycle. It\u2019s no big deal. Besides, I don\u2019t exactly have a washing machine here, do I? I\u2019m not allowed to leave the dimension. Do you think I\u2019m going to go scrub my clothes on a rock in the stream?\u201d</p><p>Tam wouldn\u2019t be out of clean clothes for another week or so, but it might come to that. She shuddered at the idea. Nothing sounded less appealing than her boobs falling out of one of these dresses as she bent over a rock in the stream while angry demons loitered, making snide remarks. If that happened, Cain couldn\u2019t hold her responsible for what she might do to them.</p> <p>Anna didn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He tried to kill you. What kind of friend do you think I am?\u201d It was a fantastic question, actually.</p><p>\u201cThat was going to be my next point. Just don\u2019t lie to me again.\u201d</p><p>Tam became fascinated with the embroidery on a pillow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I could have told you about the cycling thing, but I was so used to keeping my secret. The last person I told was Henry, and that was a few centuries ago. And it was less telling him than explaining to him what he\u2019d just seen when a woman he\u2019d befriended died and came back to life younger.\u201d</p><p>Technically that priest vampire a few decades ago and his insane sire fell into that category as well, but it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d had a sit-down about it or anything. Certainly not the kind of heart-to-heart she\u2019d had with Henry, or the kind Anna was hurt she hadn\u2019t gotten.</p><p>Anna reached out to put a hand on Tam\u2019s shoulder. When it passed through, she cursed. \u201cJust tell me the truth. I won\u2019t judge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! How could you sleep with him? He\u2019s a demon, a monster\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job not judging,\u201d Tam said, though it was hard to get mad at Anna\u2019s theatrics. She was used to them by now, and they could be somewhat entertaining. Even with her memories of her previous lives, she\u2019d remained Anna, clinging to her most recent incarnation as who she was.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you to reassure me I was wrong. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d sleep with Cain. Holy God. Of all the monsters to go to bed with.\u201d</p><p>Now Tam was mad. Anna had slept with Luc. Wasn\u2019t he a monster? Hadn\u2019t he killed humans on a routine basis for centuries before he\u2019d hooked up with her? Was he not a demon as well? The hypocrisy was so grating, it pushed Tam to drop another bomb.</p><p>\u201cI also slept with Jack.\u201d</p><p>Pin-drop silence. Maybe someone had sat on a remote control and hit the mute button, but finally Anna spoke, destroying that theory.</p><p>\u201cAs in... the Ripper? As in, the guy we\u2019re trying to find to kill right now? Mr. All-powerful Crazy Magic Man who is killing everybody in the original coven, with you on the hit list? The guy who wants to expose us all and bring destruction upon the whole planet? That Jack?\u201d</p> <p>Tam shrugged. \u201cHe was our leader, and he wasn\u2019t always like this. We had a really long relationship before he turned so dark I couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore. And if I hadn\u2019t slept with Jack, you and I never would have met. Do you think he would have saved me for last if he and I hadn\u2019t been lovers for so long?\u201d</p><p>She was dropping a lot of revelations on Anna, things her friend couldn\u2019t be expected to jump on board with. Especially the Cain thing. Sleeping with him was a betrayal of their friendship after what he\u2019d done to Anna, but it wasn\u2019t like Tam was doing it because she was into him. But explaining that would only make the situation worse.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep with Cain. He\u2019s dangerous. He\u2019s not like Luc. Do you have him under a spell or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should. For your own safety.\u201d</p><p>Tam didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her how badly such a spell would backfire and move her further from her goal.</p><p>\u201cConsidering how using magic ended for you, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. You want me to end up mated to him?\u201d</p><p>Anna made a face. \u201cOf course not. He hasn\u2019t even put a mark of protection on you. If he\u2019s supposed to be protecting you, why hasn\u2019t he done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work against Jack, and the demons are afraid to defy him. Nobody thinks killing me is worth an indeterminate amount of time locked in the caves. Trust me. It\u2019s hard to hate somebody that much.\u201d</p><p>Anna didn\u2019t seem to know about the caves, if the look of confusion on her face was any indication. Luc probably hadn\u2019t thought to mention them yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re sleeping with him, and I don\u2019t even want to think about it. It\u2019s icky. But you have to stop. He\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Tam snorted. \u201cNot at the rate he\u2019s going, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just forget it.\u201d</p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou want him to kill you. Why? We\u2019ll find Jack. You\u2019re safe here. You don\u2019t have to sacrifice yourself. God, Tam. Nobody likes a martyr.\u201d</p><p>Tam dropped onto the couch, feeling suddenly drained. \u201cTry to imagine dying\u2014but not really dying\u2014and being a kid again. Try to imagine having your mental and emotional sexual development all set, but having to be celibate for several years until you can find someone to scratch your itches again\u2014until you look like an adult again. Try to imagine having to move every time it happens, or if your friends start aging but you aren\u2019t aging fast enough. Sure, I\u2019ve had witch friends, but I\u2019ve had to keep them all at arm\u2019s length to keep my secret, and eventually I have to leave them as well because even they would figure out something about me was different. You were the first regular person I\u2019d let into my life for a long time. And it was only because I knew Henry was getting older and I\u2019d be alone again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it\u2019s not like that now,\u201d Anna said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got immortal friends. You don\u2019t have to keep losing everybody... and I mean, sure the celibacy thing is a little annoying, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me. I\u2019m tired of this. I don\u2019t want to live this way any longer. It\u2019s unnatural. It makes me feel out of sync with everyone and everything. With the other cyclers mostly gone, I\u2019m a freak. I don\u2019t want to be a freak anymore, Anna. I want to have a tribe of others like me, however I might be. Can\u2019t you understand that? I\u2019ll reincarnate. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll keep some memories. We\u2019ll find each other.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to mention the other dimension thing.</p><p>\u201cI need some air. I\u2019ll get Luc to come by and grab your clothes. We\u2019ll take them to your house and wash them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Tam said, but the word came out forced. A couple of years ago, Anna wouldn\u2019t have given up on her so easily. Things were so different between them it made her heart hurt. Anna was with Luc and a part of this new demon world now, not Tam\u2019s anymore. She was really alone now.</p><p>Cain tromped through the streets of Cary Town. It had taken a lot of threatening to get one of Anthony\u2019s guardians to tell him where Dayne Wickham\u2019s cottage was. He\u2019d never gone to a magic user for anything, he didn\u2019t trust them, but it was beginning to feel more dangerous to sleep with Tam without giving into her death wish.</p><p>Even with her books locked away, she could still create a chant to curse him. Hell, she may already have. He thought about her far too much. He\u2019d been sure she\u2019d be out of his system in a week\u2014like the flu. By that time, he\u2019d come to his senses and not try to hold on. Just because she was two thousand and understood what it was to be in the same form for so long didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d make her his mate. He\u2019d never take a mate.</p><p>Was he keeping her on reserve for if he became bored enough to settle down in another thousand years? Wasn\u2019t he the one who\u2019d ensured all books referencing demon mating in his dimension had been destroyed? Hadn\u2019t he discouraged his demons from enslaving themselves like that? Caring about anybody but yourself was a curse. It made you weak, vulnerable. It made you do stupid things to destroy your life.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to kill Anna to save Luc from such a fate, but she\u2019d gone through with the mating ritual at the last minute because she couldn\u2019t bear to be separated from him. Now Cain had to watch them make googly eyes at each other all the time, both of them looking so happy and at peace with the world. Surely that would wear off at some point, and then they\u2019d be miserable but tied to each other for eternity.</p><p>The demon growled. He wasn\u2019t about to let some wisp of a girl come along and seduce him away from his freedom like that. Certainly not a witch. They were too dangerous, which was why he had to be smarter. He should have sought magical protection after the first time he\u2019d spared her. If her death wish was this strong, she\u2019d use magic to control him if she got angry enough. He knew how that went.</p><p>There was no way for an incubus to protect himself wholesale against all magic or magic users. The man upstairs had made sure of that, wanting to limit and restrict demon powers. But with a personal object from a specific witch, he could gain temporary protection with the help of a strong magic user. It would be enough to buy him some time.</p><p>Dayne fit that bill, and Cain had a pair of Tam\u2019s panties in his pocket to seal the spell. She\u2019d left them in the caves. What else was he going to unobtrusively take without her notice? They were ripped, anyway. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d miss them.</p><p>On his way to the forest, he caught a pretty blonde\u2019s eye. She smiled at him, then blushed and turned away. Yes, he\u2019d just fed from Tam, but not fully. He was pulling his punches now that he couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted to kill her. He didn\u2019t want to kill the witch by accident until he was sure.</p><p>He strode across the street to the woman, demon swagger fully engaged. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>The sunlight glistened off her hair. She looked a bit like Tam, except her hair was longer. Goddamnit. Stop that! Stop comparing her. If he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the bane of his existence when he was about to catch another meal, he was truly lost. Tam wasn\u2019t his. She wasn\u2019t going to be his. He didn\u2019t know what the hell she was, but the only way out was to sleep with as many women as possible until he could do it without distraction, until he could enjoy being a demon again. This interest he\u2019d taken in the witch was unnatural.</p><p>The woman gave him another of those shy smiles, unaware of the conflicted emotions going through his head. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place,\u201d Cain said without preamble. Why mince words? He took her hand and looked deeply into her eyes, projecting thoughts and feelings that would make a whore blush.</p><p>Her face flushed a deep red, and she appeared as if she might faint. Cain hadn\u2019t encountered many fainters since corsets went out of fashion. He used to believe it was the intense power of his charms, until he realized they couldn\u2019t breathe properly in those whalebone cages. It didn\u2019t take much to quite literally take their breath away. He missed those days. He\u2019d found the corseted look sexy.</p><p>He reached out for her. \u201cSteady, there. My name is Cain,\u201d he said, knowing the effect the rumble of his voice had on her.</p><p>\u201cGloria. It m-must be low blood sugar,\u201d she said, clearly not wanting him to suspect the thoughts running through her mind. She\u2019d never guess he\u2019d put them there.</p><p>\u201cThat must be it,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to your house, and I\u2019ll make you something to eat?\u201d He gave her a sly look that let her know there might be something on the menu more than food.</p><p>This was always the fun part, finding out how much a woman was controlled by her baser desires. Popular myth insisted it was the men who wanted sex all the time and the women could take it or leave it. Cain\u2019s experience showed this idea to be unfounded by a wide margin. On rare occasion, a woman could have the full force of his thrall working against her and still manage to push through that fog to say no, no matter what she wanted or how desperately he\u2019d made her want it. And that was her free-will right. As a demon, he couldn\u2019t feed without some form of capitulation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d She looked around for someone to save her, but this particular street was clear of other Cary Town residents.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cSuch willpower you have. I bet you never indulge in chocolate, either.\u201d He sent her an image of herself licking chocolate off him. He gripped her elbow to keep her steady on her feet when she swayed again.</p><p>\u201cI h-have somewhere I need to be,\u201d she said.</p><p>Where she needed to be was in her bed underneath him. This was getting tiresome. The demon pulled her to him and kissed her. She moaned against his lips, her body melting into him, giving in. He chuckled and pulled away.</p> <p>\u201cNow, where do you need to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-my house,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded his approval. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can be taught.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Cain held back a growl. The blonde was curled against his chest, sleeping, her breathing shallow. He\u2019d nearly killed her, and he should have. And yet, he\u2019d stopped. He wanted to hurl the woman across the room. He was an incubus. His kind killed women. It was just what they did.</p><p>Sure, they didn\u2019t have to, and he didn\u2019t always, but eventually he did\u2014when he got bored. But this wasn\u2019t about that. She\u2019d been a quick bite, a distraction, something meant to prove he still had it, that he was still demon enough. He had no plans to come back to her again. There was no reason to keep her alive.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny the truth of the situation. He\u2019d shown mercy to someone outside his own species. The word made his lip curl in disgust. That witch had worked magic against him. She had to have. This wasn\u2019t normal. And the whole time he\u2019d been in bed with Gloria, who had he been thinking of? Tam.</p><p>He slid out of the bed, careful not to wake her. After coming so close to killing her, she really would be weak. Without letting himself think about why, he went to the kitchen and made her a sandwich and poured a glass of juice, then left it for her on her nightstand.</p><p>Angry with himself at the display of kindness for a mere meal, he allowed a fireball to form in his hand. It glowed and hissed. He tossed the ball in the air and caught it over and over as he contemplated throwing it at her and ending her.</p> <p>It was one thing for him to spare Tam. There were multiple reasons that might be a good idea. He could use a witch that powerful as an ally. Anthony clamping down with his police state would affect Jane, and Jane was one of his. It made Tam useful.</p><p>At the last confrontation with the vampire king, Tam had fought by his side like one of his demons. There were reasons to keep her breathing. But this woman? This stranger? She was just some woman he\u2019d fed from. Her only redeeming quality was that she resembled Tam. But if he was sparing meals who reminded him of the witch, it would be admitting he kept Tam alive for reasons he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.</p><p>Gloria woke then, a satisfied smile on her face\u2014until she saw him across the room with fire in his hand. It wiped the smile away as the pieces began to come together that something about their encounter was off.</p><p>\u201cW-what are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, that nervous stutter was endearing for about the first twenty minutes, but it\u2019s played out now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled with tears, her lower lip trembled, and she pulled the sheets up around her to shield herself from his gaze. Too late for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon. Incubus. Eat your sandwich.\u201d He\u2019d made it, she was going to eat it, then he was going to kill her. He\u2019d made up his mind.</p><p>\u201cSo all those stories on the news are true? A-about demons? I thought the protesters were just crackpots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d he said. The stories were partly true and the protesters probably were crackpots. Or plants Jack had put in place to further his agenda of a big reveal. What did he care if Gloria knew the truth? She\u2019d never see the outside of this room again. He could lay out every detail of each preternatural faction and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.</p><p>She eyed the fireball in his hand, and he allowed it to shrink and puff out. It wouldn\u2019t do to throw fire at her. There was no need to raise suspicion with police, and no identifiable source for the fire would raise suspicion. Things were too delicate for another unsolved mystery that suggested the preternatural. Ordinarily he wouldn\u2019t care, but this was bigger than isolated weirdness. Anything could be tied to a larger magical world by the human media.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with me? I-I won\u2019t say anything if you\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat. The. Sandwich.\u201d</p><p>Her hand shook as she reached for the food on the plate. \u201cDid you put something in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll find out,\u201d Cain said. He wouldn\u2019t let her tears or pleading affect him. He was a demon for fuck\u2019s sake. Human misery thrilled his little black heart. Only it wasn\u2019t thrilling him right now.</p><p>She ate the sandwich as he tapped his foot against the hardwood floor, his arms crossed over his chest, looming over her like some nightmare. He could say it served her right for taking him to her bed, but she\u2019d made a valiant effort to resist him. Maybe that was worth sparing her. No. That was compromise. He wasn\u2019t about to let Tam reshape him into something tame and housebroken. He had to kill this woman to convince himself he wasn\u2019t under a spell.</p><p>\u201cThe juice, too,\u201d he said when she\u2019d finished the sandwich.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to the trouble of making the sandwich. He couldn\u2019t stand to see it sitting there mocking him as a sorry excuse for a demon. Humans are food. They are not pets, or friends, or any kind of equal lover. Did humans keep pet chickens or cows?</p><p>The empty glass thudded on the nightstand, clinking against the plate.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to, but I want to.\u201d</p><p>He knew it was a lie even as the words came out of his mouth. He didn\u2019t want to kill her, but it felt like a line had been drawn in the sand. If he didn\u2019t do this, he was lost. Who was he? What was he? It had always been so simple. Betray. Feed. Kill. When he\u2019d been human, feeding hadn\u2019t been part of the process, but he\u2019d still operated the same. He\u2019d always been alone on a deep level. Human, demon, it didn\u2019t matter. The one thing that made the world rotate right was the knowledge that he didn\u2019t need any of them. He could find pleasure without connection, without risk.</p><p>As much as he protected his own kind, if they so much as thought about crossing him, his vengeance would reign down. He\u2019d never been soft. He would never be soft.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said. He\u2019d put the thrall in his words and watched her fight with herself not to leave the bed and move closer to him, but he\u2019d put too much force in it for her to win, this time. And having already given him her will once, she couldn\u2019t so easily take it back again. The sheet fell off her nude form as she approached.</p><p>She was lovely, with a light golden tan and tan lines from a string bikini. He liked the lines. The contrast between darker flesh and lighter. He traced a finger over where the straps had been, and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cI can do this one of two ways. I can hypnotize you again and sleep with you and take you out that way, or I can snap your neck. Lady\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cain put a finger to her lips to silence the begging. \u201cThose are the options. Pick one.\u201d</p><p>She stood frozen in terror.</p><p>\u201cIf you pick the first one, you\u2019ll forget all of this fireball demon stuff. You\u2019ll have another good experience, and then you\u2019ll go to sleep and wake up in Heaven.\u201d Why was he trying to comfort her?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said after a long beat, the resignation dripping from her voice.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. If he slept with her again, he\u2019d only end up sparing her. He\u2019d think about how much she looked like Tam, and he\u2019d walk away, losing a piece of who he was in the process.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d he said. Before she could realize he\u2019d changed his mind about choices, he\u2019d gripped her head and twisted. Then something horrible happened. A tear slid down his cheek.</p><p>Cain pounded on the door of Dayne\u2019s cottage, still angry at himself for taking the side trip and for all the confusing feelings his tryst with Gloria had produced.</p><p>Greta answered the door, a look of apprehension on her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. I just ate. Is Dayne around? I need to speak with him.\u201d Cain saw therians as moderately more worthy of life than humans, and he tried not to get on the bad side of magic users, so Greta would have been off the menu no matter what.</p><p>You had to have a grudging respect for the one type of being who could take you down and make all your powers null with a single spell. And from what he\u2019d heard, Dayne had a reputation. Cole had banned him from buying blood from his website, after all. Not that that mattered if he had a live-in cat-shifter.</p><p>He followed the skittish werecat into the house. Her hair was dark brown, but short, like Tam\u2019s. He growled at himself for having that thought. The therian jumped and turned around.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was thinking. Honestly, you\u2019re not in any danger.\u201d He held his hands up like he was surrendering, trying to look nonthreatening, but he knew he wasn\u2019t pulling it off. He didn\u2019t have much occasion to practice the skill without demon thrall involved.</p><p>When they reached the living room, the sorcerer looked up from an old, dusty book in his lap. \u201cGreta,\u201d he said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the word, it was the tone, as if he feared for her and didn\u2019t think he could cast a curse fast enough to save her. Dayne needn\u2019t have worried, because the next moment she shifted, and a black house cat fought her way out of her clothing. She darted under the couch and watched him with glowing, yellow eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one way to escape my charms,\u201d Cain said, chuckling.</p><p>The sorcerer didn\u2019t seem to find the joke funny and raised an arm in a way only a sorcerer could make menacing.</p><p>Cain held his hands up again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. You think I\u2019d mess with a magic user\u2019s girl? You\u2019re crazy. And I don\u2019t kill women just for the hell of it.\u201d Except for that time about an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat business do you have here, demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a favor.\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of fraternizing with the enemy.\u201d</p><p>Cain made a pffft sound. \u201cYou fraternize with Anthony. If you don\u2019t think he\u2019s the enemy, you\u2019ve been smoking too many of your magic herbs.\u201d</p><p>Greta gave a mew from under the couch, and Dayne laughed like it was an inside joke. Could he speak Cat-onese or had they just been together that long?</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that gets smoked around here is catnip,\u201d he said, \u201cand not by me.\u201d</p><p>Despite the angst of the past few hours, Cain chuckled. Greta hadn\u2019t seemed the type to smoke a bowl of anything. So she was a little stoner. He could still be surprised.</p><p>He composed himself to get back to the business at hand. \u201cI\u2019m the one thing that stands between The Cycler finding and taking Tam. We are about a blink away from a worldwide war, but keeping her in my dimension carries risk. I can\u2019t have her hexing me. I need protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lock her books and tools away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, but she\u2019s two thousand. There is plenty of magic she can do with just her mouth.\u201d Wrong wording. An image of her talented mouth and all the naughty things it could do to him surged through his mind as if it were the witch who had the demon thrall, putting sexual thoughts and feelings into his head from a distance.</p><p>From the look on his face, Dayne seemed to have caught the innuendo. \u201cI see. Let me guess. You think she\u2019s cast a love spell on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If she cast that, it failed.\u201d Unless it was just starting to take effect, making him think about her, taking the demon right out of him...</p><p>\u201cDefensive,\u201d Dayne said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go downstairs and see what the damage is and what we can do about it? Do you have a personal item of hers?\u201d</p><p>Cain pulled the pair of black panties from his pocket and smirked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine why she\u2019d feel compelled to use magic against you,\u201d the sorcerer said, dryly.</p><p>Cain just shrugged and followed him downstairs. The black cat darted past his legs to follow Dayne.</p><p>Once downstairs, Greta paced back and forth over a spot at the far corner of the room, looking distressed and deep in concentration.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer shook his head. \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019ve never seen her do anything like that in cat form.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed at a spot on the ground, making unearthly shrieking sounds.</p><p>\u201cGreta,\u201d Dayne said. No response. The cat continued her bizarre ritual. Pacing, growling, sniffing. \u201cGreta, look at me!\u201d</p><p>The cat looked up, seeming to snap out of it. \u201cMrrawwr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs and shift and put some clothes on so we can talk about this.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but finally went upstairs. Once she was gone, Dayne was all business. He uncorked several bottles, opened some books, sprinkled a few herbs, and chanted some words in a strange language that didn\u2019t seem like Latin. Cain knew Latin. And ancient Sumerian. Some of the other dead languages he\u2019d grown rusty on from lack of use. As he chanted, Dayne glowed much like Tam had in the caves.</p><p>The whole ordeal made the demon jumpy. The sorcerer could be doing anything to him. This was why demons didn\u2019t do this. It made them too vulnerable. Going to one magic user to protect yourself from a second magic user raised the odds the first one would hex you. They tended to have a code of honor to protect each other and respected the spells of others most of the time. Cain could be stepping into quicksand, here.</p><p>Finally, the glow faded from the sorcerer and the glassy look in his eyes cleared. \u201cThere are no spells in effect right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t done magic against me? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Dayne said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to undo her spell, but I would know if it was there. You\u2019re clean.\u201d</p><p>The demon let out a sigh of relief, muscles he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been clenching, loosening. \u201cCan you give me something to keep her from casting one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to make her helpless,\u201d the sorcerer said, his expression closed.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not asking that. She still has her energy balls. She can resist a lot of my thrall...\u201d Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t share so much information. \u201cI just don\u2019t want what happened to Luc to happen to me. Witches are dangerous to us. If I\u2019m being asked to protect her, then I should be protected from her. It\u2019s only fair. Remember, I could toss her on her ass out of my dimension. Then you all are on your own.\u201d</p><p>If things went to shit, he could be affected with the magic users coming out of the closet and uniting. It would be a demon nightmare. But the sorcerer didn\u2019t have to know how seriously Cain took the threat, not when he had more immediate protection needs.</p><p>Dayne sighed. \u201cI know. All right. I\u2019m going to loan you something of mine. If you lose this, I\u2019ll hex you myself. It belonged to my Uncle Arthur.\u201d He took a gilded box off the shelf and retrieved a ring from underneath several small scrolls of parchment. \u201cI need to bespell something you\u2019ll wear that won\u2019t draw attention to you. If you take this off, you\u2019ll be unprotected. The spell will last three moon cycles at the most, so if this isn\u2019t resolved by then, you\u2019ll want to return to have it recharged. When all of this is over, you will return this ring to me.\u201d</p><p>Cain nodded. He didn\u2019t like the way he was being spoken to, but at this moment all he cared about was being nice to the magic user with the promise of safety. He was grateful the ring wasn\u2019t gaudy. It was a simple band made of pewter, with runic markings carved into it. Probably no one would notice it.</p><p>He stood out of the way while Dayne prepared for the spell. Greta came downstairs as he was finishing the preparation.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, keeping a wary eye on Cain.</p><p>The sorcerer put the ring on the table. \u201cHey. So what was that weird behavior about a few minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>The therian looked confused. \u201cWhat weird behavior?\u201d</p><p>Dayne pointed to the area where she\u2019d acted so oddly. \u201cYou were pacing and growling and looking really intense and sniffing, like something upsetting happened there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I was down here for a few minutes with you guys, then I decided to go upstairs and change. Then I came back down. I wasn\u2019t even over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this kind of memory loss normal?\u201d Cain asked.</p> <p>Dayne stroked his chin. \u201cSometimes. It depends on a lot of factors. I think she was a little anxious when she shifted, but she was human enough in there to engage with me and understand what I was saying, so her memories should be intact. There\u2019s no logical reason for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould she be under a spell of some sort? Something that would affect her as a human but not as a cat?\u201d Cain had paid close attention to the various ways magic could be used to fuck with someone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but if someone else cast a spell on her, I wouldn\u2019t be able to undo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but at least you would know. Besides, what if you did it?\u201d</p><p>Dayne looked offended. \u201cWhy would I do it?\u201d</p><p>Cain shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. To protect her from something? Isn\u2019t that what men in love do?\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer seemed doubtful. \u201cSomething I don\u2019t remember either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Nevermind, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if I\u2019d done it, I can\u2019t even undo my own spell if I don\u2019t know which spell I used. As you can see, I have hundreds of books down here. Memory-related spells are a dime a dozen.\u201d He made a sweeping motion to the shelves behind him with all the books.</p><p>\u201cWell... you can work on this Nancy Drew mystery after you\u2019ve fixed my ring.\u201d Cain needed Dayne to stay focused and not get off track on something that didn\u2019t involve or affect him.</p><p>The sorcerer shot him an annoyed look. \u201cIn a minute. Greta?\u201d</p><p>The therian bit her lip, her anxiety rising. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you shift back? Maybe you can help me in cat form.\u201d</p><p>She seemed upset at the idea of doing something she wouldn\u2019t remember doing later, but she closed her eyes and shifted anyway, her height dropping several feet in seconds. The black cat wrestled her way out of her clothes.</p><p>\u201cGreta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrawrr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened over there?\u201d Dayne pointed. \u201cBlink once for yes, twice for no.\u201d</p><p>Two blinks.</p><p>\u201cBut something happened?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, looking from the area of the room he\u2019d indicated and back to Dayne. One blink.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any spells being done?\u201d</p><p>A pause and a look of concentration, then one blink.</p><p>\u201cDid someone else take your memory?\u201d</p><p>Two.</p><p>\u201cDid I do it?\u201d</p><p>One.</p><p>Cain stood back and watched the kitty charades, less than amused. Why this drama had to interfere with him getting his ring, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember which book I used?\u201d</p><p>Greta went to the shelves with the books and jumped up onto one, threading her way around the dusty volumes of magic until she got to an old, red leather volume on the middle of the second shelf. Dayne took it and thumbed through.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing but forgetting spells. It\u2019ll take me forever to figure out which one it is. Thanks, baby. You can go change back now.\u201d The cat rubbed against his hand, then hopped off the shelf.</p><p>\u201cAs enlightening as that was, I need that protection spell.\u201d</p><p>Greta hissed at the demon and dragged her clothes into the hallway. By the time she returned, Dayne had set up a circle of salt and put together a potion in a small iron cauldron, adding the personal object of Tam\u2019s with a glare aimed in the demon\u2019s direction. What other personal object but panties was an incubus going to have from a woman he\u2019d been sleeping with?</p><p>\u201cRemember anything that happened?\u201d the sorcerer asked when Greta reached his side.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust shifting, after that it\u2019s a blank until I took my clothes to go shift again. And I think I hissed at Cain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected as much.\u201d Dayne took her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Cain cleared his throat.</p><p>The sorcerer kissed Greta, ignoring the throat clearing. \u201cLet me do this spell so we can get the demon out of our hair, then we\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right here,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>Greta rolled her eyes in the demon\u2019s direction and went upstairs. Dayne finished dropping herbs into the cauldron. He took a book, the cauldron, and the ring into the center of the circle, dropped the ring in, raised his arms, and began to chant. Whether or not it was the spell Cain had asked for, something was happening. A green, shimmering wall came up around the cauldron, then the ring rose out of the potion, spinning as Dayne incanted.</p><p>When he finished, the green wall dropped first, then Dayne slid his hand underneath the ring and the piece of pewter dropped into it.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said, handing it to the demon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this thing will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a little faith.\u201d</p><p>Faith was something Cain had discarded long ago, but he put the ring on.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cTamar,\u201d It was a whisper, like a hiss that floated through the still air of the demon dimension. The place was deserted except for her sleeping guards. Something about that scenario tickled at the back of her mind, but she was too panicked to think it through.</p><p>\u201cCain!\u201d she shouted. But he wasn\u2019t there either\u2014probably out feeding on some random guileless woman who didn\u2019t know it was going to be her last orgasm.</p><p>The whisper got closer. \u201cTamar.\u201d</p><p>As she ran down the cobblestone streets, the tents and marketplace collapsed in a flutter of fabric and knocked over support poles. In their place, old stone and brick buildings rose so high they seemed to go forever into the sky, sealing her into a labyrinth she\u2019d never find her way out of. The cobblestones beneath her feet chipped and crumbled, aging before her eyes, and suddenly she was in an alleyway she recognized.</p><p>She froze at the sound. It was like fingernails on a chalkboard\u2014or like a sharp knife scraping over stone, dragging closer and closer. She cringed.</p><p>\u201cTamar.\u201d His voice was snakelike. It seemed to wrap around her, constricting the life out. And then that horrible knife scraping, raspy as his voice when he kept saying her name.</p><p>\u201cCain!\u201d She tried to scream it again, unsure why he was the one she called out for. Why not Luc or Anna? Why not the wolf pack she\u2019d met when they\u2019d fought Anthony? Why not anybody but the other monster in her life?</p><p>There was a deep chuckle behind her. She spun toward it, but the alley was dark and empty. Still, she heard Jack when he finally whispered something besides her name.</p><p>\u201cSweet, Tamar. Don\u2019t you know he\u2019s busy with his own whores? Let\u2019s not bother him right now. You\u2019re not that special.\u201d</p><p>If that were so, why was Jack so obsessed? It had been centuries, and he couldn\u2019t seem to let go. Had he taunted the others this way before coming for them? Her guess was no. It was a special torment he\u2019d saved for the one who\u2019d left his bed.</p><p>The endless alley opened onto a street with carriages and horses and properly dressed Victorian ladies all going about with parasols to protect them from the harsh sun\u2014even though it was dark and cool. Maybe it was to protect them from something else. When they\u2019d passed, Tam saw the carnage. Everyone he\u2019d killed, laid out like dolls.</p><p>He\u2019d dressed them all in white like a macabre angel massacre. Some had fewer organs and less blood than others. Some were more rushed and hurried. Some of them more methodical. She averted her eyes from her sister, the one image she\u2019d tried not to see or know too much about. The others were hard to look at, but not like Naomi. They\u2019d all been friends, companions as they traveled through the changing world together, until Jack had gone mad and put an end to all that.</p><p>Not everyone could handle immortality.</p><p>Tam cringed when the flat of a blade dragged across the back of her neck. She closed her eyes at the sensation of his hot breath in her ear.</p><p>\u201cSoon, my sweet Tamar. Soon, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>She turned, surprised when he wasn\u2019t hiding again in the shadows. He stood dressed in white like the others, like a cult leader who\u2019d chickened out of drinking the Kool-Aid at the last minute. Tam looked down to find she, too, was dressed in white.</p><p>\u201cIs there a ball I don\u2019t know about?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it. She knew it was a dream, and there was only so much he could do to her here. There was no sense in letting him know how much he scared her, even in a place where the danger was minimal.</p><p>He smiled. She wished the things he\u2019d done could have made him just as ugly on the outside as the bloody death he\u2019d wrought, but his outward appearance refused to reflect the evil within. Like Cain, he was an enticing, pretty spider, waiting for a woman to fall into his web. Tam had been there, done that.</p><p>\u201cYou still want me,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cLike hell I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s right. You\u2019ve got a new monster to scratch that dark itch for you now. You\u2019re just as bad as I am, Tam. You think a good girl would do the things you\u2019ve done with a demon, knowing what he is? No, you\u2019re my lovely dark girl. I\u2019ll see you soon. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t run or scream when he moved toward her, his warm lips brushing against hers. He wrapped his arms around her, and for the smallest second she remembered them before all the carnage, before he\u2019d lost his mind\u2014back when she\u2019d loved him, and she wished they could go back there.</p><p>His voice fell over her like a blanket while she pretended he was pre-crazy Jack. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take my offer? I would have spared you.\u201d</p><p>His embrace turned into a vice, and then he transformed into a giant snake, wrapped around her, constricting until she couldn\u2019t get air.</p><p>Tam sat up from the bed of fluffy pillows on the ground in her tent, her heart palpitating wildly. It would be nice to believe it was just a dream\u2014her confused fears and past feelings all mixing together in a tapestry of nocturnal images that meant nothing. But she knew better.</p><p>As much as she didn\u2019t want to admit it, that had been Jack. Not an apparition of him or an imagining or fear of him. Him. She knew the difference. He\u2019d visited her in dreams before when they\u2019d been close enough for him to form a connection. The blood that bound them all together in the spell, that had made them what they were, made such connections difficult, but not impossible, especially for someone of his power.</p><p>He\u2019d grown too strong for her to initiate connection with him by herself, his magical wards high and always in place. Otherwise she might have been able to lead Cain and the others to him. But there was a slim chance she could, now that he\u2019d opened a connection.</p><p>She threw some clothes on, and after a brief argument with her guards, made her way to Cain\u2019s tent. He was sleeping. Officially, demons didn\u2019t need sleep, feeding alone replenished them, but it wasn\u2019t hard to see how someone as old as Cain would choose to sleep anyway. It was the one place he could escape and forget himself. Tam understood that need more than most. Even though she required sleep, still tied to normal human needs, she\u2019d used the night and the dream world for the same reason. To forget. Not that she ever wanted to sleep again right now.</p><p>For a moment, she watched him. In sleep, there was none of the arrogant asshole bravado to taint things. His face was peaceful and not as perfect, since he\u2019d shed the glamour. She wanted to trace her finger over the scar a god had marked him with, but was afraid he\u2019d wake up. She thought about waking him anyway, but if she did, it would be back to the disturbing dynamic they had. All she wanted right now was to feel safe, not banter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid underneath the blankets next to him and was surprised when his arms came around her in his sleep, pulling her close. She waited for the constricting evil feeling from her dream, but it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>A few minutes passed like this, and she finally relaxed.</p><p>\u201cTam, nobody walks into my tent without me waking up,\u201d he rumbled.</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t been asleep. But he\u2019d still held her like he cared. No. She wasn\u2019t going there. All she was doing was trying to transfer some residual feeling for Jack onto the lesser evil because it felt less traumatic. But was Cain the lesser evil? Of course not. He was the worse evil. He didn\u2019t kill my sister. But he tried to kill Anna. And hadn\u2019t Anna been the next closest thing to a sister?</p> <p>As far as she knew, Jack had killed ten people. Gruesomely, yes, but it didn\u2019t compare to the vast number of women Cain had killed. It hardly mattered how they died. By numbers alone, Cain was the bigger monster. Transferring anything onto him was foolish. Feeling anything for either one of them at any point in time was shameful. Jack was right, she wasn\u2019t an innocent. Why couldn\u2019t she have loved Henry? He was good. Kind. Decent. Nice. He\u2019d always had her back through everything for two centuries.</p><p>Maybe the more important question was, why couldn\u2019t Henry love her like that? Had he been too kind to tell her what he\u2019d thought of her? He\u2019d had a soul mate waiting for him on the other side, but had he known that? Was it from his most recent life or a previous one?</p><p>Even though Cain had revealed he was awake, he hadn\u2019t let go of her.</p><p>\u201cYour heart was beating too fast when you got here. Was it wild lust for me or something else?\u201d</p><p>It was easy to forget how evil he was. Sometimes he seemed so damned normal. An asshole, yeah, but normal.</p> <p>\u201cJack came to me in my dream.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her tighter, but even so, it didn\u2019t feel stifling like it was supposed to. \u201cIt was just a dream,\u201d he said. He stroked her back, and she tried not to read too much into the gesture.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was real. Jack was there.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help the tears. The last thing she wanted was for Cain to see her cry. Showing that much weakness to a demon was stupid, but she was so tired. Of everything. \u201cWhy do you all have to be so evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re old enough to know it isn\u2019t like that, Tam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? How many people have you killed?\u201d</p><p>He pushed her away and sat up, his eyes glowing red and angry in the dark. \u201cIs that how it is now? I knew you\u2019d start falling for me, but you don\u2019t get to make demands. I said you\u2019d beg me to keep you. Looks like I\u2019m right. And if you think that\u2019s a way to get your life spared, trotting out all my crimes and trying to domesticate me like a puppy, boy do you have the wrong demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen fucking kill me! I never asked to be spared. Put me out of my misery like I\u2019ve asked you to a hundred times. I told you I\u2019d never beg you to keep me, and I never will, Cain. Let go of the dream. This is getting serious. You don\u2019t want to keep me. I\u2019ll never ask you to. I can\u2019t cope with what you are, what Jack is. I want to be free. Just end it. You don\u2019t need me to fight a war with Anthony! You don\u2019t need me at all.\u201d She was tempted to throw an energy ball right at his pretty monster face.</p><p>He gripped her shoulders. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to control me. When have I ever claimed to be a good guy? You don\u2019t get to shout out orders and get whatever you want. I do need you for a war with Anthony. You\u2019re strong. But if you really want me to kill you, beg me to keep you and mean it. Tell me you love me, Tam, and maybe I\u2019ll take your request into consideration.\u201d</p><p>If he was that gung ho about keeping her to use her in a war, he wouldn\u2019t kill her even if she begged him. He was just sadistic and bored. He could play that game with someone else. \u201cI know you\u2019re used to stupid women who were born yesterday. I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him, his lips pressing against hers. It was like Jack in the dream, but different. He slid a dark image of something she\u2019d never trust him enough to do for real\u2014bondage. Whips. Of course, Cain would go for the freaky stuff. He was eight thousand. Nobody that old just did it missionary. Not that they\u2019d just done missionary. In the time she\u2019d been in his care, they\u2019d made it through the entire Kama Sutra. In spite of herself, she melted against him and wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>The demon pulled away while she was still dazed with the images, half of her wanting to act them out. She was a bad witch. She couldn\u2019t even remember to keep her shields up. Was that how Jack had gotten into her dream? Had he been trying before and failed?</p><p>Cain\u2019s face was serious now. \u201cJack kills his kind, for power, and ultimately to control everything in the human dimension if we can\u2019t destroy him. I kill my dinner. Being at the top of the food chain doesn\u2019t make me evil. And you know that. You\u2019re two thousand, Tam. So get over this self-loathing. It doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Anna? She wasn\u2019t dinner,\u201d Tam said, not willing to concede the point just yet, even though she knew he was right. Two thousand or not, she was still moderately human, and right now Cain and Jack looked like two flavors of the same guy.</p><p>\u201cMy brother had been imprisoned for half a century, and your friend stubbornly refused to do the only thing to free him. So yes, I took matters into my own hands. She put herself between me and Luc. I\u2019m also not claiming to be good. I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m not Jack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still playing with me. You don\u2019t want a relationship. You want to toy with me until you\u2019re bored. So you\u2019re still an asshole.\u201d Where had that come from? She didn\u2019t want a relationship with a demon so what difference did it make if he did? Weren\u2019t they both using each other?</p><p>He smirked. \u201cNow that I\u2019ll admit to.\u201d He started to pull the shirt over her head, but she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about the fact that she still wanted to. Obnoxious or not, there was something about him beneath the surface. Maybe it wasn\u2019t real and it was the same bullshit lies women had told themselves about the wrong kind of guy for ages, but she desperately wanted to believe there was something more to him than what he was showing her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you might beg me or because you\u2019ll hate yourself tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his ego. \u201cNeither. I need to do some big magic, and if you drain my energy it won\u2019t be possible. Jack is closing in. We don\u2019t have time for whatever this thing is we\u2019re doing. I need my books and tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to fight me on the books and tools thing?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, he just stood and helped her get up out of the pile of pillows and blankets. How he ever found the strength of will to get up out of that much comfort, she didn\u2019t know. If she were a demon, she\u2019d be tempted to just lie around and starve, or order carryout.</p><p>Cain wasn\u2019t wearing a stitch of clothing. As he turned toward the entrance of the tent, she got a great view of his ass. It wasn\u2019t even the pretty form he used to catch prey. Having just gotten up, he hadn\u2019t bothered with the glamour. Even without enhancements, he looked like he\u2019d worked out endlessly, which probably wasn\u2019t far off the mark. In his brief time as a human, he\u2019d been a farmer\u2014if the stories were true. It was hard to have that job and not look like you\u2019d been chiseled out of marble, especially back then.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put some clothes on?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound like a fangirl.</p><p>He turned and arched a brow. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a being in this dimension who hasn\u2019t seen me naked at least once. It\u2019s an occupational hazard. Why? Would it make you more comfortable if I put some clothes on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason not to,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>She wished she could say she was playing reverse psychology with him and just wanted to scope out his ass and muscular back on the trip to the caves. So much for being ancient and not behaving like a schoolgirl. Though he did have six thousand years on her.</p><p>As they walked, he held her hand like she didn\u2019t know where the caves were. Suddenly she was thirteen again\u2014not one of the cycles, the real thirteen\u2014holding a boy\u2019s hand for the first time. The memory fluttered up from the abyss of her consciousness. It was hard to believe it was there under all the other layers from the past.</p><p>She barely breathed. Why was holding hands with Cain such a big deal? They\u2019d slept together like a couple of nymphomaniac rabbits\u2014way past the hand-holding stage. Such a simple act shouldn\u2019t create that flutter in her stomach. She should pull away. He should pull away, but his warm hand stayed solidly in hers as they made their way to the caves. Was it wrong that it felt natural? Strip away the demon and witch thing and weren\u2019t they just two people having an affair? Kind of strange motives all around, but still. She was attracted to him, even when he wasn\u2019t using the demon thrall or glamour and her shields were up. Did he find her attractive in the same way? She\u2019d never thought about it, and felt silly for thinking about it now.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the shock and weirdness of the moment had worn off that Tam felt the metal around his finger. As they moved down the cobblestone streets between torches, she turned his hand to see the ring with the runic markings. She stopped, pulling him back with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The demon seemed puzzled they\u2019d stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cNice jewelry,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>If a demon could blush, or show any signs of guilt, Cain was doing it right now, though it was hard to tell for sure with the low lighting of the demon dimension. He pulled his hand away, and she couldn\u2019t decide if she was disappointed.</p><p>\u201cA friend gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmmm,\u201d Tam said, not buying it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born yesterday. Someone did a spell for you. I can feel the magic on it. Was it to protect you from me? I\u2019m flattered you find me that threatening.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cSo I should trust the witch I\u2019m toying with not to turn the tables and hex me for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you admit it openly. You\u2019re toying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve admitted it openly from day one, and yet you\u2019ve been spreading your legs. So much for age making you smarter.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI really don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to judge me.\u201d She refused to let his words hurt her. It was all part of how he played. She knew what she\u2019d signed on for when she\u2019d made the bargain with him. Of course, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d be dead by now. At this point, did she really think he\u2019d kill her? If not, why was she still sleeping with him?</p><p>Tam hadn\u2019t been awake long enough to contemplate these deep thoughts, so she put them on the shelf where she kept all other unpleasantness, like why she couldn\u2019t be in love somebody like Henry.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, willing herself not to be distracted, \u201cwhat did you use to bind the spell?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already turned and started walking away from her in all his naked glory toward the caves. He tossed an answer over his shoulder. \u201cThat lovely scrap of black lace you had covering your ass the last time you seduced me.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was it. A ball of energy glowed in her hand. He should have expected it by now, but he hadn\u2019t gone noncorporeal. The ball hit squarely in the center of his back. Tam heard the sizzle as it scorched his skin.</p><p>He rounded on her and roared as he shifted into the demon form, horns popping out, fangs descending, eyes glowing. \u201cI\u2019m not your punching bag. I should suck the life out of you for that.\u201d</p><p>Tam didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cOut here in the middle of the desert? In that form? Kinky.\u201d How many ways could an incubus suck the life out of you? Those had been his words. Not snap your neck or rip out your heart... suck the life out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably like it, you little freak.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHey, I\u2019m old. Same as you. We get creative and experimental the more time passes.\u201d The truth was, she wasn\u2019t put off by his demon form. Cain was Cain to her. For better or worse.</p><p>The demon smirked, erasing much of the sinister look and irritation, even though the swirl of dark, black emotions pressed in on her. She wouldn\u2019t back down or show fear. Not to him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she was pushing so hard. Did she still really want to die? If they could get to Jack and stop him first? The death wish was beginning to fade, but it wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d suddenly found a new reason to live, it was that the demon was right. She wasn\u2019t going to say she was falling for him\u2014that would be an admission worthy of psychiatric care, but she did enjoy their time together, even the fighting because fighting made her feel like maybe there was still something in life worth fighting for. It reminded her she wasn\u2019t dead yet. If she could still work up an energy ball or angry words, there was something there that wasn\u2019t completely lost.</p><p>She shook herself out of the pattern of thoughts she still didn\u2019t want to address. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take my stuff for magic, especially not my underwear. It\u2019s tacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left them in my cave. It\u2019s not as if I rooted through your bags.\u201d</p><p>Tam trudged along behind him, keeping a safe distance so she couldn\u2019t feel the emotions the demon form brought with it. He couldn\u2019t help that those things existed in that form. Did he feel them as much as she did? Did he draw strength from it or did it weigh him down? How could anybody, good or evil, carry that around with them all the time, just under the surface? Where did it all go when he was in the handsome form and she couldn\u2019t feel it? Did he keep it all bottled inside?</p><p>In spite of herself, and everything else, the tiniest seed of sympathy for the devil sprouted within her. And she knew it would be her downfall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>By the time they reached the caves, Cain had shifted back into the pretty form. Even with his back to her, she knew which form it was. He was a little bigger and a little more intimidating in this form than his original human look. And just like the demon form gave off a form of dark energy few could withstand, this form gave off a sexual energy, more subtle, but still intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cDoes it take a lot of work to maintain that form?\u201d</p><p>He created a fireball to light the torches, then turned to her, his face smooth of all lines and scars. \u201cNot at my age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why do you shed it sometimes, like when you sleep?\u201d She stood just inches from him, trying to avoid the temptation to discard her own clothing; she needed to stay focused on her goal.</p><p>He reached out and stroked her cheek. She didn\u2019t breathe, afraid if she did, she\u2019d break this uncommon moment that felt like tenderness and honesty between them. She\u2019d berate herself for her sanity slippage later.</p><p>Although they were isolated in the caves, his voice was low, as if he were sharing a secret he didn\u2019t want the walls to hear. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s good to let everything go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you put the glamour back up just now?\u201d She\u2019d seen his original human form. They were in the middle of nowhere. There was no one to impress and no food for him to hunt out here. And if he wanted her, they both knew at this point that the form wasn\u2019t a barrier for her. She probably would have slept with him in the demon form out in the desert, a point she didn\u2019t want to dwell on. It would mean she was starting to feel for the person underneath it all, not just the pretty fantasy.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cForce of habit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo let go,\u201d she said.</p><p>His face tensed, and for a moment she thought she\u2019d pushed too far, but then he sighed and dropped the glamour. Tam reached out and traced the mark on his forehead. A moment of stillness passed between them. With other people in another situation, it would have been the part where the epic orchestral music played, where the couple looked deeply into each other\u2019s eyes with the devotion of true love and shared a passionate, angst-filled kiss. But they weren\u2019t those people, and the only music Tam could hear was the flickering of the torchlight. Cain pulled away abruptly and went down one of the dark corridors.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make an arrogant remark or taunt her like he normally did. He was so eerily quiet, she almost wished he\u2019d say something awful just to break up the discomfort of his silence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see back here,\u201d she said, as she followed him. She assumed they were going to get her stuff, but a part of her thought maybe he just wanted to get away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou could use one of your energy balls.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought about it, but was afraid he\u2019d take it as a threat. And she wasn\u2019t in the mood for another fight right now. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be bright enough.\u201d Which was also true.</p> <p>Cain created a fireball to illuminate the corridor and they kept walking. He reached the pod with her stuff in it and placed a hand over the egg-shaped door. It glowed for a moment, then opened with a groan of rock against rock. He slung a few of the bags over his shoulder and gave the rest to Tam.</p><p>They were in the main part of the cave when he spoke again. \u201cYou said you had to do big magic. What kind of magic?\u201d</p><p>He was pretty confident about that ring, if he was just asking now.</p><p>\u201cI need to contact Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d</p><p>Was that jealousy in his voice? Ridiculous. Cain wasn\u2019t the type. But it seemed like something similar\u2014some emotion too nuanced to put her finger on.</p><p>\u201cHenry was a dear friend of mine for a couple of centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why are we contacting him?\u201d There was that weird pseudo-jealousy thing again. She had to be reading things that weren\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a raven therian and my familiar. I lost him a few years ago. He\u2019s on the other side. Since Jack formed a connection with me in the dream, I can\u2019t find him, but maybe Henry can. So to answer your question, I need to do a s\u00e9ance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need more than one person for that?\u201d</p><p>And now he was being somewhat considerate and helpful. It was almost unnerving. It was as if he\u2019d been possessed by somebody civilized.</p><p>\u201cI need someone to ground me.\u201d She was afraid to outright ask him, but he was the only person there. Obviously he was the one she\u2019d have to use.</p><p>They exchanged a look, and she dug through her bags for the book she needed, a sage stick, matches, a clay dish, and a large container of salt. She flipped through the book to the spirit summoning spell and re-read it to refresh her memory. She\u2019d done it many times over the years, but it was always wisest to recheck for things like this. A small mispronunciation could have unpredictable results. Right now she needed predictability.</p><p>\u201cCould you have done this with your sister? Call her, I mean?\u201d The care of the phrasing and gentleness in his tone startled her and dampened any ire she might have felt at being asked. He thought her sister could have given them information they needed about Jack\u2019s location.</p><p>Tam tried to keep the tears at bay. She\u2019d mourned in short bursts, not letting the grief wash over her yet. She couldn\u2019t. And she\u2019d convinced herself it wasn\u2019t necessary. If Cain was going to kill her for real, she\u2019d see Naomi soon enough. But the belief that he would was fading, and along with it, her ability to keep her emotions in check.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Jack would be that sloppy. He changed locations after each kill for that reason. It wouldn\u2019t give me anything real to use, and it would be too painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could change his location now,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but if Henry can make use of the brief connection he made while it\u2019s still fresh and get a track on him, it won\u2019t matter. He\u2019ll be able to follow him.\u201d</p><p>She poured the salt in a circle around Cain and lit the sage stick. When he looked anxious\u2014an odd look on Cain to be sure\u2014she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cI need to cleanse the space, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re inside the circle.\u201d She waved the stick around the cave, glad it was large enough for so much smoke.</p><p>She entered the circle and sat cross-legged on the ground, placing the clay dish in front of her. She laid the sage stick on the dish, allowing it to continue to burn, the thin ribbon of smoke curling upward. Cain sat across from her and took her hands without prompting when she held them out.</p><p>Despite what he was, he felt warm and solid. She couldn\u2019t ask for better grounding. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply, inhaling the scent of the sage, letting go, while her anchor held her steady.</p><p>Cain\u2019s grip on her hands tightened when she began to intone a chant. It was unlikely she was working magic against him, especially knowing about the ring and the danger such an attempt could bring. But old reflexes died hard. It wasn\u2019t easy letting one\u2019s guard down with a witch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about why he\u2019d held her hand on the way to the caves, or why he\u2019d allowed her to snuggle in the pillows and blankets with him before letting her know he was awake, or why holding her hand right now felt more possessive than perfunctory.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d let his guard down, feelings rose to the surface that he\u2019d pushed down. She was right. He didn\u2019t need her in a war. It would be nice. It would be helpful. But Cole and the others could cobble together a coven to stay protected if necessary.</p><p>Deep down he\u2019d known what all of this was all about. She had enough life experience to relate to him. She was pretty, sure, but pretty women weren\u2019t rare in his world. He could have anybody he wanted, even her\u2014without promises or commitment. He\u2019d proven that already. But he didn\u2019t just want a meal or toy. If he suspected he was covering a confusing collection of feelings, he had no doubt the witch was doing the same. Why would she keep sleeping with him if she really had a death wish, given how many times they\u2019d done it in the preceding weeks, with no sign of her death on the horizon?</p><p>Of course, now he\u2019d played up the whole you\u2019ll-beg-me-to-keep-you thing so hard that she\u2019d never trust he wasn\u2019t toying with her. What had that been about? Because he couldn\u2019t risk his own ego? Was it that he needed to know she wanted him before making a fool of himself? Hadn\u2019t he lived long enough by now to survive a little ego bruise? And if she bruised his ego, couldn\u2019t he put the whammy on her and kill her?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he wanted forever, he just wanted time to figure it out. The idea of Tam in his life felt strangely comforting. Whether they were fighting or fucking didn\u2019t even matter to him, just so long as she was there and he didn\u2019t have to pretend he was the happy-go-lucky hedonist, wearing a mask for the other demons. It wouldn\u2019t do for them to know the man upstairs had finally succeeded in breaking him. He was the symbol of what a demon could be: free. There was no need to be tortured about it or succumb to one\u2019s prey. If he broke down and gave in to the twisted plan to remake him\u2014set in motion long before Tam came on the scene\u2014then it was only a matter of time for the other demons.</p><p>He looked back at Tam. She was glowing again. Her voice had taken on an ethereal quality. If he hadn\u2019t been holding her hands, he wouldn\u2019t be sure she was solid at all. She seemed more like a vision or hallucination than anyone who could possibly be real.</p><p>The smoke curling off the sage stick grew thicker as it rose between them, and then, out of the smoke, came the shape of a raven. The image of the raven swirled and became distorted, and out of the distortion rose a more human shape, transforming from a smoke-created image into a spirit, someone so real, you could almost touch him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tam, did you ever look at your cards again?\u201d the apparition asked, by way of introduction, as if they\u2019d recently had a conversation.</p><p>How often did she call this guy up? The spirit eyed Cain with a smirk that the demon didn\u2019t particularly care for.</p><p>Tam opened her eyes and smiled up at him. \u201cHey, Henry. I hope I\u2019m not disturbing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean up here in Stepford Heaven?\u201d</p><p>Tam giggled and Cain had the odd urge to kill someone that was already dead. She seemed so relaxed around this Henry guy, and Cain knew that even if it wasn\u2019t like that now, at one point in time, they\u2019d been lovers. He could just tell these things. He growled.</p><p>The witch arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your boyfriend is getting a bit territorial over here,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>The indignant rebuttals came out of the two of them simultaneously, but the therian just chuckled. \u201cYoung love,\u201d he said with a sigh. Then he laughed. \u201cOr is that an inappropriate description for two people of your advanced ages?\u201d</p><p>Cain was ready to let go of Tam\u2019s hands to make the guy disappear. Worse than someone he might have to compete with was someone who could see things a bit too clearly. Not love, just that something was brewing. It was easy for people to confuse sex with love. He saw it all the time. Powerful attraction and love weren\u2019t the same thing. He knew it, and he assumed Tam knew it. Where that left them, he wasn\u2019t sure, but he was ready to break the connection and end the s\u00e9ance before it had really begun if it meant he wouldn\u2019t have to keep thinking about it.</p><p>The witch held on tighter and shot him a glare. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t looked at my cards again,\u201d she said, turning her attention back to Henry. \u201cMy stuff has been locked up. But we\u2019ve got something more important to talk about. I\u2019m sure you know Jack is on the hunt again. He came to me in a dream a little while ago. I was wondering if you could sense the connection, and if so, if you could help us find him.\u201d</p><p>The apparition closed his eyes, seeming to be in deep concentration. When he opened them, he said, \u201cThe connection is thinning, but it\u2019s there. I can try to trace it and see what I can find out from there. Do you want to call me back here tomorrow night for the report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>Henry looked at Cain in an assessing way that made the demon\u2019s skin crawl, then he looked back at Tam and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your tools back now, right?\u201d</p><p>The uncertain way she looked at Cain made him feel guilty for some reason.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cain said, not looking at the spirit.</p><p>\u201cLook at your cards again, and really listen to them this time.\u201d</p><p>Tam let go of Cain\u2019s hands and Henry disappeared. She put the sage stick out in the clay dish and Cain began to get up.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, putting a hand on his arm. \u201cI need to take down the protective barrier first.\u201d She closed her eyes again and whispered something, then opened them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d It was less of a show than Cain expected, which made him leery of the whole situation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ran a finger through the salt on the ground, smearing the circle. He didn\u2019t feel any push-back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hope for your own sake that I can,\u201d he retorted, flashing the ring that protected him. He didn\u2019t want to think about the fact that he was using a small piece of jewelry to protect himself from a girl. It wouldn\u2019t do anything good for his reputation.</p><p>She gathered her things, making a convincing show of ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t think you\u2019re leaving now,\u201d he said, moving toward her, glad he hadn\u2019t bothered with clothing. It made it easier to tempt her when her access was so easy. Now to get her out of those jeans. Annoyingly Anna and Luc had done her laundry, and she was back to wearing jeans instead of the clothing from the trunk. He much preferred her in the demon-concubine look. If she were his mate, he\u2019d use her first power against her and make sure she wore what he wanted at all times. She wouldn\u2019t be able to sneak off without his knowledge and change, seeing as it wouldn\u2019t be possible for her to be solid or interact with physical things unless he was there touching her. He\u2019d always liked that perk of the demon mating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grimaced, trying to dislodge the thought from his brain. Not about wardrobe, about mating. He wasn\u2019t taking a mate. Why would he do such a ridiculous thing and give up his freedoms? Lonely or not, the mating ritual was irreversible. And if it had seemed like eternity alone, it really would be eternity together. At least now he had an option to end his loneliness. If he took a mate, he wouldn\u2019t have the option to go back. On the surface, he realized such reasoning made him look crazy, but forever was a long time. He\u2019d gotten the tiniest taste of it in his eight thousand years as a demon, and he knew that was only the beginning.</p><p>Tam dropped her bags. \u201cDid you have something else in mind?\u201d The tone in her voice made it clear she knew exactly what was on his mind. What was always on his mind.</p><p>He backed her against the wall of the cave. \u201cYou woke me from a nice dream. Then you had the audacity to stop me because you needed your energy for magic. I was very accommodating for you, I expect you\u2019ll be accommodating for me.\u201d</p><p>He smirked when his double entendre, complete with filthy mental pictures, hit their mark. She was lovely when she gasped and flushed like that. Her gaze drifted south and then back up again to his face quickly, as if caught with her hands in the cookie jar.</p> <p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d Cain said. He gasped when her small hand closed around him, touching him like only a woman with over a thousand years experience could. He\u2019d never understand the male fixation with a virgin. It didn\u2019t matter who else had been there first. Every bit of experience was something you didn\u2019t have to teach her.</p><p>Despite how good her hand felt on him, his mind was too distracted. He wondered if the thing about conserving her magical energy to do the s\u00e9ance was true. Maybe the amount of bells and whistles didn\u2019t indicate how much energy one was using. Maybe it took a lot of energy and magical concentration to hold a spirit to this plane long enough for a chat. What did he know about the finer details of magic? He\u2019d spent the better part of his existence avoiding it as much as possible, just as someone highly flammable would avoid fire.</p><p>She sagged against him as his mouth found hers. She was so warm and sweet and pliable this way. He needed less and less of the demon thrall to get her to this place. He suspected if he held out, she\u2019d beg him to keep her, no matter what she said to the contrary. Her body told truths that her mind could only begin to imagine. And what would he do then? Laugh and kill her like he\u2019d said?</p><p>He growled angrily against her mouth. If this game went on much longer, he\u2019d lose because he\u2019d keep her. And if he went down that road, how much farther before he lost his mind entirely and became so attached that what Luc had done with Anna started to look good?</p><p>He\u2019d already had the urge to mix their blood to protect her, but from what? It only worked against demons, and no one in his dimension would dare defy him on this. No, it was simply a need to possess, and now that his immediate fears over her hexing him were gone, that need made itself known more loudly.</p> <p>\u201cOww!\u201d Tam said.</p><p>A second later he was on the ground across the cave, smarting from an energy ball burn. He rubbed his shoulder. They didn\u2019t usually do the fighting thing after the foreplay thing had started. No matter what she said, she liked screwing him too much to interrupt their momentum.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you bite me for?\u201d She wiped the blood off her lip with the back of her hand, looking equal parts hurt and angry, like for a moment she had trusted him. At least within certain perimeters.</p><p>His eyes widened. No. His fangs had come out while he\u2019d been focused elsewhere, but biting her wasn\u2019t the thing that had him panicked. Somehow, he\u2019d drawn his own blood as well. He felt the tiny sting of throbbing pain in his tongue. Had their blood mixed? It wasn\u2019t the traditional ritual. Not like Luc had done.</p><p>Luc had taken a knife to Anna\u2019s hand, then cut his and mixed them together good and proper. He hadn\u2019t hesitated to protect her. Whether his brother had known it would initiate the first stages of the mating ritual, who could say? Surely what Cain had just done wasn\u2019t enough for that level of psychic connection. Yes, he still had free will in all of this, and more or less, so did Tam even if it had worked, but it wasn\u2019t something to cheer about. It was dangerous.</p><p>After all the trouble he\u2019d gone through to protect himself from her, his instincts wanted the opposite. He stood and wiped the sand off him.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think you can start hurting me, just because I can\u2019t hex you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Tam. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>She must have seen the honesty in his eyes, because her anger deflated.</p><p>\u201cI think I just marked you, though. As mine.\u201d</p><p>Though he knew she wanted him, he expected a momentary flutter of revulsion to cross her face, but all he saw was peace. Then all at once it was gone, replaced by suspicion and a fear that seemed strange and incongruous on her face with regards to him.</p><p>\u201cIs this your idea of a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I laughing?\u201d He came closer and licked the last bit of blood off her lip. Her blood was already inside him, and his in her, so there was no sense in leaving a mess behind. What was done was done, assuming it counted as a true mark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I marked you. I just think it\u2019s possible,\u201d he clarified.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you not be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ritual is specific. We don\u2019t do it enough to have experimented with it. You were there with Anna; you know how it goes. But blood was mixed. It might mean something. It might mean nothing.\u201d Why he was being so forthright, he couldn\u2019t say. Maybe he needed someone to reassure him that nothing had happened and things were still the same.</p><p>But something had already shifted, maybe before he\u2019d bitten her, maybe after, but the thing he wanted to do right now wasn\u2019t bend her over a rock and fuck her\u2014oh, they\u2019d do that again, and many other things if he had his way\u2014but right now what he wanted was to make love to her. Even those words make love had him inwardly cringing.</p><p>He shook his hand as if his ring had shorted out, but he knew the truth. It had nothing to do with the ring beyond being able to think a moment without fear of her magic bringing him harm. Now that he held the upper hand and all she had were energy balls, he was looking at her differently.</p><p>But hadn\u2019t that been true from the beginning? He remembered the first time he\u2019d met her. She\u2019d showed up with the cavalry at Anna\u2019s house like a rampaging pixie. He\u2019d wanted to hurt her to get to the woman standing between him and his brother, but she hadn\u2019t come to him when he\u2019d ordered her. No amount of demon thrall could penetrate the walls she had up. Even Anna\u2019s resistance hadn\u2019t impressed him so much. Then Tam had done one better, sending him across the floor with one of her fancy energy balls. From that moment he\u2019d wanted to screw her brains out, possess her, make her cry out his name. She was the first real challenge he\u2019d met in more centuries than he could remember.</p><p>And now here she was, and what had started out as a grudge fuck had become something more.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, space cadet. Are you with me?\u201d Tam said, waving a hand in front of his face.</p><p>He felt the fire light his eyes, and he growled. \u201cShut your mouth and kiss me like you mean it.\u201d Oh yes, he was the king of killing romantic moments. Yet when their lips met, it was more gentle than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cCain?\u201d</p><p>It was a questioning, almost hopeful whimper against his mouth, and at any other moment he\u2019d taunt her for it. Right now he didn\u2019t want to fuck this up. It had been so long since he\u2019d done it, since he\u2019d even experimented for the sake of curiosity. He wanted to know what it felt like to have sex with a woman like in the movies and storybooks, where feelings were involved and it wasn\u2019t just about instinctual urges. He knew this was a dangerous road, but tomorrow he could go back to being a badass. Tomorrow he could leave little handprints and welts all across her ass for making him feel something tonight. For now, he wanted something new: boring, normal sex.</p><p>He gripped the back of her neck, pulling her closer as he explored her mouth, not willing to let her get far enough away from him again to offer commentary. He didn\u2019t bother with demon thrall. No tricks this time. No mental images or manufactured arousal. He wanted to know if she felt something for him without all that. Oh, he was playing with fire.</p><p>The sand beneath their feet was soft enough to lie on, so he picked her up and took her down to the ground with him. He allowed his hands to hover over her, inches above her body to feed\u2014to taste her. She arched off the ground toward him as he moved his hand away. She was his sexual marionette, pulled along by his movements as if she had strings.</p><p>Her nipples hardened underneath her top. She hadn\u2019t bothered with a bra when she\u2019d gotten dressed to come to his tent. He liked the easy access. She began to undo the button on her jeans, but he stilled her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to unwrap you myself.\u201d</p><p>A shiver.</p><p>It seemed like she might protest, trying to reclaim some control of the situation. The way they fucked was the same as the way they fought\u2014a constant power struggle with neither of them willing to cede the upper hand to the other, and neither of them trusting the other. He wouldn\u2019t ask her to trust him because he respected her intelligence more than that. All he wanted was the illusion for a little while.</p><p>Each time he slept with a woman, he wrapped the whole thing up in a pretty illusion for her, a fantasy where it was hard to separate what was actually happening from what was going on in her mind. Just this once, he wanted an illusion for himself\u2014the illusion that someone could love him.</p><p>He struggled with himself over the thought. It was a fight not to flip her over and take her from behind, so she could be just another warm body and not a person he might grow to feel for. Now that they\u2019d gotten this close, staring into each other\u2019s eyes with no words between them and no magic, he wanted to flee.</p><p>Tam reached up and stroked the side of his face. He leaned into the touch. He definitely had to kill her now. If she kissed and told, his rep was over. But not tonight. Cain interlaced his fingers with hers and kissed the back of her hand, his eyes never leaving hers.</p><p>He returned to the task of clothing removal, and she seemed content to watch him. Moments later he was inside her, but not just his body. Their eyes were locked, silencing all their snark for a moment of connection he\u2019d never had and could understand why. It was terrifying.</p><p>To her credit, Tam seemed equally scared. As he moved within her, her mouth sought his again, and then they lost themselves in the sensation as he began to feed.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Tam\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She expected to be up in Stepford Heaven, hanging out with Henry by now, but the hand stroking the short bits of hair from her eyes was Cain\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d she asked. When he\u2019d fed, he\u2019d taken too much\u2014more than usual. After the moment they\u2019d shared where he\u2019d looked like a deer caught in headlights, she\u2019d been sure she was a goner. Whether he wanted her dead or not, she didn\u2019t know, but that look of his had been so stark, she was sure self-preservation instincts alone would allow him to end her.</p><p>In the last moment before she\u2019d lost consciousness, the thought Please, had popped into her head, because somehow with the demon she\u2019d found her will to live again. But she\u2019d said she would never beg him to keep her, and she wouldn\u2019t. Whatever they\u2019d shared, he was still what he was. She was still what she was. She wasn\u2019t young and stupid enough to think this could be something real.</p><p>He may not have used the demon thrall, but he\u2019d given her no less of an illusion. She wouldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t toying with her, taking his game to a new level. He didn\u2019t love her, but some little destroyed piece of her loved him. She looked away, not willing to let him see his small victory shining out from her eyes.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t answered her and didn\u2019t look like he was going to. Well, what had she expected? A love confession?</p><p>\u201cCain!\u201d</p><p>They both turned to the mouth of the cave to see Cole standing there. His gaze flicked over her, trying not to look like he was checking her out, but he was totally checking her out. Jane popped in behind him, caught the once-over, and smacked him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m male,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see me drooling all over Cain,\u201d Jane replied.</p><p>\u201cHey, now. Let\u2019s not get personal,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>He\u2019d subtly moved in front of Tam, tossing her clothing back to her. It was the thing that made her think for the briefest moment that maybe he wasn\u2019t toying with her. Protecting her modesty out of some sense of possession was fairly weird given who he was. And it wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d shrieked and rushed to cover up. What did she care? It was just a body. She didn\u2019t have hang-ups about it anymore. In fact, over the centuries, she\u2019d figured out how to make it look almost exactly how she wanted, even without magic. It wasn\u2019t as if she had tons of opportunities to show the accomplishment off to random people.</p><p>She sighed and pulled the top over her head, then stood and shimmied into her jeans.</p><p>\u201cThis had better be good,\u201d Cain said. \u201cThis is my private space. Jane, maybe you\u2019re too young to understand this, but these caves equal terror for demons. Please start acting scared about it and steer clear if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Jane rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll try to act properly terrified in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, don\u2019t push him. We need him.\u201d Cole turned his attention back to the head incubus. \u201cSun just came up a few minutes ago. You know how we thought he was going to wait until the next full moon to kill the next one? Well, we were wrong. New body, new letter, human media is crawling all over this and Anthony is dead for the day. We thought you\u2019d want to be in on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tam worked to keep her face blank. The full moon was less than a week away. If Jack had jumped the gun, it could only mean one thing. He didn\u2019t want to wait anymore. He was coming for her this month, not next month. She should have known. He wouldn\u2019t form a connection with her in a dream like that if he wasn\u2019t coming soon. He wouldn\u2019t give her the opportunity to get the upper hand. He must have come to her right after he\u2019d killed. The thought sickened her.</p><p>That mouth that had most likely just eaten a human organ, kissing her. She turned away from the group and threw up, unable to fight back the wave of nausea over his lips\u2014even his dream lips\u2014on hers.</p><p>A second later, a hand was on her back. Cain\u2019s. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Now he was showing concern for her in front of others? \u201cFine,\u201d she said, not meeting his eyes. She wasn\u2019t willing to let him see how angry she was with him right now. He\u2019d had his moment to kill her and beat Jack at his own game, but instead of waking up in Heaven, she\u2019d woken right back here, where she was a target for a sadistic serial killer. Gee, thanks, Cain. No, he didn\u2019t love her. He didn\u2019t know what love was. If he had the faintest spark of a genuine human emotion, he would have done the noble thing and spared her from Jack. He had the power to, after all.</p> <p>Their last time together would have been a perfect note to go out on. Peaceful and painless. What stood in front of her now would be anything but. It didn\u2019t matter that they all thought she was safe in the demon dimension. There was no place in existence safe from Jack\u2019s reach. He would find a way.</p><p>No matter what, she wasn\u2019t going to lose her shit right now with Cain and Cole and Jane all standing around, looking at her with concern.</p><p>She just wished she knew why Jack was breaking his pattern. There had to be a reason it was this moon that he had to have her for. It couldn\u2019t be a case of missing her. Gross.</p><p>\u201cCain?\u201d Cole said. \u201cAre you coming with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Tam said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Probably food poisoning from the last crappy food run your minions went on. They have to start feeding me better. I\u2019m not a fucking cat you can just give fake food in a bag.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrowed, but whether or not he was buying the lie, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with them.\u201d</p><p>She needed to figure this out, and she didn\u2019t need anybody hovering over her. She was barely keeping it together now. The last thing she wanted was to get the shakes and Cain be there to see it. The last thing she wanted to see from the demon she was angry with was pity. And she wasn\u2019t about to ask him to fuck her again to kill her. She so was not in the mood right now. Plus, a part of her just wanted to kick his ass at least one more time. It seemed only fair, considering how much he pissed her off.</p><p>When he\u2019d left, she sorted through her bags for the moon chart. She did one each year for the year ahead. It contained not only the moon phases, but planetary alignments and all astronomical anomalies that might affect magical workings. It let her know the best times to do certain workings. She could do magic at any time, but some magic worked better with an extra boost.</p><p>She rolled the parchment scroll out flat. The drawings and notations had been done in a blue pencil. She skimmed to the current month and her mouth dropped open. This full moon would also be the biggest planetary alignment in five centuries. The fact that it was happening on a full moon was even bigger. Maybe she would have noticed if she hadn\u2019t been having a meltdown, but she tended to do each phase of the chart separately. Moon phases, then anomalies, then planetary alignments. By the time she\u2019d gotten to planetary alignments, she hadn\u2019t been thinking about where they were falling, or making the connection with Jack.</p><p>He\u2019d be willing to kill the girl before her on a random day and get less power out of her if he could get his last kill on this particular date. Thinking back, wasn\u2019t the last planetary alignment like this close to when he\u2019d killed his first? Jack was all about magical symmetry.</p><p>It was too late to chase Cain down. He\u2019d be out of the dimension by now. And the last thing she was about to do was stop another demon to say something like \u201cHey, could you be a dear and go grab my demon lover? I really need him to screw me right now for the good of preternatural beings and puppies.\u201d</p> <p>She shoved the scroll and the rest of her books and tools back into the bags and hid them behind the big rock. Then she took the tarot cards with her back to her tent. Something about being out here alone in these caves spooked her now. It was too dark and sinister, and knowing there were demons in the walls wasn\u2019t comforting. She\u2019d much rather be back in her own brightly colored tent with her demon guards.</p><p>When she got back, she sat on one of the large, round pillows on the ground and took the cards from their red, silk wrapping. She closed her eyes and tried to focus, breathing slowly in and out. She wasn\u2019t sure reading her own cards would do her any good, despite Henry\u2019s insistence.</p><p>She needed somebody else who was good at this, but contacting her coven was out of the question. She\u2019d kept them out of it this long, no sense endangering them so close to the end. And the end was coming, she could feel it. Most likely the end for her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ask Anna to do it, either. In the first place, divination wasn\u2019t her gift. Incantations were her thing. It wasn\u2019t that a witch couldn\u2019t have more than one strong gift, Tam had two, but Anna hadn\u2019t been a witch for as long as Tam had. Either way, she couldn\u2019t touch the cards, and you needed physical contact with the deck.</p><p>Tam had just laid out the spread when Anna passed through the curtain in her wispy, ghost-like way.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s future are we looking at?\u201d she asked, hovering.</p><p>Tam knew her friend was trying to be casual, but it fell flat. \u201cMine,\u201d Tam said, grimacing. The cards were much the same as they\u2019d been before she\u2019d fled her house, which meant that running to Cain, or intending to\u2014he\u2019d kind of just showed up on her doorstep\u2014hadn\u2019t changed her future to any great degree.</p><p>There was still the death card, the tower, the lovers, and now judgment, a card that symbolized rebirth and hard and final decisions. The rebirth part was hopeful, at least, but if she had to fall off a tower and die to get there, she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. Henry had told her to follow her heart, and he\u2019d made the quip about young love in the caves, but he couldn\u2019t possibly mean she was meant to be with Cain. Could he? Would that be so bad?</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Anna said.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want the cards to say and what I think Henry means, but I can\u2019t get myself to believe in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it you can\u2019t believe in?\u201d</p><p>Tam let out a deep sigh, knowing before she said it, how this would go. \u201cThat Cain and I are meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>Anna let out a bloodcurdling shriek that had the guard demons darting into the tent to see what the fuss was about.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Anna is just being dramatic,\u201d Tam said.</p><p>The guards didn\u2019t seem to be buying it, but since they\u2019d been asked to guard Tam and not Anna, they went back to their post without a word of comment.</p><p>\u201cYou are insane,\u201d Anna hissed. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t be with Cain. Whatever he\u2019s making you think or feel, it\u2019s an illusion. It\u2019s what he does.\u201d She made a disgusted face. \u201cHe\u2019s done it to me, even. He\u2019s toying with you. He\u2019s not Luc. He\u2019s not going to take you as his mate and love you. That\u2019s not who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that! Jesus, give me a little credit for not being a stupid twit. I didn\u2019t say it was what the cards meant. I said it was what I wanted them to mean. Well, maybe not the mating part. You\u2019re right about that one. Cain won\u2019t mate with anybody. I\u2019m not as good at reading my own future. I\u2019m not unbiased enough. But it seems like Henry thinks it, too, so maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Henry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00e9ance,\u201d Tam clarified. \u201cIn the caves a little while ago. He noticed the thing with me and Cain and commented. He seemed supportive, at least.\u201d</p><p>Anna shuddered, far from comfortable with Tam sleeping with the enemy. Tam couldn\u2019t explain to her that the enemy was the only person she felt safe with and the only time she wanted to be here anymore. If they could have something together, he was someone she could never lose to death. He was solid and forever, and he understood\u2014maybe not the cycling part\u2014but all the rest\u2014the endless continuity of it all. He was old enough that next to him, she didn\u2019t feel like a freak.</p><p>Regular people thought they wanted to remember their previous lifetimes, but if they did, they would be pressed down by the crushing weight of it. Forgetting was a mercy she hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to partake in for far too long. She wanted to drink the cup of forgetting and start over. She wanted a clean slate, but a part of her also wanted Cain, to see where it went, to see if she could be genuinely happy again.</p><p>Maybe when all this was over, if she survived it, they could see where things might lead. It didn\u2019t have to be a forever thing. Maybe they could just have something for a while.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not being faithful to you,\u201d Anna said, as if she could see the wheels in Tam\u2019s head turning. And most likely she could. \u201cHe can\u2019t be faithful to you. He\u2019ll never change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d Tam said. And she really didn\u2019t. She was too old for that silliness.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not care?\u201d</p><p>Tam shrugged. Over the past several years, there hadn\u2019t been many moments where she\u2019d felt completely disconnected from her friend, but this was one of them. How could she explain her general lack of jealousy? She\u2019d been like this for a few centuries now. Jealousy seemed so stupid once enough living time had passed and you\u2019d settled into life in a way a seventy-year lifespan didn\u2019t allow. Average humans saw things in terms of forever when they couldn\u2019t even properly conceptualize that term and \u201ctil death do us part\u201d. But when death never really came for you, as it did for all your lovers, you saw each encounter as more temporary, and the possessiveness and clinging stopped making sense.</p><p>If she had something with Cain, they\u2019d have it until they didn\u2019t, whether or not he was feeding from other women. She looked up to see that Anna was still waiting for a real answer.</p><p>\u201cLook, Anna, you just can\u2019t tie somebody down like that. If they want to be with you, they do. If they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t. If they want to be with you and other people, you can choose to accept it or walk away. I just want somebody who is there, someone who can\u2019t die on me. I don\u2019t care what else they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>If Cain mated with her, it would be only her: it was the price the demon paid. But it was a price Cain never would pay. And she was okay with that. It was nice to know she\u2019d have the option to break the cycle and get out of all this\u2014that she and the demon could have something that didn\u2019t have to be everything. Then they could part and go along their separate courses.</p><p>Though their blood had mingled, she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever go through with it. That had been a weird crazy moment. It was an accident. From what Anna had described of the incubus-human mating ritual, there was no way to do the real thing accidentally. There was no way she\u2019d ever be doing that with Cain. Could she be his part-time concubine? Yes, without question. But Anna wouldn\u2019t understand. She was too different in this way.</p><p>Anna shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t get you. This is just lust. If you\u2019re not jealous... If you could share him and not have a problem with it, it can\u2019t be love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossession and restriction aren\u2019t love.\u201d</p><p>If her pride wasn\u2019t in the way, she\u2019d ask Cain to keep her. He might do it if he knew she wouldn\u2019t tie him down or restrict him. He could still be the badass glutton hunting and feeding like always. She didn\u2019t want him to give up who he was. She just wanted a constant in her life. Maybe he could feel the same way. Maybe they\u2019d have a chance to talk about it when this was over.</p><p>Anna sighed. \u201cCan I at least take this to mean you don\u2019t have a death wish anymore?\u201d</p><p>A small smile. \u201cI think I could stick around a little longer.\u201d</p><p>When Cain finally did get tired of her, and her of him, he could take her out for real and let her start over. She wanted it to be him when the time came.</p><p>Cain hadn\u2019t spoken a word to Jane or Cole as he\u2019d followed them out of the demon dimension and back into the human world to the hive where the Cary Town wolf pack lived. He was too lost in thought. Despite his feigned anger, he was glad he and Tam had been interrupted.</p><p>He was out of good answers for why he kept missing opportunities to kill her. When he\u2019d lost control and taken too much, he\u2019d backed off just soon enough to save her. The fear he\u2019d felt in that moment dwarfed any emotion he\u2019d ever felt. He didn\u2019t want to examine that. The longer he could stay in denial, the happier he\u2019d be.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d come around, he\u2019d gotten himself under control enough to give nothing of his emotional state away. He just didn\u2019t want her gone. Was that a crime? It was okay not to be bored with someone in a week. He wasn\u2019t bored with his brother. He wasn\u2019t bored with his friendships with Daria and Jackson. Why should it be so strange that a woman who shared his bed could interest him in a long lasting way? And if she did, wasn\u2019t that a good thing? He\u2019d been feeling less excited about his demon existence before Tam, everything blending and merging together, no joy in the hunt anymore. He\u2019d been doing it to do it, to prove he still had it. Whatever it was.</p><p>It would be simpler once Jack was destroyed and he could get Tam out of his dimension and back into her own house. But would he be able to get her out of his mind? What excuse would he make to keep coming back? And would he even need to make one? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He snapped back to the present as a computerized code was punched into a panel inside the pack\u2019s network of caves. \u201cWelcome, Cole,\u201d the pre-recorded voice said as the metal door whooshed open.</p><p>The wolves in the main den were unusually silent, watching the news on the big television.</p><p>\u201cThis one is bad,\u201d Cole said, clearly having seen the reports already. It must all be on repeat. Humans liked to do that. \u201cIt\u2019s a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Cain said. The witch must have made an attempt to take herself out like Tam had\u2014before Jack could get to her. She must have failed and restarted a new cycle. Whatever she might look like on the outside, she wasn\u2019t some defenseless street urchin.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s what the humans will think. They see a kid there. They don\u2019t know that\u2019s a two-thousand-year-old magic user. They don\u2019t even believe in magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d A male wolf approached their circle and pushed a button on the remote. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about the last letter and the new letter all day. Mara transcribed it.\u201d The wolf handed a piece of notebook paper with careful block lettering on it to Cole. He read it and then passed the paper to Cain.</p><p>Dear Boss,</p><p>By now deep down people know it\u2019s me. Maybe not everyone, but that will come soon enough when I reveal myself to the world in person. Eleven down, one more to go.</p><p>I\u2019ll take the last one soon, then this bloody and unpleasant mess will be over and the humans will find out what goes bump in the night. I will lead them to freedom. They\u2019ll know I have never been a threat to them, only to that which is unnatural. I will be their savior.</p> <p>Be afraid. Your hunting of humans will end, and I will run this world while you starve in caves and crypts, hiding from the sun. The apocalypse the holy books foretold is drawing near.</p><p>I\u2019m excited for the finale. I hope you are, too.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>The Cycler</p><p>Cain read the letter a couple more times. Even if they succeeded in killing Jack, even if the crazed lunatic wasn\u2019t able to raise an army to carry out his plans, he\u2019d planted the seed. If the humans accepted what they were seeing, the genie was out of the bottle and there was no memory wipe by vampire or demon that could put it back in again. In a way, it was amazing the secret had been kept so well this long with all the security breaches and the magic users, themselves humans. It was bound to come out eventually.</p><p>He looked up as the sound on the television got louder. The protesters were in greater numbers than before, carrying much of the same signs and a few new ones. They demanded that the vampire and demon and werewolf problem be taken care of, calling for the government to admit they\u2019ve been lying and keeping secrets.</p> <p>As far as Cain knew, the human governments had been kept just as much in the dark as every other human, but it was natural to blame those in authority. Several of the protesters wore costumes: vampire fangs, werewolf masks, demon horns. It looked like a cross between a PETA protest, Mardi Gras, and a Halloween party.</p><p>A pretty female newscaster appeared on the screen behind a desk back in the newsroom, her hands clasped in front of her. \u201cWell, Jim, it\u2019s certainly getting heated. This is the most interesting case we\u2019ve had in a long time, though even if he\u2019s not just insane, it\u2019s hard to understand how The Cycler can justify the brutal killing of a child. Certainly that innocent little girl can\u2019t be part of an evil element.\u201d</p><p>The correspondent said something unintelligible that got swallowed up by the crowd around him, while the newscaster maintained her practiced look of sad concern. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jim, you\u2019re breaking up.\u201d She looked straight out into the living rooms of the viewers. \u201cAnd now a look at the polls. We\u2019ve been monitoring nationwide public opinion on this breaking story for the past couple of weeks, and the results of the last poll may startle you. A shocking 56% of Americans believe something supernatural is involved in this case and that The Cycler is telling the truth. 28% believe he\u2019s lying and simply seeking publicity or suffers from mental illness, while the remaining 16% are undecided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about other countries?\u201d Cain asked. \u201cHow do they rank in this sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head. \u201cAbout the same, according to the Internet. We\u2019ll know more tonight at the meeting when Anthony rises and speaks to the other vampire leaders.\u201d</p><p>The channel changed again, and this time it was a talk show with three women dressed in colorful robes, sitting on a stage. A fourth woman, dressed more normally in a chic, black pantsuit, held a microphone out to her guests.</p><p>\u201cMy coven has been practicing real magic for ninety-three years now. That\u2019s how long we\u2019ve been together as a group.\u201d</p><p>The host looked confused. \u201cYou mean your family has a line of witches over several generations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s true also, but I mean me, my coven\u2014the three of us and a few other girls and a couple of guys back home. We\u2019ve been together for close to a century now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d The microphone shook the barest amount.</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible.\u201d The witch held out her hand palm up, and a ball of fire appeared, much like what Cain created.</p><p>The host leaped back, looking terrified, while the cameras panned the audience for a reaction shot.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do this? It could backfire on them,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>Cole shrugged. \u201cThat episode aired two hours ago, they\u2019re re-showing it. The women say they need to come out of the broom closet and that that they don\u2019t know what The Cycler killed, but it may not even be human. It\u2019s been outed as a hoax, though. The network is claiming it was special effects. No one can find the witches again for comments. My guess is someone at the network was threatened by something big and scary and that the witches who talked were killed. I don\u2019t have any evidence of that, of course, but it looked pretty real to me, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Cain nodded slowly. \u201cOh yes, there is no way that was special effects. The way the fire rises out of the palm is exactly how I do it. And why would anybody make a hoax like that over something so serious?\u201d</p><p>The demon paced. He was glad technology didn\u2019t work in his dimension. The last thing he wanted was to be glued to a TV twenty-four-seven, watching latest developments, or watching the old ones replay on a loop.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t matter how much damage control is done. People have got minds of their own. We can\u2019t box this back up,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can,\u201d Jane said. She\u2019d been quiet since they got back. \u201cIf demons and vamps are sent to all major influencers to backpedal on all this... If those influencers believe what they\u2019re saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll it can do is slow things down. Not everybody will believe whatever story we feed them,\u201d the demon said. While it was true that thrall would work on those it was used against, there was no way to create mass thrall. If there were, he\u2019d know about it. The best they could hope for was to control the gatekeepers of the message and hope enough of the population fell in line behind it.</p><p>\u201cA slowdown is better than nothing,\u201d Jane reasoned. \u201cThis shit is going to get ugly, and we all know it.\u201d</p><p>With or without Jack getting to Tam, he was strong enough to lead an army. And he\u2019d gotten the world\u2019s attention. Tam\u2019s power would be the cherry on his sundae.</p><p>Cain sighed. \u201cGo to the penthouse and wake Charlee, if she\u2019s not already up with the baby. See if she can get the vamps in the dark part of the world to get going on this. I\u2019ll get some of my demons working in places where it\u2019s light out. Our numbers aren\u2019t as many, but we may be able to put a cap on it, at least until the meeting tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But Cain wasn\u2019t thinking about information damage control. He was thinking about Tam and how everything was escalating too fast. Either Jack had abandoned full moons altogether, or he\u2019d pushed up his date. It meant less than a week before he\u2019d make his move.</p><p>Cain left without another word. In the demon dimension, some were in, but most were out feeding. It was a lull, if there was such a thing in his world. He gathered as many of his kind together as he could and issued orders, telling them to bring any other demons they stumbled upon, or whose whereabouts they knew, into the plan. Then he headed straight for Tam\u2019s tent.</p><p>He was startled to find Anna there, giving him a look like she knew more than he wanted her to know.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be gone most of the day,\u201d Tam said. \u201cIt sounded like some big mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. It\u2019s underway,\u201d he said. He turned to Luc\u2019s mate, who hovered protectively near Tam as if she could do anything to help or harm anybody in her noncorporeal form. \u201cGet out,\u201d he barked. \u201cI need to speak with Tam alone. Go find your mate, we need him.\u201d</p><p>Anna looked like she was going to argue, but in the end she just gave him a dirty look and left, too scared to defy him, especially without her mate lurking protectively nearby. Smart girl.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Cain said when Anna was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Tam looked wary, which was good, since she wasn\u2019t going to like what he was about to do.</p><p>\u201cWe need to keep you safe. I\u2019m putting you in the caves.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cWhat do you mean putting me in the caves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d she said, flicking her wrist so an energy ball appeared.</p><p>She could be so exasperating.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too drained to fight me. It\u2019s for your own safety just until we destroy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be weeks or months or never. You can\u2019t lock me in there without any food or water. I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly what she meant. She wouldn\u2019t be gone, but she\u2019d start a new cycle. He didn\u2019t find that particularly appealing, but maybe it was a good thing. If she started a new cycle, he could bring himself to kick her out of his dimension more easily when this was all over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you food and water,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you in there long.\u201d</p><p>She threw an energy ball, but he was ready for it. He\u2019d already gone noncorporeal, knowing she\u2019d fight him on this. She was still drained from earlier when he\u2019d taken too much, her magical recovery time slower. He rushed her, going solid and grabbing her arms again before she could form another ball of magic.</p><p>\u201cYou will not win this,\u201d he growled. He scooped her up and carried her out of the tent.</p><p>She kicked and screamed, flailing about, trying to squirm out of his arms. Halfway to the caves she started chanting. He wasn\u2019t picking up all of it but whatever it was, it was nasty. Or it would have been if not for the ring. The magic bounced off him and dispersed into the night, going off like fireworks in the black sky.</p><p>He flipped her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and smacked her on the ass.</p><p>\u201cOww! You cretin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that again,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you forget about the ring?\u201d He was happier than ever he\u2019d thought to have that made. Otherwise, there was no telling what she would have done to him, assuming she had enough energy reserves to do anything right now. It was hard to know. Desperation and adrenaline were funny things in humans.</p><p>\u201cIf you do this, I\u2019ll never forgive you. I\u2019ll fucking hate you forever,\u201d she screamed, still kicking and now pummeling him in the back with her ineffective little fists.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I care?\u201d But he did care. That was the problem. He cared too much about everything. How she felt. Whether she lived or died. He wanted to blame the blood they\u2019d exchanged, and maybe it was partly that, but he\u2019d initiated it. It had come from his possessive nature. She was just his. It wasn\u2019t an idea she was likely to ever warm up to, so initiating another conversation about it seemed pointless.</p><p>She stopped hitting him, but it was only the calm before the storm. She jerked her head up and bit his ear, drawing blood. He couldn\u2019t go noncorporeal again without dropping her and giving her a chance to run, and he was not in the mood for a chase.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Tam.\u201d He flung her down on the ground. \u201cOur blood is already mixed, why don\u2019t you make it worse?\u201d</p><p>She glared up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not locking me in the caves,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI swear, if you do, you will live to regret it. That ring won\u2019t protect you forever. You think I don\u2019t hold a grudge? You think I won\u2019t make it my life\u2019s mission to destroy you?\u201d</p><p>Hmmm, she had a point there. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you safe, like I promised everybody I would.\u201d</p><p>The witch stood, brushing the sand off her pants, then she broke off into a run toward town. Cain put on full speed and ran her down, knocking her in the sand. She struggled to roll over to fight him, and her fingernails caught him in the side of the face. She was one of the dirtiest little fighters he\u2019d ever encountered, not that many women had the good sense to fight him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your promise to me? Your promises are worth shit, Cain. Just take me out. Do it now, so we don\u2019t have to go through this. You\u2019re scared he\u2019ll get to me. You know he will. Just take me out of the equation. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to sleep with you right now? After all this with you biting and clawing?\u201d He eased off her, ready to throw her back down if she tried to move again, but all she did was peel her shirt off and unhook her bra.</p><p>Her voice turned soft and seductive. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Cain. Do you?\u201d</p><p>She was unbelievable and infuriating. He\u2019d just snap her neck but it wouldn\u2019t actually kill her. She was tempting, lying there half naked and flushed in the sand.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d say you liked fucking me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cOf course I like it. Did you not hear all those times I screamed your name?\u201d</p><p>He covered her body with his, his mouth finding her throat, and then he bit down. Hard. She shrieked, not expecting that. He wasn\u2019t going to think about what he was doing or why he just had to mix their blood and make sure it stuck. An internal monologue had started, insisting he mark her in a real way. He didn\u2019t have a knife handy, but he was pretty sure this would work.</p><p>He bit into his own wrist and pressed it against her neck, both to blend more of their blood together and to heal the damage he\u2019d caused.</p><p>She scrambled away when he released her, her hand going protectively to her throat. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou. Are. Mine. Now you\u2019re going to the caves where you\u2019ll be safe, and I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it.\u201d</p><p>She was nearly wiped, but she managed to create another energy ball. Without hesitation, a fireball flared to life in Cain\u2019s hand. He threw it to disarm her. It burnt her arm and knocked her back in the sand.</p><p>When she was down, he picked her up to carry her the rest of the way to the caves.</p><p>There were tears in her voice when she spoke. \u201cI hate you. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this, but I hate you.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what she felt now, some part of him had decided he wasn\u2019t letting her go. She\u2019d get over it. There would be plenty of time to sort out their issues if he could keep her away from The Cycler.</p> <p>When they got to the caves and he\u2019d opened a pod in the wall, she made one last attempt to sway him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cain. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the pain that had started in the center of his chest, right around the region where his heart was supposed to be but probably wasn\u2019t. He shoved her in and tossed her shirt at her, then he sealed the pod.</p><p>The demon started to walk away, but the sound of creaking rock stopped him. He turned back, shocked to find her standing there with her hands on her hips, so much anger simmering in her eyes, he thought they might glow red with fire of their own.</p><p>\u201cIt appears the cave\u2019s magic is incompatible with mine. I\u2019m not a demon or part demon, so I guess it can\u2019t hold me. I never want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>He should have turned back around and walked out. He had work to do before the meeting. There were too many humans in power out there who knew too much. Damage control had to be done. He didn\u2019t have time for this. But instead, he strode toward the witch and pulled her toward him, his mouth finding hers.</p> <p>She resisted at first, but soon enough, she was kissing back, moaning against his lips, her hand sliding down his pants. Sexual heat rose off her without thrall, without him doing anything preternatural to elicit it. He broke away from her mouth and whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see me every day for the rest of your life, and you know it. You want me to fuck you like a bitch in heat, and if you say anything different, we\u2019ll both know it\u2019s a lie. Now go back to your tent and stay there. No wandering until we get this situation under control.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the cave, one of her energy balls hitting him in the back on the way out.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Hadrian stood by the pool on the roof of Anthony\u2019s penthouse. Jack was waiting for him in the forest near the portal point into the demon dimension. They\u2019d discovered it while tracking the werewolf pack alpha. The sun had set less than an hour ago, but it wasn\u2019t quite time for the meeting. Would it look suspicious being up here this early? He adjusted the Roman collar on his clerics.</p><p>The metal door slammed against the brick. Anthony\u2019s dress shoes clicked over the concrete as he reached the conference table. Why he preferred open air meetings, Hadrian had never bothered asking. It seemed strange for a man who otherwise seemed so intense about security.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Charlee?\u201d he found himself asking. He didn\u2019t care where Anthony\u2019s mate was, but making small talk would make him look less nefarious.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room, taking care of the baby.\u201d</p> <p>The vampire king seemed tense. For a moment Hadrian wondered if just taking out the infant would end the police state\u2014even though the idea made him recoil. That child had done nothing wrong, no matter who her father was.</p><p>There was no way to anticipate what was going on with vampires in other countries\u2014how tight the control was\u2014but in the U.S., more magical barriers had started cropping up to keep therians in pens like cattle. Vampires could pass freely\u2014for now\u2014but they were under Anthony\u2019s thumb in other ways, and Hadrian feared that by the end, the vampires would be cattle to the vampire king as well. He\u2019d seen the plans for the vampire barriers in Anthony\u2019s vault.</p><p>Killing the baby wouldn\u2019t change things\u2014not now with Jack involved. There was no turning back, and Hadrian was determined to see this through.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte or the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby.\u201d</p><p>The vampire king shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s as to be expected. Weak. Needs a lot of blood. Sleeps all the time. She\u2019ll have to be protected. Always. Kept out of the sun. Kept away from anything stronger than a human female that might wish to hurt her. She\u2019s got her mother\u2019s physical strength and all of a vampire\u2019s weaknesses. That\u2019s how these things work. I don\u2019t know how long she\u2019ll live. I don\u2019t recall an abomination being allowed to live long enough to find out. She could be effectively immortal, or she could have a human life span. Is it wrong that I\u2019m hoping for the latter? I can\u2019t imagine the stress of worrying about her for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian shrugged. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know, sir.\u201d</p><p>It was clear the vampire king didn\u2019t see his daughter as an abomination, even though he\u2019d used the word. He was prepared to protect his offspring, even if it was against every vampire instinct to let something weak and frail live. But then, Anthony had always had that weakness. He\u2019d been a king mated with a human female.</p><p>Taking humans was still frowned upon. They weren\u2019t considered equals. And yet, Charlee had held her own most of the time. Though many of the vampires who followed her orders probably would have slaughtered her in a heartbeat if not for fear of Anthony\u2019s wrath.</p><p>The two of them stood awkwardly, having exhausted all conversational topics that wouldn\u2019t reveal Hadrian\u2019s contempt for Anthony\u2019s policies. At least the vampire hadn\u2019t pulled out a wallet full of baby photos with cute little fangs popping out of its gums. Vampires couldn\u2019t reproduce like this with other vampires. And there was a reason. It was freakish and disturbing.</p><p>Thankfully they were interrupted by the metal door clanging against the brick. Cole. Hadrian tried not to look anxious. The portal charm was on the werewolf.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jane?\u201d Anthony asked, looking up from the projector. He\u2019d most likely been briefed by guardians on what had been happening while he\u2019d slept. It would be a big meeting tonight with a new death and a greater pressure to come up with ideas on ways to find The Cycler.</p><p>The kill site was different each time. Jack would tease and taunt them, but he\u2019d never give them a chance to find him until he was ready to bring the fight to them.</p><p>The werewolf grunted. \u201cShe\u2019s out doing Cain\u2019s bidding.\u201d</p><p>Anthony arched a brow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Cole flung his jacket over a chair, causing the leather cord from the portal charm to spill out of the pocket. Hadrian\u2019s eyes flicked to it for a moment, but he quickly made his face go bland, pretending to be interested in what Cole and Anthony were discussing, trying to look like it was all news to him.</p><p>\u201cCain is trying to do as much damage control as possible. They\u2019ve been at it all day. Politicians, people with power, news media. The demons have been covering all locations where the sun was out. Vampires hit the parts of the world where it was night. The people have seen what they\u2019ve seen. We can\u2019t stop that, but we can at least set up strong denial and retractions among those in authority to slow it down,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>Even if they wanted to, vampires couldn\u2019t go about during the day. The sun being up nearly killed them, slowing their respiration to almost nothing. It was the moon that resurrected them again. It was a law they couldn\u2019t breech. The best they could do was go underground, or black out their windows and lock their doors and hope no one suspected what they were. More than most preternaturals, vampires were always vulnerable to the truth coming out.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen any of the news since you rose?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was being briefed for the meeting,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cYou probably should.\u201d</p><p>The vampire king followed the werewolf back inside the penthouse. He turned at the door. \u201cHadrian, are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment. I want to read the new letter if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The transparency was already up and ready. Anthony shrugged and went inside.</p><p>Hadrian couldn\u2019t have planned this better. He couldn\u2019t have planned it at all. Cole showing up early, being left with his coat. He thought he\u2019d have to pull off a bump and grab like the pickpockets he\u2019d so often fed from in the alleyways of big cities.</p><p>He took the portal charm and slipped it into his pocket, then stood on the ledge and looked down onto the small alley between the apartments and the next building over. The next building was only four stories, instead of six. As a vampire he could make a four story jump without much trouble. He leaped to the neighboring building, then jumped down into the alley from there.</p><p>When Hadrian reached the portal point in the Cary Town forest, Jack was waiting. He\u2019d created a circle with salt, and lit candles. Incense burned in a censor, and he had a dish with an unidentified herb crushed in it.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d</p><p>Hadrian passed the portal charm to the sorcerer. Jack\u2019s eyes lit as he looked at the circular golden object with runic markings and a dial.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out your secrets, shall we?\u201d He placed the charm on the ground inside the circle and sprinkled it with the herbs in the dish while chanting: \u201cRevelare tuum secreta. Revelare tuum secreta. Revelare tuum secreta...\u201d</p><p>A pure white smoke rose out of the herbs, swirling into runic markings, forming the combination for the charm. The sorcerer stared at it for a few moments, memorizing the symbols and the order they came in, then he brought down the circle and blew out the candles.</p><p>Hadrian stayed out of the way as Jack turned the dial on the disc to the correct combination and a shimmery film appeared\u2014the doorway into the demon dimension.</p><p>Jack tossed the charm to Hadrian, not having any pockets for it himself. \u201cAre you coming? I need you to persuade her out. It\u2019s less fuss that way, if she\u2019ll fall for it. Who knows with her?\u201d</p><p>Hadrian hadn\u2019t looked forward to seeing Tamara again\u2014not under these circumstances. It wasn\u2019t as if the vampire had started with the intent to betray her. He\u2019d been curious and searched for another cycler until he\u2019d stumbled upon Jack in the seventies. The Cycler had been on a break from hunting, but his interest had renewed upon hearing of Hadrian\u2019s encounter with Tam.</p><p>The vamp had known from the beginning the man was crazy, but now, well... they wanted the same things. At least temporarily. They both wanted Anthony out of power. Their similarities in goal ended there, but for now it was enough.</p><p>He stepped through the portal after Jack, into a dimension that felt like a past he wasn\u2019t old enough to remember. Jack stayed a distance away, keeping an eye out for Tam while Hadrian poked his head in tents and wandered. A few demons milled about, but most of them seemed involved in their own activities, wrapped up in the humans they\u2019d brought back with them. One of them stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your business here?\u201d the demon asked, suspicion in his eyes.</p><p>Hadrian looked around him, but Jack had slipped between a couple of tents out of view. The vampire pulled out the portal charm. \u201cCain sent me. I need to speak with Tam. It\u2019s of an urgent matter regarding the investigation.\u201d</p><p>The demon made a face at the mention of the blonde witch. \u201cShe\u2019s one street over, about halfway down, in a purple tent with two demon guards outside. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d He turned and went off in the other direction.</p><p>The vampire wasn\u2019t sure if Jack had heard all of that, but he followed the directions to the tent. He had to go through the same explanation with the guards to let him pass.</p><p>Tam looked up, startled, when he entered.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You still wear the same clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cI may be old, but my memory isn\u2019t shot.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian chuckled. It was regrettable that this woman had to be in the middle of all this. He\u2019d promised to keep her secret, and now he was working directly with the man she\u2019d been running from, the one she\u2019d thrown herself at Hadrian\u2019s fangs once to avoid. He just hadn\u2019t been old enough or strong enough to kill her for good.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you working for him? I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d betray me this way. What have I done to you?\u201d The calmly spoken words caught him off guard.</p><p>So much for convincing her and luring her away. Still, he made an attempt at a lie. \u201cCain needs you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. He would have come for me himself. He never would have sent someone, and he wouldn\u2019t want me to leave the dimension. He was insistent about that point. Your face lies. Even without using magic I can see your guilt. Do you think I\u2019ve existed this long while being repeatedly duped by those with bad intentions? Tell me why. I deserve that much.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t tell her. All he could do was yell for backup. \u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>She tossed an energy ball at him. Hadrian dodged it. He heard Jack outside the tent, chanting, no doubt incapacitating her demon guards. Tam raised her arms and started her own chant. \u201cJack!\u201d Hadrian shouted, not sure what the witch was about to do to him, but not wanting to find out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBite her!\u201d Jack yelled from outside.</p><p>Hadrian rushed her, going for her throat, but a field of some kind forced him back.</p><p>The witch looked shocked like she hadn\u2019t expected that. Her hand went to her throat, but not the side he\u2019d tried to bite. The other side. Before he could figure out what was going on, Jack entered the tent.</p><p>Tam began to hyperventilate, but managed to push past her fear to conjure an energy ball.</p> <p>\u201cCome now, Tam. You know that\u2019s not going to hurt me. It\u2019ll only piss me off. You know how strong I\u2019ve gotten over the years\u2014we\u2019ve had our little meetings. I could have killed you at any one of them. I could kill you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do it, then. I\u2019m not afraid of death.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and looked around him at her surroundings. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t appear that you are. But you know my purposes can\u2019t be served that way. Go open the portal, Hadrian, the one we talked about. I\u2019ll be right behind you with the girl.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian, not wanting to be more involved than he had to be, left to carry out the order. The vampire walked at a normal pace, trying not to draw attention to himself, until he reached the portal point Jack had found during his dream connection with the witch.</p><p>As soon as Jack was through the portal, Hadrian would go back to his resting place. It might be daylight where The Cycler was going, and even if it wasn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t trust the guy. When the sun rose and he was helpless, his usefulness was over.</p> <p>Jack finally showed up, the girl slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Although Tamara had been scared and was no match for Jack, who\u2019d been collecting powers and additional strength with each kill for centuries, he\u2019d still managed to incapacitate her much faster than the vampire would have bet on.</p><p>\u201cI punched her. You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d waste magic did you? First rule of magic users, Hadrian: at the end of the day, we\u2019re still humans with human frailties. Why waste magic when you can just knock one out? Why do you think I told you to bite her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that...\u201d the vampire didn\u2019t know what to make of bouncing off her like that. Whatever she\u2019d done, it hadn\u2019t affected Jack.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me a boring story right now,\u201d The Cycler said. \u201cI\u2019m tired, and we\u2019ve got what we came for. Let\u2019s go before our luck runs out.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian turned the disc on the charm to the runic combination that had appeared in the smoke earlier. The doorway opened, and Jack passed through with Tam. The vampire backed away and the shimmery film closed, leaving Hadrian safe with the portal charm that would take him back home.</p> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Cain was running late for the meeting. He\u2019d stopped to feed\u2014anything to take his mind off the absolute possession he felt toward the blonde witch in his dimension. Was this what Luc had felt with Anna? If so, he finally understood why all his warnings against it had meant nothing. This time, when he fed, he hadn\u2019t been able to kill the woman.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop seeing Tam\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how disappointed she\u2019d be in him and how much she\u2019d equate him with Jack if he took another innocent life.</p><p>When he reached the penthouse, Anthony and several of the others were already on the roof, but they were still waiting for Dayne and Greta and the vampire-priest guy. What was his name?</p><p>As Cain reached the table, Cole said, \u201cI still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Anthony rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure Hadrian went hunting. He knows what time the meeting is. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian. That was his name.</p><p>Charlee came up to the roof then with a small bundle all swaddled up. Anthony kissed his mate\u2019s forehead when she reached him.</p> <p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said.</p><p>The human shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to sleep during the days. She just goes... dead. Do you know how terrifying that is for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, now. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s what happens to all vampires. She can\u2019t stay up during the day. It\u2019s just the sun. When the sun sets she always wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t? Watching your baby in her crib barely breathing is unsettling. Haven\u2019t you heard of SIDS?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped her in his arms and held her for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to try to sleep today. You can\u2019t keep going on like this. Sit.\u201d He pulled out a chair for her.</p><p>As she settled into it, the metal door clanged against the brick wall and everybody\u2019s head turned to it. The baby started crying. Charlee glared, trying to settle her back down.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Greta said when they reached the table. She was so out of breath and flustered, her words came out in broken stutters and pants. \u201cD-Dayne\u2019s been working on spells to figure out something that was taken from our memories. I-it\u2019s Hadrian. He\u2019s working with Jack. W-we did a spell on one of the victim\u2019s blood and we saw him, but Hadrian took our memories, mine with a spell he forced Dayne to make, and Dayne\u2019s with thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d Dayne said, reaching Greta\u2019s side. \u201cHe\u2019s a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want our secrets revealed?\u201d</p><p>Cole growled. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t like what a control freak you are.\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes glowed red. \u201cLike The Cycler is any better?! Does nobody care that I want to keep us all safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d They all yelled in unison.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop yelling, you\u2019re upsetting the baby,\u201d Charlee said.</p><p>Their voices drifted past Cain as a dead calm came over him. \u201cEverybody shut the hell up. When was the last time anybody saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the meeting,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe were up here talking. Anthony and I went inside to watch the newscasts he slept through. Hadrian said he\u2019d be right behind us, but never came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your portal charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my coat over there.\u201d Cole\u2019s face turned white. \u201cHow could I know...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust check for it,\u201d Cain said, not in the mood for apologies or denials.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>It was an unnecessary statement. They\u2019d all known it would be gone even before Cole had moved to check his jacket pockets.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did all this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour or so,\u201d the wolf said.</p><p>Jane arrived then along with Luc and Anna, the metal door against brick announcing their arrival. Nobody but Charlee seemed capable of opening that door without banging it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Cain said, still maintaining the calm. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care. He had plans to torture the life slowly out of anyone who stood between him and Tam. His calm was due to his certainty that bodies would drop and enemies would suffer.</p><p>\u201cWe did damage control as best we could,\u201d Jane said with a shrug. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see how it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back home and find out if Tam has been taken. If she hasn\u2019t, take her to the caves and guard her there. I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were using her. You don\u2019t give a shit about anything that happens to her,\u201d Anna said, mistaking his calm mask for indifference.</p><p>\u201cGO!\u201d he said.</p><p>Luc grabbed her arm and steered her toward the exit before Cain lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cLucien?\u201d</p><p>Luc turned. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need heavy duty chains installed in the caves, and the setup we do for a vampire. Can you take care of that for me?\u201d</p><p>The other demon nodded. Jane followed them out.</p><p>Cain turned to the sorcerer. \u201cCan you locate the vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d Charlee said.</p><p>Cain turned to Anthony\u2019s mate, an eyebrow raised, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t trust anybody. I don\u2019t see why he\u2019d trust The Cycler any more. He\u2019d go to his normal resting place if he could get there. He doesn\u2019t stay with us at the compound. He stays at the Catholic church near the woods. In the basement.\u201d She passed the baby to Anthony, who couldn\u2019t quite figure out how he should be holding it, while she wrote down directions for Cain.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be too risky to go there now? After his betrayal?\u201d the demon asked.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I know,\u201d Charlee said.</p><p>Cain took the slip of paper and turned back to the sorcerer. \u201cTry to do that spell, anyway. If he\u2019s not here, I need a backup. Cole, go back to the hive and get another portal charm, I want everyone here to meet up in my dimension in one hour. No later. If Tam has been taken, we have to move on this.\u201d</p><p>Anthony cleared his throat. \u201cExcuse me, but I believe I\u2019m in charge.\u201d</p><p>Cain rolled his eyes. \u201cYou gave up that right when you let a traitor into the ranks. I\u2019ve played along with your king-of-the-hill routine for expediency, and mainly because I really didn\u2019t care that much when we started, but I\u2019m running this show now. Do you have a problem with that? In a couple of days, The Cycler is going to kill her and put his plan in motion to enslave us all. Would you like to run an election to see which one of us should lead, or will you let someone with a little more life experience take over?\u201d</p><p>The vampire king growled but backed down. \u201cFine,\u201d he said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Cain didn\u2019t wait for Cole\u2019s agreement. He knew the wolf was on board. After all, Jane was already headed back to the demon dimension. He\u2019d want to get back to his mate as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Anthony, I need you to come with me to collect your traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>The demon shrugged. \u201cYou seem to think you\u2019re the biggest badass here, and I can\u2019t get into a church. Besides, I thought you\u2019d want some personal time with the rogue priest, considering he\u2019s made a bigger fool out of you than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>The vampire king glared, but finally conceded. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t kill him. I have a lot of aggression to get out,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>The two of them shared a smile for the first time. Despite their rocky beginnings, Cain could see promise in him, even if he was a half-breed.</p><p>Cain hated that he had to rely on a vampire to get Hadrian out of the church. It was complete bullshit that a vampire was allowed inside, but a demon wasn\u2019t. The tiny sliver of shiny human inside the vampire made him still okay? Still acceptable in the eyes of the man upstairs? Cain snorted in disgust. Anthony was every bit as evil as he was. Probably more.</p><p>\u201cHave something you\u2019d like to share with the class?\u201d Anthony asked.</p><p>\u201cJust go get him.\u201d</p><p>The vampire shrugged and went inside. Cain stood by the door, hating that he couldn\u2019t go in there and kick an ass yet. There was a chance Anthony could end up on the wrong end of the stake, then what? Or Hadrian could. Then they were out the one informant that could possibly help them find Tam before it was too late.</p><p>He felt the stirrings of an emotion he hadn\u2019t felt in awhile. Guilt. What if she hadn\u2019t been taken yet? What if she was fighting for her life, and here he was staking out the vampire priest\u2019s church like an imbecile?</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Anthony had an unconscious Hadrian in his arms. \u201cHe won\u2019t stay out for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need long.\u201d The portal point was only a few blocks away.</p><p>Cain stood over Hadrian, his anger and fear for Tam simmering underneath a mask of calm indifference. But he wouldn\u2019t show any of that to his captive. On the surface he would be cold, empty. He had to maintain control for Tam\u2019s sake.</p><p>The vampire priest slumped in a set of chains, still unconscious. The demon looked over at the table filled with instruments of torture. Something inside him jumped with glee over the idea of having not only a half-breed, but a former holy man in shackles. It\u2019s not about that. Remember why you\u2019re here.</p><p>Hadrian opened his eyes slowly, swaying a little as his feet sunk into sand. His gaze darted around the cave, the smallest hint of fear in his expression when he saw the demon. He tugged at the chains, but they held strong. Luc had done a good job installing them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you rejoined us. I\u2019ve got some good news and bad news. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the same news,\u201d Cain said. \u201cHere in the demon dimension, you can\u2019t go dead for the day. So if you thought you just had to hold out a few hours before you got a break from me, sorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>He felt the demonic fire burn in his eyes and he rolled right into the only question that mattered. \u201cWhere is Tam?\u201d</p><p>Hadrian looked at the ground, his jaw set in determination.</p><p>\u201cHey, I love torturing people. I don\u2019t get to do it enough. You see, most of my time is spent in a pretty woman\u2019s bed seducing the life right out of her. It\u2019s a bit more low key than what I\u2019ve got planned here. You can imagine my excitement over the change of pace. I like to be gentle with the ladies, you see. So I\u2019ll ask again nicely. Where\u2019s Tam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Jack,\u201d Hadrian said. It earned him a hard punch in the jaw.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be clever. I\u2019m sure the difficult task of thinking is a strain. You\u2019re obviously not very bright to do what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Cain wanted to shred the vampire like paper, peeling strips of skin off one at a time. The vampire would probably survive it. It would be interesting to find out.</p><p>Hadrian looked up. \u201cOh really? Because what I\u2019ve done is going to end Anthony\u2019s control. Do you know he had plans in place to put up barriers vampires couldn\u2019t cross without permission? Not just therians. And after that, do you think he would have left you and the rest of the demons alone? Anthony likes control. He likes to keep tabs on everybody and have tags and numbers on them so he knows exactly where they are at all times. Excuse me for not wanting to be a lab rat. I thought this vampire gig was supposed to mean freedom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Jack would do the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Jack could do the same. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with him. He\u2019s too crazy to be that organized. That\u2019s the point. I knew he was a nutter the second I met him. Why do you think it\u2019s taken him so long to take out his coven? Do you really think he\u2019s got the mastermind genius to be a threat over the long haul? Anthony is the real threat. The most important thing is to destabilize his control. Even if the cost is the humans finding out.\u201d</p><p>Cain nodded. If Tam wasn\u2019t involved, he might be on Hadrian\u2019s side. But she was involved. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree about Anthony. Unfortunately, you helped take something that belongs to me and I\u2019m very possessive. Demon occupational hazard.\u201d</p><p>The vampire rolled his eyes upward. \u201cOh my God. You think you\u2019re in love with her. That\u2019s what this big torture sequence is all about. It has nothing to do with being on Anthony\u2019s side or stopping a mad man. You just want the girl.\u201d</p> <p>It was the wrong thing to say. It was too much truth. The demon ripped the fabric covering Hadrian\u2019s torso, tearing away the Roman collar with it. He smiled at the expanse of bare flesh he was about to destroy. He wondered if the vampire would scar. Time for more cutting and less talking.</p><p>He turned to his table of blades and clamps and spikes and crosses, trying to decide what to use first. It allowed him a moment turned away from the vampire to reign in his emotions and push the firey glow from his eyes. He had to stay cold for this. If he lost control he\u2019d kill the vampire and never get to Tam in time. Finally, when his breathing was back to normal, he chose a thin, sharp blade. Jagged would hurt more, but he had plenty of time to get to that.</p><p>He pressed and dragged the point across Hadrian\u2019s skin, slicing it like a ripened tomato. The skin flayed open, red spilling out. The vampire hissed, but that was far from the worst Cain had.</p><p>\u201cSomething I\u2019m interested in,\u201d the demon said conversationally, \u201cis what holy water does to a priest turned vampire. I know what it does to a vampire, but perhaps you\u2019re immune. You do still wear your clerics, after all. Surely, living and sleeping in that church, you\u2019ve gotten curious. Maybe dipped a finger in just to see? I know I\u2019m curious, so let\u2019s answer the big question on everybody\u2019s minds.\u201d</p><p>Hadrian let out a howl as Cain poured the water into the cut he\u2019d just made. Smoke rose off the vampire, sizzling like an egg frying on pavement.</p> <p>\u201cOne less mystery of life to unravel,\u201d the demon said. \u201cReady to chat yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hadrian said between gritted teeth. \u201cYou may as well just kill me.\u201d</p><p>The demon laughed. \u201cAs if that\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ll never kill you. I\u2019ll keep you alive and torture you slowly and painfully until you talk. If you never talk and Tam dies, it\u2019ll turn into vengeance, and you don\u2019t want to see that side of me. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>If it came to that, he might even lose interest in feeding, only doing it often enough to survive. Hurting the vampire who\u2019d taken Tam away from him would become his new obsession.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I didn\u2019t want to hurt Tam. I just wanted to stop Anthony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth nothing,\u201d Cain shouted.</p> <p>Hadrian shuddered and jerked in the chains as the demon pressed a silver cross against his chest. Part of Cain was disturbed his reaction was so strong to the witch being in trouble, but he shoved it down. The witch was his. That alone was enough to torture the filth who\u2019d taken her.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Tam groaned as she struggled to sit up, her eyes still shut against the light. She felt like she had a hangover. A cup of water was pressed into her hands as another hand stroked through her hair. For the briefest moment, she felt safety as she gulped the water gratefully down\u2014until she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might sleep right through the full moon.\u201d</p><p>Jack.</p><p>She recoiled from his hand, fighting to keep the water down.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou loved me once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you became a psycho,\u201d Tam said. The power he\u2019d absorbed from murdering the members of his coven was beginning to take a toll on him. You couldn\u2019t make up crazy like this. His eyes were wild and a little unfocused. Unpredictable. While intellectually she knew she had a couple of days before he killed her, maybe time enough to find a way to escape... with Jack, you just couldn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Despite the moon coming and its ritual significance and the kind of power boost it would give him to drain the blood from the last remaining cycler on that night, he could lose his shit and kill her at any time.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where it ends?\u201d Her voice was hoarse when she spoke. That was the fear coming out. Yes, she\u2019d wanted out, but not like this, not the way Jack was going to do it. Beyond the coming pain of the experience, it twisted her stomach to think he\u2019d done this to her sister.</p><p>She should have known this would be where he\u2019d take her. It was the cavern where the original ritual had been performed. If she\u2019d been hidden anywhere but the demon dimension, Jack would have had to work harder to get her here. Irony was a bitch.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed poetic,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat could be more powerful than completing the cycle here? You\u2019ll die in the same place you were reborn. I saved you for last because I thought you\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Tam grimaced. \u201cYou saved me for last because you\u2019re obsessed with me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMaybe just a little. I\u2019d still give it all up for you. I\u2019m strong enough. When I die, I come back an adult now. With you, I might not be killable at all. Or I might die for only a few minutes at a time. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d like to find out, but I\u2019ll keep you around. You just have to say the word. We could rule this place together.\u201d</p><p>She sat on a stone altar\u2014a moat had been dug around it in the ground. They were beside the water where they\u2019d found that stupid immortal jellyfish. It had been foolish trying to become gods. They\u2019d thought keeping the same form, remembering everything, would be a blessing, would give them power. But in the end, all it had been was a curse that had slowly eaten away at her sense of what it meant to be human.</p><p>She stood and jumped over the moat. Jack didn\u2019t try to stop her. He just backed out of her way, giving her space to wander.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve brought some food for us.\u201d</p><p>Tam\u2019s head whipped around, trying to figure out if he was kidding, but he seemed sincere. For the moment, his fantasies of world domination and ultimate power must have taken a backseat to his fantasies of riding off into the sunset. Lucky her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go get it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack disappeared down a dark path that she knew led to the entrance of the cavern. No sense in trying to escape, yet. He\u2019d gone toward the only exit.</p><p>As she paced, she tried to think of how to play it. Could she stomach seducing him after what he\u2019d done to her sister?</p><p>Probably not. But if she could... wouldn\u2019t it buy her an opportunity to get away? He might drop his guard if he was thinking about their future together, instead of eating her internal organs. Such a fine line with him.</p><p>Then what? She was back to running, stuck in this form. But she could get back to Cain. It was odd that should be her thought. Shouldn\u2019t she want free of him? She put her hand against the mark he\u2019d left on her throat with his fangs. It tingled when she touched it.</p><p>She wanted to believe it was just their blood connection that made her feel this way, but she\u2019d felt it before their blood had exchanged, and she still felt like she had a choice\u2014even now. Being with Cain wasn\u2019t some magical foregone conclusion, and she was sure it was the same from his end. They weren\u2019t drone-like slaves. The mark hadn\u2019t been in effect long enough. And anyway, he\u2019d initiated it.</p><p>She wondered if she\u2019d start getting the dreams Anna had gotten with Luc. Seeing into Cain\u2019s past was a prospect that both intrigued and terrified her, but the bond was still so new, and it hadn\u2019t been done like Anna\u2019s had. Perhaps she wouldn\u2019t dream at all.</p><p>With regards to the demon, she was torn. At times, Cain seemed oddly normal, but then, she knew how that worked, how one hid their age and tried to pick up on the current trends of the times to blend in. If they both dropped the affectations they\u2019d picked up over the centuries, they\u2019d be like a couple of old fossils. Nobody else would understand them. And wasn\u2019t that what she liked about him? That they were like the last two members of a secret club that had found each other long enough to do the secret handshake?</p><p>She was still angry with him for trying to lock her up in the caves. For her protection or not, it was a shitty thing to do. She thought about the tarot spread again. Maybe she was meant for Cain and he for her. It didn\u2019t matter now. It was too late. And no matter what she wanted to be true, she couldn\u2019t decide if he was toying with her or not. As long as he\u2019d been around and resisted settling down, he must have figured out all possible permutations of mind games.</p><p>What he said and what he meant could be opposite things. Even what he did and the intention behind it could be that way. Her experience with Jack had killed her optimism for men. She just didn\u2019t want to be some stupid girl waiting for Cain to ride up full of self-righteous vengeance to sweep her away like a fairy tale. It wasn\u2019t like they had the big epic love. Ninety percent of their time together had been a grudge fuck\u2014or a power struggle, using sex as the weapon they had both learned to wield.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>Tam jumped, too lost inside her head to hear Jack\u2019s return. His voice came out soft and needy, like he was still planning a white picket fence and evil babies. Even the idea of seducing him\u2014even if it would take her back to Cain, and even if Cain wanted her back\u2014made her skin crawl like little ants.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she replied. My demon lover seemed like the kind of answer that would get her spleen ripped out in short order. Because no matter how sane and puppy-like he seemed this second, things could shift at any time.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s something.\u201d He moved toward her and put a hand on her arm, closing his eyes.</p><p>She tried to pull away, not sure what he was doing, but then she remembered one of the coven\u2019s witches had seen visions when they touched things or people. But it was too late for Tam to stop her thought train or get away from him.</p><p>His expression was closed and cold when he opened his eyes. \u201cI see.\u201d The jealousy over no doubt seeing her in the demon\u2019s arms was only barely concealed beneath the surface. \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ve made your choice. You\u2019ve ripped out my heart, Tam. Do you know that? So I think I\u2019ll eat yours when the moon is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt meant nothing,\u201d Tam said, taking an instinctive step back. The moment she said it, she knew how deep the lie ran. And so did Jack.</p><p>\u201cSave it, you little whore. I knew you\u2019d been with others, but this... a demon? And you think to judge me? At least I\u2019m still human.\u201d</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t been human for a long time.</p><p>She wanted to throw an energy ball at him so badly she could barely contain it, but escalating to that kind of violence with a sorcerer much stronger was too foolish even for her short temper. Instead, she used words.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re kidding. You\u2019ve violently murdered all our friends, the only people who understood who and what we are because they were the same, and you think I\u2019m the bad one for having a little sex, no matter who the partner was?\u201d</p><p>Even if she\u2019d thought to play the role of seductress to get out of this mess, and even if Jack wouldn\u2019t be onto her game, she\u2019d lost her stomach for it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she defended her actions. He was treating her like she\u2019d betrayed him, like she\u2019d cheated on him. Apparently her leaving him hadn\u2019t been a strong enough indicator that they\u2019d broken up.</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019re not a couple,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot now, we aren\u2019t. Until about three minutes ago, I still thought it could work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re delusional. You killed my sister! You killed nearly all my friends. You thought I was going to roll over and cuddle with you after that?\u201d</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes. \u201cYour lover is a killer, too. He\u2019s killed more women than you could count.\u201d There was still the note of jealousy in his voice, like he wanted to play some martyr role. Like he was the victim in all this and somehow the good guy.</p><p>\u201cYou chose power over me, Jack. You think I don\u2019t know Cain has killed? You think I\u2019m stupid enough to whitewash it? I know what he is, but I also know he\u2019s not human. It\u2019s what he has to do to avoid suffering.\u201d The demon couldn\u2019t really die, after all, just starve and suffer indefinitely if he went on a hunger strike. \u201cYou had a choice. Besides, Cain hasn\u2019t killed anybody I love.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel like getting into the grayness of the Anna situation. Since Anna had come back as Luc\u2019s mate, and Tam hadn\u2019t really lost her, and Cain hadn\u2019t had completely evil motivations, she tried to just skirt right around that issue. Either way, it wasn\u2019t like what Jack had done to her sister, or the rest of their coven for that matter.</p><p>Part of her wished Jack would just go ahead and kill her to spare her and get it over with so they wouldn\u2019t have this stupid argument like an old married couple for the next two days. That might be even more painful and annoying than the ritual.</p><p>Cain stepped out of the caves, wiping Hadrian\u2019s blood off his hands. The vampire had lasted longer than he\u2019d expected, nearly a human day. He hadn\u2019t killed him, even though Hadrian had finally given up the information he needed. He wanted to leave him to suffer more. And if Tam didn\u2019t survive, he wanted to start on him again. He tried to shut out that possibility. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The others were waiting impatiently when he got back into town. Greta had fallen asleep curled up next to Dayne, and a few of the others seemed like they were about to drop as well. About a hundred of his demons were gathered, waiting for word. Among them were Daria and Jackson, several of the demons who had guarded Tam, and some who apparently didn\u2019t think she was all that bad. Either that, or they understood the value of stopping Jack before the world slipped into complete chaos.</p><p>Cain cleared his throat, and a few of those who had been snoozing sat up. \u201cI\u2019m going to need everybody to rest or feed. Whatever you need to do to replenish. The vampire finally gave up Jack\u2019s location as well as other information. I was very persuasive. We\u2019re going in tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night? Why not now?\u201d Anna demanded. \u201cLuc, are you going to let him...\u201d</p><p>Luc shook his head at her in warning, and Cain continued, used to the woman\u2019s histrionics by now. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight him before tomorrow night. He has to start the ritual. It\u2019ll be his one weak moment when he\u2019s absorbing her power. He\u2019ll be unable to defend himself, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll all strike.\u201d</p> <p>He worked to keep his face indifferent. It had become exhausting wearing this mask. Jack might not kill her before the full moon, but he could be doing anything to her in the meantime. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what The Cycler might like to do with his former lover. And Cain couldn\u2019t stop him from hurting her. He\u2019d lose the battle and the war if he did. Still, the demon wanted nothing more than to blaze in and rip the bastard\u2019s head off.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019ll be so weak, why does it take us all?\u201d Anthony snarked, not happy with having to play the minion role.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take any chances? We\u2019re going to go in and annihilate him. I don\u2019t do losing. We have plenty of firepower to bring him down, but it\u2019ll take a lot to kill him. There are only two ways they die for real, by the hand of one of their own, or by a very strong and old preternatural being, using their power. I can throw a bunch of fire at him, but I can\u2019t actually do him in. Do any of you girl demons want to fuck him?\u201d</p><p>They all made faces. It was just as well. As strong as The Cycler had become, odds were bad any of his succubi could successfully do it, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo that means I\u2019m going to need demons to throw distractions at him, vampires to drain him, and magic users to block him. He\u2019ll be weaker during the ritual, but he won\u2019t be dead. I don\u2019t want to make the mistake of underestimating him. This whole time he\u2019s led us around on a leash, not worrying we\u2019d catch or stop him. I\u2019m tired of games.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony looked like he was going to protest again, but instead he sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll gather some vamps and my magic users.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t need us?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us,\u201d Cain said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need any shifters in this fight. Therians can stay out of this if they like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jane?\u201d</p><p>The demon knew Cole wouldn\u2019t stay behind if his girl was fighting, and werewolves might get in the way this time. Jane was young anyway. \u201cShe can sit this one out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay at the penthouse until we get back,\u201d Dayne said to his werecat.</p> <p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d Greta said. \u201cBut be careful. Don\u2019t be on the front lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make promises,\u201d the sorcerer said.</p><p>In reality, Cain\u2019s plan was probably overkill, but he was taking no chances when it came to Tam. He\u2019d given up pretending he didn\u2019t have feelings for her. He\u2019d deal with that\u2014or go back to denial\u2014when she was safe. He was sure they\u2019d have a screaming match later to make everything feel normal again.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The light from the full moon shined down on Tam through the opening at the top of the cavern. Jack had tied her down and was getting all his carving tools and magical accoutrements ready.</p><p>He looked up at the light pouring in from the opening. \u201cJust like old times.\u201d He whistled a jaunty tune as he lined up his knives. \u201cI would say \u2018this won\u2019t hurt a bit,\u2019 but there should be honesty between us in these last moments. Don\u2019t you think, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Tam gathered saliva in her mouth and spit on him as he walked past. He just laughed.</p><p>\u201cNice try. But we\u2019ve made it this long without killing each other, I intend to get the most out of this ritual by doing it right. The moon only needs to move another fraction and we\u2019ll be ready to begin.\u201d He was more chipper than she\u2019d seen him since he\u2019d taken her. For the most part up until this point, he\u2019d kept her well fed, keeping her in a cage while she slept, but mostly he\u2019d just watched her with disgust and glared\u2014still not over the demon lover thing.</p> <p>She\u2019d hoped she\u2019d dream about Cain, but no dreams had come. Did that mean they weren\u2019t meant to be? Maybe it hadn\u2019t been long enough since he\u2019d done it. Maybe her shields were blocking it. Maybe he\u2019d done it wrong and they really had no true bond. She didn\u2019t know why it mattered so much to her, but she hadn\u2019t dreamed at all. There had been no respite while with Jack. Maybe he was keeping Cain\u2019s dreams away from her out of his own jealousy.</p><p>Would dreams have been better or worse? Was there a softer side of Cain she could have seen? Hadn\u2019t she started to see it already?</p><p>She cringed as Jack put a hand on her arm. \u201cStay with me, Tam. No thinking about your boyfriend. He\u2019s a demon. He doesn\u2019t care what happens to you. Here\u2019s how it will go. I\u2019ll make a few small incisions so we can get a good blood drain going, then I\u2019ll start the chant. Once I\u2019ve absorbed all the magic I can, I get to start carving and eat something. You\u2019ll probably be alive for at least part of that. Sorry. It\u2019s just how these things must go, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look the least bit sorry.</p><p>She winced as he took a small knife and started to make little cuts down her arms, legs, and torso. This was really happening. A part of her hadn\u2019t believed it would. Somehow, something or someone would stop it. Another burst of anger surged through her at Cain for letting this happen\u2014for not killing her when he had the chance.</p><p>Once the blood started flowing, Jack raised his arms. His voice echoed off the cavern walls, drowning out the falling water nearby as he chanted. The chant was complicated and long, and at the rate she was losing blood, she wasn\u2019t grasping it all, already starting to feel a bit woozy from blood loss.</p><p>She lurched off the stone as she felt the magical pieces that made her who she was start to detach from her and go to Jack. It was what made her angriest of all.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d she shouted at him, knowing she couldn\u2019t stop him from killing her, but hoping she could at least distract him enough to make his ritual less successful. If he\u2019d had a brain in his head he would have put tape over her mouth for this. But maybe he\u2019d wanted her to whimper and beg. Maybe he\u2019d wanted to give her one last chance to try to convince him to spare her and run off together. She wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of either outcome.</p><p>Loud footsteps came through the cavern, and hope blossomed inside her. She turned her head toward the opening to see Cain. He looked angry when he saw her, so angry even she would have feared him.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d the demon growled.</p><p>The growl threw Jack off the tiniest bit in his chanting, but then he went back to it. When he finished, he sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to save her. I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Tam\u2019s eyes widened as demons fanned out around the perimeter, throwing fireballs in Jack\u2019s direction. He deflected them easily with his magic, and then put up a barrier to protect himself from the fire. Her heart sank. If this was all they had... But the demons kept throwing the fire, lighting up the inside of the cavern like fireworks until the barrier began to weaken. Next, a group of vampires came in and swarmed on the distracted Jack, fangs piercing all exposed expanses of flesh and ripping clothing away to expose more.</p><p>The demons stood back and let them feed, weakening him, though Tam wasn\u2019t sure if any of them were old enough to kill him. She might be able to, since she was a cycler, but given her weakened state, that seemed unlikely.</p><p>Magic users filed in next. A dark-haired man came near her to start his group chant while other magic users were distributing appropriate herbs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love what I\u2019ve come up with for you,\u201d he said to Tam with a wink. \u201cJust watch Jack, and listen to me. You\u2019ll know what to do... if you aren\u2019t too rusty on your Latin.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was trying to draw a smile out of her, but she was too weak to smile. If they planned for her to help, that wasn\u2019t a great plan. Cain reached her side then, working to cut through the ropes that held her down. He took the knife Jack had been using to cut the center of his palm, using his blood to heal the wounds The Cycler had left on her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she said, \u201cIt won\u2019t do any good. I\u2019m going to die\u2014this time for real. I can feel it. This time it\u2019s different.\u201d It seemed so unfair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it in a minute, after you kill Jack,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>He was talking crazy, but she listened to the magic user\u2019s chant and watched Jack anyway. His shirt had been ripped away in the vampire feeding frenzy, and his chest was exposed to the moonlight. As she listened to the words, and watched what happened to Jack\u2019s chest, the way it seemed to ripple and be made of something that could easily be penetrated, she knew exactly what they wanted her to do.</p><p>Whether they needed her to kill him for good or not, she couldn\u2019t be sure, but she knew Cain got her well enough to know she didn\u2019t want to be rescued like some fair maiden. She wanted to be the one to kill the bastard that had terrorized her for centuries and taken her sister\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, as he helped her up off the stone altar.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later. Do your job now.\u201d</p><p>When they reached Jack, he was screaming profanity. Tam\u2019s hand sank right through him\u2014the flesh and bone having softened like Jell-o. The muscle throbbed in her head as she took his still-beating heart from his chest. When she\u2019d done it, the vamps stopped feeding, and a single moment that spanned eternity passed as Jack realized what she\u2019d just done, how she\u2019d finally ended him. Her former love for him, her current hatred\u2014it all blended together in the weakening pulse, everything good and bad inside him dying at once.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ve ripped your heart out. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p><p>He dropped to the ground, then his heart turned black and desiccated, turning to dust in her hand. His body soon followed suit, proving once and for all that he\u2019d become something other than human.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me. He\u2019s gone,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>Tam felt her legs go as she dropped to the ground. At first she feared killing Jack had somehow killed her, too, but it was just the natural course of the death he\u2019d already started in her. Jack got the last laugh after all. She fought to keep her eyes open, hearing Cain\u2019s command for everyone to leave him bouncing off the cave. Then they were alone together.</p><p>His fingers threaded in hers. She jumped and opened her eyes when she felt a hard slap on her face. He looked... distraught. Cain? Maybe he did feel something for her after all.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s too late. I\u2019m sorry. Another life maybe.\u201d It felt like everything inside her was slowing down.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d He squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cI would if I could.\u201d And she meant it. She never thought she\u2019d be so upset to leave the demon behind.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stay. Be my mate. Please don\u2019t leave me here alone. I don\u2019t want to have to find you, I have you here, now.\u201d</p><p>Her brain could barely catch up to what he was saying. Had he said mate? Forever? So much for breaking a cycle. But looking into his eyes, she didn\u2019t ever want to not be looking into them. He carried her back to the stone altar, and took the knife, cutting a slice down the center of each of her palms and each of his. \u201cJust say yes that you\u2019ll give me your soul when I finish. Please, Tam.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t already been through this with Anna and Luc she would have balked about the whole soul thing, but she knew what it meant and what she\u2019d be giving him. Mixing blood and immortality had consequences. She knew that better than most. And here it was happening again in the same dark cavern, though at least they couldn\u2019t kill each other. This magic was different.</p><p>He shifted into the demon form. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to be in this form. Just for the blood ritual. I\u2019ll change back, after.\u201d He said it as if he feared she\u2019d reject him if reminded too much of what he was.</p><p>This time the negative emotions pouring out of him didn\u2019t feel oppressive; they felt like his pain. Pain she could fix just by being there and breaking his own cycle. The constant cycle of meaningless feeding and fucking without a real connection. The cycle of endless loneliness without a partner to go through life with.</p><p>He chanted the words over her in his demon language and she felt the magic flare up. If she\u2019d had any doubts about this, they dissipated as the thoughts hurry hurry hurry before it\u2019s too late tore through her mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll give you my soul,\u201d she said when his chant ended. It was done. She was his. She could feel it. The moment she died, she\u2019d be tied to him forever. For the first time, it felt like relief.</p><p>She used the last bit of strength that she had to say, \u201cSo are you finally going to kill me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be much of a challenge,\u201d he said, shifting back to his pretty form. \u201cI should let you just drop on your own for spite.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even muster a glare or a snarky comeback. It was how she knew she only had a few minutes left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, fine. I promised I\u2019d take you out. I don\u2019t want Jack stealing my thunder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShift back,\u201d she said.</p> <p>His eyes widened, not believing what he was hearing. \u201cI can\u2019t feed in the demon form, and you don\u2019t want that. You never have to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t feed that way because nobody wants you that way. I do. I love you. Shift back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You don\u2019t have to prove anything to me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHonor a girl\u2019s dying request here.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and shifted. She was right, she still wanted him\u2014even in the scary form. In two seconds flat, he\u2019d managed to get out of his ripped pants. It was the quickest sex they\u2019d ever had. Not angry, not lust-filled, but short and somehow sweet despite the negative emotions that bubbled out of the form. Underneath all that, she could feel him, the man hidden deep within the monster, and she knew her comparisons to Jack had been wrong.</p> <p>When he started feeding, it took almost nothing to bring her over. Her spirit ripped from her body and she found herself hovering. Great, she was going to be like the Doublemint Ghosts with Anna now. Her past lives surged into her, the ones she\u2019d lived before she\u2019d been Tamar. It wasn\u2019t a long list but several brief glimpses stopped her.</p><p>\u201cCain! You\u2019ve killed me before, in like five different lives!\u201d</p><p>He shifted back to the pretty form. \u201cWell, shit, Tam. I didn\u2019t know. It was bound to happen. I\u2019ve been around forever. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m mad that all those times it was easy, and this one time I actually asked you to do it and we had to go through all this drama to get here.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and pulled her into his arms, making her solid again. \u201cYou\u2019re never happy.\u201d He kissed her before she could smack him.</p><p>Anna floated in, not on Luc\u2019s arm. \u201cOh thank God,\u201d she said when she reached Tam. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank Cain,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>Anna looked conflicted. \u201cThank you,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said you didn\u2019t care about her. I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young. You can\u2019t help these things,\u201d Cain said.</p><p>\u201cLuc!\u201d Anna shouted. Her mate ran in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold my hand so I can hug the friend I almost lost.\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of them together. \u201cYou took a mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everybody think I don\u2019t have layers,\u201d Cain said, beginning to sound irked.</p> <p>Anna grabbed Luc\u2019s hand and hugged Tam. \u201cWelcome to my ghostly world,\u201d she said. \u201cParts of it suck. Parts of it are awesome.\u201d</p><p>Tam laughed.</p><p>When they got back to the demon dimension, Cain pulled her away from the others, taking her off to the caves.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we can probably just do it wherever we want now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m bringing you out here.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he was holding her hand, taking her out to the caves, only this time she knew it meant something.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to regret doing this?\u201d she asked, the slightest bit of insecurity creeping in. The whole thing had sort of happened very suddenly and under duress. For both of them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, firmly. \u201cI realized before you were dying that I wasn\u2019t just keeping you around for amusement. I like that you aren\u2019t some twenty-year-old, bubble-headed twit. I relate to you. I like that you\u2019re not scared of me.\u201d He paused for a second, and she knew he was still moved that she\u2019d asked for the demon form. No other woman in existence would have done that for him. He quickly regained his composure. \u201cAnd I like that you can kick my ass\u2014or make a valiant attempt, at least. Though that won\u2019t be true for a while because of your change. But I\u2019ll live until you get unruly again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m queen of the verbal sparring match, you won\u2019t be bored,\u201d she promised. \u201cSpeaking of queens, does this make me queen of the demons? Oh oh oh! Or queen of the underworld, like Persephone?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cPlease, those are such human labels. Aren\u2019t we above all that?\u201d</p><p>But she was just screwing with him. Though she did sort of love the Persephone and Hades myth. Maybe there had been a clue in there all along.</p><p>Things turned serious when he took her into the caves. Hadrian was chained to a wall, badly beaten and tortured.</p><p>\u201cYou did this,\u201d she said quietly. For a moment she wondered if she would be the one to regret the mating. The evidence of her mate\u2019s brutality was stark as Hadrian groaned in the shackles. He was healing, but if he was still this messed up as a vampire, it had to have been really bad.</p><p>\u201cI did. And I would do it again. I told you before we got split up that you were mine. Did you really think I wouldn\u2019t move Heaven and Earth to get you back?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known demons were possessive and that words like mine didn\u2019t spill out of their mouths casually, but she\u2019d been in denial at that point.</p><p>He turned her face toward him, his hand cupping her chin. \u201cDo you regret the mating?\u201d</p><p>Tam looked at Hadrian, then back to Cain. \u201cNo. I knew what you were when I agreed. I\u2019m not a twenty-year-old, bubble-headed twit,\u201d she said, tossing his words back at him.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cSomething we can all be grateful for. I bet you were a terror when you were twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery single time.\u201d</p><p>He got serious again. \u201cWhat do you want to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Tam sighed. \u201cJust let him go. I\u2019m too old to be that petty.\u201d</p><p>He unchained the vampire and offered him a hand to help him stand. \u201cYou\u2019ve no doubt made enemies of everyone, especially Anthony. I\u2019d steer clear if I were you. You might also want to change where you sleep for the day. It\u2019s only a matter of time before things escalate in the human world, even with Jack gone.\u201d</p><p>The vampire nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it went like this, Tam. Truly. But bad things will happen from Anthony\u2019s control. Jack was evil, but he was a means to an end for me.\u201d</p><p>Tam didn\u2019t reply. She didn\u2019t feel like he wanted her to, just that he had to get that said. He\u2019d probably been holding onto it for a while. Father Hadrian left them alone in the caves, and Tam looked over at her mate.</p><p>\u201cCan I still eat food?\u201d</p><p>Cain chuckled. \u201cIf you like. When you\u2019re not in the ghostly form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not really what keeps me going?\u201d These, of course, were the questions you typically asked before you gave your soul to a demon, but meh.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re tied together now. I can only feed successfully from you, but you gain strength through it, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat.\u201d She looked down at the sand she couldn\u2019t really stand in. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d just love for one century to go by where my life was normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>She turned her palm up and was surprised when she could still form an energy ball, though it was ghostly and wouldn\u2019t do any damage. Someday, though. Cain grabbed her and pulled her to him for a kiss as the glowing purple ball fell from her hand and sizzled in the sand. </p> </body></html>"]
