At least, not in the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s circle of acquaintances. One dressed\u2014to be frank\u2014to dazzle and amaze one\u2019s female friends. Or, if one were so inclined, to invite a seduction...to engage in an affaire.</p><p>Husbands were just there, like coal in Newcastle and pigs in the sty.</p><p>Which made it all the harder for Jemma, the duchess in question, to decide what to wear to seduce her spouse. After all, Elijah had been her husband for years. True, they had lived apart for some time, but now they\u2019d agreed, in an alarmingly businesslike fashion, that after he returned from a fortnight spent at the Prime Minister\u2019s house, they would...</p><p>Would what?</p><p>Have a baby. Produce an heir, or at least go through the motions that would produce one in nine months.</p> <p>Go to bed together.</p><p>They had come to that decision a year ago. When she had first returned from Paris, she was too angry to contemplate marital intimacies, but then somehow the fury drained away. Still, they kept to separate bedchambers. The humiliating truth was that Elijah didn\u2019t seem terribly interested.</p><p>First he said he wouldn\u2019t bed her until she finished her chess match with the Duke of Villiers, since everyone believed that the match was naught more than a cover for an affaire. Then, when she threw in the chess match, giving the win to Villiers, Elijah announced that he was going into the country with Pitt\u2019s wing of the government.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine another man claiming that he was too busy to bed her. Too busy to seduce the Duchess of Beaumont?</p><p>Unlikely.</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t think she was being overly vain, just realistic. It had been her experience that men were driven by lust above duty. And she had been assured by male attention from age sixteen that she was precisely what a lustful man would like to find in his bed.</p> <p>She had blue eyes, hair of a deep golden color, a very elegant nose (she particularly liked her nose), and crimson lips. True, the crimson color resulted from lavish applications of lip rouge, but if one were lucky enough not to have a thin hard mouth, one might as well draw attention to it.</p><p>And at twenty-eight, she still had the allure of youth, together with a sheen of sophistication and wit that no sixteen-year-old could command.</p><p>She even had all her teeth, to lower the subject to the level of cattle.</p><p>The problem, it seemed to her, was that to Elijah she was a wife, not a woman.</p><p>There was nothing sensual about the word wife. Jemma gave a little shudder. Wives nagged and complained. Wives wore little caps on their fading hair and suffered from broadening hips due to child-bearing.</p><p>It was mortifying to be a wife. Even worse, a wife whose husband was reluctant to take her to bed.</p><p>It was definitely a new, and rather disconcerting, sensation, to feel that she was more interested in bedding a man than the reverse. She was used to men trying to seduce her. During the years she lived at Versailles, gentlemen considered her ripe for the plucking, given that her husband lived in England. They swiveled before her to display a powerful thigh, flaunt an embroidered coat or an enameled snuff box. They dropped roses, plums, and poems at her doorstep.</p><p>She smiled, enticed, laughed, dismissed. She dressed to amuse herself, and to dazzle the court. She dressed for power and admiration. She certainly didn\u2019t dress to enchant men: she took that for granted.</p> <p>But the whole process of making her toilette felt different tonight.</p><p>She wanted all the passion and energy her husband devoted to the House of Lords, to the fate of England. She wanted him to look at her with the same hunger that he showed for a new bill in Parliament. She wanted Elijah at her feet.</p><p>She wanted what she probably couldn\u2019t have. No wife had that.</p><p>Brigitte, her femme de chambre, popped into the room with a fistful of visiting cards. \u201cAll your beaux are below requesting to assist you in your toilette,\u201d she said. \u201cLord Corbin, of course, and Viscount St. Albans. Delacroix and Lord Piddleton.\u201d</p><p>Jemma wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I shall admit anyone this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shall dress alone, Your Grace?\u201d The look on Brigitte\u2019s face was almost comical.</p><p>\u201cI am never alone,\u201d Jemma pointed out. \u201cI have your assistance as well as that of Mariette and Lucinda. A woman with three maids, each with such decided opinions, can hardly bemoan her lack of guidance!\u201d</p><p>Brigitte\u2019s eyes narrowed, just for a second. \u201cIndeed, Your Grace. Perhaps you plan a special toilette for the f\u00eate this evening. Shall I inform the gentlemen that you decline their counsel?\u201d</p><p>But Jemma had already changed her mind, based on that little flash in Brigitte\u2019s eyes. Brigitte knew that the duke would be going directly to the king\u2019s f\u00eate. Servants talked...servants knew.</p><p>Jemma suspected that the house knew of her embarrassing, humiliating infatuation with her husband. In the last month or so she had taken to sitting in the library with a chessboard before her, waiting for Elijah to return from the House of Lords. She had started reading all the papers, with particular attention to accounts of the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s speeches. She was...</p><p>She was a dunce. She should behave as if there was nothing untoward about the evening. Her husband had been in the country for two weeks; that meant nothing to her. A fashionable wife would never even note the absence or presence of something as insignificant as a husband.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I have a headache,\u201d she said, with precisely the right note of lament. \u201cAnd Corbin and Delacroix can be so trivial. If only Villiers were here.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion vanished from her maid\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe would soothe your head, Your Grace. And he\u201d\u2014Brigitte dimpled\u2014\u201cis far from trivial.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Jemma smiled. \u201cBut Villiers would never lower himself to join a woman at her dressing. For one thing, I suspect that it takes him longer to dress than it takes me. I suppose I must needs admit Corbin, at least. How do I appear?\u201d</p><p>Jemma was wearing a honey-pale corset, adorned with daring bows of sheer black ribbon. Brigitte darted about, pulling a lock of hair over her shoulder so it emphasized her white skin, dusting a touch of powder onto her nose.</p><p>Her hair, of course, was already built into a formidable pile of curls, though it awaited ornamentation and powder. One of her three French maids, Mariette, was a genius in that area and had spent two hours earlier that afternoon constructing a style fit for a royal occasion.</p><p>Jemma looked at herself again in the glass over her dressing table. To her mind, nothing suited her quite as much as dishabille, to be with her face painted, but her hair unpowdered, her legs showing through the frail lawn of her chemise. If only Elijah visited her at this time in the afternoon...but he never did.</p><p>Only strangers\u2014or at best, acquaintances\u2014thronged below in the drawing room, begging for permission to help her place a patch, or choose a gown.</p><p>Presumably husbands were uninterested in seeing their wives dress; their secrets were all known and the thrill of the unfamiliar was lost. Though considering that she and Elijah hadn\u2019t seen each other under intimate circumstances for nine years, one might imagine he felt a tinge of curiosity. The last time they had slept together she had been a gauche and, comparatively speaking, flat-chested twenty-year-old.</p><p>\u201cIf Villiers were below, would you admit him?\u201d Brigitte asked, artfully spilling a box of ribbons onto the dressing table as if she were setting the stage for a play. She snatched up Jemma\u2019s silver-backed mirror and laid it carefully across the glowing strands of color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVilliers is dangerous,\u201d Jemma stated. Villiers was everything Corbin and Delacroix were not. He was a chess master, for one thing. His mind was as nimble as hers, and his machinations were not trivial, and\u2014</p><p>And he wanted her.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s desire wasn\u2019t like the light emotions of the men waiting below. His desire was like a dark undertow, pulling at her along with the force of his charm, the wicked beauty of his smile, his French mother\u2019s delicious eyes...</p><p>Brigitte sighed, and the sigh said it all. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s a Frenchman, and that changes everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly on his mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssez! Assez! C\u2019est assez.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte was right. The French blood Villiers inherited from his mother was definitely enough...put together with an English manliness and strength. He was truly dangerous to a woman\u2019s peace of mind, not to mention her reputation.</p><p>\u201cOnly Corbin?\u201d Brigitte asked, picking up the cards tendered by those waiting below.</p><p>Generally, a lady allowed two, three, even four gentlemen into the dressing room to help her choose patches and lace. To invite only Corbin would invite a scandal, but who could really believe that she was instigating an affaire with Corbin? He was Jemma\u2019s favorite partner for the minuet, her comfortable companion of an evening. A brilliant dancer, an exquisite dresser, a notable wit. And she had a shrewd feeling that he had as little interest in her as she had in him.</p> <p>What if Elijah didn\u2019t bother to come tonight, for all they had agreed to meet this evening? What if affairs of state kept him from affairs of the heart?</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>Besides, one never had an affair of the heart with one\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cJust Lord Corbin,\u201d she said decisively.</p><p>Brigitte nipped out of the room, down to dismiss the crowd and admit Corbin and no other, and set alive a small blaze of gossip about Jemma\u2019s preferential treatment.</p><p>A moment later Corbin paused in the door just long enough to allow Jemma to assess his costume, and to allow him to appreciate Brigitte\u2019s careful stage setting. The frank appreciation in his eyes was very soothing to Jemma\u2019s fraught feelings.</p> <p>\u201cI should like a glass of Champagne,\u201d she told Brigitte. \u201cLord Corbin, does that please you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Corbin drawled. He was the son of a country lord, who likely was affronted, if not terrified, by his eldest son. Corbin\u2019s wig was a snowy perfection; his heels were higher than Jemma\u2019s and graced with large, floppy flowers; he was just saved from effeminacy by the breadth of his shoulders and by a rugged turn to his chin. He was dressed in a coat of antique rose, sewn with narrow cuffs of persimmon. His breeches were the same persimmon, and his stockings\u2014</p><p>\u201cThose stockings!\u201d she cried. \u201cExquisite!\u201d They were pale cream, with rose-colored clocks rising up the sides.</p><p>Corbin swept into a graceful bow. \u201cI first saw a pair on Lord Stittle, if you can countenance it.\u201d</p><p>He sat in a chair at her side, the better to help her pick the perfect accoutrements for her hair.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer not to imagine such a thing,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I told him his thighs were too large. Or was it his feet? At any rate, it was only after sustained insults that I managed to wring the name of his hosier from him. William Low on Bond Street, if you can believe it. I thought Low carried only worsted stockings for country squires.\u201d</p><p>His eyes laughed, and Jemma felt fifty times better. \u201cI must look my absolute best tonight,\u201d she said, hearing too late the fervency in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, you always look your best,\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cBut always! Would I be your closest companion were you not the most exquisite duchess in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reverse is true as well,\u201d Jemma remarked.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cSpeaking of which, do you care for this small accent on my chin? I spent the entire week in the country growing it, and by Thursday I was despairing of achieving an appropriate appearance in time for the king\u2019s f\u00eate.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked at him carefully. Dazzled by his stockings, she hadn\u2019t noticed that he now sported the smallest goatee she\u2019d ever seen, just an arrow of silky dark hair below his lower lip, fashioned into a wicked little V. \u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI do like it, Corbin. You\u2019ll start a fashion. It makes you look older, and a bit dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuinous in a woman, charming in a man,\u201d he said happily. \u201cAt least at my tender age. Dare I ask what makes this evening so fraught with anxiety? I do trust your plans have nothing to do with Delacroix. I had to elbow him out of the way to make my way up the stairs, and I don\u2019t like even to stand next to him; I\u2019m afraid all that artlessness will rub off on me.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be cruel, darling. Delacroix considers himself to be the epitome of sophistication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could call it adolescent greenness but for his advanced age. He tries so hard that I feel exhausted at the very sight of him. Such sincerity should be outlawed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are cruel.\u201d Jemma picked up three or four ribbons and held them to the light, put them down again. Ribbons were too girlish for what she had in mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan la grande toilette?\u201d Corbin asked, catching the connotations of her gesture instantly.</p><p>\u201cTherein lies my problem,\u201d Jemma said, waving a hand at her bed. \u201cI cannot decide.\u201d</p><p>Naturally, Corbin rose to inspect the two choices Brigitte had laid out.</p><p>On one side was a lovely gown of a blue-green watered silk. It was embroidered with green roses, small ones, and the piquancy of the improbable flower made the whole costume all the more delicious. The skirts pulled back to reveal a gossamer underskirt in a lighter shade.</p><p>\u201cIn your hair?\u201d Corbin asked.</p><p>\u201cRoses to match.\u201d She tossed one to him.</p><p>\u201cExquisite,\u201d he said, inspecting it. \u201cI gather the centers are made of emeralds and not green glass, Duchess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery small ones,\u201d she said, shrugging one shoulder. \u201cPractically invisible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am entirely in favor of luxury,\u201d Corbin said, turning the rose in his fingers. \u201cEspecially the kind that doesn\u2019t herald its worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, they were terribly expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thus to be worn only by a woman who need not worry about finances. Though now I think of it, these roses should be worn by a woman deep in debt. Flaunting extravagance is the best way to assuage creditors\u2019 anxieties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that they are rather extravagant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess\u2019s prerogative.\u201d Corbin moved to the other costume. \u201cBut if with the one gown you flaunt your extravagance, what exactly do you wish to flaunt\u2014and why\u2014with this gown?\u201d His voice was silky, but delivered its insult for all that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the very newest fashion,\u201d Jemma said indignantly, coming to stand next to him. \u201cA chemise gown. Queen Marie Antoinette has at least four, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but the lucky queen doesn\u2019t live in England.\u201d Corbin picked up the gown. It was made of a sweet flow of fabric in a pale peach, caught up here and there with bunches of pearls. Rather than being made of stiff satin, the cloth was as thin as a chemise\u2014hence the name. It would barely skim her breasts, flowing down over her body like a delicate night garment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre we so stuffy in England?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSo cold,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cIn both senses of the word. My darling duchess, you will cause the women to thrill with rage and cause the men to thrill with something else. But meanwhile you will freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreeze?\u201d Jemma stared down at the chemise gown.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing more unattractive than flesh dimpled with cold,\u201d Corbin said flatly. \u201cAnd the king\u2019s f\u00eate takes place on his yacht. On the river. Unless you wish to spend the evening inside longing for a fireplace and a woolen shawl, you should wear the green gown. Which, by the way, is gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not so desperate,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Jemma whipped around. \u201cI am never desperate!\u201d</p><p>Corbin met her eyes in the glass. \u201cThen why the desperation?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI am not desperate. I am...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInterested?\u201d Corbin\u2019s eyebrow rose, and his smile was so amused that she couldn\u2019t help smiling back.</p><p>\u201cIn my husband,\u201d she told him impulsively.</p><p>She surprised him. He dropped into his chair with something less than his usual insouciance. \u201cYour husband? Your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else\u2019s,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI have never meddled with a married man.\u201d It was a frail claim to virtue, but all she had.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had decided on Villiers,\u201d Corbin said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t say that it was a near miss.</p> <p>\u201cYour husband. I don\u2019t even have the faintest idea what to advise you. I am shocked. Husbands are so\u2014so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUninteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Beaumont is all that is admirable.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d She picked up the chemise gown and held it against her body, looking in the glass.</p><p>\u201cEssential to the future of the country, from what I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTedious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that! He holds deep moral beliefs, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my opposite,\u201d Jemma said dismally. She threw the chemise dress back on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cHow clever of you to recognize it,\u201d Corbin said.</p><p>\u201cLife is so much more interesting when people understand how angels and devils differ. I hear His Grace is most sincere in the House. You can\u2014\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I believe you can trust everything he says.\u201d He sounded horrified.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Jemma said, sighing again. \u201cHe\u2019s a veritable Puritan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need good people,\u201d Corbin said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that they\u2019re so\u2014so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I feel so only because I myself am quite errant. I have never considered taking a seat in Parliament. Everyone\u2014but everyone\u2014wears those snail wigs. The ones with small crustaceans ranked around the ears like soldiers on parade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can easily imagine you in Parliament,\u201d Jemma said, moving behind her friend so she could meet his eyes in the mirror over her dressing table. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly more clever than most of them. I\u2019d much prefer to see you running the country.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cI hope we are not friends due to some hopeless misconception about my character, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are friends because you are funny,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd because you tell me the truth if my stockings are at odds with my slippers. And because you gossip cruelly about everyone and pretend to me that you will never do so behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a pretense. I can have room for only one woman in my heart at a moment,\u201d he said, \u201cand you are she.\u201d</p><p>Jemma bent and kissed his cheek. \u201cWe are admirably suited.\u201d She sat back down next to him.</p><p>\u201cExcept you are so serious this evening,\u201d Corbin pointed out. \u201cSo passionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we allowed to be serious only about stockings?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He thought about that longer than she thought necessary. \u201cI am quite serious about scandal,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cBut never about passion itself?\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose but his eyes were sympathetic. \u201cThank God, infatuation has never forced me into seriousness. A beautiful woman should never be serious, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt implies that there is something you cannot have. And we who are not as beautiful prefer to believe that you have everything you wish for in life. That is the essence of beauty, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel myself growing plainer every moment,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cPerhaps it is the curse of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge and passion!\u201d Corbin looked faintly nauseated.</p><p>\u201cI shall have to ask your maid for a drink of brandy if you continue in this vein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should not wear the chemise gown,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. In fact, given what you have just told me, the green silk may be a trifle too revealing in the bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your husband,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThe duke is...\u201d He paused delicately. \u201cWell, were Beaumont a woman, his skirts would be long and his neckline high.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought about that and shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t transform into a Puritan wife in order to please Elijah. He\u2019ll have to take me as I am.\u201d</p><p>Corbin paused. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind the question, exactly what sort of taking do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need an heir,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But that need not, in itself, involve passion on your part, and surely no anxiety. Though you might wish to put a bottle of brandy on the night table and take a surreptitious swig now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus the quest for passion?\u201d Corbin asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first, but you set yourself such a difficult task, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better call me Jemma,\u201d she said, rather grimly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t advertise it and you shouldn\u2019t either. So what you need is lessons in making a husband feel passion for his wife.\u201d</p><p>It seemed impossible, put so bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ll wear the green dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeductive clothing will never work, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for Beaumont.\u201d She picked up a rosy ribbon and started wrapping it around one finger.</p><p>\u201cIf you wear the chemise dress, you\u2019ll likely just make him angry. Or embarrassed. After all, such flamboyant clothing is designed to make a man hunger for what he cannot have, and what he cannot imagine. But a husband...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to surprise him,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cShow him a side of you that he\u2019s never seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any sides,\u201d Jemma said despairingly. \u201cI play chess; he knows that. We play together occasionally.\u201d</p><p>Corbin groaned. \u201cLike an old married couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the library,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cWhile discussing the news of the day.\u201d But there was a look in Corbin\u2019s eye, a smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have something that he\u2019s never seen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a woman with a past, Jemma. And better than that, you have a reputation.\u201d</p><p>She knitted her brow. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like my past. And he never liked my wilder parties. Some years ago he paid me a visit in Paris over Twelfth Night. You should have seen his face when I informed him that all the gentlemen were to come to my ball dressed as satyrs! He refused, of course. Every Frenchman wore a satyr\u2019s tail, but Beaumont was in a frock coat, precisely as if it were not a masquerade at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. And I\u2019ve never heard a breath of scandal attached to the duke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had a mistress, but no one considers that scandalous,\u201d she said, dropping the ribbon in a tangled heap back on her dressing table.</p><p>\u201cBecause it isn\u2019t. Mistresses are commonplace. And for a man of Beaumont\u2019s character, the presence of such a woman in his life must have been shaming after a time.\u201d</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re paid,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cPaid to play out the fantasies every man has in the back of his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantasies!\u201d Jemma cried, revolted. \u201cHe had a regular appointment with her, in his chambers at the Inns of Court, at lunchtime yet. How could that possibly stem from fantasy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just business,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cHe likely made the arrangement before marriage, and simply forgot to change it. How old was the duke when he inherited the title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite young,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of the late duke\u2019s death? I\u2019m afraid it was quite a scandal at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! He died in flagrante delicto with\u2014was it four women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cOnly two. But I gather that The Palace of Salom\u00e9 catered to rather specialized tastes, and it was the duke\u2019s favorite establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder your husband made his mistress part of his public life,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cWhere better to prove that his tastes were not deviant than in his own office?\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cElijah said he loved her,\u201d she added in a smallish voice.</p> <p>\u201cIf you challenged him on the subject, he may have said that from rage. But it is very difficult to love someone whom one pays for the most intimate of pleasures. The money kills joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are rather terrifying,\u201d Jemma said, eyeing him.</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d Corbin said smugly. \u201cDo you see what I am suggesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to rouse passion in a husband of so many years, I think you will have to show him the side of yourself that you have flaunted only in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chemise dress?\u201d Jemma said, pleating her brow.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s boldly sexual. For Beaumont, you will have to be imaginative. Playful. Joyful. All the things that never, ever happen in the halls of the House of Lords, and certainly have never happened with his mistress. You need to be spontaneous, naughty, and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Elijah\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Corbin folded his hands. \u201cNeither can I, Duchess. Neither can I. Therein lies your challenge. Oh, and I think he needs to choose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that I should encourage Villiers?\u201d She wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But I also mean that someone should flirt with the duke, someone as powerful and beautiful as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be suggesting that I encourage another woman to court my husband!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo woman in London would dare do so unless you make it clear that you are uninterested, and frankly, indifference will only serve your cause. No man wants the woman who lies prostrate at his feet.\u201d Corbin\u2019s eyes drifted down to his feet, as if seeing feminine hands curled pleadingly around his ankles.</p><p>\u201cI would never plead,\u201d Jemma stated.</p><p>\u201cI am merely suggesting that you do not inform the world of your newfound passion. Let the duke come to you. Win your attentions from another man, if possible. Beaumont married at a young age, and for obvious reasons he never indulged in any sort of exuberant naughtiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did have a young woman pursuing him last year,\u201d Jemma pointed out. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember Miss Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you called Miss Fetlock? She of the long nose and abrasive intelligence? Please, Jemma. A true rival would have to be someone of your stature in beauty, wit, and status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mistress\u2019s name was Sarah Cobbett,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cThat speaks for itself, doesn\u2019t it? The poor man has experienced nothing but well-meaning intimacies with a woman graced by the name Cobbett. I am moved near to tears at the thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain this is necessary, Corbin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. The man has never had women vie for his hand before. He will love it, if only because you are one of the two.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought he might be right. \u201cWhat makes you so wise?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cI take my pleasure in watching others,\u201d he said as a shadow passed over his eyes. \u201cSome of us, like yourself, my dear duchess, fling themselves into the midst of life. Others, myself included, spend their time watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou should be taking up a seat in Parliament and manipulating all the poor people like myself who never take the time to develop wisdom.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never given much thought as to why Elijah was tupping his mistress on his desk all those years ago. It was simply the event that tore their marriage asunder, broke her heart and drove her to Paris.</p><p>But of course most men did set up their mistresses in houses in the suburbs. They didn\u2019t make appointments for them in their offices, appointments that every man working in Elijah\u2019s parliamentary chambers must have known about.</p><p>Brigitte entered with a silver tray and Champagne glasses.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Corbin sighed, accepting his glass. \u201cAll this deep thought is making me quite thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided on the green,\u201d Jemma told Brigitte, standing up so her maid could tie on her panniers.</p><p>\u201cTwo patches,\u201d Corbin said decisively. \u201cA kissing patch near your mouth, and another below your eye.\u201d</p><p>The watered silk fell over her panniers with the gentle swish. The bodice plumped her breasts and pushed them forward. She raised an eyebrow to Corbin.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cDelectable yet legal. And since you do not clash with my coat, I shall allow myself to stand next to you on occasion.\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled at the glass. There was a small tendril of joy in her heart. \u201cCrimson lip color tonight, Brigitte,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNaughty,\u201d Corbin observed.</p><p>An hour or so later, that is precisely how she looked. Her curls were powdered and adorned with green roses that glinted mysteriously from their emerald depths. Her eyes laughed above a small patch that drew attention to her crimson mouth. She looked naughty\u2014not overtly available, not scandalous, but mischievous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Corbin said, rising to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a miracle!\u201d Jemma cried, giving him a kiss.</p><p>Corbin\u2019s smile was smug. \u201cI have always found it best to create my own entertainments,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThis evening should be truly interesting, Duchess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Right Hon. William Pitt\u2019s country home</p><p>Cambridge</p><p>March 26, 1784</p> <p>The Duke of Beaumont had been trying to extricate himself from the Prime Minister\u2019s house for the better part of an hour. A group of men, among the most powerful in the kingdom, had spent the last fortnight discussing strategies and laws, ways to thwart Fox\u2019s schemes and defeat his proposals, the case for and against every conceivable argument that a man could voice.</p><p>Elijah had spent the weeks fighting long hours for the causes he believed just, such as the ongoing effort to halt England\u2019s slave trade. He\u2019d won some battles and lost others; it was the nature of politics to weigh inevitable failure against possible gains.</p><p>\u201cI will convey your concern to His Majesty,\u201d he said now, bowing before the Prime Minister, the Right Honorable William Pitt. \u201cTactfully, of course. I agree that it is perilous to hold a royal fete in such proximity to the hulks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him that those floating monstrosities were never meant to be prisons,\u201d Lord Stibblestich put in. He was a florid man with eyes that glinted from the little caves shaped by his plump cheeks. His body was no more than brawny; his face was bloated in comparison. Even his nose appeared engorged in contrast to his shoulders.</p><p>Elijah bit his tongue rather than indulge the impulse to snap at Stibblestich. His Majesty was fully aware that the decommissioned warships anchored in the Thames were never meant to be used as prisons. The hulks were aging warships, as tired and broken down as the English navy.</p> <p>But the presence of hundreds of criminals housed on those ships was a problem that His Majesty was not yet pleased to face. And in truth, Elijah knew it was the Parliament that should be finding a solution.</p><p>\u201cThere was an attempted prison break just last week,\u201d Stibblestich added shrilly, apparently under the illusion that he was saying something original.</p><p>\u201cMy butler informs me that your valet is recovering from his stomach ailment,\u201d Pitt said to Elijah, ignoring Stibblestich. \u201cI will send him to London as soon as he is able to travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for the inconvenience,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI know that Vickery is also grateful for your forbearance.\u201d He bowed again and turned to go. His carriage would go straight to the king\u2019s yacht, the Peregrine. Where...</p><p>Where he was due to meet his wife. Jemma.</p><p>Tired though he was, exhausted by a fortnight of late nights spent arguing, trying to get his own party to understand the unethical side of their deliberations, he couldn\u2019t wait to be aboard. Tucked into the corner of the carriage, he fell asleep, waking only when the wheels started jolting over London\u2019s cobblestones.</p> <p>He pulled his watch from his waistcoat and glanced at it. He had forty minutes to board or the Peregrine would launch without him. The king had a mind to take his revels into the middle of the Thames and then float downstream, the yacht blazing with light and music pouring through the open windows.</p><p>At that very moment the carriage lurched and came to a halt. Elijah summoned his patience. London streets were crowded, and obstructions were common.</p><p>He waited two minutes before he banged on the roof. \u201cWhat the devil is going on, Muffet?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re through Aldgate, but the street is blocked ahead, Your Grace!\u201d came the shout back from his coachman.</p><p>Elijah groaned and pushed open the carriage door. The grooms were off the vehicle and standing at the horses\u2019 heads. A crowd was milling about the street, making it hard to see the source of the disturbance. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded, pushing his way to the front.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure,\u201d Muffet said. \u201cSee, Your Grace, they\u2019ve barricaded Sator Street. And they\u2019re still working on the blockade.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, entry to the street was barred by a growing wall of furniture, beer barrels, and debris. People milled about cheerfully, handing up a stuffed armchair, ducking out of the way as a barrel came free and bounced around the street. There were a couple of small fires burning to the side, and what looked like a lively trade in baked potatoes.</p><p>\u201cAnyone in charge?\u201d Elijah asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I can see,\u201d Muffet said. \u201cAnd Your Grace, it\u2019s going to be a proper mess getting ourselves out of here.\u201d He jerked his thumb, and Elijah realized that their carriage was merely the first of a tangled mess of carriages streaming in from outside London, now caught inside the city gate. Some people appeared to be backing their carriages, or trying to, but they were hampered by others who had apparently decided to scold their way to the front of the line.</p><p>Elijah glanced down at himself. He was dressed in full court attire, as befitted an event held on the king\u2019s yacht. His coat was a deep yellow-gold, embroidered with mustard flowers. His buttons were gilded. He would stand out in the crowd like a damned marigold.</p><p>He strode toward the flickering but bright light cast from the fires at the foot of the barricade.</p><p>The moment he came into the light, the cheerful calls and shouts died. A young man with lank black hair and a mouth like a trout\u2019s froze in the very act of hoisting a wardrobe to the top of the barricade. The sturdy fellow hauling it up recovered faster. \u201cEvening!\u201d he shouted down.</p><p>\u201cGood evening!\u201d Elijah shouted back. \u201cMay I ask for the reason for the barricade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiots in the city tonight,\u201d the man shouted back. He jerked a thumb behind him. \u201cLimehouse ain\u2019t never been rioted in, and it ain\u2019t going to happen tonight either. We\u2019re not letting any of those hellhounds into our houses, nor yet into the square neither.\u201d</p><p>Elijah eyed the barricade. \u201cIt looks remarkably sturdy.\u201d</p><p>The man beamed. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019ve never been rioted in yet. I learned me barricading from me pa. We can put it up in under twenty minutes and we does it whenever we thinks it needful. The Watch knows,\u201d he added a bit defensively. \u201cThey\u2019re all back there behind the barricades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the rioting sure to happen tonight?\u201d Elijah shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never been wrong yet. You\u2019d best get your carriage out of sight. There\u2019s many a bastard in these parts would love to snatch those matched grays of yers, yer lordship.\u201d He started to haul on the wardrobe again.</p><p>\u201cYou put that up in twenty minutes?\u201d Elijah bellowed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the man shouted back. He had the wardrobe now, precariously balanced on top of the armchair.</p><p>It was going to fall. Elijah moved back. It fell, with a great, splintering crash. Luckily the fish-lipped boy scrambled out of the way.</p><p>Elijah cast a glance behind them. The narrow street was entirely blocked by vehicles. Aldgate would be jammed for hours, if not all night.</p><p>If there was a riot, he would lose his horses. Unless...he eyed the blockade. Minus the wardrobe, it wasn\u2019t as high as it might have been. Six feet perhaps. He could smell the riot coming, smell it in the excitement of the men, in the frenzy with which they were piling up furniture, and in the utter absence of children.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he shouted up at the stout man, who was staring down at the wardrobe and cursing in an extremely creative manner.</p><p>\u201cGot no time for chatter matter!\u201d the man bellowed back.</p><p>\u201cGet off the blockade. I\u2019m bringing my horses over and my men as well. Clear space on the other side!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Muffet appeared at his shoulder. \u201cYour Grace, a carriage tried to back through Aldgate and the fool hit the wall and shattered his undercarriage. The way out is entirely blocked. You\u2019ll have to climb the barricade. You\u2019ll be safe on the other side, and the grooms and I will defend the coach and horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave my men or horses behind. Given the situation on the street behind us, there\u2019s likely to be a riot started by this very blockade, if for no other reason. There\u2019ll be blood at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never take down that blockade to let us in,\u201d Muffet said.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t\u2014and they can\u2019t,\u201d Elijah said, examining the complicated maze. It held everything from chairs to dining room tables, all bound together with rope in a haphazard way that looked as if it would take days to untangle.</p> <p>\u201cTake the horses out of the leads. I\u2019ll be damned if I allow them to be lost in whatever riot is about to happen. Pull the carriage over against that building. It\u2019ll probably burn, but I don\u2019t mind that so much. How many grooms do we have? Two? Send them together. Tell them to climb over that barricade and wait for the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t get the horses through,\u201d Muffet protested.</p><p>\u201cI can defend them, Your Grace. I have my pistols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cAnd I must be on the king\u2019s yacht within the half hour. Take the horses from the coach and we\u2019ll get them to the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean to jump them!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGalileo will have no problem with the barrier, so you\u2019ll take him over. I\u2019ll go first with Ptolemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, Your Grace! Neither horse is trained for jumping. What if Ptolemy stumbles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to quibble about it, Muffet. I have to ensure that these horses and yourself are safe, and then get to the yacht before she launches. If Ptolemy makes it over, you should have no problem; Galileo is the stronger horse.\u201d</p><p>A moment later the coachman returned with both horses. \u201cJames grew up in Limehouse,\u201d he said, \u201cand he can talk his way through. I\u2019ve sent him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace\u2014\u201d Muffet began desperately.</p> <p>But Elijah was already slicing the leads, cutting them to the length of reins. Then he was swinging up on Ptolemy. \u201cI\u2019ve an appointment with the duchess,\u201d he shouted down at Muffet. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>He began backing Ptolemy, to give them enough space to gain speed. He felt like a boy again, riding bareback with Villiers through the meadows behind his estate, leaping anything they could find, turning around, and leaping it again.</p><p>Ptolemy was trained to draw a carriage, not be ridden, let alone bareback. He pranced madly, trying to pull his head free. Elijah wound the leads around his right hand and calmed the horse with his left. Once he\u2019d backed as far as he could, he turned the horse\u2019s head back toward the barricade. It rose, a tangled maze against the houses, lit by leaping flames.</p><p>Ptolemy tried to buck again, but Elijah brought him down. Both horses were beloved and expensive, and he\u2019d be damned if he would sacrifice them to a riot, let alone expose his men to the danger of trying to protect them.</p><p>\u201cSteady,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSteady.\u201d</p><p>Then he loosed the reins and Ptolemy leapt forward, obediently dashing straight for the barricade. Elijah judged the distance, accounting for possible defects in his abilities due to the shifting light, reached the exact spot, signaled\u2014</p><p>Ptolemy leapt up, powerful rear legs throwing them into the night air. For a moment it seemed as if the snarled furniture was rushing toward them instead of the other way around; Elijah caught sight of a brass pole sticking out at an angle that could impale a horse\u2019s stomach. And then they were clearing the furniture, coming down with a hard jolt, a rush of wind, and a sharp snap of his teeth.</p><p>James was there, reaching up for the leads. Elijah tossed him the reins. \u201cKeep them safe,\u201d he told the footman, who was quickly pulling Ptolemy out of the way so Muffet and Galileo could join them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be no problem, Your Grace,\u201d he said, tugging his hat. \u201cThere\u2019s a mews just two streets over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they were blocking a square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, sir. They\u2019ll be barricading all of Limehouse, with a good eight thousand souls inside. Limehouse doesn\u2019t welcome strangers. It\u2019s known for that. Everyone who lives here knows that it\u2019s safe. See, there\u2019s the Watch.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, London\u2019s finest were warming their hands over a fire. \u201cI need to get to the Thames,\u201d Elijah told James, just as Muffet landed behind him, Galileo having sailed over the barricade with no problem at all. \u201cI don\u2019t have the faintest idea where we are.\u201d</p><p>James chewed on his lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out by the barricade at Bramble Street,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the horses to Muffet, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never make it without me,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cThese streets aren\u2019t like the ones you\u2019re used to, Your Grace. They\u2019re scrambled up and people like it better that way. It\u2019s not far, but it\u2019s messy.\u201d</p><p>Elijah followed the footman from one knotty little street to another. There was a holiday spirit inside the barricades. The windows were all open, and people spilled out of the narrow tip-tilting houses, singing songs in a cant dialect that Elijah couldn\u2019t follow, shouting things to each other. They fell silent when they saw him, but not in a unfriendly way.</p><p>For the night, their enemies were not the rich, like himself, but the violent. The riot held everyone\u2019s attention, from the old men sitting outside boasting of foregone days and foregone barricades, to the young women frying up sausages in a lively trade.</p><p>Elijah had a strange, sudden wish that Jemma was with him. His expensive, delicious duchess would enjoy this strange evening. She would love to be following him through these streets.</p><p>The barricade at Bramble Street was a better one than the first. It was intricate but ordered. Men were handing up long pointed objects.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are those?\u201d Elijah asked.</p><p>\u201cSpears,\u201d James said, weaving his way through the excited crowd toward the looming barricade.</p><p>\u201cSpears? Spears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have a few guns, but in the dark, spears are a better deterrent. Though no one has attacked a Limehouse barricade in some twenty years. You\u2019d have to be mad to do so,\u201d James said. \u201cStark mad, so most rioters hove off in other directions. It makes the men around here quite disappointed, really. They keep extending the barricade, in the hope that someone will prove foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going through?\u201d</p><p>The footman grinned, his face wild in the leaping firelight. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were in the shadow of the barricade that Elijah realized that there was, in fact, a small trickle of people making their way through a man-shaped hole in the bottom. \u201cThey\u2019ll only block the hole when they get word that the riot has started,\u201d James said, worming his way through the people. \u201cMake way!\u201d he shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s a duke here. Make way!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah felt like a fool, walking through the crowd in his brocade\u2014not to mention his high heels and wig\u2014but that was life as a duke. He\u2019d resigned himself long ago to looking and acting in ways that most men found incomprehensible and that he, in the inner sanctum of his study, often found just as foolish.</p><p>He strode along, the heavy silk of his coat swinging around him, and the people fell back, letting him pass.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best make hurry,\u201d James said, almost pushing him through the hole. \u201cThey say it\u2019ll start soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do they know?\u201d Elijah asked. He checked his pocket watch. The yacht had taken up anchor. But he couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014miss his appointment with Jemma.</p> <p>\u201cThey know,\u201d James said. \u201cThere\u2019s the Thames, Your Grace. I\u2019ll just ask one of the mudlarks about a boat. Wait a moment.\u201d</p><p>Some minutes later Elijah sent James back to guard the horses, in the unlikely event that one of the barricades failed, and he climbed into a rowboat owned by a man with the less than inspiring name of Twiddy.</p><p>Even hadn\u2019t he known of the Limehouse blockades, he could have guessed that something was afoot in London. Fires burned all over the city: not huge, uncontained fires, but small glowing ones, the kind that crowds of men gathered around to warm their hands, to talk and gossip.</p><p>Twiddy was a tired-looking fellow in a ripped coat who seemed to have only half his mouth at his disposal, since the other half was frozen by a nasty scar that split his face in two. \u201cYou\u2019re wanting the king\u2019s big boat,\u201d he said now, out of the right side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRiots\u2019ll start any minute,\u201d the man said. His face seemed to sneer, though it was perhaps only because the left side was immobile.</p><p>Elijah thought of asking whether the authorities had been notified, and dropped the idea. They\u2019d be dunces not to have noticed, even if they weren\u2019t officially informed. Oh, by the way, Mr. Constable, sir, there\u2019s a riot due to start at ten o\u2019clock tonight.</p><p>He would make his way onto the Peregrine, inform the captain of the impending riots, and manage to get the yacht steered to a safe place. Then he would take his wife, bring her safely home, and that would be that. London could\u2014nay, London undoubtedly would\u2014 burn, but if he could save Jemma, it would be enough.</p><p>That was what his world had shrunk to: from his grand plans for the poor and the disenfranchised, to a desperate desire to be home in bed. With his wife.</p><p>Twiddy pulled up his oars. \u201cThe yacht\u2019s gone toward the Tower of London,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elijah leaned forward. \u201cThe royal yacht?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s down where the hulks are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make all speed after it.\u201d</p><p>Twiddy shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, Yer Grace.\u201d He bent over and spat into the dark water lapping greasily at the small boat. The only light came from a torch burning at his back, affixed to the prow.</p><p>\u201cI will pay you double,\u201d Elijah said, realizing the moment the words left his mouth that he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>Sure enough, the man\u2019s face darkened and the immobile left lip pulled savagely down. \u201cI stand to be arrested if I goes near the hulks, and I can\u2019t do it. Not for yer gold, not for nothing. I got two daughters at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is on that yacht,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWhy will you be arrested?\u201d</p><p>He spat again. \u201cI\u2019m demobbed.\u201d</p><p>A former soldier, Elijah translated. Which explained the damage to his face, but not why he couldn\u2019t venture near the hulks.</p> <p>\u201cIffen a former soldier even goes near the hulks, they shoot him,\u201d Twiddy said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s me friends on those boats. Me brothers-in-arms. I stood with them, out there, and now they\u2019re shut up worse than chickens in a coop. I don\u2019t do nothing with the riots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe riots are coming from the hulks? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>But Twiddy hadn\u2019t meant to reveal that, clearly, and his face closed like a trap.</p><p>\u201cI must get to that yacht,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI will personally guarantee that you are not thrown in jail. I am the Duke of Beaumont, one of the highest in the land. I must get my wife off that ship!\u201d</p><p>Twiddy stared at him, the left side of his face twitching slightly.</p><p>\u201cI have a large estate in the country. If you wish, I will employ you there, and your children and wife can come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWife\u2019s dead,\u201d he grunted.</p><p>\u201cThen your daughters will be all the better for fresh country air and safety,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cYou sound like someone raised in the dells. Look about you, man! Is this the place to raise children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you askin\u2019 me if I choose to raise my girls here?\u201d</p><p>Elijah cursed himself silently. For someone with a reputation for a silver tongue, he was certainly awkward tonight. \u201cI\u2019ll take you out of this,\u201d he said, sitting back. His heart was thumping in his chest, and he didn\u2019t want to think about that. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the country and give you decent work for decent pay. But you must get me to that yacht, and get myself and my wife off it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s we to do that? Likely they aren\u2019t going to let someone like me draw up alongside the king\u2019s yacht. Not on a night like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about the riots, or they\u2019ve decided to ignore them.\u201d</p><p>Twiddy spat again.</p><p>Elijah felt like spitting too, but dukes didn\u2019t spit, and it was too late in life to start. A second later Twiddy picked up his oars and started silently moving them upstream again. He stuck close to the banks as they turned into the main cleft, clearly unnerved by the great floating prison ships anchored in midstream. There were redcoats on all the decks, Elijah was glad to see. Perhaps they would head off the riots.</p><p>They tooled silently along, the drip from the oars drowned out by the frequent howling shouts coming from the shore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up ahead,\u201d Twiddy finally said with a grunt.</p><p>Elijah leaned forward, braced on the gunwale, and caught sight of the golden pearl that was the Peregrine. From this distance it seemed to be a glistening dream from a fairy tale, shimmering from the touch of a magic wand. But between them and the yacht floated two broken-down hulks, prisons for men who rotted in chains.</p><p>\u201cMost of them don\u2019t live the first year,\u201d Twiddy said. It was like a curse under his breath.</p><p>Elijah had argued against the hulks for years now. \u201cIn fact, one-fourth die in the first three years,\u201d he said.</p><p>Twiddy\u2019s oars froze. \u201cYou know about them? I thought none of you even thought about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought for a bill against using the hulks as prisons. I lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bill.\u201d He spat.</p><p>\u201cIn the House of Lords.\u201d</p><p>They drifted slowly past the first ship. The decks were thronged with guards. Clearly they, if not the king, knew about the impending riots, though whether they would be able to stop the conflagration hitting their own boat was debatable. One more ship lay between Elijah and the yacht.</p><p>Twiddy was edging along the shore, so close that reeds bent into the rowboat and brushed past Elijah\u2019s elaborate coat. \u201cHist,\u201d he said, so quietly that his voice was just another shush from the reeds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah looked. The last hulk had no redcoats on the deck. It wasn\u2019t thronged with marauding prisoners either, though.</p><p>\u201cEmpty,\u201d Elijah breathed.</p><p>Twiddy shook his head. His oars came up and Elijah saw that his hands were shaking. Elijah took off his signet ring and handed it to Twiddy. They both stared down at the sapphire; it caught the light of the torch and sent back a flare of blue fire.</p><p>\u201cBring it back to me if we\u2019re separated,\u201d Elijah said.</p> <p>\u201cTell them it\u2019s my pass if you\u2019re caught.\u201d</p><p>Twiddy\u2019s hand closed on the ring and it disappeared into his clothing.</p><p>They were almost past the hulk, sliding up to the king\u2019s yacht on the far side. Music spilled from the deck and Elijah could see brilliantly colored forms meeting and separating. He watched as a plump woman laughed, tilting her head so far back that her tall wig was in danger of toppling.</p><p>Twiddy steered to the side of the yacht and threw a rope up to a servant, who reeled it in after a quick look at Elijah. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the duchess,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cShe\u2019ll see it as an adventure. We\u2019ll continue on\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that moment the yacht lurched, as if a giant hand had lifted it slightly into the air and thrown it back down.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d Twiddy said with a harsh gasp of air.</p><p>The black, silent prison ship, the one that had appeared devoid of life, had broken free of its moorings, struck the Peregrine, and rebounded away.</p><p>Elijah gave a mighty heave and pulled himself onto the deck. \u201cTwo minutes!\u201d he shouted, looking down at Twiddy. The footman had run off, so he tied the rope from Twiddy\u2019s bark to the gold-plated railing and plunged into the throng of screaming nobles.</p><p>His heart was pounding and he forced himself to walk rather than run. Where was Jemma? He saw many he knew: one of the royal dukes; Lady Fibble fainting in the arms of her husband; Lord Randulf looking particularly idiotic, with his wig knocked askew.</p><p>He had to peer around high piles of white curls, looking for his wife. She might wear roses and jewels in her hair, but never sailing ships or replicas of bridges.</p><p>There she was. On the other side of the crowd milling at the railings, waiting calmly. She must believe that there had been a small accident, he thought. But in his gut he knew that the silent, dark prisoners\u2019 warship, now coming closer to the yacht, wasn\u2019t accidentally drifting in the Thames.</p> <p>Jemma was at the very end of the line to board the small boats for shore, her eyes searching the deck. Looking for him.</p><p>Then he was running toward her, twisting through the crush of people. They were flooding to the railing, which made it easier. The king\u2019s servants were lowering boats. He caught sight of His Majesty with a boatful of laughing courtiers, being rowed to shore, and still the hulk drifted closer.</p><p>Then he had her, gave her one hard kiss and pulled her back to the railing where Twiddy was waiting. The hulk was almost on the boat again. Noblemen were laughingly filling the boats that had come out from shore to rescue them, paying no attention to the seemingly dead ship.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014Why, Elijah,\u201d Jemma said, breathlessly.</p><p>He picked her up and dropped her into Twiddy\u2019s hands as if she were no more than a load of laundry. Then he vaulted the railing himself and landed in the back of Twiddy\u2019s boat. There was no need to give the man orders.</p><p>Twiddy had an oar ready to push them away from the yacht. He jammed it back down into the water and threw his whole weight against the current to push them ahead of the two boats as quickly as he could.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d Jemma cried, just as a pistol barked.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d he shouted, and lunged forward, pushing her into the bottom of the boat and covering her with his body. Twiddy swore under his breath, rowing with all his might and main.</p> <p>Elijah looked up to see the deck of the hulk thronged with prisoners. Five, or perhaps six, had taken a wild leap onto the deck of the royal yacht. A dilatory nobleman yelled and then fell into the water, making a fine splash. Twiddy gave another great heave, and the span of water between themselves and the yacht grew into a dark well.</p><p>Elijah let Jemma sit up. Her hair was tumbling about her shoulders, though she looked as beautiful as ever. The shore was brightly lit now, thronged with the king and his courtiers, with the little boatloads still coming ashore. And on the deck of the Peregrine, convicts waved their pistols and roared their defiance.</p><p>Twiddy shook his head and looked away, grunting at the force he put into rowing.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoners,\u201d Jemma breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have been hurt,\u201d he said. She was so beautiful. It wasn\u2019t her golden hair nor the color of her eyes, nor the lush shape of her bosom. It was the way her lips curled, the way her eyes laughed at him, the slender fingers she held out to him. He took her hand and carefully pulled off her glove. Then he pressed her palm to his lips.</p><p>The very touch of that small palm against his lips made his heart beat faster than it had while running, while jumping the horse, while diving into the boat.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she whispered, her eyes still on his.</p><p>And then she was in his lap, and Twiddy rowed away up the great River Thames while the Duke of Beaumont kissed his wife.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jemma looked flushed, happy and excited. More happy than Elijah had seen her look in...oh...forever. Perhaps since the early days of their marriage.</p><p>They didn\u2019t show each other joy, not anymore.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t happy merely because they were away from the river, and safe on their way home. He caught her off the seat of the hackney and kissed her just because he could. And because the moment when she melted into his arms, when her arms came around his, wasn\u2019t anything he remembered from their awkward beddings years ago.</p><p>There was only one thought in his mind, beating through his body with the force of a tidal wave. The minute they entered the house, he would carry her up the stairs. The hell with any servants who might be watching. He would take her straight into his bedchamber.</p><p>Finally, after years, he was taking his wife. She was his again. His\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know each other,\u201d Jemma whispered. She was seated on his lap, her head tucked into the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI do know you. Your name is Jemma, and you are my wife.\u201d And soon I mean to know you in another fashion, he added silently.</p><p>\u201cWe separated for nine years,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cWe bungled our marriage before. I don\u2019t want to rush into this. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and nipped her lip. \u201cI promise you that I never rush.\u201d</p><p>She gurgled with laughter at that, and then fell silent again when he took her mouth with all the urgency in his heart. Time was finally on his side, had finally brought them together. It felt more important than life, even than death\u2014</p><p>She interrupted that thought. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that we need to spend more time together. Almost as if we were courting, if that makes sense.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell her...No. He wouldn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll woo you,\u201d he said, snatching up her fingers for a kiss. A horrifying thought crossed his mind. \u201cJemma, you\u2019re not suggesting that we shouldn\u2019t sleep together tonight, are you?\u201d Every muscle in his body froze at the thought.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She said it clearly, meeting his eyes. For all her sophistication, his Jemma was not the sort to banter when the subject was most important. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek, letting his voice fall to a seductive timbre. \u201cWhere will you be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>But two could play at that game. She turned her face, caught his lips, breathed into the secret silence of his mouth. \u201cWith you.\u201d And then, again, even quieter: \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had turned a smoky blue, a color he would gladly look at every day of his life.</p><p>His heart stopped for a moment, kept going.</p> <p>\u201cBut I shall woo you, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen don\u2019t woo,\u201d he said, not really listening. He was trying to ignore the beating of his heart, as syncopated as the raindrops just beginning to fall on the roof of the carriage.</p><p>Her smile sent a flare of heat up his spine. \u201cI have never paid much attention to that sort of rule. I do not need to be wooed, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou do. Could you perhaps take some time for yourself in the next few weeks? Persuade Pitt and the rest of them that the country will survive without your help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m won,\u201d he said. His voice sounded dark and low.</p><p>\u201cConsider me wooed and won, Jemma. Please.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing against his mouth, pulling away. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a mistress, Jemma. There\u2019s no one to win me from, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Though I am glad to hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since you discovered us on my desk,\u201d he said, coming out with the somber truth of it. \u201cAnd no one else either.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes grew round.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I decided it was you\u2014or no one.\u201d She seemed too stunned to speak. He bit back a smile. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we consider me won?\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m wooing you because I want it to be different than it was nine years ago. Because you and I, Elijah, we will be together until we\u2019re old and gray.\u201d</p><p>It was one of the great acts of courage in his life to smile at her. \u201cAnd how does the Duchess of Beaumont woo, when she puts her mind to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI used to enjoy receiving poetry, but somehow I can\u2019t see myself breaking into verse. Perhaps we\u2019ll start with chess. We have a game left to play in our match. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>The carriage was swinging around the corner. They would be home in a moment. Blood thrummed through his body with a dark promise of pleasure.</p><p>He forced himself to sound light rather than desperate, laughing rather than lustful. \u201cHow could I not? You owe me a last game. I seem to remember that there were a few rules attached to that game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re to play blindfolded,\u201d she said. He could hear the faintest tremor of desire in her voice, just the promise of huskiness. But he meant to make her cry aloud with pleasure, grip his shoulders, beg for more.</p> <p>\u201cBlindfolded and in bed,\u201d he said slowly, tracing a pattern on her knee. He felt as if his fingers burned through her skirts, as if he caressed the pale perfection of her thigh instead of just rumpling her gown. \u201cAn unusual style of wooing, Jemma. But I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ll enjoy my wooing,\u201d she said, her voice as smug as a little girl with a pocket full of boiled sweets. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll let you steal my pawns.\u201d</p><p>He was too hungry to consider her teasing, even to care about it. The carriage was finally, finally, coming to a halt. He curbed himself, drawing on years of self-control practiced in front of the House of Parliament. Of course he wouldn\u2019t throw his wife on a bed and leap on her like a wild dog.</p><p>Jemma left the carriage before him, bending down to avoid striking her head on the door. Her bottom swayed for a tantalizing moment in the doorway of the carriage. Even given the absurd panniers she wore, the rounding of silk at her rump made him reckless, drunk with the need to touch her. He was in the grip of a raging passion that threatened to turn him into a man that he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize her either.</p><p>In the flick of an eyelash she lost that edge of sensuality and hunger he saw in the carriage. She greeted Fowle at the top of the steps, looking regal, as if she hadn\u2019t just been rescued from a yacht at the very moment of disaster. As if she was as cool and uncaring as any other duchess out for tea.</p><p>Elijah took the steps two at a time. Jemma glanced over her shoulder at him as she handed her gloves to a footman. \u201cI was just telling Fowle that Mr. Twiddy will be arriving tomorrow to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d lost his mind, he backed straight into the drawing room, grabbing her wrist and swirling her with him, slamming the door in his butler\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d Jemma said, sounding amused. \u201cI assure you that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swooped on her. Took her mouth with all the desperate wish he had to claim her, to make her his. In every sense of the word. He possessed her mouth, kissed her savagely, with all the fear he felt when he saw her on the Peregrine, standing there unprotected, without him. Anything could have happened to her. Anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d His voice had nothing in common with a statesman\u2019s even tenor. It was deep, savage, knowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth again, stealing her words, telling her silently that she had no choice, that he would be the one to pleasure her, that the danger they had just gone through was only a shadow of what would happen if she ever tried to push him away.</p><p>\u201cI let you go, years ago,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. Her voice had a breathy catch in it, an echo of desire that reverberated deep in his body.</p><p>\u201cI will never let you go again.\u201d His voice grated with the truth of it.</p><p>She looked shocked. He didn\u2019t give a damn. Then she started smiling, and something deep inside his heart relaxed. That was a wicked smile. There was anticipation there...</p><p>\u201cYou can woo me tomorrow,\u201d he said, voice guttural, unrecognizable. \u201cTonight is another kind of event altogether.\u201d</p><p>She had been shocked but was recovering herself now. \u201cSo no chess?\u201d Her pout said that she knew precisely what her deep bottom lip did to him.</p><p>\u201cJemma.\u201d He said it low and soft. His heart was dancing a wayward rhythm, and urgency gave his voice an edge.</p><p>\u201cI must take a bath!\u201d she said, laughing. He had her backed against the door, hunkering over her like a great beast.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Elijah, I must insist. I have been thrown into a boat and splashed with river water. I am...\u201d She paused and gestured with mock horror. \u201c...not myself.\u201d Vulnerability glimmered deep in those exquisite eyes of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be beautiful to me if you were bathed in mud,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s call for the bath and I\u2019ll act as your maid.\u201d</p><p>Even in the dark, with no light other than that filtering through the windows, he could see a stain of color in her cheeks. \u201cI bathe alone, always.\u201d</p><p>He bent closer. \u201cAfter tonight I shall know every nook and cranny of your body, Jemma.\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cBathing will just hasten the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a great deal of confidence in yourself,\u201d she said, looking a bit uncertain, not like the arrogant duchess who had ruled Paris with her wit and beauty.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou see? You\u2019re getting to know me better already. There\u2019s no need for a courtship between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But his wife was no malleable young miss. She pulled back. \u201cI will welcome you in my bedchamber in one hour, Duke.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t protest again. They weren\u2019t children. His Jemma might have taken a lover or two in Paris during the years they were apart, but clearly she had granted the poor Frenchmen no real intimacies.</p><p>So he kissed her again. With all the knowledge he had that she was the only woman for him, that she\u2019d been so for years.</p><p>With the knowledge that time was not his friend, and that if she took too long to woo him, he wouldn\u2019t be there for their last kiss.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jemma found it hard to formulate sentences, though luckily her maids were so excited about the riots that they didn\u2019t notice in the midst of their chatter.</p><p>One moment she was starkly terrified, and the next moment her whole body flushed with heat. It felt as if she faced a slide into some sort of delicious madness, a kind of wild state in which one had no concern for what others thought. She had an idea that Elijah was already there. Thinking of Fowle\u2019s startled face when Elijah slammed the door almost made her laugh aloud.</p><p>She was still in her bath when she heard a discreet knock. Brigitte bustled back into the room a moment later, her eyes shining. \u201cWe should finish your bath, Your Grace. The duke is requesting that you join him for a light supper in his bedchamber. The meal is already served and he has dismissed his valet for the night.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte\u2019s voice betrayed her excitement. For a second all three maids froze, and then rushed into chatter about inconsequentials. Jemma rose and allowed herself to be toweled off. How strange it was that four women would all understand exactly what was to happen tonight and still say nothing of it.</p> <p>The maids knew, of course, that she and Elijah had not slept together for years. They likely knew that she had returned from Paris due to the duchy\u2019s need for an heir; they almost certainly knew that she had a foolish infatuation for her husband.</p><p>Brigitte drew a nightgown from the wardrobe and held it up for approval. She had chosen Jemma\u2019s most extravagant, most French, most utterly delicious garment. It was made of a rosy silk so thin as to be translucent. The neck fell very low, and was embroidered with a thick tangle of red roses that called attention to her breasts.</p><p>She nodded, and Brigitte slipped the gown over her head. It followed the curves of her body and then flounced into a tiny train at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put roses in your hair,\u201d Mariette said, wielding a hairbrush like a sword.</p><p>\u201cThat seems rather elaborate,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cJust a rose or two.\u201d The maid smiled with a Frenchwoman\u2019s suggestive charm. \u201cNothing more than a little one tucked here or there.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma looked in the glass and felt, not for the first time in her life, a bone-deep gratitude for her beauty. As an intelligent person, she had never allowed herself to fall into the trap of thinking that beauty made her a person of greater worth.</p><p>But if one had to face appallingly frightening\u2014and yet exciting\u2014events, it helped to be beautiful. It gave one backbone. Her hair fell in lazy honey-colored waves down her back, and the little roses gave her the look of a wanton matron prancing off to some sort of pagan holiday. The kind that involved spring woods and satyrs, Jemma thought, seeing the pink high in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cQuite nice,\u201d Brigitte said, coming forward again.</p><p>\u201cA patch, perhaps? Just one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am preparing for bed, not a ball,\u201d Jemma protested.</p><p>But Brigitte wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cJust there,\u201d she murmured, pressing a small velvet patch just above the corner of Jemma\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe bisous\u2014the kissing patch. And a touch of lip color.\u201d</p><p>Jemma reached for her favorite pot of color, but Brigitte presented her with another. \u201cMore rose than crimson this evening, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>It truly was a strange life, one in which her maids dictated the color of her lips and the flowers in her hair. She turned and gave them a huge smile. There was no need to speak, after all. They were servants and friends, and in their eyes she read the hope that her evening would be a pleasurable one.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I should join His Grace before our meal cools. You may all retire for the night.\u201d</p><p>They curtsied and left, unspoken encouragement floating in the air behind them.</p><p>Jemma took a deep breath. Now it came down to herself and Elijah. Their marriage had been an embittering, desolate thing so far. But it had changed\u2014and they had changed. The night could be one of joy.</p><p>And tenderness. She had learned in their years apart that while pleasure was desirable, tenderness was far more rare, and far more valuable.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and opened the door to her bedchamber.</p><p>Elijah came awake all of a sudden. He always did. The slide into unconsciousness was like drifting into darkness. Generally when he woke after one of these spells, it was to find himself staring into the frightened face of someone who thought he was dead. That was a bracing sensation.</p><p>Then he would find his heart beating wildly in his chest, trying, one had to assume, to catch its rhythm again, keep itself going.</p><p>When he had fainted in front of the House of Lords, he had woken to find a shocked Lord Cumberland shaking him. The Duke of Villiers had actually slapped him on finding him in the library. Once he awoke in an armchair to find Fowle shouting in his ear. The butler had backed away, dull red rising in his cheeks.</p><p>But this was the worst.</p><p>Jemma\u2019s face was utterly drained of color. Her fingers, wrapped around his wrists, were trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Her voice wobbled like a child\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cPlease, tell me this is a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>He managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your heart,\u201d she said. \u201cYour heart...your heart is faltering, just as your father\u2019s did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead, Jemma. I\u2019m almost accustomed to these spells now. I could live for years like this, fainting occasionally.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands, and her fingers fell from his wrists. She was kneeling by his chair, just where she must have thrown herself. Elijah put a hand on her hair and a small rose tumbled into his lap. Like the roses one throws into the grave at funerals, he thought with a wrenching twist of self-pity.</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cOh God, Elijah, this can\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to tell you.\u201d Her hair was warm, thick and springy against his fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I fainted in the House last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014we\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wrapped a hand behind her neck and gently pulled her toward him. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself!\u201d she cried, terrified.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to fear that. The attack is over.\u201d He reached down and scooped her up, sitting back with his wife curled into his lap.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said a moment later. \u201cI won\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re so young and we were going to have children and grow old together.\u201d</p><p>He put his cheek against her hair. \u201cLife should not be measured by time. The only thing that counts is how one uses the time one has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew before last year, before you summoned me home from Paris, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked suddenly. She was shivering in his arms as if a frigid wind were blowing through the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father died at thirty-four. I\u2019d have been a fool not to question my ability to live much over that date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was eight years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d She was moaning it, her hands clutching his shirt.</p> <p>\u201cIt drove me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a passion, to make sure that my life came to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your father\u2019s didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no time. I hated him for a while. But then I realized that he hadn\u2019t my advantage. He had no idea. He was young; he might have proved himself a man had he lived another forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife allowed him to be foolish. Oh, Elijah, you never had the chance to be foolish. I\u2019m just so\u2014so sorry.\u201d</p><p>They were silent a moment. Jemma\u2019s eyes were dry, and fierce, like those of a mother hawk. \u201cIf you die before me...Well, whenever you get to where you\u2019re going, Elijah, you sit down and wait for me.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at that. \u201cWhat do you envision? A bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly unimaginative. But I want to find you waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will wait for you,\u201d he said, kissing her again.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, when I fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was no sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cBut yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. It generally happens when I sit down. It\u2019s as if the darkness just gathers itself up and comes over me. There\u2019s just a little pain when I wake up, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works hard to bring me back. And it does bring me back, Jemma. In that sense, the attacks are no worse than they were a year ago: I wake up every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so brave,\u201d she said, her hands moving quickly. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it; I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand on her cheek but didn\u2019t know what to say. Words came to him easily when he was in front of the House of Lords. But he became tongue-tied at the most important moments of his life, and all of those were with his wife.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done, Jemma. I shall just live until I can\u2019t anymore. People die unexpectedly every hour.\u201d Unfortunately, his attacks were always followed by a headache, and he could feel its iron grip tightening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you when you say it doesn\u2019t hurt, Elijah. Your eyes are tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a headache. Fowle has something for it.\u201d</p> <p>She was up in a flash, ringing the bell for his valet.</p><p>\u201cFowle knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to tell you. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVickery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Vickery didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow it. Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Villiers and not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He found me one day, in the library.\u201d Elijah stood with some difficulty, given that his head felt as if it were a blacksmith\u2019s anvil, pounded by blows from a sledgehammer.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Jemma said. She came back and pushed him a little. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical exertion is necessary,\u201d Elijah told her, brushing her mouth with his. \u201cI have lived past my father\u2019s life span because I am fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know when an attack is likely to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have begun to entertain the idea that they result from moments of sudden, great exertion. The time I fainted in the House, for example, I felt passionately angry about my subject. And this evening, when I saw you on the yacht, I was so alarmed that my heart lost its rhythm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must stop being so exhausted.\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cYou could stay in bed!\u201d</p><p>Elijah smiled wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s not a cure, but a prison. The attacks don\u2019t happen constantly, Jemma. I likely won\u2019t have another one for a week.\u201d He rolled his head from side to side, trying to ease the pressure that clamped his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve found that taking exercise is very helpful. If my heart begins to beat irregularly, I can head off an attack by going for a ride. Forcing my heart into a regular rhythm helps it remember the correct pattern.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cI have every belief that marital intimacy will achieve precisely the same effect.\u201d</p><p>But she just scowled at him. \u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201d she said hotly.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s found a cure for a broken heart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot in any sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>She did cry then, and he found himself cursing his heart, not for the fact that it was broken, but for its ability to break other hearts.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>March 27</p><p>Jemma rose the next morning with the emptiness that follows grief. The night before, she had forced Elijah to drink a posset, and then left. She had returned to her room, plucked a few wilted roses from her hair, washed her face, changed into a nice cotton nightdress\u2014and cried for hours.</p><p>Not that crying did any good. She came to only one conclusion: Elijah must leave his work with Pitt. The unremitting work and frantic pace could not be good for his health.</p><p>Likely Elijah was right in his assessment that he wasn\u2019t going to die today or tomorrow. But if he dropped the frenzied pace and the extraordinary hours of work generated by the House of Lords, he might be alive in a year. Or five years. Or...</p><p>She dressed carefully, avoiding Brigitte\u2019s eyes. The household knew of their master\u2019s heart problem now, of course. There was a distressed silence perceptible in the very air.</p><p>Elijah wasn\u2019t in the breakfast room. When Fowle announced that His Grace had been summoned to an emergency meeting at the chief magistrate\u2019s office, Jemma felt rage swell into that empty place in her heart.</p><p>\u201cDid the duke leave a note?\u201d she asked, and knew the answer already, of course.</p><p>Fowle cleared his throat. \u201cSince the messenger came at dawn, His Grace merely asked me to give you his most sincere apologies.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was killing himself. And for what? So the government of England would run more smoothly for one day, or even a week?</p><p>\u201cHe was not entirely certain what time he would be able to return,\u201d Fowle continued, laying a carefully ironed copy of the Morning Post before her.</p><p>It was absurd to feel this angry at Elijah. And yet\u2014how could he simply leave without a word, after what had happened last night? What if he died during the day? Would he leave her without a kiss, without a word? Realizing that thought would just lead to tears, she cut it off.</p><p>\u201cMy husband said he wouldn\u2019t be home for the evening meal, didn\u2019t he, Fowle?\u201d she asked, hearing the peculiar deadness of her own voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that His Grace did indicate the possibility that he would not return until late tonight,\u201d Fowle replied, jumping straight to another subject with the adroitness of an experienced butler. \u201cThe duke left instructions with me about sending Mr. Twiddy to Swallowhill, should that person present himself today. The butler at Swallowhill has told me of the difficulty he has retaining garden laborers. I am sure he will be grateful for the help.\u201d</p><p>So Elijah had not forgotten Twiddy, though he appeared to have forgotten his wife. Anger burned in Jemma\u2019s chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The butler put down another paper. \u201cI have also the Morning Chronicle, Your Grace. They are comparing the riots to the Gordon Riots four years ago. Though thank the Lord, there were fewer casualties and the Clink is unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Elijah had looked so exhausted last night. He was utterly delectable even tired, of course. His dark eyebrows and dark eyes emphasized his cheekbones, giving him the raw beauty of a marble statue of a Roman statesman. Or perhaps it was the expression in his eyes: all that serious passion in the service of good had chiseled his face.</p><p>If he had been in the room, Jemma would have screamed at him like a common fishwife.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he be selfish for once? He must give up his seat in the House of Lords. Corbin was right, though for the wrong reasons. Elijah needed to enjoy himself, rather than get up at dawn and leave for pressured meetings about riots and floating prisons.</p> <p>She stared blindly down at the paper, reading one sentence over and over again. It was the beginning of a piece about a hoax carried out near St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Convinced that the devil had taken up residence in his sitting room, Mr. Bartlebee gave a conjurer a gold chain to exorcise the unwanted guest, she read. And then read it again.</p><p>And then finally moved on to the next sentence. Mr. Bartlebee\u2019s son Jeremy was equally convinced of the devil\u2019s presence...</p><p>How could they have children now? When Elijah was a child he had had white-blond curls, which implied that their children might have had the same. A darling young boy with Elijah\u2019s beauty and his serious eyes drifted in her mind\u2019s eye. Her throat tightened and she turned back to her buttered toast.</p><p>There was nothing she could do\u2014nothing. The knowledge was bitter in the back of her throat. Even the idea of playing chess felt horrible, like fiddling as Rome burned. She was desperate to find a plan, something she could do to help.</p><p>The only thing she could come up with was paltry indeed. If her husband didn\u2019t have very long to live, then it was up to her to make certain that he enjoyed every moment. That meant following Corbin\u2019s plan. Wooing Elijah. Winning him from another woman. Or was Elijah supposed to win her from another man?</p> <p>She found herself staring at the account in the paper again. Given the lingering smell of sulfur, the constable asserted that a devil of some sort had paid a call to the sitting room.</p><p>She could not flirt with another man merely so Elijah could win her. The falseness of it curdled in her stomach. Even if he had cheerfully jaunted off to work, without even bothering to leave her a note, she could not flirt with someone merely for fun. Surely she could orchestrate a seduction\u2014or an attempted seduction\u2014of Elijah. There was only the matter of determining her rival. He knew all the English ladies of her acquaintance, and anyway, they were\u2014</p><p>She froze, the toast halfway to her mouth.</p><p>For the eight years that she lived in Paris, she had had one great rival, the Marquise de Perthuis. Their sparring matches were known throughout the city. They competed against each other in fashion, in dress, and in manner. They excelled at insulting each other under the mask of an apparent compliment.</p><p>The marquise was now in England, and Elijah hardly knew her. Louise was consummately witty, but not so beautiful that she made Jemma\u2019s liver curl. The question was only how to drive the marquise to Elijah\u2019s side.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an easy proposition. The marquise cherished her milk-white reputation. Jemma knew it wasn\u2019t for the sake of virtue itself; Louise was so besotted by her loose fish of a husband that she likely never even looked at another man.</p> <p>The only way Louise would dance to her tune would be out of rage. That posed a challenge: to convince the marquise to attempt a seduction of Elijah, without that lady having the faintest idea of her intentions. It would be a fiendishly difficult task. Machiavellian, really.</p><p>Jemma finished her toast, forcing herself to read the paper\u2019s account of the prisoners\u2019 riot. Before recapture, the prisoners had burned a number of houses, though they were barred from a large area of the city due to the forethought of the citizens, who had defended themselves by erecting impenetrable barriers.</p><p>The Morning Post issued a challenge to the mayor of London and to Pitt\u2019s cabinet: How had it come to pass that common citizens had to defend themselves, using brooms and trash cans? Why wasn\u2019t the Queen\u2019s Royal Regiment called in to quell the violence of these criminals?</p><p>Jemma couldn\u2019t bear to read any longer. It just made her think of the speeches Elijah would undoubtedly be called upon to make in the House. She threw the paper aside and rose.</p><p>\u201cI must be at my most elegant,\u201d she told Brigitte a moment later. \u201cI shall go to visit the marquise. I caught a glimpse of her on the king\u2019s yacht last night, so I know that she is currently in London.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte\u2019s eyes widened and she set to work with the concentrated fervor of a lady\u2019s maid whose work would be judged by the best\u2014her rival femme de chambre. A few hours later Jemma tripped into the marquise\u2019s drawing room, fit to dine with Queen Marie Antoinette herself.</p><p>She was wearing, unusually for her, a wig. Unlike the rather tatty and (she felt) dirty wigs that she commonly saw in ballrooms, hers was made of white curls so delicate that they shone like spun sugar in the morning sunlight. They rose to an exuberant height, but rather than supporting an entire birdcage with its songbird or anything of that ridiculous nature, Mariette had simply tucked a few pale blossoms among the curls.</p><p>With it she wore an exquisite morning gown of the same pink as the blossoms, the skirts caught back to show a deeper, rosy underskirt with a border of amber gold. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, to Jemma\u2019s mind, was her shoes: delicate high-heeled slippers in rose-colored silk, with tiny gold buckles.</p> <p>She had been seated a mere twenty minutes before the marquise appeared. Jemma rose, dropping into a short curtsy. It was a signal honor, indicating that she was overlooking their difference in rank. The marquise fell into a deeper curtsy, the sort that recognized the delicate compliment Jemma had just given her, and topped it with an expression of deep respect.</p><p>Finally they managed to seat themselves, on opposing sofas, naturally, given the width of their skirts. The marquise was even more elegantly attired than was Jemma. As a matter of course, the marquise never wore any colors other than black and white, a rather eccentric notion that complemented her dark eyes and hair. This morning her gown was white and embroidered with elaborate swirls of black silk.</p><p>Jemma thought about that costume while they went through the motions of drinking tea and chatting about the riots. Hadn\u2019t Elijah once said that the marquise looked like a chessboard?</p><p>\u201cHow do you find yourself?\u201d Jemma asked, watching the marquise over the edge of her teacup. \u201cThe last time I saw you, you were on your way to Lincolnshire...\u201d She allowed her voice to trail off in a tactful invitation.</p><p>The marquise\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cI did locate my husband, or at least where he had been. There was a village where he stayed with this\u2014this putain that he followed to England. I made my footmen inquire.\u201d</p><p>The pained edge to her voice made her humiliation clear. \u201cApparently he and the woman were together, and then he suddenly left. She stayed a mere day or two longer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they are no longer together!\u201d Jemma exclaimed. \u201cHe left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Louise\u2019s tone lightened. \u201cThe villagers were very clear about that. Henri simply left. He must have been desperate to get away from her; there was some talk that he discarded his clothing in the inn where they were staying, though I don\u2019t hold with that notion. Henri is not the sort to travel without proper accoutrements. I expect he went back to France.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She picked up a lemon tart. \u201cI found it hard to believe that he ever left France for this woman, even in the throes of the deep love he felt.\u201d She spat the last sentence.</p><p>\u201cWill you follow him across the Channel directly?\u201d Jemma enquired.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cCan you imagine? He might think that I pursued him to England because of some anxiety about his degenerate activities.\u201d She magnificently ignored the fact that she had followed her husband for just that reason. Instead she gave a careless shrug. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be less concerned about what he does, and he is perfectly aware of that fact. I shall stay here for as long as I please. London is an enchanting place, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jemma translated that statement into a declaration that Louise would stay in London just as long as necessary to assure that her husband dared not question her presence in this country.</p> <p>It was time for an insult, one ruthless enough to send Louise directly into a towering fury. Jemma shook open her fan and held it so that it covered the lower part of her face, as if she were preparing to say the unsayable. Fans were so useful to the art of the insult. She pitched her voice low and confidential. \u201cMy dear marquise, if you\u2019d ever like some guidance in the matter of husbands, you need not do more than ask.\u201d</p><p>Louise narrowed her eyes. \u201cAdvice of what sort, dear duchess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mere suggestion,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut have you considered altering your\u2014\u201d She waved her hand as if she couldn\u2019t even think of the word.</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must be frank between ourselves, must we not?\u201d Jemma said, lowering her fan to chin level to bestow a lavish smile. \u201cI mean, of course, between close friends like ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturellement,\u201d the marquise said, every inch of her rigid body showing just how much she disliked frankness.</p><p>\u201cYou wear the most sophisticated costumes in the French court. Your ensemble is only equaled by that of Marie Antoinette herself. Your face is always exquisite, your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so.\u201d Coldness sliced through Louise\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet.\u201d Jemma sighed. \u201cOne cannot ignore the fact that you look...oh just slightly...like a chessboard, dearest marquise. What man wants to sleep with a chessboard? You do not dress like a woman who wants to seduce, but like a woman who wants to impress. To be noticed.\u201d Then she added, as a kindly afterthought, \u201cThough you are, of course, a most beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>Louise appeared to be grinding her teeth.</p><p>\u201cMy husband never strays,\u201d Jemma said, closing her fan. \u201cAnd why is that, Marquise? Why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t because you yourself have remained chaste,\u201d the marquise said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAlas, that is so true,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSo, so, so true. And yet my dearest Elijah never wandered during all the years I lived in France, never even looked at another woman. I wish for nothing more than for you to have the same happiness.\u201d Her smile was guaranteed to scrape the marquise\u2019s nerves like the squeal of rats in an alley. \u201cDear friends should always look out for each other\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe that Henri took this woman to Lincolnshire because he dislikes my \u00e9l\u00e9gance?\u201d One had to admire the marquise\u2019s command over her voice. She conveyed withering scorn with nothing more than a shading of tone.</p><p>It was time to move in for the kill. \u201cMy husband,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cnever, but never, looks at another woman. And why is that, my dear marquise? It is not only because my clothing is perhaps, shall we say, just slightly more graceful than your dogged wearing of black and white, but also because I do not wear my heart on my sleeve.\u201d</p><p>Little white marks had appeared on either side of Louise\u2019s nose. \u201cThis English term...I do not know it. Where is my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut for everyone to see. You never flirt. You stay to the side of a ballroom and gaze at Henri with your heart in your eyes. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now my heart is in my eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, most people do feel sympathy, though there are always the unkind who mock. You might try to seem a bit indifferent, my dear. A passion so flamboyant is bound to garner pity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah never looks at another woman,\u201d Jemma repeated, a bit worried about whether she was overdoing it.</p><p>But the marquise\u2019s nails had curled in such a way that strips of delicate paper shredded off her fan.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Jemma said, sitting up as if suddenly inspired. \u201cYou might strive to create a bit of a scandal here in England. Something that would cause a rumor to fly home to Paris, convincing your husband that he is not the only one to enjoy himself with matters of the heart.\u201d</p><p>Louise gave a savage little laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I should have trouble finding someone willing to overlook my chessboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, no,\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t take me too literally. When you say chessboard, it truly sounds as if I meant you were flat in the bodice, and of course I would never say such a thing! I have no doubt but that many men are delighted with a, shall we say, more modest offering.\u201d Her eyes gently slid away from the marquise\u2019s entirely adequate bosom, as if she were excusing a serious flaw.</p><p>She continued, \u201cOf course, women can be so cruel to each other. Why, the other day a bumbling lady of my acquaintance referred to you in the most disparaging terms\u2014she is really hopelessly ill-bred\u2014oh yes, I believe she mentioned a bird. Could it have been a crow?\u201d She gave a shrug. \u201cAt any rate, I defended you. I told her that you were the only woman I considered to have the wit and charm to rival the great courtesans.\u201d</p><p>Louise drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cI mean that as the greatest compliment,\u201d Jemma added. \u201cYou could have any man you wished. If you put your mind to it.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cOther than my dear Elijah, of course. He is so very devoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care for English men,\u201d the marquise said, chomping down on a lemon tart. \u201cFor the most part they are quite brutish in their manners. Their bows are too unformed, too unrefined.\u201d She waved her hand in the air. \u201cThey lack that sense of \u00e9l\u00e9gance that characterizes the French court. The beauty of the French poise and discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile your point about elegance is absolutely fair, some Englishmen have a kind of masculine beaut\u00e9 that I find appealing,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI have always thought that my husband, the Duke of Beaumont, looks rather like Gerard de Ridefort, but with less affectation. And you know that Marie Antoinette herself called de Ridefort the most beautiful man in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband,\u201d Louise said broodingly. \u201cDear me, I remember the strangest rumor. But I am sure it is no more than that.\u201d She opened her fan and waved it just below her eyes.</p><p>Jemma shrugged again. \u201cAny scandal that involves the duke is surely untrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d the marquise cried. \u201c\u2019Twas the reason why you moved to France, all those years ago. The foolish man declared himself in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mistress,\u201d Jemma said, her tone pitched to perfect indifference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what an excellent decision you made to come to Paris. I remember the first year when you arrived; you had no poise, none of the charm that comes with sophisticated taste. And now look at you!\u201d Louise raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo much older, and yet still with that sprightly, artless mode of dressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned so much in Versailles,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhy, you have no idea how innocent I was. I truly believed that the duke loved his mistress. I can hardly believe that I was so foolish as to flee to another country over a matter as paltry as a husband\u2019s lover!\u201d</p><p>The marquise took a moment to compose herself. \u201cDear me, all that agitation for a mistress,\u201d she said, fluttering her damaged fan vigorously.</p><p>\u201cI was very young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow fortunate that you retain your memory. So many people find it difficult to think back over that many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I am very possessive,\u201d Jemma added.</p><p>\u201cWhat is mine, is mine. I would naturally consider it the worst of insults if a woman dared to approach my husband. Even though my husband merely thought he loved his mistress, I could hardly contain my anger. Very childish of me, I know. In Paris I learned that the way to my husband\u2019s heart was to ignore his unrefined behavior.\u201d</p><p>The marquise picked up her third tart. \u201cI consider mistresses to be part of a man\u2019s world, a necessary adjunct, as it were. They parade and trade them the way women might trade fans. They are necessary to their sense of\u2014I don\u2019t know the word in English\u2014amour propre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir sense of vanity,\u201d Jemma translated. \u201cYes, I suppose you are right. But I was young and rash, and so I fled to France. Luckily, Elijah quickly learned his lesson. His eyes never stray to other women. I credit that to the fact I went to France and had a few dalliances of my own. He learned that what is sauce for the gander is even better for the goose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI fail to see how your dissipated behavior turned him into a saint,\u201d Louise said acidly.</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cJust think, Marquise. Your husband has never had to worry that your affections were caught by another man, one who would be a worthy competitor to himself. No, he is free to stray about, to fall in love, to act as foolishly as he wishes\u2014confident that you will be at home waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>The marquise chewed her tart rather savagely. \u201cI would never lower myself to his level!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you have never met a man whom you considered his equal,\u201d Jemma said soothingly. \u201cI myself am so fastidious about a man\u2019s appearance that I could not countenance your husband\u2019s adorable way of finishing every scrap of food that strays onto his plate. He has such an appetite! It\u2019s admirable in a man, of course,\u201d she added unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cDo you dare to suggest that Henri is fat?\u201d Louise inquired.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, of course not!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhy, a man his age should have a belly. It shows gravity of purpose. Seriousness. That sort of thing. Please do continue to eat, Marquise. I myself never eat sweet things in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>They both looked down at the plate. \u201cDear me!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even noticed they were all gone. At any rate, as we were saying, I do admire your husband. He\u2019s so modest...of course, he has much to be modest about.\u201d</p><p>There was a rigidity about the marquise\u2019s jaw that suggested to Jemma that perhaps she should stop before a plate broke over her head.</p><p>She sprang to her feet. \u201cWhat a lovely conversation this has been. I would give you the name of my mantua maker, but I never share her address, even with my very closest friends. She\u2019s by far the best in London, and if I pay her three times the price, she plucks gowns literally out of the air. I\u2019ve had a gown made for the following day!\u201d</p><p>Louise managed a good show of indifference. Of course, half of London knew that Jemma frequented the establishment of Madame Montesquieu, on Bond Street.</p><p>\u201cI do hope to meet you again soon, Marquise,\u201d Jemma said blithely. \u201cWe go to Vauxhall tomorrow night...well, I believe I\u2019ve never seen you there. Do you not care for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I had long planned to pay it a visit,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cDoes one not wear a domino there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no one would note my odious clothing,\u201d Louise said with a marked snap. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than curtsy, Jemma delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce. She held out her hand to be kissed.</p><p>Of course Louise bent her head over her hand with utmost grace. But her eyes swore revenge. Jemma left smiling.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t control everything. She couldn\u2019t control her husband\u2019s erratic heart. Elijah was important to the government and she was important to no one.</p><p>But she had her own rather particular skills.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>On the way back from the marquise\u2019s house, Jemma remembered that she had one problem left to solve in Francesch Vicent\u2019s 100 Chess Problems. She handed her pelisse to Fowle and headed directly for the library and her chessboard.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d the butler said. \u201cYou have callers.\u201d</p><p>But Jemma was already living inside the game. \u201cI can\u2019t talk now, Fowle. I\u2019ll just be in the library for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour gloves,\u201d the butler said, a wry smile in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jemma said, pulling them off.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers awaits,\u201d Fowle said, to her back.</p><p>She turned about, feeling a pulse of extreme annoyance. \u201cVilliers is here? What on earth is he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke paid you a call,\u201d Fowle said. \u201cSince the drawing room had a number of ladies waiting in it\u2014and they are still there\u2014he requested to be placed in the library. In front of the chess set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jemma said, smiling. \u201cI think those callers had better take themselves off, Fowle.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cDo they know of Villiers\u2019s visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d She turned to the library. \u201cI am suffering from a terrible headache, Fowle. Do give my apologies to all my visitors. And you might bring a light luncheon in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>As she walked into the room, the Duke of Villiers rose from the chessboard. Villiers was an odd mix of fashionable and its opposite. He disdained the mania for wigs, wearing his hair tied back in a ribbon, unpowdered of course. And yet he dressed as magnificently as she did.</p><p>In some ways, Villiers was the opposite of Elijah. He had none of Elijah\u2019s startling beauty: his face was too rough to be courtly, and his eyes too cold to be alluring. He cared nothing for the world\u2019s opinion, let alone its salvation. He had never taken up his seat in the House of Lords; as far as Jemma knew, his sole passion was the one she shared: chess.</p><p>Jemma actually felt a pulse of envy at the sight of his coat, an emotion rarely inspired by men\u2019s attire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself, Villiers,\u201d she said, by way of greeting. \u201cCream silk with interlocking chains in cherry embroidery. I\u2019ve never heard of such a coat. No, I\u2019ve never dreamed of such a coat.\u201d</p><p>Villiers fell into a bow as magnificent as his garment. \u201cI dreamed of it, though my tailor complained. It seems he feared I might become besmirched by dirt or spotted by rain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cRain would not dare spot His Grace, the Duke of Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirt is something that happens to others,\u201d he said, with that wicked laughter in his eyes. \u201cLike sin and bankruptcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, if you hope to avoid the blemish of sin,\u201d Jemma said, sitting down before the chessboard, \u201cI am not the one to give you an education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is one of the things I love about you,\u201d he said amiably. \u201cThe only thing I am certain about is the art of dress. Since you dress exquisitely on your own, I need not bother with advice. I do like your wig this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d Jemma agreed. She was wondering whether to speak to him of Elijah\u2019s heart. Better not. She might cry, a truly horrific thought.</p><p>She began swiftly rearranging the chess pieces. \u201cThe last time I spoke to you, Villiers, you flatly refused to play with me. I hope that your current position opposite me indicates that you have revoked your ban on the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband tells me that you have decided to forfeit the final game in our match,\u201d he said, sighing.</p><p>Jemma looked up quickly. \u201cYou discussed our match with Elijah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final game was to be blindfolded and in bed,\u201d he said mournfully. \u201cHow it pains me to give up the prospect. You can have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I am throwing the match! You win. Surely that makes you just as happy as being blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my astonishment, I find it does not,\u201d he said, looking faintly surprised.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I will give you the pleasure of playing a game,\u201d she said, promptly putting the pieces in order.</p><p>\u201cYou may be White, as it agrees with your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy coat is the color of rich cream,\u201d he said with a delicate shudder. \u201cNot White. I abhor white silk, and satin of that hue is even worse. It reminds me of angels. Saints. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with angels,\u201d Jemma observed. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the idea of feathery wings, though perhaps not halos. They sound like a particularly awkward kind of bonnet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you will like the reason I\u2019ve come to see you,\u201d Villiers said, moving a pawn forward. \u201cI am considering a bid for a halo of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d Jemma murmured. They played for a moment in silence. Villiers brought forward a rook and she challenged one of his pawns with her bishop.</p><p>\u201cI have a problem,\u201d Villiers said, not even pausing before he brought a knight into the contest.</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou, the Great Villiers, has that most plebeian of all human conditions\u2014a problem?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly tedious conundrum, or I wouldn\u2019t bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all are. Although I was of the opinion that unmarried men with no encumbrances had the fewest problems of any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, I seem to have acquired a few encumbrances, though, as yet, no wife,\u201d Villiers said thoughtfully. \u201cI have fallen into respectability without noticing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallen?\u201d Jemma said with a chortle. \u201cGiven those illegitimate children of yours, you should boast of the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVulgar,\u201d he said. \u201cUnworthy of you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma grinned at him. \u201cI find vulgarity so refreshing. From what I understand, children are a problem. Though surely the illegitimate type, tucked away out of sight and mind, cannot present very many problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thought exactly.\u201d His long fingers played with the pawn she had just knocked from the board.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you remember, while I was very ill following my regrettable duel last year, I made a promise about my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deathbed promise! Oh, the very worst kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdding unkindness to vulgarity,\u201d he said with mock severity.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d she said. \u201cTo whom did you make that promise, anyway? I don\u2019t remember hearing that any church folk were tenderly waiting by your bedside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was to Miss Charlotte Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>Jemma made a face before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cNo Puritan. Miss Learned Fetlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same one who spent too much time adoring your husband,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cI asked her to marry me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad she didn\u2019t accept you,\u201d Jemma said with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWho said she didn\u2019t accept me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my Twelfth Night ball I walked into my own sitting room to find her passionately clasped in the embrace of your heir. She wasn\u2019t nearly interesting enough to kiss him and marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you fret about whether she would be successful in pursuit of your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fretting. I would never do something as bourgeois as fret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were fretting,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cEyeing poor Elijah the way a rat eyes cheese. A true dog in the manger, in fact. \u2018I don\u2019t care to have him, but no one else can either.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to your problems,\u201d Jemma said, taking his rook.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I received a missive this morning informing me that my heir has irresponsibly and inappropriately married Miss Tatlock by special license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery romantic,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cYour tone is distinctly unkind. Unsympathetic, in truth. Do you know that is the second of my fianc\u00e9es to marry by special license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s wife and now Miss Tatlock. Tut tut, Villiers. Is that the problem you wish me to solve? Finding you a fianc\u00e9e who will actually stay with you, rather than dash off with a swashbuckling passerby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to enjoy my plight quite so much,\u201d Villiers said, moving a pawn forward. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t care for a wife. I have other pursuits in mind.\u201d</p><p>Jemma caught her breath. He looked up at her, his hand still holding the chess piece, and there was no mistaking which pursuit he was thinking of. All of a sudden her laughing friend was gone; his eyes were smoldering. She raced into speech. \u201cYour problem? What is it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak for a moment, letting her know that he saw her flimsy evasion. She couldn\u2019t help it; the flicker of amusement\u2014and recognition of desire\u2014in his eyes made the corners of her mouth curl into a smile. But there was nothing in her smile that betrayed Elijah. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d he said. \u201cI promised Charlotte that I would find her the perfect husband. She showed no faith in my abilities, and insisted that if I managed the task, I would have to turn father, when she turned wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she just turned wife!\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cYou are caught, Villiers, fairly caught!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to call me Leopold. I\u2019m sure we had reached that pitch of intimacy.\u201d</p><p>The air stilled in the room again. She fled back to the subject at hand. \u201cThe question is, what did she mean by turning father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said something about learning the children\u2019s names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do support them, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, knowing that he did. Even if he didn\u2019t entertain guilt, Villiers would never shirk a financial responsibility.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI gather that you need to understand the word \u2018fatherhood.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m finding the parameters hard to determine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I ever met your father. Mine taught me to play chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that,\u201d Villiers said, something easing in his expression.</p><p>Jemma sneaked a glance at him under her lashes. \u201cMy father taught me how to fight off an unwanted suitor, and threatened to kill me if I failed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Villiers said languidly, taking one of her knights. \u201cHow very violent.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt a prickle of irritation. Her father had been rightfully impassioned on the subject of rakes like Villiers. \u201cMost of what he taught us we learned from living with him. Fatherhood involves propinquity.\u201d</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cThe children are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many children are we talking about?\u201d Jemma demanded. And, when he didn\u2019t answer, \u201cYou do know the number, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But there are complications.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma swept a bishop off the board. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSix? You have six children out of wedlock?\u201d</p><p>His eyes focused on her fingers, still holding the bishop. \u201cConsidering the number of women I have made love to in my life, it seems a not inconceivable number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInconceivable? Who\u2019s vulgar now?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cAn inadvertent pun, I assure you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you had perhaps two children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be more careful,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever give a thought to the lives of those children, born out of wedlock? Or their mothers, bearing children without marriage lines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It was Jemma\u2019s turn to move, but she hesitated. She felt a bit sick. She liked Villiers. Leopold. She really liked him. She had even\u2014</p><p>\u201cI am a duke,\u201d he said. His voice was like dark velvet, impenetrable. \u201cWhy would I give a damn about that sort of thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least you pay for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could support a foundling hospital, and you would applaud my virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to populate your own orphanage,\u201d she said, her voice coming out more sharply than she intended. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable to think so little of the women that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he supplied. \u201cI think a great deal of some women I bed. Or hope to bed.\u201d</p><p>But this bit of gallantry was forced, and she flashed him a look of contempt.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the difference between six and two?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOne child out of wedlock is an error. Two suggests carelessness. Three\u2014and six\u2014is simply wrong. Wrong.\u201d</p><p>There was something in those dark eyes of his that made her anger diminish.</p><p>\u201cYou understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou simply don\u2019t appreciate the mental cast of a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me that your children\u2019s mothers were lucky to be impregnated by you, simply because of your rank!\u201d</p><p>There was a brief smile in his eyes. \u201cNo. I meant that I was brought up to think that everyone below me was unworthy. That my inherited money, power, and title gave me the right to do just as I please. And as it happens, I dislike French letters and I honored my dislike for some years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing honorable about that,\u201d Jemma said scathingly. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t have fourteen children! Who are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mothers. I know that a child of yours was born to a gentlewoman, Lady Caroline Killigrew. And that you refused to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cthat particular girl is not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean she doesn\u2019t count as one of the six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, but merely because she is in my care. I told you there were complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course the girl is yours. Lady Caroline told everyone. And her father told my Uncle Edmund that you admitted to bedding her and then refused to marry her. Everyone was so sympathetic and\u2014\u201d She met his eyes and caught herself. \u201cMy God. So who was the father?\u201d</p><p>Villiers shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. I certainly never bedded her. I think she must have been desperate. It seemed to me that as a gentleman I had to play my part in the script she had written.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she hoped you would be forced to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. If she wanted to acquire a husband, she would have accused someone of lower rank, someone who would be glad of the large dowry her father would offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved by your dukedom,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd yet you played the hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI refused to marry her. I merely restrained myself from pointing out the fact that I hardly knew her. She, for her part, did a wonderful job of lurking at the side of ballrooms and staring at me tragically, until her father whisked her off to Canada. The child was sent back to England a few months later with a quite disagreeable note about my role in its upbringing. What on earth could I do except accept her as my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where the mother is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo her child is one of my six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the five remaining mothers? Nightwalkers, all?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand. \u201cPlay your piece, Jemma. I intend to win. And no, there are no nightwalkers among them. I have a great deal of respect for myself, and the risk of disease in those encounters is appalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re splitting hairs,\u201d Jemma said, moving her king. \u201cCall them courtesans, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir station in life is irrelevant,\u201d he said with emphasis. Just as she hoped, he was focused on the conversation and didn\u2019t appear to notice that her remaining bishop would soon have his queen.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t agree, given that they are rearing your children. And I imagine they aren\u2019t teaching the children chess. Just imagine all the useful lessons the girls are learning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, only one child is being reared by her mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Then who cares for the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy solicitor makes sure that the children are well cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? Do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had a child, I would know where he was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, we have two items on the fathering list,\u201d he said, sighing. He was being surprisingly calm. The old Villiers, the pre-nearly-dead Villiers, would have stalked from the room long ago. \u201cAscertain who is raising them, and teach them chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe you ought to take them in yourself, as we discussed a few weeks ago,\u201d Jemma said, baiting him. \u201cAlthough I must admit that I thought we were talking of two children at that point.\u201d She moved a pawn, calculating the number of moves remaining before she seized his queen.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cYou were joking then, and I trust you are now as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! Is your hand on that pawn because you intend to move it?\u201d</p><p>He looked down with a slight frown and moved the piece. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChildren ought to live with their parents.

So, what we need to do is find you a wife...just the right kind of wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind who won\u2019t object to my children, you mean, because she has some illegitimate offspring of her own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would serve you right,\u201d she said, breaking into a laugh at the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should live with these children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no.\u201d She moved her bishop. \u201cCheck and mate.\u201d</p> <p>He stared down at the trap she\u2019d set. \u201cChrist! You distracted me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was so delicious to see your face when I suggested that you move the children into your house. Delicious!\u201d</p><p>He blinked at the board and looked at her. \u201cI might take in one child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take in one. Do you think that would be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough for what?\u201d Jemma stared at Villiers as if she\u2019d never seen him before. \u201cI was merely trying to win the game. And I won. Do you wish to trace your mistaken move?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cNo. You won. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I must think.\u201d</p><p>She sprang to her feet. \u201cThink about bringing illegitimate children into your house? I was only joking, Villiers! Truly. No respectable woman will marry you under those circumstances. I should never have said such a thing.\u201d</p><p>He rose and came one step toward her. He was tall, almost as tall as her husband, and she had to tilt her head up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry a respectable woman,\u201d he said. Slowly.</p><p>Oh God. There was something in those black eyes of his that she\u2019d never seen before. They had been flirting for almost a year now, ever since she had returned from France and challenged him to a chess match...A match that was never finished, and never would be. A match designed to end in bed.</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be serious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re married. You\u2019re married to my childhood friend, Elijah. And Elijah\u2014\u201d He seemed to change his mind and took a breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got you and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying, Jemma, that there aren\u2019t a lot of places a man can go after he has met you.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma felt the pleasure of that compliment deep in her gut, in her backbone, in all the silly places that a person can feel a compliment. And she knew why, too. Somewhere in her was still the forlorn young woman, desolated to find that her husband enjoyed the company of his mistress over that of his wife.</p><p>She shook her head. She would never be unfaithful to Elijah again. \u201cWe plan to have a child,\u201d she said, pretending there was nothing wrong with her husband\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI already have some children, and I think it\u2019s time I came to know them.\u201d Villiers stepped back, and she found herself reaching out a hand without conscious will. His tone was so sad and yet so self-accepting, with that flare of humor.</p><p>\u201cYou will fall in love with someone, Leopold. Someone will steal your heart before you notice it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI plan to visit Vauxhall tomorrow night; come and I will introduce you to the loveliest women of my acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>He bowed, said all the right things, and left.</p><p>Jemma sat in front of the game board for a long time, thinking that Villiers had changed. After finishing a game of chess, they used to play it backwards, dissect it three or four different ways, argue over moves. Now he\u2019d walked away after she\u2019d played the oldest, silliest ploy in the book, distracting him with a lively conversation.</p><p>The thing that made her uneasy, made her sit staring at the discarded pieces, was that she knew what was in his eyes when he looked at her. Not that she\u2019d seen it all that often.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t something he was supposed to feel. Not for her. Not for...not for anyone, except his wife, when he had one.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>By evening, Elijah had not yet returned to the house. Jemma ate in solitary splendor at nine; she dallied over her meal until ten and then retreated to the library. She fiddled with a chess problem and went over the household accounts.</p><p>But in reality, she watched the clock. She felt torn in two: one moment desperate just to see Elijah, the next torn by resentment and a furious determination to make him leave the House of Lords.</p><p>When her husband finally walked into the library, his face gaunt and exhausted, she wanted to throw herself into his arms, at the same time that she wanted to rail at him. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to choose: the presence of Fowle and the footmen made either an impossibility.</p><p>Elijah bent over her hand, kissing it as if she were the merest acquaintance. Fowle bustled across the room before they could exchange a word, followed by three footmen carrying a small table, covered dishes, and china.</p><p>Jemma walked back to her seat, feeling as if she were walking on broken glass. She, who was never at a loss for words, was struggling to formulate even the most trivial comment. They sat in silence as Fowle set the table before Elijah, uncovered a beefsteak, and poured him a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cIf you would be so kind as to leave the dishes, I will serve myself,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>Fowle pursed his lips in a scandalized kind of way, but Elijah sent him from the room with one look.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Elijah asked as the door closed behind Fowle and the footmen.</p><p>Jemma took a sip of brandy. \u201cOh, quite enjoyable,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI paid a visit to a friend in the morning, and I beat Villiers at a game of chess in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>A shadow crossed his eyes. \u201cHow is the duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Though he confessed that he has six illegitimate children.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s hand froze, a piece of steak halfway to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d Jemma repeated. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, he did not actually father Lady Caroline Killigrew\u2019s child. Do you remember all the fuss when he refused to marry her?\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was astonishingly generous of him to allow that story to circulate. He said that he felt it was the gentlemanly thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an impulse he feels on a daily basis,\u201d Elijah said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOnly Villiers would be so careless of his reputation that he allowed himself to be besmirched by a young lady he hardly knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the privilege of the uncaring.\u201d There was a bit of a snap in his tone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great deal more sanctimonious than he allows. I believe that he finds a reputation for immorality useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes being on the side of the sinners look extremely attractive,\u201d Elijah admitted, pulling off a cover and putting a helping of plaice on his plate.</p><p>\u201cWhereas you make being on the side of the saints look very exhausting,\u201d Jemma replied, seizing the opening.</p><p>He looked at her over the table. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shan\u2019t ask it, because there\u2019s nothing worse than a nagging wife, saying the things that one knows already.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile made her heart beat suddenly faster. \u201cI quite look forward to being nagged by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t give me encouragement of this sort,\u201d Jemma said, striving for a flirtatious tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived apart so long that you\u2019ve forgotten what a shrew I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never a shrew,\u201d he said, his voice low. They stared at each other a moment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even scream at me after walking into my office when I was\u2014with my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d In all honesty, Jemma couldn\u2019t remember anything but Sarah Cobbett\u2019s yellow hair, hanging over the edge of Elijah\u2019s large desk.</p> <p>\u201cYou just looked at me, your face white. You dropped the picnic hamper you held, and you fled.\u201d</p><p>Jemma gave him a little smile. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019d be as silent again. If I ever encountered such a scene now, I would bring the walls down around your ears.\u201d But she said it knowing perfectly well that Elijah would never do such a thing again. That he\u2019d changed, and she\u2019d changed, and no woman stood between them.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face was like a dagger,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cSurely, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating. I\u2019d seen that look before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou had?\u201d</p><p>He waved his fork at the walls. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken down all the evidence.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at the walls. She\u2019d had them repaneled and painted a dark crimson while they were in the country for Christmas. \u201cThey were oak,\u201d she said confusedly. \u201cI would hardly call that evidence of a crime, though they were rather old-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA large and detailed picture of Judith and Holofernes used to hang directly before my father\u2019s desk,\u201d Elijah said, returning to his plate. \u201cIt was a particularly vivid tableau in which Judith waved Holofernes\u2019s severed head with a distinct air of glee. I think my mother liked to believe that it would force my father to notice her rage, but I doubt she succeeded. He was not an observant man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was angry about your father\u2019s mistress?\u201d Jemma asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cSomething of that nature.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation was not going where Jemma had planned. The former duke\u2019s dubious intimacies were interesting, but not relevant.</p><p>\u201cIn truth, I had a horrid day,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>Elijah immediately put down his fork. \u201cI am very sorry if the state of my health caused you any distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistress?\u201d For a moment she couldn\u2019t continue; it felt as if her throat were closed to words. \u201cI was quite unkind in the morning to a woman who is an acquaintance, if not precisely a friend. And I topped that piece of goodwill by goading Villiers into taking his illegitimate children under his own roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t do that,\u201d Elijah said, frowning. \u201cEven his rank won\u2019t inoculate him from becoming a pariah. What were you thinking, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d She raised her chin, willing herself not to cry. \u201cI was so angry at you for leaving this morning without even a note, that I behaved\u2014\u201d Despite herself, her voice wavered. She swallowed and continued. \u201cI behaved like the worst sort of person, determined to win in both encounters no matter the damage I caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWin? What on earth did you hope to win from your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unimportant, and I\u2019m afraid that that friendship is at an end.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was most unkind of me to leave you no personal message, particularly after the shock of last night. I apologize.\u201d His eyes were warm and sympathetic. \u201cI shall not behave in such a discourteous way again.\u201d</p><p>She was a shrew and he was the perfect husband. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do have a request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can anticipate you,\u201d he said, raising his wineglass to his lips. \u201cI know we need to have a serious discussion; of course, you wish to address the question of an heir. The next duke. I have already informed Pitt that I will not be available tomorrow.\u201d His eyes caressed hers. He clearly meant to spend the day in bed. With her.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, that is not my request,\u201d she said carefully, trying not to dwell on the cold-blooded fashion with which Elijah referred to the question of children.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI would ask that you give up your seat in the House of Lords. For your health.\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air. The sensual warmth in his eyes disappeared as if it had never been, and she was faced by the consummate statesman. Being Elijah, he didn\u2019t dissemble. \u201cThe government faces ongoing prisoner riots, a coming election, an impoverished citizenry. Fox and the Prince of Wales risk the health of the entire nation with their drunken exploits; the king seems unable to rein in his own son. I could not consider such a drastic move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not argue with their need for you,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut I wonder that you need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t follow your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt that the Prime Minister faces a difficult year. But Mr. Pitt seems to me to be amply, if not eagerly, able to take on those challenges. In fact, he was elected for just that purpose. But you, Elijah, were not elected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsibility is not incurred only from election.\u201d His eyes were grave but utterly resolute.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is giving out because of the pressure of being roused at dawn to argue problems that most of your peers merely read of in the papers, if they bother to do so. Villiers never took up his seat in Lords. When he was so very ill last year, after his duel, he recovered in bed.\u201d</p><p>Elijah put down his wine. \u201cWe are very different men. The ethical compass of Villiers\u2019s life is bounded by the chessboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not listening to me,\u201d Jemma said, feeling her hold over her temper slipping. \u201cVilliers nearly lost his life last year, but he is here today because he retreated to his chambers. Had he pushed himself out of bed at dawn under the mistaken impression that there was no one else able to deal with a public furor, he would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s jaw was set. \u201cSurely you are not suggesting that I live the remainder of my life in bed? Lying flat, as Villiers did in the grip of fever? Perhaps playing a game of chess now and then?\u201d He pushed his plate away, the food half-eaten.</p><p>\u201cThat seems an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>His tone was courteous as ever, but she could see the leashed fury in his eyes. \u201cYou suggest that I should treasure life so much that I preserve it, as a fly in amber? That I should add to my allotted minutes by staying on my back, by giving up every ambition I had to do something of value with those minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jemma began, only to be overridden by the steady voice of a man used to shouting down a chamber full of howling statesmen.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, you would have me become a man like Villiers, a man whose children are negligently scattered about the countryside, a man who cares for nothing but his next game of chess. Though perhaps you consider that an unjust appraisal. After all, Villiers does care about his appearance. So I would be allowed sartorial splendor and chess.\u201d</p><p>Jemma straightened her back, trying to force air into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cI could walk about with a sword stick and make absolutely sure that every man on the street understood that I was a duke, a man who by the fortune of birth considered himself just under the rank of the Archangel himself. Without lifting a finger to gain that status.\u201d He picked up a silver cover and put it precisely on top of one of the serving platters with a sound like a slap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me put this as clearly as I can, Jemma.\u201d His mouth was a straight line. \u201cI will shoot myself before I become the man that Villiers is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are unkind,\u201d Jemma said, hearing a slight shake in her voice and hating it. She wasn\u2019t used to battles of this nature. In fact, she never argued with anyone but her husband. Her sanctimonious, infuriating husband.</p><p>Elijah obviously heard the tremor in her voice. He rose, walked to the cabinet and poured two tiny glasses of ruby-colored liqueur. Then he returned and handed her one. \u201cIt\u2019s made by monks in France, from cherries. Or cherry blossoms.\u201d</p><p>Jemma took a taste and choked. The liqueur burned to the bottom of her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cThe particular pastimes of the Duke of Villiers are not relevant,\u201d he said, sitting down again. \u201cBut he and I are very different men. I cannot conceive of a life in which I drift around London, impulsively stopping for a game of chess with a friend. Or did you summon him this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>He waited, one eyebrow up. Jemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo the duke happened by and you spent a delightful afternoon together, sharing a bit of light banter about his bastard children, a bit of flirtation, I have no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Jemma heard the naked anger in his voice with a shock of surprise. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be jealous of Villiers! Not after I gave up the chess match with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous of a man who spends the afternoon telling my wife how beautiful she is?\u201d</p> <p>She opened her mouth and he held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cTell me that Villiers didn\u2019t compliment you, Jemma. Tell me that, and I\u2019ll acknowledge myself a fool.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with you,\u201d Elijah said flatly.</p><p>They were at some sort of queer crossroads. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I would be unfaithful to you. With Villiers or any other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p> <p>She took another sip of liquor. It was like a fiery stream of sugar. She hated it.</p><p>\u201cLast night Fox called out the Artillery Company and told them to open fire on rioting citizens in Lambeth, his district,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Jemma murmured.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt it seems a remote problem. But tell that to the young mother whose babe was shot in her arms last night, when she thought they were safe inside her own house. A stray bullet from the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am deeply sorry for that poor young woman,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut must you be so self-righteous, Elijah? Listening to you, one would think that you are the only thing stopping Fox and Pitt and everyone else in the government from turning to a snarling mass of savages. Your sense of importance seems a trifle overblown. After all, you too gained your position due to an accident of birth. Or do you think that you would have the same influence, the same power, were you not a duke?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his expression. There was nothing in his eyes. \u201cHas your opinion of me always been this low?\u201d he asked. He sounded curious, as if he were asking about a preference for peas over potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI do not have a low opinion of you,\u201d Jemma stated.</p><p>\u201cI merely suggested that you might wish to rethink the extent of your personal capacity to cut short the world\u2019s injustices, including Fox\u2019s authorization of an artillery man who accidentally shot a child. Did you personally sanction Fox\u2019s unfortunate decision?\u201d</p> <p>Anger flared in his eyes, and she welcomed it. There was nothing worse than a dismissive Elijah, the statesman who made her feel like a fool easily quelled by a patronizing word or two.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what happened today, Jemma?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wait with bated breath,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose your sarcasm is warranted. I can imagine it is much easier, and certainly pleasant, to stay at home and win a game of chess.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sprang to her feet and walked quickly to the fireplace. She turned around a moment later, certain that she had her breathing under control. She\u2019d be damned if she started panting from pure rage. \u201cGiven that women are allowed no part in government, your insults are not only unkind but unfair.\u201d</p><p>He had risen to his feet, of course. Elijah would never sit while a woman stood. \u201cI apologize. That is an entirely valid point. In that case, let\u2019s not talk of your day, but of Villiers\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for goodness sake!\u201d Jemma exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThe duke spent a delightful afternoon telling you a sad tale of his children, and his newfound resolution to be a good father. Rousing your sympathy and your interest, he opened his heart. True, he lost the game of chess, but he gained so much more in becoming closer to you. Closer to you than he is to any other person on this earth, I expect.\u201d</p><p>His tone was dispassionate. Jemma took a deep breath. \u201cEither you believe that I will be unfaithful or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you think that infidelity is a matter of bodies alone, Jemma!\u201d</p><p>His insult burned in her stomach. \u201cI have always thought that infidelity took forms beyond the obvious! From the moment I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. From the moment you found me on the desk with my mistress. What you have never understood is how unimportant that relationship was compared to one of true intimacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to say that you and I were truly intimate all those years ago, I must disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t. In fact, I expect that you and Villiers are now better friends, more intimate, and in sum, more loving to each other, than we were in our early marriage. And yet I know perfectly well that you and Leopold have never entered a bedchamber together.\u201d</p><p>Words burned on Jemma\u2019s tongue, but Elijah didn\u2019t wait for her to formulate a response.</p><p>\u201cLet me make this very clear. I would not wish for the duke\u2019s pleasant afternoon, idling away his time and yours, even should I die tomorrow. I realized when I was eight years old that either I could die knowing that my life had changed the world around me\u2014or I could die like any trout on a string, leaving the world precisely as it was before I was born. I chose not to be that sort of person, and you will never be able to turn me into Villiers. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to become Villiers!\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cI merely thought that even in the face of the world\u2019s injustices, there might be a point at which a man is allowed to retreat from the fray. It\u2019s not that you would eke out your remaining moments in bed, but that this life is actually killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider that unimportant,\u201d Elijah said, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cYour life is unimportant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have always known my life would be short. Why should I betray everything I hold dear in order to gain a few extra, lazy minutes?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, unable to even begin a sentence.</p><p>\u201cI see that you would prefer me to throw away the world to stay at your side,\u201d he said, restlessly walking away from her, across the room.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2014\u201d</p><p>Never had Elijah interrupted her so many times. He swung about and faced her. \u201cWe are too old to prevaricate, Jemma. I have no doubt but that after I am gone, you and Villiers will find great happiness together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you say such a thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare because it is true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou suggest that I am simply waiting for you to die!\u201d she cried furiously. \u201cYou insult me as well as Villiers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold is my closest friend in the world,\u201d Elijah said quietly. \u201cEven when he and I were estranged, I still considered him so. The fact is that I have never been and cannot become the charming companion you deserve. But my disinclination to nurse my health doesn\u2019t mean that I am afraid to acknowledge that Villiers would be a better mate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe your arrogance,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAs you see it, I will prance away from your grave and turn directly to my partner in lazy crime, living the rest of my life in happy indolence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour characterization is not helpful. What you call arrogance, I would call logic.\u201d He took another quick turn and stopped just before her. \u201cI am merely trying to be honest with you, Jemma. It would be patronizing of me to not share my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, striving to get a grip on her temper.</p><p>\u201cBut just to make certain that I understand your point of view: although you consider Villiers to be a lack-wit, you have every belief that I will turn directly from your grave to his arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetically put,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cMoreover, you refuse to take any action that might prolong your life, preferring instead to gallop recklessly toward that grave without a thought for\u2014for those you leave behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think of you, Jemma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you? Why? I am nothing but a frivolity ensconced at home, a woman who can be quickly dispatched into Villiers\u2019s arms the moment your brief candle burns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only poetic but Shakespearean.\u201d</p><p>Jemma turned sharply and stared out the dark window, biting her lip savagely to control tears that caught at the back of her throat. Her heart was beating heavily, in harmony with her new\u2014and wretched\u2014understanding of her importance to her husband.</p><p>\u201cI truly wish that I could be the man you\u2019d prefer.\u201d His voice came from somewhere behind her.</p><p>She controlled her voice with an effort. \u201cI wonder, Elijah, that you bothered to summon me from Paris at all.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI do not understand your bitterness, Jemma. If you don\u2019t wish to marry Villiers, you won\u2019t do so. I merely\u2014\u201d His voice broke off and suddenly his large hands were on her shoulders, turning her around to face him. \u201cDamn it, Jemma, the truth is that I envy him. I envy him your cozy afternoon, the chess game, the sympathy in your eyes, the affection between you.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma angrily dashed a tear away. \u201cYou just scorned such intimacies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not made to be a courtier.\u201d</p><p>What could she say? That she\u2019d been fool enough to think that he was falling in love with her?</p><p>She leaned her head back against the cool dark window behind her. It wasn\u2019t Elijah\u2019s fault that his honor came before his wife. She should admire him for it. God knows, the world admired his nobility.</p><p>She opened her eyes again and looked at her beautiful, honorable husband. That same stupid, foolish man who thought to pass her over to Villiers like a package that might spoil if left in the rain.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to have caused you distress,\u201d he said. She could tell he meant it.</p><p>\u201cDistress.\u201d She had to swallow. \u201cYes, well, I suppose that goes along with a dying husband.\u201d The words fell harshly from her lips, and he flinched.</p><p>\u201cIt needn\u2019t be like this between us,\u201d he said, his hands sliding from her shoulders to her hands. \u201cI thought we were...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were what?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. His eyes were the dark blue of a midnight sky, too beautiful for a man.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to consider me an appendage of the estate,\u201d she said, charging recklessly, miserably, on. \u201cA cow to be passed from hand to hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma, you are growing hysterical\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cAllow me the grace to finish. Since you consider nothing in life to be more important than your work, the question of an heir cannot truly perturb you. You have known for more than a year that your heart was unstable, to say the least, and yet you refused to bed me until I finished my chess match with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cIt was for the good of the child. I wouldn\u2019t want the world to think that my heir was not of my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall make this as clear as you have your refusal to leave the House of Lords. I will not sleep with you, Elijah. I am no brood mare, available for breeding during the spare moments you are not with Pitt or the chief magistrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma!\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been longing to sleep with you.\u201d The words were halting. \u201cAs much as if you were a drink of water in the desert.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was not a man who wanted to reveal a vulnerability, ever. When she didn\u2019t answer, he kissed first one of her palms, and then the other. His touch burned. \u201cWe desire each other, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said stonily. \u201cOr rather, yes. We do desire each other. But that\u2019s not enough, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hands. His eyes were shaded, dark and impenetrable. \u201cThen woo me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand courtship. I see it in the House of Lords every day. It takes an elaborate courtship to convince a man that his opinion is wrong. That he has made a grave mistake in backing the slave trade, or the tax on wheat. If you are right, and I am spending my time in a fruitless effort, then convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the five minutes you spare me on your way to the House of Lords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you giving up?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you never gave up. I thought you always wanted to win. I thought you were my equal in that, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot work miracles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time. I have dropped some of my committees.\u201d He was watching her closely. Her thoughts were tumbling between inconsolable misery and irritation. \u201cI want what you give to Villiers,\u201d he added.</p><p>That made her head snap up. \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, Elijah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Woo me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah, I don\u2019t woo Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He caught up her hands again. \u201cPlease. I am not going to the House of Lords tomorrow. Allow me to accompany you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you are going. Whatever you are doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t go out and save the world, or even one prisoner tomorrow, Elijah. It\u2019s Thursday, and that means I shall go to the flower market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you woo me even though I am a fool who enrages you?\u201d He asked it quietly, but she heard the strain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so angry.\u201d The words spat like fat in the fire. But she found it impossible to harden her heart entirely. She was too infatuated. Of course, it was only infatuation.</p><p>She put a hand to his cheek. It was faintly bristly, male, so different from her own. Elijah said nothing, so she let her fingers spread over his cheek, turning her touch carnal. One touched his lips, another the arch of his cheekbone. He closed his eyes, and his dark eyelashes lay against his cheek like the shadow of sin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t sleep with you. I won\u2019t go to bed with you merely to have an heir. Your cousin can inherit for all I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sleep with me for another reason altogether?\u201d</p><p>What was she supposed to say? When you want me more than you want to save the world? That would never happen. The intrinsic fabric of Elijah\u2019s soul, the whole construction of his life, meant that he could not give her what she wanted. Some part of her heart grieved, and another part craved him even so. His kisses. That affection she had interpreted as love.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, his voice sounded hoarse and guttural. \u201cYou are mine, Jemma. Do you understand that?\u201d</p> <p>Then, suddenly, she understood. In fact, she couldn\u2019t imagine why she hadn\u2019t seen it all from the beginning: the way Elijah insisted on playing chess with her only after she and Villiers started a match. The way he refused to sleep with her\u2014until after she finished the match with Villiers.</p><p>All along she had been in a relationship in which Villiers and her husband were the opposite poles, and she had been too stupid to realize it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she said, hearing the heavy sadness in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cYou sound...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not mine, Elijah.\u201d</p> <p>And she left the room before he could say more.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>March 28</p><p>Jemma had barely arrived downstairs the next morning before her husband appeared. He looked better for having slept past dawn, she thought, watching him descend the stairs. A man of such physical beauty never looked truly haggard; his bones carried it. And Elijah had been given great gifts: a nobleman\u2019s chin and a statesman\u2019s eyes. A beautiful, mobile mouth.</p><p>She had decided to woo\u2014with the understanding that her husband\u2019s emotions were bound in a rivalry with Villiers that she could never challenge. She would woo with no expectation of winning, but simply because every moment that she kept Elijah from Lords was healing for his heart. Even if she secretly thought that those same moments would break her heart in two.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked immediately.</p> <p>Elijah, she thought, had spent far too much of his life expecting that every day would be life-changing.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to the Covent Garden flower markets. It\u2019s a humble errand, such as duchesses sometimes do, when they feel like being useful. Which,\u201d she added candidly, \u201cisn\u2019t terribly often.\u201d</p><p>He handed her into the carriage, and being Elijah, didn\u2019t look in the least bored.</p><p>A mere half hour later they were wandering among stalls of flowers, hawkers shouting on all sides.</p><p>\u201cViolets,\u201d Jemma said, halting next to a great tub of the small flowers.</p><p>\u201cAh, those purple ones,\u201d Elijah said, staring down at them. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know what violets are?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot particularly. Why should I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBotanical studies? General knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to mind the gap in his knowledge either.</p><p>She plucked a bunch of velvety small flowers and held them to his nose. \u201cThese are violets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we take the lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole bucket?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNo. They\u2019re delicate. These will last only a day or so. This kind of pleasure comes best in small bunches, a bit by the bed, for example. To take so many would be extravagance. You, Duke, have accused me of extravagance on occasion, but in truth I am quite economical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember accusing you of extravagance,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI believe it was in Paris. You were not happy with the cost of my crystal forest, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds of pounds a tree,\u201d he said, remembering. \u201cBut then...the king loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the crystals were promptly sold back to the merchant from whom we bought them. At a discount, naturally. But violets die, and cannot be resold.\u201d</p><p>She took a few violets from the bunch and tucked them into his coat. \u201cThere. Now you don\u2019t look as severe.\u201d</p><p>Elijah glanced down at his black velvet. \u201cDo I look too severe?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a statesman. But the violets give you a more debonair air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer that I take to wearing coats like Villiers\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He sounded so dubious that she burst out laughing. \u201cVilliers would never give you the address of his embroiderers, Elijah, so you are quite safe.\u201d</p><p>He caught her gloved hand and brought it to his lips. \u201cYou called me Elijah.\u201d</p><p>Jemma could feel herself growing a trifle pink. \u201cI often do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\u2014We\u2019re married,\u201d she said, hearing the slightly breathless quality of her voice and cursing herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe my mother even knew my father\u2019s given name,\u201d he said, putting her hand down.</p><p>Jemma handed the rest of the violets to a footman. \u201cThese and another bunch, please, James.\u201d Then she tucked her hand through Elijah\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure she did. Likely she simply chose not to use it in your hearing. Do you suppose that your mother might pay us a visit? Or\u2014\u201d She hesitated. \u201c\u2014ought I to have paid her one? I suppose I have been a sadly neglectful daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my mother wished to see you, she would have sent you a command, informing you of her decision,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWhat are all these white ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple blossoms!\u201d Jemma crowed. \u201cOh, I love these. It means spring is truly here. And those are white cherries. I think we should have a huge amount in the drawing room, don\u2019t you? These are boxwood.\u201d</p><p>Elijah sniffed the boxwood and actually took a step back. \u201cI think something died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoxwood doesn\u2019t smell as beautiful as it looks,\u201d Jemma agreed. She nodded to James. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a largish amount of the white cherry, thank you.\u201d She drew Elijah on, out of earshot of the footman. \u201cDo tell me, Elijah, should I pay your mother a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do so together,\u201d he replied, with a notable lack of enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s like visiting the king, you know. We\u2019d have to petition a visit. She hasn\u2019t summoned me in some two years.\u201d He thought about it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps longer.\u201d</p><p>Jemma stopped. \u201cShe might be ill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. She writes me once a week. Strategy is her m\u00e9tier. She has given me remarkably good advice on a number of topics over the years. Though she tends to be far too inclined to insult,\u201d he added. \u201cShe is always counseling me to ferocity.\u201d</p><p>The fact that his mother\u2019s primary decorating idea had been to strew the house with lurid depictions of Judith holding Holofernes\u2019s bloody head meant the dowager duchess\u2019s forceful tendencies were no surprise to Jemma. She bent to look at a pail of bluebells.</p><p>The old man selling the bluebells looked like a tattered and rather furry owl, all eyes and beak. \u201cGrew \u2019em on the dung heap,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019s always has the first and best bluebells in London. It\u2019s the dung that does it. Ha\u2019penny a bunch, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked down at the bluebells with the first real interest he\u2019d shown in the market. \u201cWhy do you suppose that is?\u201d he asked the man. \u201cCould it be that the dung generates heat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe granddad said it was because there\u2019s nothing richer than the dung of a horse fed on grain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDung heaps do generate heat, though.

He had a bucket of tall, showy flowers that resembled bluebells, but with heads the color of violets.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch those,\u201d the man barked.</p> <p>\u201cYou are speaking to a duchess.\u201d Elijah\u2019s voice was all the more commanding for being utterly even.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re some sort of pisin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissing?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cA pissing flower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPisin!\u201d the man said, annoyed. \u201cDead Men\u2019s Bells, they\u2019re called. And they\u2019re pisin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison,\u201d Jemma supplied. \u201cAnd yet they\u2019re so beautiful. Do you grow them for an apothecary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA doctor. He takes whatever I grows. Some sort o\u2019 medicine he\u2019s cooking up.\u201d The old man gave a sudden cackle. \u201cDon\u2019t mind taking his brass but I\u2019ll be slumgubbered if I\u2019ll take any o\u2019 his medicine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely it doesn\u2019t kill by the touch,\u201d Elijah said, his voice still sounding annoyed.</p><p>\u201cFor all I know, you\u2019ll reach down an\u2019 eat one,\u201d the man said stubbornly. \u201cThere\u2019s chillen have died o\u2019 that. You can die even from drinking the water one of these has been sittin\u2019 in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put bluebells down the dining room table,\u201d Jemma decided. \u201cWe\u2019ll take at least half of those, if you please, James,\u201d she told the footman.</p><p>Elijah plucked a few of the nodding bluebells. \u201cThey\u2019re the perfect color for your hair,\u201d he said, looking down at her. He tucked them on top of her ear. \u201cYour hair is the color of...something yellow. I\u2019m not very good at compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgg yolks?\u201d she said cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cDrowsy sunshine,\u201d he said, tucking another flower into her curls.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d she said, startled. \u201cLike poetry.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and pulled her arm back into his.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I shall write an ode to you. That is what courting couples do, do they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never heard of a woman writing an ode to a man,\u201d she said with a gurgle of laughter. \u201cBut I could try. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m sadly unimaginative. It\u2019s the chess player in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Jemma, whose hair is like drowsy sunshine,\u201d he said, \u201cand whose eyes are like...are like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarbles?\u201d she suggested, laughing.</p><p>He glanced down at her. \u201cI can see that you have no gift for romance. I shall have to take control of this wooing business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou have control of far too many things. I am in charge of our wooing. Tonight you are going to Vauxhall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI? Don\u2019t you mean we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall be there, masked of course. You will have to find me.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cJemma, I\u2019m an old and respectable duke, too old to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah, what are you saying? You\u2019re thirty-four! When\u2019s the last time you went to Vauxhall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d he said, extremely unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been there with you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine you going alone. Did you visit before we married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took up my seat at age twenty-one,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time! No time for one of the most...I must say, Elijah, it\u2019s a good thing that our parents arranged our marriage when we were young. At this rate, you\u2019d have become a curmudgeonly old bachelor without even entertaining the thought of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after I had seen you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt that, like a drop of joy, all the way to her toes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look so pleased to marry me at the time,\u201d she said, keeping her voice light. \u201cI was quite infatuated with you, as I\u2019m sure was painfully obvious. But even infatuation couldn\u2019t disguise the fact that you were less than pleased to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fascinated by power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me the way strong drink takes other men. My father had disgraced himself, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jemma cleared her throat. \u201cDo you refer to the unfortunate circumstances of his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, of course. But also in the House. He took up his seat, God knows why. He clearly must have had no interest. And he led a group of men who took delight in delaying measures, in frolicking.\u201d</p><p>Jemma frowned, uncertain what he meant.</p><p>\u201cIf a bill was being debated, they would stand up and make long, frivolous arguments in favor or against, switching their argument halfway through sometimes. They would introduce new bills, arguing for things like providing every man in the country with free French letters, or providing all whores with lessons in Eastern dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were enough of them so that they effectively killed several bills, and caused no end of embarrassment to men who were trying hard to do the work of government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been difficult to take up your seat after that,\u201d Jemma ventured.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2014my father\u2019s friends\u2014were still around, you see. They hailed me as Bawdy Beaumont. They thought I would continue in his vein, play the young Bacchus to their frolics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled ruefully. \u201cI didn\u2019t. But it took time, and much thought and scheming, to play down my father\u2019s reputation and the House\u2019s expectations for me. I\u2019m afraid that marriage wasn\u2019t terribly important under those circumstances. In fact, as I recall, the months before our marriage were particularly fraught, as I was finally establishing myself as a voice in my own right. I could hardly concentrate on anything else.\u201d</p><p>Jemma cleared her throat. \u201cI really should apologize.\u201d</p><p>He bent over and tucked the bluebells into her hair again. His hand lingered for a moment. \u201cThey were slipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that my scandals, in France and here, caused you embarrassment. But I had no idea that you were contending with something like \u2019Bawdy Beaumont\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cNone. I promise you that I would have been discreet, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t share my travails with you, did I? I never told you about my daily problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember asking about your day, and you would tell me the events being discussed. I wanted to contribute somehow, but of course I knew nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me a few years to think clearly about the early days of our marriage, but then I remembered. You would lie next to me in the morning and ply me with questions. And I was such a fool that I was eager to be in the House already. I had no time for you. That was one of my greatest stupidities, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had other concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserved to lose you. And I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be at Vauxhall tonight, masked, of course.

Who else would try to flirt with you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>The Duke of Villiers, known to himself as Leopold and to everyone else as terrifying, had made up his mind. The one woman he really wanted, Jemma, wasn\u2019t his to win. His old friend Elijah had her, and for all Elijah\u2019s ideas that he might follow his father\u2019s early death, Leopold didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>At any rate, some small foolish part of him wanted to be loved by someone who hadn\u2019t loved Elijah better.</p><p>After all, the first woman he loved in the world had been a winsome barmaid by the name of Bess. But once Elijah crooked a finger, she traipsed after Beaumont without a backward glance.</p><p>\u2019Twas all the fault of Villiers\u2019 face, no doubt. It was a harsh type of face, and not softening with the years. The silver streaks in his hair didn\u2019t help, and neither did his great beak of a nose. In fact, he looked like the damned beast he was, and the hell with that.</p><p>He was done with women. He revised that thought. Not done with women until\u2014God forbid\u2014his loins withered. But he was throwing away the idea of a good woman, by which he meant a marriageable woman. Not that Jemma was ever marriageable, given that she was married to Elijah.</p><p>So, not marriageable, but otherwise a woman like Jemma. A woman who was worth giving a damn about.</p> <p>Villiers was very good at dismissing his little black moments. He generally took that sort of emotion and shoved it away with a pungent curse.</p><p>His butler, Ashmole, entered the library. He had been in the household for years and grown slope-shouldered and sunken as he grew old. His skin was the color of a wilted celery leaf.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer a pension or a cottage?\u201d Villiers asked, before Ashmole could say anything. He asked him periodically, as a matter of course.</p><p>Ashmole gave him the ferocious look of an aging vulture, all bony beak and chin. It struck Villiers that he would probably look the same in his seventies. It was an unpleasant thought.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d the butler replied. \u201cJust when you\u2019re having a fit of the vapors and planning to make things interesting around here?\u201d</p><p>Villiers eyed him. There was something distinctly disadvantageous about inheriting a butler who had spanked you as a lad, ignoring the fact that you were the future duke and focusing merely on your sins to do with stolen blackberry tarts. The man had never formed a proper sense of awe. \u201cYou look like something that fell off a tinker\u2019s cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a damned parrot,\u201d Ashmole retorted. Then he pulled his shoulders back, which signaled that their charming preliminaries were at an end. \u201cYour Grace\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Templeton, awaits Your Grace\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, go take a nap. I don\u2019t want to frighten Templeton by the thought you might expire while handing over his cloak.\u201d</p> <p>Ashmole retired without a word, which meant that he would take a nap, and knew he needed it. Villiers sighed. It was just as well that he hadn\u2019t the faintest inclination to invite anyone to visit his house.</p><p>Templeton was a miracle of legal sobriety. His long, jutting chin had surely never lowered to emit laughter. Given his superior attitude, it was hard to imagine him taking a piss. He looked like a mourning bird hatched from a somber black legal tome, and due to be buried in the same.</p><p>Villiers nodded, indicating that Templeton might stop bowing and take a seat. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to house my bastards,\u201d he said without further introduction.</p><p>Templeton blinked. \u201cI assure Your Grace that they are housed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Templeton was the sort of man who had a huge desk containing at least forty pigeonholes. Each of those would be assigned to part of the duke\u2019s estate: bastard children likely off in a lower corner somewhere, in a position of shame. The horror in his eyes surely resulted from a confusion of pigeonholes.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollect them,\u201d Villiers said briefly. \u201cWait\u2014isn\u2019t there one of them living with its mother?\u201d</p><p>Templeton coughed. \u201cIf you\u2019d given me some warning, Your Grace, I would have brought the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Villiers barked. \u201cSurely you know their situations?\u201d</p><p>Even a duke could read the criticism deep in Templeton\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI handed those children over to you,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cThey are well cared for,\u201d Templeton said, a little bluster entering his voice. \u201cYou can find no fault in the record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking to do so. I\u2019ve simply changed course. The children are coming to live here. All but, perhaps, the one who lives with the mother. I\u2019m not having any mothers.\u201d</p><p>Templeton cleared his throat, took out a small notebook. \u201cNo mothers,\u201d he said weakly.</p><p>\u201cShould be easy enough to round them up. Simply go to their addresses, relieve their current minders of responsibility, and bring them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Templeton looked around the room a bit desperately, his gaze skewing upwards.</p><p>Villiers had to admit that his library almost veered into a parody of himself\u2014but then, so did he. Last year he\u2019d had the vaulted ceiling painted with a riotous mural depicting life on Mount Olympus. He had long thought of Greek myths as a storage house for the male imagination (Jove\u2019s seduction of Danae in a rain of gold coins was a particularly efficient fantasy). It struck him as amusing to house his literature collection in a room that implied it was all about the bed.</p><p>Jove was here, there, and everywhere. Now a bull, now a swan, but always in pursuit of a lushly nubile (and naked) nymph. He had instructed the artist to forget the idea of painting any of those little Italian cupids, the ones with limp, small penises, and concentrate on breasts instead.</p><p>The painter had taken to his task with a great deal of enthusiasm. Villiers was still discovering new breasts that he hadn\u2019t noticed previously.</p><p>Templeton clearly did not approve. Unfortunately for him, Villiers didn\u2019t give a damn about his opinion.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all,\u201d he said, looking back down at the papers on his desk.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Templeton implored.</p><p>Villiers layered his voice with a combination of irritation, annoyance, and possible violence. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho shall care for these children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Ferrers will manage them. You might mention it to her. She\u2019ll hire some nursemaids or some such, I\u2019ve no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Templeton gulped.</p><p>Villiers raised his eyes again. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of my housekeeper, Templeton, just let me know and I\u2019ll inform her myself.\u201d</p><p>Templeton rose to his feet, regaining a semblance of dignity. \u201cI bid Your Grace a good morning,\u201d he said, bowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A thought struck Villiers. \u201cTempleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d Bowing again.</p><p>\u201cWould a sensible\u2014nay, a charitable\u2014person believe that I ought to recover these infants myself?\u201d</p><p>Templeton\u2019s mouth hung open.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder what Miss Tatlock would say?\u201d Villiers mused to himself.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tatlock?\u201d Templeton stammered.</p><p>\u201cActually, her name is now Mrs. Dautry, since she married my heir,\u201d Villiers murmured. \u201cI did give you that letter, didn\u2019t I? Yes, I surely did. With instructions to change the details of my will, I believe. I am quite certain that the line of descent is now assured. She will likely produce any number of clucking infants\u2014and all within the bounds of wedlock, which is surely more than I can say for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace\u2014that is, I am aware of that, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would think I should fetch the children myself,\u201d Villiers said, making up his mind. \u201cVery well, Templeton. Send me a note in the morning with the relevant names and addresses. I shall try to fit it in. I have a very busy few days ahead of me. I promised the Duchess of Beaumont I would visit Vauxhall tonight; I am promised for several games of chess at Parsloe\u2019s, and now this.\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his chin.</p><p>His solicitor\u2019s voice was a predictable squeal, but there was an extra edge of scandalized horror there. Villiers heard it with interest. Why should his solicitor be afraid at the idea of him rounding up his illegitimate infants?</p><p>\u201cYour Grace cannot mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Villiers fixed him with a look. \u201cI can indeed,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd on second thought, I should like that list delivered to me within the hour, Templeton.\u201d</p><p>Templeton scurried from the room.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Later that evening</p><p>The Marquise de Perthuis was feeling miserably uncertain. \u201cThis costume makes me feel like a circus performer,\u201d she told her companion, pulling her purple domino more tightly around her body.</p><p>\u201cYou look ravishing,\u201d Lord Corbin said, bracing himself as the carriage went around a corner. \u201cI promise you, Madame la Marquise, everyone at Vauxhall will think that you are utterly exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t this Vauxhall a place of ill repute? I seem to have been told something like that. I remember now; it was Balthazar Monoconys. He said there was a miscellany of persons there and a wench in a mask asked him, in the most familiar way, if he would drink a bottle of mead with her.\u201d</p><p>Lord Corbin leaned forward and patted her hand. \u201cIt is true that without the affectation of black and white, you are alarming beautiful, marquise. But I will ward off anyone asking you to share a bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think this color suits me?\u201d Louise was aware that she shouldn\u2019t reveal her insecurities to Corbin. But he was so sympathetic\u2014and besides, she had seen him exchanging intimacies a thousand times with Jemma. First, she planned to usurp Corbin, and next, the duke himself.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. That bluish-purple is perfect for you,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cBlack is too harsh. It can have an aging effect.\u201d</p><p>The marquise was silenced by that revelation. Though she would never forgive the Duchess of Beaumont for her grotesque impoliteness, perhaps it was just as well that she had discarded her penchant for black and white.</p> <p>She smiled at Corbin. \u201cWhat does one do at Vauxhall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a table near the orchestra,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a raised building in Moorish style that you\u2019ll find very interesting. And truly, there\u2019s no need for concern. I shan\u2019t leave your side.\u201d</p><p>That would never do. \u201cMon Dieu!\u201d she cried, snapping open her fan. \u201cI am not an enfant who needs to be coddled, Lord Corbin. In fact, I am hoping to see a particular friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look in the least insulted by this revelation. It was just as she suspected: Corbin understood that he had no real hope that she, a marquise, would take his charms seriously. He was very attractive and well-dressed, with an easiness of manner that made him seem almost French, but still...if she, the Marquise de Perthuis, decided to stray from the marital bond, it would not be into the arms of a man of his rank.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d she continued, leaning forward as if confiding a deep secret, \u201cthe Duke of Beaumont and I are dear friends.\u201d Corbin was a notable gossip, which was one of the reasons she had chosen him to escort her. All of London needed to know of this night.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Lord Corbin said with his charming smile. \u201cI must compliment you, Marquise. I confess that I viewed the duke as something of a Puritan. But of course, no man is invulnerable before a woman of your beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too kind,\u201d the marquise said, settling back on the seat and rewarding his compliment with a smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you find the duke an easy conversationalist?\u201d Corbin inquired. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I know little of the state of the government, and he, of course, is an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never discuss such matters,\u201d Louise said. \u201cFor one thing, I never read the English papers. I am not very good at reading the language, and they\u2019re so depressing, always. It\u2019s the same with the French papers, but at least I can understand the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely agree,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThese newspaper people write only for themselves, and with no thought about what is really interesting in life. It\u2019s a wonder anyone reads them at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are always writing about obscure people,\u201d Louise said fretfully. \u201cSavages and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t abide reading about the Americas,\u201d Corbin agreed. \u201cThey sound quite unsanitary. And full of people murdering each other for the most extraordinary reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I refer to savages living in the next street,\u201d Louise corrected him. \u201cIf you believe the French papers, there are astonishing kinds of people anywhere one looks. The papers positively delight in telling one loathsome details about poisoners and the like. It\u2019s enough to make one quite nervous about the cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exceedingly thought-provoking,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cAnd boring. I expect the Duke of Beaumont is very glad to have a change of subject when he talks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Louise said, wondering just what she should talk to Beaumont about. Perhaps she should have perused the Morning Chronicle.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, what is the duke\u2019s familiar name?\u201d Corbin asked.</p><p>Louise narrowed her eyes at him, but he gazed back innocently. \u201cI never address any man by his first name,\u201d she pronounced.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies!\u201d Corbin cried. \u201cI recall the Duke of Villiers addressing you as Louise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI myself do not engage in such intimacies. At any rate, Villiers is my cousin. He\u2019s not a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to what everyone thinks,\u201d Corbin said, sounding delighted.</p><p>When the carriage stopped, Louise tied on her mask and they strolled toward the center of the park. There were some young couples embracing rather ardently in the shade of the poplar trees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than one might see in the environs of the Bois de Boulogne,\u201d Corbin said, after she pointed out this vulgarity.</p><p>\u201cI have never entered the Bois de Boulogne,\u201d Louise remarked. \u201cAnd now you tell me that, I never shall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corbin immediately commanded a supper box in just the right spot with a minimum of fuss, ordering two bottles of Champagne and a plate of delicacies.</p><p>\u201cTwo bottles?\u201d Louise said, trying to adjust her mask so she could see a bit better.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well make ourselves comfortable,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the Duke of Beaumont does not appear to have arrived yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come only for that purpose,\u201d Louise said loftily (and untruthfully).</p> <p>Corbin didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cI should hope not. It doesn\u2019t do for ladies to track men down like hunting dogs. It would make my whole sex far too vain to even know of the possibility.\u201d</p><p>Louise took a desperate swallow of Champagne. \u201cThese masks make everything rather difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly hope I recognize those people I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need for introductions at Vauxhall,\u201d Corbin assured her.</p><p>She digested that in silence. Truly, the English were a different race than the French. No French nobleman would attend an uncouth event of this nature. Still, she ought to be polite, since Corbin was kind enough to accompany her. \u201cThose lamps shaped like stars are quite beautiful,\u201d she told him. Corbin filled up her glass again, and she clutched it like a precious elixir. \u201cDo you see any sign of the duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook at that!\u201d Louise exclaimed. \u201cI do believe there are courtesans here.\u201d The woman in question had thrown off her mask, if she ever had one.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Corbin replied. \u201cThat is an elegant dress. I wonder if she knows that her entire bosom is visible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Louise retorted. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t skimp cloth in that particular area unless one has made up one\u2019s mind to do so. I must admit that I\u2019ve never seen the demimondaine very close. Of course, one jokes about people such as the Comtesse de Montbard, but there is a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the countess is liberal with her affections but entirely free,\u201d Corbin murmured.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how they phrase the request for money,\u201d Louise said, drinking again. \u201cI would be quite embarrassed at the need to price myself, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect they are used to it,\u201d Corbin said in a companionable sort of way. They sat in their small box and observed the dancers for a time. Then Louise found herself watching a very tall man with an air of natural command and a beautiful profile, even masked. There was no question: the Duke of Beaumont had arrived.</p> <p>\u201cI beg you to excuse me for a moment,\u201d she said, rising. She swayed a bit but caught herself. \u201cI see a friend of mine. I\u2019ll just take a glass of Champagne with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be right here,\u201d Lord Corbin said, with just the right note of reassurance.</p><p>Louise headed directly across the dance floor. The duke appeared to be in a veritable nest of courtesans, and she thought she ought to make haste. The duchess was certainly wrong about her husband\u2019s faithfulness. But then, Louise thought with a pang, she\u2019d had the same illusions about her own husband.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what on earth are you doing here?\u201d Jemma said, sliding into the marquise\u2019s chair as Louise wavered away from the table. \u201cYou find yourself in the midst of a play of my making, though now that I think of it, it\u2019s entirely appropriate. You instigated the plot, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear duchess,\u201d Corbin said, kissing her fingers, \u201cI must compliment you on your efficacy. I certainly didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be able to bring about a courtship of your husband within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely sure the marquise would take the bait,\u201d Jemma confessed. \u201cBut I thought Vauxhall offered many opportunities for that sort of encounter. Where is Elijah, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s directly across from us. I rather think that\u2019s a courtesan he\u2019s speaking to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo give me a glass of Champagne, darling. This is fun for Elijah! And now comes Louise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my, she is truly unsteady. It must have been that third glass of Champagne. How was I to know that she had such a light head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is Louise doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s winding herself around your husband,\u201d Corbin pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stop giggling, Jemma, if you want me to believe that you are sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may believe whatever you like. Did she just throw herself into his arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she might have tripped on her cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s holding her very tenderly,\u201d Jemma observed. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose Elijah thinks she is I, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now that he\u2019s holding the marquise,\u201d Corbin said cheerfully. \u201cYou weigh at least a stone more than she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you very much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour weight is nicely apportioned in the chest area. Men tend to notice that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least he got her back on her feet. He\u2019s laughing,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cElijah is laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the Puritan bends.\u201d Corbin poured a little more Champagne into Jemma\u2019s glass. \u201cWe must have a drink to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drink,\u201d Jemma said, getting up. \u201cI\u2019m going to rescue my husband. The marquise just kissed him on the ear, and that was not part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her mask straight and sauntered toward them. The marquise was draped against Elijah\u2019s right side, looking muzzy but determined, and an unknown lady was draped on his left, looking considerably livelier and just as determined.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jemma said as she sauntered up, pitching her voice deliberately in the hope that Elijah would think she was yet another stranger.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell whether he recognized her or not. \u201cHello,\u201d he said politely, and then turned back to the lady on his left. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t dance very well, but it\u2019s kind of you to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery gentleman knows how to dance,\u201d Jemma said, moving closer. The marquise had her head resting on Elijah\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI know how to dance,\u201d Louise said, clearly recognizing Jemma as she straightened immediately. \u201cAnd what I\u2019d like to do is dance with you!\u201d She smiled up at Elijah. \u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m very, very fond of beautiful men. You probably didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>A muscle moved in Elijah\u2019s cheek, and Jemma thought he was close to breaking into laughter. Which was better than becoming swamped by desire.</p><p>\u201cI can teach you how to dance,\u201d said the crimson domino on his left side. She had a husky voice that promised a lot more than dancing lessons.</p><p>There was definitely a cocky glint in Elijah\u2019s smile now, Jemma thought.</p><p>Jemma put a hand on her hip and pitched her voice to be as inviting as that of the stranger with the husky voice. \u201cMen have been known to cry if I refused to dance.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked expectantly to his left, to the crimson charmer. Her eyes were narrowed and she was examining Jemma inch by inch. \u201cThere are some people who aren\u2019t worth dancing with because they\u2019re too hoity-toity to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>The marquise stepped away from Elijah with nary a waver and gave the crimson domino a scathing look. \u201cUne allure honteuse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did she say to me?\u201d the woman demanded.</p><p>Elijah very courteously translated. \u201cI believe she called you a shameless jade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>But with one triumphant glance, Louise neatly turned Elijah about and hauled him into the throng of dancers.</p> <p>Jemma\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cChrist\u2019s toenails!\u201d the crimson cloak said. \u201cI had him all set, and then that drunk wobbled out of nowhere, and now she took him! It\u2019s because she is French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen all think that Frenchwomen are on their knees half the night,\u201d she confided. \u201cThe worst of it is that he was a nabob.\u201d She grinned at Jemma. \u201cAnd he had big hands. I was looking forward to dancing with him.\u201d</p><p>Jemma turned about and surveyed the assembly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d best look elsewhere,\u201d the crimson cloak said consolingly. \u201cShe had him from the start, I could tell. She made a couple of remarks that made him laugh. And she had herself draped on him. I got only one feel but it was a nice one.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cLove\u2019s dart, so they call it. But this was a great deal thicker than a dart,\u201d she added, with a naughty laugh. \u201cAh, well, it wasn\u2019t for my benefit.\u201d And she wandered off.</p><p>Jemma\u2019s eyes narrowed. She didn\u2019t like to think of that woman touching the dart in question. She turned back to the dancers. Louise seemed to have sobered enough so that she was dancing a reasonable approximation of the minuet, but as Jemma watched, she tripped and fell into Elijah\u2019s arms. He was laughing.</p><p>Jemma ground her teeth.</p><p>Enough!</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Dancing in Vauxhall, at this hour of the night, did not resemble the parallel activities that took place in the ballrooms of Versailles and St. James. The music sounded the same; a large orchestra was sawing away on its raised platform. But the dancers\u2019 movements were entirely more intimate.</p><p>Some people seemed to know that the minuet being played at the moment was generally danced in a formal pattern; others seemed to consider it more of a country dance. No one bothered trading partners: why pass your partner to the hand of another if it meant you might not see her again?</p><p>Only the Puritanical would insist that those at Vauxhall were drunker than those in elegant ballrooms. Elijah had seen whole rooms full of bluebloods reeling from an excess of punch. And those same Puritans couldn\u2019t honestly call the dancers more lascivious, since lust coursed through the noble soul with the same fury as anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>The primary difference, Elijah decided, was that whereas noblemen danced in patterns, those who came to Vauxhall danced in pairs. And pairing allowed for a certain proximity that encouraged groping.</p><p>Not that he felt the slightest inclination to approach his partner in that manner. He had recognized her immediately, though without any particular pleasure.</p><p>He was supporting the Marquise de Perthuis with one arm, while dancing a lamentable version of the minuet, and wondering where on earth Jemma had got to when he realized that his wife was standing at the edge of the floor, tapping her foot in an irritated fashion.</p><p>He swiftly turned the marquise in a circle so Jemma didn\u2019t catch his delighted grin.</p> <p>\u201cGoodness me,\u201d the marquise said, \u201cyou are very quick on your feet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is because you are so beautiful,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>She looked up at him rather owlishly, and Elijah thought that in fact she actually did look beautiful. Maybe it was due to being inebriated. Generally the marquise\u2019s rigid personality precluded anyone from thinking she was beautiful.</p><p>It was an odd thought, because rigid was what Jemma had always called him when they quarreled. As well as hidebound, moralistic, and tedious. He looked down at the marquise uneasily. Moralistic people were quite dislikable...though he never thought of himself in those terms.</p><p>She took a deep breath and shook her head a bit. \u201cI do believe that I might have drunk a trifle more Champagne than I ought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all indulge at times,\u201d he told her, looking around to see where Jemma was now. She would be very annoyed to see how closely he was holding the marquise, though in fact he either had to grasp her tightly or let her slip to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI never indulge,\u201d the marquise told him. \u201cIndulgence is the province of the devil. My mother said so and I\u2019m sure she was always right.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be brooding about something, so Elijah twirled her again so he could see the space where he had last seen Jemma. She was still there, but no longer alone.</p><p>A red-haired fellow in a tired blue domino and matching mask was bowing before her. He looked like a sailor on leave. He had the rakish air of a young man of the town: not a gentleman, not a farmer, but something in between. Elijah began edging the marquise backwards through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cDo mind my skirts,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cI must say, have you ever seen so many dissolute women in your life?\u201d She seemed utterly fascinated. \u201cI love it here. Had I known, I would have come long ago. You must have been to Vauxhall many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Elijah said. The blue cloak was leading Jemma onto the floor, and she was smiling up at him in a way that sent a flare down Elijah\u2019s spine. A moment later he had maneuvered the marquise so that he was shoulder-to-shoulder with his wife.</p><p>From the lavish and delighted smile Jemma was giving her partner, she knew perfectly well he was there.</p><p>He set the marquise to turn a gentle circle and leaned in toward Jemma\u2019s ear. \u201cI want you.\u201d His voice was somewhere between a whisper and a growl.</p><p>She threw him a glance from those laughing, wicked eyes of hers. The man in the blue cloak hadn\u2019t noticed and drew her in the opposite direction. He had red whiskers, a look that Elijah found extremely unattractive.</p><p>Now he was bending his head, to say something clever, no doubt. Jemma was laughing. Elijah saw her throat ripple and was seized by a blind wave of lust. He wanted to lick her there, to lick her whole body, feel the vibration of every muscle when she\u2014</p><p>Belatedly he remembered the marquise and took her back on his arm. She was growing slightly more sober the longer they danced. \u201cYou know, Beaumont,\u201d she pronounced, \u201cI expect my husband Henri adores this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Elijah had met the Marquis de Perthuis only once, but he remembered a man with a longing face, the face of someone who wanted more than dissolute dancing. He looked like a frustrated painter, or an inventor of some kind.</p><p>\u201cHe hates being a marquis. He has all sorts of revolutionary notions about the noblesse and the canaille being alike. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>Elijah could imagine quite easily. The marquis was a man who hated himself, and apparently he extended that dislike to his entire class. The marquise went on, telling him about her husband\u2019s strange proclivities, while he steered her through the crowd and back over next to Jemma. That fellow she was dancing with was entirely too familiar for Elijah\u2019s comfort. He was looking at Jemma as if she was a tart ripe for devouring.</p><p>Elijah could sympathize. Jemma looked succulent and sweet, like a peach. But she was his peach. Finally he managed to get the marquise jostled into the correct position so that he was shoulder-to-shoulder with Jemma again. The marquise was still talking, though Elijah had lost track of the subject.</p><p>Elijah Tobier, Duke of Beaumont, was never vulgar. Even when in the company of men who indulged in coarse jokes at women\u2019s expense\u2014or at their own\u2014he invariably smiled, but always remained silent. But now all nature of coarse words surged to his lips, though he didn\u2019t want to share them with a roomful of men, but with only one woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned over and brushed her hair with his mouth, and whispered something extremely vulgar that only she could hear. He turned away, but heard her choke and laugh.</p><p>The marquise was pouting, so he bent his head down to her again.</p><p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d she repeated, \u201che met this woman at a meeting with le Marquis de Lafayette. She helped Henri translate an American document, a declaration of some sort, into French. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>It was surprising. \u201cIt would have been easier had he fallen in love with someone of my stature,\u201d the marquise said dismally. \u201cBecause she would understand\u2014\u201d She waved her hands. \u201cAll of it, she would understand all of it. As it was, this woman demanded that he leave with her. Leave!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd did he?\u201d Elijah enquired.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d She nodded vehemently and tripped on her cloak again. Elijah neatly caught her and put her back on her feet. \u201cHe left with her, and he left me. Moi!\u201d She widened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAn absurd decision,\u201d Elijah put in.</p><p>\u201cI am a leader in Queen Marie Antoinette\u2019s court,\u201d the marquise announced. \u201cMy clothes are talked of by everyone. I have never marred my reputation, even with the slightest slur. I have never contemplated an excess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t, but it hardly mattered. \u201cYou are my first excess,\u201d she stated.</p><p>He blinked down at her. \u201cI am an excess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Shall we go have some more Champagne?\u201d she asked, seemingly forgetting that he hadn\u2019t been with her from the beginning. \u201cThere are several bottles on our table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here with a party?\u201d he asked, more than willing to return her and pluck Jemma away from that sailor she was dancing with.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the marquise said with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m here with you. And you and I are...\u201d She struggled for the word. \u201c...seducing each other.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cWe are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not decided exactly how far I shall allow the seduction to continue,\u201d the marquise said loftily.</p><p>\u201cIt likely depends on the Champagne.\u201d She looked around with a little puckered frown. \u201cThis wooing was quite easy once I had a glass or two. I should like some more. I believe I shall fetch it myself.\u201d And with no further ado, she left.</p><p>Elijah looked after her for a moment, but a gentleman was hailing her to join him at a table to the side, and she wasn\u2019t swaying quite so much anymore. He wondered briefly how the marquise found herself at Vauxhall, and then swiveled to find Jemma.</p><p>She was still dancing. Her partner had either had too much to drink or was simply too lusty for his own good. He was trying to pull Jemma against his body. She stepped precisely on his foot with her sharp heel, and the sailor stumbled back.</p><p>Of course Jemma had fended for herself in Paris for years. She didn\u2019t need him. The recognition of it turned his mouth into a hard line. She didn\u2019t even leave the floor after her partner\u2019s attempt at a kiss, just kept dancing with that blackguard as if nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat a distinct\u2014and surprising\u2014pleasure,\u201d said a voice at his ear.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother turning, just kept his eyes on Jemma. \u201cVilliers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you watching with such\u2014Ah, the wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t realize the man is drunk.\u201d</p><p>Villiers laughed. \u201cJemma strikes me as a woman who will always be able to ascertain the extent of a man\u2019s inebriation.\u201d</p><p>On the dance floor, the gallant leaned over as if he were trying to gobble Jemma\u2019s ear and she neatly evaded him.</p><p>\u201cWhy the devil doesn\u2019t she simply leave him there alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s having too much fun putting on a drama for you. The cruelest thing you could do would be to turn away.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a possibility. Turn away while another man tried to paw his wife? Never mind the fact that he had known quite well that she was having affaires while living in Paris. That he deliberately hadn\u2019t followed her to Paris for three years\u2014no, four\u2014until rumor reached him that she\u2019d had a week-long fling with a young fool named DuPuy.</p><p>It was her right, after what he\u2019d done to her. He owed her.</p><p>But it was different now.</p><p>Now he was going to have to kill that fool she was dancing with. Even as they watched, the red-haired sailor leaned toward her again, trying to catch a kiss. He was going for her mouth\u2014He was\u2014</p><p>A strong hand caught him. Villiers. \u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to retrieve my wife,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be involved in a fight,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re a statesman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t stopped most of the men I know from brawling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>Jemma seemed to be fending off her swain with her elbow, so Elijah frowned at Villiers. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart,\u201d Villiers hissed. \u201cYou should be at home resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil with that.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye he saw the man swoop in again. He was bigger and stronger than Jemma. She was trying to push him away but\u2014</p><p>Elijah was next to them in a second. He grabbed the man\u2019s shoulder and caught one glimpse of his surprised face, red lips pursed in a kiss, before he hit him so hard that the man rose slightly in the air, landed hard, and skidded on his bottom to the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>There was a chorus of little screams as dancers scrambled to get out of the way. The ruffian climbed to his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for?\u201d he yelled, furious. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything that the trollop didn\u2019t want me to do! Who the hell are you? Her protector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe husband,\u201d Elijah said softly. \u201cJust the husband.\u201d He could see the man shifting his weight from foot to foot, trying to decide whether to lunge at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have a wife like that!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>The crowd was interested now, forming a circle around the swell in the velvet domino and the red-haired sailor. There was a murmur of approval at that comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep a wife where she belongs!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>The red-haired man grinned. \u201cEspecially if she\u2019s not satisfied at home. This one was looking for company.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s fists clenched and he stepped forward, just one step. \u201cNo woman should be handled in such an uncouth manner.\u201d</p><p>A shrill voice agreed. \u201cShe got the right to dance with whoever she pleases without paying with her reputation!\u201d It was a burly woman in the front of the growing crowd.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 he\u2019s got a right to fight for his wife, light-skirt though she be!\u201d someone else shouted.</p><p>Behind him, Elijah could hear Jemma\u2019s helpless laughter. He made the mistake of smiling at the sound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me! I did nothing to your wife but what she welcomed. She\u2019s worse than a light-skirt. She\u2019s a\u2014a...\u201d Maybe it was the look in Elijah\u2019s eyes that dried up his words. Without bothering to finish his sentence, the sailor lowered his shoulder and charged like a bull, catching Elijah square in the chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah was expecting a blow to the face because that was how the men fought in the boxing salon he regularly visited. He barely managed to keep to his feet, and the man was rounding about, ready for another charge.</p><p>In one lightning quick moment, Elijah calculated the rate of speed of his attacker and his relatively lower height, drew back his fist, and waited for the man\u2019s chin to connect with it.</p><p>Over the sailor went, out cold.</p><p>The thunk that resounded through the night air was followed directly by an unmistakably official bellow. \u201cNow what\u2019s all this, what\u2019s all this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh...the watchman,\u201d Villiers said softly.</p><p>Elijah turned his head. \u201cYou\u2019re at my shoulder?\u201d</p><p>Villiers shrugged. \u201cHe might have had a brother. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Elijah waited a split second, shook himself, and started grinning. \u201cStupendous. Where\u2019s Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d Villiers muttered, stepping forward.</p> <p>The duke made an imposing figure. A plain domino would never do for Villiers, of course. His was of black velvet with a border of pale lilac. His silver cane looked exactly like the sword stick it was. The crowd stopped chattering when they saw him.</p><p>He prodded the fallen man with the tip of his boot.</p><p>\u201cDrunk,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The watchman frowned. \u201cI was informed there was a fight and I think I heard...\u201d His voice died out.</p><p>The cold look in Villiers\u2019s eyes could have graced the devil himself. \u201cYou must have been mistaken.\u201d He looked around at the bystanders. \u201cHe was mistaken, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Vauxhall might attract those of different backgrounds, but it wasn\u2019t limited to the stupid. \u201cDrunk as a sailor,\u201d the burly woman in the front said promptly. \u201cOnly person drunker would be my old da, and he ain\u2019t here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumph,\u201d the watchman said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose someone must drag him away to sleep it off,\u201d Villiers said, sighing. \u201cFor your trouble.\u201d There was a gentle click, the kind made by guineas passing from one hand to another.</p><p>\u201cNow, now!\u201d the watchman shouted briskly. \u201cNo need to stand about gawking at this unfortunate inebriate.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was standing to the side, still giggling.</p><p>\u201cYou are a reckless wench,\u201d Elijah said, taking her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she protested, but her eyes were alight with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou enticed that man to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to make you jealous,\u201d she said with a delicious pout, \u201cI could do far better than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d He pulled her mask over her head.</p><p>\u201cVilliers is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2014\u201d She broke off in a little grunt. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Without further ado, he picked her up and threw her over his shoulder. \u201cGoing where I can chastise my errant wife.\u201d</p><p>There was an enthusiastic shout behind him. \u201cThat\u2019s the way, square toes! Keep the missus in line!\u201d</p><p>Elijah turned. \u201cI shall, thank you...Villiers!\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be an acquaintance of mine,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAre you the local dockworker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Marquise de Perthuis is here somewhere, unless she\u2019s fallen into a drunken stupor. Will you escort her to her house? I must take my wife home.\u201d</p><p>Villiers bowed and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sauce!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cGive her a bit of the home remedy and she won\u2019t be flirting with the first jackanapes she sees!\u201d</p><p>Jemma was laughing helplessly. Her hair had fallen around her face and she couldn\u2019t see anything. \u201cElijah,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment,\u201d he said politely, walking off.</p><p>\u201cI had too much Champagne to be in this position,\u201d she said a second later.</p><p>He put her down immediately. By then they were in one of the shadowed lanes that spread out from the orchestra pavilion and were lit only by infrequent lamps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve lost track of where we are,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe carriages don\u2019t seem to be in this direction. Did you have a great deal of Champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the Dark Walk,\u201d Jemma said, sitting down on a bench. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t have flirted with that ginger-haired fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said agreeably.</p><p>\u201cIt was rather fun, knowing that you were watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough of course he didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have tried to kiss me so roughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had reason to think that you welcomed his advances. After all, you stayed on the floor with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...You\u2019re making me feel shabby, Elijah. I hate it when you do that!\u201d</p><p>He reached out and pulled her into his lap in one swift movement. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss the rules of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules of marriage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to kiss anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She must have recovered from her shame, because she gave that one word a deeply wistful tone.</p><p>\u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall think about it.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened. \u201cNo thinking. No kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I get to tell you the second rule of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to care if someone is going to kiss me. While dancing or elsewhere.\u201d She whispered it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma laid her head against his chest, so she couldn\u2019t see Elijah\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhen I went to Paris, you didn\u2019t follow. I cried every night for months, but inside, I thought you would arrive any day. Then I decided that you couldn\u2019t come while Parliament was in session.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cBut then Parliament went into recess, and friends wrote me and said that you had gone to Kent, to the Earl of Chatham\u2019s estate. I thought perhaps you couldn\u2019t escape the work,\u201d she said, relentlessly.</p><p>\u201cBut I never came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd not because of work. Because\u2014Because it wasn\u2019t my right, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour right to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo follow you. I\u2019d broken our marriage. I\u2019d done just what my father did to my mother, over and over, without even realizing it. I\u2019d broken your heart and your trust.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought about reassuring him, but it was all true. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you come after me?\u201d She sounded like a little girl.</p><p>\u201cI waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited until you had found someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want anyone!\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened. \u201cYou had the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurt to see you with a mistress. It was heartbreaking when you said you loved her. But the real heartbreak came when I realized you didn\u2019t even care what I did. That I meant so little to you that you didn\u2019t bother to visit for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years, ten months, and fourteen days.\u201d</p><p>The only sound was that of a sleepy, confused lark, somewhere deep in the park. Jemma straightened up so she could see Elijah\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how long it took you. You finally had an affaire with DuPuy. It lasted only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt lasted three days,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou knew that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy friends were as assiduous in letter-writing as were yours. And of course the fact that DuPuy had fallen so deeply in love with you was considered tantalizing news for your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came that Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI came as soon as the Parliament recessed. I had this foolish notion...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it would all be fine. But you were furious at me. And I\u2014I found that for all my reasoned decision that it was your right to have an affaire, I wanted to throttle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe things you said drove me to more excess.\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger slowly down the slope of her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI know. I came again the next year, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t fight as much,\u201d Jemma said, remembering.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was moralistic and boring. And I was. You had become so sophisticated and beautiful. I had ruined everything, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I went back to England, back to the House. But I never took another mistress, Jemma. I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stunned,\u201d she said. She kept searching his eyes, but it was too dark and she couldn\u2019t see them well.</p><p>\u201cThe third rule of marriage,\u201d he said.</p><p>She put her arms around his neck, feeling a huge wrench of emotion that she wasn\u2019t even sure how to name. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe never let anger or the sea stand between us again.\u201d</p><p>It was too sad, all that time lost. She couldn\u2019t even smile. Her throat moved, and then he was kissing her and she could have sworn that the same sorrow was in his mouth and his touch, in the way his hands twisted into her hair. Finally the sweet deep pleasure of his mouth made all the rest of it fade away.</p><p>After a while he unwound her arms and stood up, slowly putting her on her feet. \u201cI need to get my duchess home safe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be glad to know that I am not attending Pitt tomorrow. I would be happy if you would accompany me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing as colorful as the flower market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I dress in black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a visit to the cemetery,\u201d he said. \u201cBut perhaps it would be best to avoid being very extravagantly duchess-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall eschew my jewels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd no wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hard bargain,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cBut I suppose I can be seen outside the house in such a pitiful state without my reputation suffering overmuch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>March 29</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Cow Cross,\u201d Elijah announced the next morning.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Spitalfields.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked. Spitalfields was one of the poorest areas of London, a tangled mass of grimy tenements and questionable businesses. Cook shops there followed no regulations and regularly were accused of serving rat stew, but who would know, since the entire district had the odor of cooking onions and aged chicken fat?</p><p>No duchess entered Spitalfields. In fact, Jemma would have ventured to say that the only ladies who entered Spitalfields were of the missionary variety, tough by nature and likely carrying defensive weapons to boot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to a house that is not as beautiful as the flower market but just as interesting,\u201d Elijah said, acting as if he had said nothing much out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cIs Cow Cross on the outskirts of Spitalfields?\u201d Jemma asked, knowing she was a coward.</p><p>\u201cIn the very center.\u201d He helped her into the coach.</p><p>\u201cCow Cross is a tiny lane, bounded on one side by a sewer ditch and the other by Simple Boy Lane. Most people don\u2019t know these streets exist,\u201d he pointed out, which was something she knew quite well herself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to call on anyone in Simple Boy Lane,\u201d she said. \u201cWho lives there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCow Cross is the home of glassblowers, for the most part,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cGlassblowers. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father owned a house there, which I inherited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own a house in Spitalfields?\u201d She was stunned. Moralistic Elijah, champion of the poor?</p><p>\u201cI can see that you think I should have torn it down.\u201d</p><p>She chose her words carefully. \u201cI am surprised to find that you are a landlord in such an area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must be,\u201d he said reasonably. Then he relented. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t rent rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn orphanage?\u201d she said, her frown clearing. Of course Elijah would be involved in good projects.</p><p>\u201cNo children,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you might not like it once you learn more of the place. I inherited it from my father, and I maintain it. But it is shameful, all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s shameful, why don\u2019t you sell the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also complicated.\u201d A moment later he added, \u201cWe own the Cacky Street Glassworks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jemma said uncertainly. \u201cIs that a large establishment? In Spitalfields?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is certainly located there.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be in a fierce mood, and she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do. One good thing about being separated for the past years was that she hadn\u2019t had to deal with anyone\u2019s moods but her own. If she were in a bad mood, she stayed inside and played chess against herself until she felt better.</p><p>But what did one do with a grumpy husband? She stole a look at Elijah, but he was frowning out the window. Already the streets were growing smaller and grimier.</p><p>After a moment she took off her gloves and removed the diamond her mother had given her. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust Elijah to protect her, but there was no need to be foolish. She dropped it neatly into the pocket next to her seat.</p><p>\u201cWill Muffet wait for us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Though we may wish to take a walk.\u201d</p><p>Take a walk in Spitalfields? She had done very daring things in her life, as she saw it. She had ridden a horse bareback, once. She had left her husband and presented herself to the Court of Versailles before she understood how to look truly expensive (and thus irreproachable). She had provoked a woman into attempting to seduce her husband.</p><p>But she had never put herself deliberately in the way of bodily harm. Her native intelligence included a keen sense of self-preservation.</p><p>Out the window, everything looked slightly foreign. The shops were jammed together like an old man\u2019s teeth just before they fell out: dingy, leaning, doubtless full of holes. She could see alleys snaking away to the left and right, but buildings bent over them, so the sunshine disappeared a foot or two from the entrance. The darkness looked rusty, as if it had solid mass.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cElijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He was staring sightlessly out the window, as best she could tell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been into Spitalfields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite safe,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, Spitalfields would not be a wise place to enter at night. But it\u2019s not as if hordes of savages roam the streets, Jemma. Spitalfields is simply a place where the very poor live. And they are trying, rather desperately for the most part, to find their next meal, rear their babies, afford a blanket or two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate it when you do that,\u201d she said crossly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He honestly looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cMake me feel so shabby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you can\u2019t help it.

But she didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>\u201cI am neither better nor worse than the next man,\u201d he said, biting the words. \u201cI have compromised on issues where I felt bitterly that the better option\u2014the kinder, more ethical option\u2014was being tossed to the side.\u201d</p><p>The carriage rocked to a halt. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d he said, holding out a hand to her. His smile helped. \u201cI do believe you\u2019ll find yourself interested, Jemma. And I need you to know of this place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, just as the footman opened the door to the carriage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to carry on,\u201d he said, rather obscurely.</p><p>But Jemma knew instantly what he was referring to, and her heart hiccupped from fear. Then she pulled herself together. She had the blood of three arrogant duchesses running through her veins. She could certainly survive a visit to Spitalfields.</p><p>They stepped out onto a street that was presumably made of cobblestones, but if so, the stones were buried under a thick compost of rotting vegetables. It felt like a springy blanket under her feet, as if made of horse hair.</p><p>\u201cThe carriage won\u2019t fit in Cow Cross,\u201d Elijah said, tucking her arm under his. \u201cIt\u2019s just down there.\u201d</p><p>Cow Cross was one of those little alleys that lurched suddenly off the street as if it were a hare fleeing a fox. This one broke left and then faded into the same rusty darkness as the alleys she\u2019d glimpsed from the carriage.</p> <p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Elijah said, sounding amused. \u201cNo one is lurking in Cacky Street, hoping that a duchess with a jewel in her slipper will happen by.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. She didn\u2019t see a single person, only a great congregation of ravens sitting atop a dilapidated house. They looked down at the two of them in a disapproving fashion, as if they were preachers in ragged blacks, squawking at the incongruity of a ducal carriage in Cacky Street.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Jemma asked. She had the mistaken idea that the poor lived in the street. That was how they were depicted in the papers: cooking, sleeping, fighting in the open. But Cacky Street was empty, just a twisted, shabby street dozing in the sun.</p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWorking.\u201d He glanced at her and there was a gleam of something in his eye.</p><p>\u201cMaking love. If you\u2019re not rich enough to have a hundred rooms, you know, you find yourself curled up next to the missus of a morning and that gives a man ideas.\u201d</p><p>Jemma ignored him. \u201cWhere are your glassworks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown to the left,\u201d Elijah said, his face closing again. Somehow she\u2019d asked the wrong question.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said brightly, \u201cshall we continue to Cow Cross?\u201d</p> <p>Once they entered the lane, Cow Cross wasn\u2019t as dark as it had seemed from Cacky Street. A bit of sun managed to sneak past the buildings that leaned and wobbled toward each other like tipsy matrons sharing secrets. Elijah stamped down the lane as if it belonged to him, which, for all Jemma knew, it did.</p><p>The lane curved to the left and then stopped. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was the biggest house in the street, though that wasn\u2019t saying much. And it was definitely in the best repair. Of course, it would be, since it was Elijah\u2019s. There was a large door with a rusty knocker, but Elijah simply pushed it open.</p><p>\u201cI stopped begging them to lock the door years ago,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they wish to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone really wants to come in, they\u2019ll come regardless of a lock. It\u2019s Spitalfields. So they prefer to channel visitors through the door. It saves on wear and tear. Ah, Knabby, there you are.\u201d</p><p>A small stout man was coming toward them, squinting in the gloom of the hallway. \u201cYer Grace!\u201d he said happily. \u201cNow this is truly a pleasure. You\u2019re here for the birthday, of course. May I say what an honor it is that you remembered such an event? Cully will be happy, but happy indeed!\u201d</p><p>Jemma could tell that Elijah had no memory of a birthday, but he didn\u2019t say so. Instead he drew her forward and said, \u201cMr. Knabby, may I present my wife, the duchess?\u201d</p><p>Knabby blinked at her uncertainly. \u201cA duchess,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman!\u201d Then, as if he suddenly remembered the protocol, he bobbed something between a curtsy and a bow.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely voice,\u201d Knabby said, cocking his head to one side. \u201cYes, it sounds like a duchess. I shall remember that, indeed I shall. So that is what a duchess sounds like!\u201d He wasn\u2019t squinting due to the dark, Jemma realized. He had a permanent squint.</p><p>Jemma looked up at Elijah. \u201cKnabby has lost his sight,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI see a bit, I see a bit,\u201d Knabby put in. \u201cLight and shadows, really. Better than many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to hear that,\u201d Jemma said. She knew Elijah had to be involved in a charitable project. It was so like him. But her smile died at the hard look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cKnabby lost his sight because he worked in our glassblowing factory,\u201d Elijah said, and his voice was flinty.</p><p>Knabby had turned and was making his way briskly along the dark corridor. \u201cDo come along to the birthday!\u201d he called. \u201cOh my yes, I was a glassblower, m\u2019lady. Is it my lady? Or is there something else I should be a-calling her? Is she a grace as well? Or duchess lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may call me whatever you wish,\u201d Jemma said, picking up her skirts and following him.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to give me a report, before we go to the birthday party?\u201d Elijah asked Knabby.</p><p>Knabby stopped suddenly, and Jemma almost ran into him. Then he started jabbering so fast she could hardly follow. \u201cNibble\u2019s wife has been staying with him for a spell, but they do fight something terrible. So I moved them to the back of the house where no one can hear her a-beating on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeating on him?\u201d Jemma said, unable to stop herself.</p><p>Knabby turned his face toward her. \u201cShe\u2019s a devilishly strong woman, and if you give her a saucepan, she can make a right rumpus,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when he\u2019s been in the drink. \u2019Course, Nibble isn\u2019t easy either. Many\u2019s the time that my hand has itched for a saucepan, if you take my meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Waxy doing?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cWaxy is a quite elderly gentleman,\u201d he told Jemma. \u201cHe must be around sixty now, isn\u2019t he, Knabby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he has his lung problems. He has those. But his daughter\u2019s been visiting him regular-like, with a couple babes in tow, so he\u2019s right as a flea in a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the doctor been coming weekly?\u201d</p><p>Knabby started down the hall again. \u201cA waste of your ready that is, Yer Grace. A waste of the ready. There\u2019s nothing the man can do and we\u2019re all happy. Though he did pull a tooth for Cully the other day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCully is well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair to middling. Of course, it\u2019s his birthday today, so he\u2019s in the drink already, though I hate to say it. But that\u2019s Cully.\u201d He stopped just outside a tall door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the courtyard, enjoying the sun. But I should tell you that the foreman stopped by and we\u2019ll be having a new man with us, any day now. The name is Berket. Can\u2019t say that I remember him very well, but he was beginning when I left, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s room enough?\u201d Elijah asked.</p> <p>\u201cMore than enough! We\u2019ve got that room from when Lasker left us, a month ago that\u2019s been. And there\u2019s Nicholson\u2019s room open still, and another one too, when Miss Sophisba ain\u2019t choosing to stay there. She\u2019s here today and will be glad to see Yer Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need, just send a boy to Towse,\u201d Elijah said. He glanced down at Jemma. \u201cTowse is one of my solicitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need nothing,\u201d Knabby said merrily. \u201cWe admired them fruits as you sent from yer conservatory, Yer Grace, but to tell the truth, none of the men would eat them. They\u2019re set in their ways, and they\u2019re not adventuresome, if you know what I mean. The children snapped them right up, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Miss Sophisba?\u201d Jemma whispered as Knabby opened the door. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Elijah said, and there was something so grim about his voice that Jemma stopped talking.</p> <p>At first sight the small courtyard seemed to be hosting a children\u2019s party, but after a moment Jemma realized that there were more chickens than people, and though both groups were making noise, the three children chasing a puppy were winning the contest.</p><p>\u201cNow look who\u2019s come to celebrate Cully\u2019s birthday,\u201d Knabby announced. \u201cThe duke is here, you group of lazy scubblers!\u201d</p><p>The courtyard was dominated by a circle of dilapidated armchairs mostly occupied by men, all of whom turned toward Knabby\u2019s voice. And all of whom, Jemma realized immediately, were blind.</p><p>They were a curious bunch. For one thing, not everyone had chosen to put on clothing. Two men were entirely without trousers; their scrawny white legs stretched out in the weak sun. One of them had a beard so long that it was tucked into the waistband of his apron, which he wore, incongruously, on top of a plaid coat.</p><p>There were two women, one a hard-mouthed matron whom she assumed must be Mrs. Nibble, as she looked precisely like someone who wielded a mean saucepan.</p><p>The other must be Miss Sophisba. She was younger, and while not exactly pretty, she had the air of someone who made an effort. Most of that effort involved lip rouge and improbably golden hair. It appeared to be directed toward attracting male attention, which seemed odd, given that no one could see her except Mrs. Nibble. And Mrs. Nibble was definitely not the sort to enjoy crimson lips and yellow hair.</p> <p>One of the half-naked men stood up. \u201cGet up, ye flea-bitten knabblesquabbers,\u201d he bellowed suddenly. \u201cThe duke\u2019s here. You should be on yer feet and doing the pretty! It\u2019s my birthday and I\u2019ll have everything in\u2014in\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sat down suddenly. Knabby was definitely right. Cully had been in the drink, and never mind the fact that it was morning.</p><p>\u201cAnd the duchess is with me,\u201d Elijah said easily. The frown had dropped from his face and he looked as genial as if he had entered a tea party in Kensington. \u201cI\u2019ve brought along my wife, the prettiest duchess in all the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we could see that,\u201d the bearded man said, staring into space. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a real duchess. Though I did see the queen once. She had a fearsome wig, the queen did.\u201d He elbowed Mrs. Nibble. \u201cIs there a wig, one of those tall ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a velvet dress,\u201d the older woman told him. She had risen and given a quick bob of a curtsy and then sat back down directly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have one of those wigs on her head. I think she has her own hair, but with some powder on it, like nobs wear.\u201d</p><p>Elijah had strolled over to wish happy returns of the day to Cully. Then he stopped at the next chair and started a conversation about the riots. Jemma felt she had to do something. She couldn\u2019t just stand about like a fool. So she moved toward the two women. Miss Sophisba promptly jumped to her feet, looking terrified.</p><p>\u201cAre these your children?\u201d Jemma asked. \u201cThey\u2019re delightful.\u201d Which was not the truth. They were too dirty to give anyone a sensation of delight. But they looked cheerful and well-fed.</p><p>The older woman had lumbered to her feet again. \u201cShe don\u2019t have any children.\u201d She jerked her head derisively.</p> <p>Miss Sophisba ignored her. \u201cThey belong to Knabby\u2019s sister. Or perhaps his niece. At any rate, she\u2019s a cloth-dyer, which is prodigious hard work, and so the children spend the days here. Usually Waxy\u2019s grandchildren come along later in the day, too. His daughter works in the mews, and so she drops them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they go to school?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cNot most of the time,\u201d Miss Sophisba said with a shy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not something most people hold with, here in Spitalfields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a school in Spitalfields,\u201d Mrs. Nibble said. \u201cNot in my time, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cThose are loverly gloves,\u201d Miss Sophisba said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to try them on?\u201d Jemma asked readily. She ignored Mrs. Nibble\u2019s snort and pulled them off.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d Miss Sophisba gasped. But they slid over her small dirty hands as if they\u2019d been made for her.</p><p>\u201cYou may have them,\u201d Jemma said, smiling at her.</p><p>Miss Sophisba paled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she couldn\u2019t,\u201d Mrs. Nibble said grimly. \u201cHer husband\u2019d have \u2019em off her in no more time than it takes to dock a whore.\u201d Suddenly she looked self-conscious. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse the expression, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hide them,\u201d Sophisba said. \u201cAn\u2019 just look at them now and then, when I was here, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you here all the time?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly when her husband is thrown in the Clink,\u201d Mrs. Nibble said. \u201cThen she doesn\u2019t have to be on her back, you see, and his dukeship is nice enough to let her stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep them for her, Mrs. Nibble,\u201d Jemma said. She let just enough of a duchess tone creep into her voice so that Mrs. Nibble blinked. \u201cWhenever Miss Sophisba is in residence at Cow Cross, she can wear them.\u201d</p><p>Miss Sophisba was stroking the gloves as if they were alive. \u201cI\u2019d be that thankful,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThey\u2019re the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you shall have this handkerchief for your trouble, Mrs. Nibble,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Mrs. Nibble frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t need no bribe to keep them gloves for her. I\u2019m not a person to cast her aside, just \u2019cause of what she does.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s handkerchief was woven of Belgian lace and embroidered in the middle with a very elaborate white B, for the Duchy of Beaumont.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a B,\u201d Mrs. Nibble said, turning the handkerchief this way and that. \u201cMy name is Bertha.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bribe,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is a gift,\u201d Miss Sophisba said, clutching the gloves. \u201cDoes you know that, Miss Duchess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t call her that,\u201d Mrs. Nibble said. \u201cMrs. Duchess maybe, or \u2018my lady.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A boy ran by, shrieking like a teakettle in a way that signified he wanted to be noticed. And just to make sure he was, he dropped a handful of smallish wooden balls at Jemma\u2019s feet.</p> <p>Mrs. Nibble took after him with an enraged howl. Jemma bent down to pick up the boy\u2019s balls, since he was currently being rapped on the head by Mrs. Nibble, though thankfully not with a saucepan.</p><p>\u201cHow clever!\u201d she exclaimed, turning it over. There was a human face carved into the ball, a face with a laughing, stubby nose and eyes that seemed to twinkle with amusement. She picked up another, which turned out to have the face of a wicked little demon with pointed ears and sharp chin. A third was a round-faced woman.</p><p>\u201cPie makes \u2019em,\u201d Miss Sophisba said. \u201cSee, he\u2019s always carving.\u201d She gestured toward a man in the circle. Pie was holding a tiny sharp knife and flicking at a piece of wood. A steady stream of shavings flew out to his left and right.</p><p>\u201cBut he can\u2019t see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sees with his fingers, he says,\u201d Miss Sophisba explained.</p> <p>Jemma walked over to Pie. \u201cThese are absolutely wonderful,\u201d she said, dropping one of the balls in his hand so he knew what she meant.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThe wood tells me, that\u2019s all. The wood tells me what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>Elijah appeared at her side. \u201cPie was a master glassblower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all were,\u201d Knobby said cheerfully. \u201cOnly the best for the Cacky Street glassblowers. There\u2019s quite a wait list,\u201d he told Jemma.</p><p>\u201cTo work in the factory?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace here won\u2019t take any apprentices, \u2019cause he says they\u2019re too young to decide about whether to give up their eyesight. But those of us that has already got the skills, well, there\u2019s nowhere else anyone would want to work \u2019cept for Cacky Street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause of this?\u201d she said, looking around.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course. All paid for, see, and nice to boot. Food we have, and enough to spare over and share about. Wives if we want \u2019em with us, and if they want to come. It\u2019s always warm, even in the coldest months.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was rocking back and forth slightly on his heels. \u201cIt\u2019s the least we could do,\u201d he said, his voice harsh. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for taking your sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no ye ain\u2019t,\u201d Pie said unexpectedly. \u201c\u2019Twas the glass that took my sight. All that lovely, beautiful glass, and I wouldn\u2019t have had it another way. See, when you blow, the glass tells you what\u2019s inside,\u201d he said, moving his face in the general direction of Jemma and Elijah. \u201cThat\u2019s what the duke here never understands, for all he feels to blame and such. It\u2019s glass that\u2019s our mistress. I thought I\u2019d go mad at first, when I had to stop blowing. Then someone gave me a knife and some wood and I was away. Thought I\u2019d go mad,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWe have one of Pie\u2019s glass bowls,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cIn the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the green one with the fluted edge? Mr. Pie, that is an exquisite bowl,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>He beamed. \u201cShe called to me and I just brought her out, that\u2019s all. And now she lives in a duke\u2019s home.\u201d His hands kept moving over the block of wood he held in his lap and then he started flicking away at it again with his knife. \u201cCan\u2019t do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday again, Cully,\u201d Elijah said.</p> <p>Cully genially waved a bottle in their direction and hiccupped.</p><p>\u201cI gave him a bit of the best today,\u201d Knobby said.</p><p>\u201cSeeing as it\u2019s his birthday. That\u2019s the best gin.\u201d</p><p>Elijah took Jemma\u2019s ungloved hand. \u201cGoodbye, everyone.\u201d</p><p>The men all turned their heads and chorused goodbye; the children ran by screaming. Miss Sophisba waved her gloves shyly, and Mrs. Nibble glared from her chair next to Nibble.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re blind because of the Cacky Street glassblowing factory,\u201d Jemma said as soon as they were back in the carriage. \u201cWhich we own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something in the glass that ruins the eye,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cThe doctor thinks it\u2019s in the smoke. It\u2019s not good for their lungs either. They don\u2019t live very long. We\u2019ve lost two in the last six months.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou likely think I should close the factory,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I close the factory,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cit won\u2019t stop people from buying glass. And if I sell the factory, there won\u2019t be anywhere for the workers to go once they\u2019re blinded. The run of them from the other factories end up in the poorhouses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I might move the house to the country, where there would be air and cleanliness, and I could get a decent woman to live in and cook for them. But they hated that idea. They like living in Spitalfields, with all their old friends dropping by for gossip and a chunk of bread. We feed half the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah...\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cKnabby has a cook shop deliver meals. I probably shouldn\u2019t allow Sophisba there but she keeps the men happy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d She touched his cheek and he finally focused on her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful house. I think you\u2019ve done exactly the right thing. I have just two suggestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d His eyes lightened. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should change anything,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cBut perhaps you could hire a young woman to play with the children and even teach them to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do that easily enough,\u201d he said, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd you should fix up some sort of head...piece, with glass in the front, so the blowers don\u2019t get smoke in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPie could carve a sort of helmet, like a soldier\u2019s helmet. And there could be something in front, oh I don\u2019t know what, something. And then some glass, so they could see the glass to blow it, but their eyes would be protected.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou could try,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cElijah! I\u2019ve never heard you swear.\u201d She started laughing.</p><p>\u201cDamn and double damn.\u201d But he said it slowly, thinking.</p><p>\u201cI have a question. What do you mean that Sophisba keeps the men\u2014happy? How exactly does she...\u201d</p><p>Elijah wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cI can see what you\u2019re suggesting. It would need light wood. Or leather. It\u2019ll take thinking.\u201d He looked up. \u201cSophisba is there only when her husband\u2019s in the Clink. When he\u2019s out, he makes her work the streets. She\u2019s Mrs. Nibble\u2019s daughter, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has her own room. I don\u2019t believe she actually performs personal services for the men. But she makes them happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe flirts with them.\u201d He reached out and picked up her hand. \u201cI like your hands without gloves, Jemma. And I love your idea about the helmet. I think we can make that work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can figure it out, and then make sure that all the glassblowing factories start using them,\u201d she said, beaming at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to do is flirt with the most beautiful duchess in London,\u201d he said, turning her hand over and placing a kiss in the middle of her palm.</p> <p>\u201cI flirt best over a chessboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen chess it shall be,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you ever play out of doors, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess? And a picnic, you mean? That sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be at my chambers in the morning. But I could arrange a picnic for the afternoon.\u201d There was a world of meaning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. The carriage came to a halt. \u201cI have an appointment for tomorrow afternoon, though you\u2019re more than welcome to join me. Parsloe\u2019s is holding an open session of the Chess Club and I intend to become one of the members.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey allow women? How marvelously forward-thinking of them.\u201d A footman opened the carriage door.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI believe that it was entirely in error. They simply never thought that a woman could possibly play chess. Until the redoubtable Mrs. Patton came along. You do remember her from our Twelfth Night party, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEccentric and thoroughly intelligent,\u201d Elijah observed. \u201cWith a sharp edge to her. Mrs. Patton told me that the House should be ashamed of itself for ignoring a Quaker bill outlawing the slave trade, and she was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Patton realized that there was nothing barring a woman from going to an open session and simply playing everyone there until she won a spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich she did,\u201d Elijah said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cShe took herself there for a visit last year. No one can join until they win all offered games at an open session. I shall do so tomorrow,\u201d Jemma said serenely. \u201cAnd you are welcome to try for a spot as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assume the open session is to replace a deceased member? As I understand it, Parsloe\u2019s ruthlessly maintains its members at one hundred precisely. In that case, we cannot both successfully join the Chess Club tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jemma took Elijah\u2019s hand as she stepped down from the carriage. \u201cI shall ask Fowle to make sure there is a particularly lovely meal tomorrow night, so as to assuage your disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Elijah loved the look in her eyes. It was just too bad that he was going to have to puncture her expectations. \u201cAren\u2019t you fond of gooseberry tarts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFowle, do inform Mrs. Tulip that Her Grace will be in need of comfort tomorrow night,\u201d he told the butler.</p><p>\u201cPride goeth before a fall!\u201d Jemma said, but she was laughing as she climbed the stairs.</p><p>The footmen were all staring. Elijah paused for a moment. \u201cWhom will you bet on, Fowle? And don\u2019t try to tell me that the household won\u2019t engage in a very lively series of bets if Her Grace and I both try for a spot in the Chess Club.\u201d</p><p>Fowle raised an eyebrow, ever the imperturbable butler. \u201cI could not bring myself to bet against one of mine own masters,\u201d he said, bowing.</p> <p>\u201cIn that case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers,\u201d Fowle said.</p><p>\u201cBut he is already a member.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that unless one of us wins the tournament, we won\u2019t become a member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that His Grace has been responsible for keeping many aspirants from joining Parsloe\u2019s. I believe that in fact there are only seventy-three standing members at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood lord,\u201d Elijah said, startled. \u201cDo you happen to know how many people have managed to beat Villiers and join Parsloe\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Patton joined after His Grace did not attend an open day,\u201d Fowle said. \u201cBut Mrs. Patton has beaten him thereafter. There\u2019s many a man who has rued the day that His Grace decided to join the London Chess Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a positive fount of information, Fowle.\u201d</p><p>Fowle bowed. A butler of the very best caliber would count it a failure not to anticipate all the questions his master might ask. But he never anticipated the duke\u2019s next inquiry.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should lose?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cLose, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the duchess.\u201d</p><p>The duke appeared to be perfectly serious. It was the first time Fowle had been asked to give marital advice, but he drew himself upright. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cHer Grace would be appalled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Fowle.\u201d</p><p>The butler was still staring at the duke\u2019s back, trying to remember the last time he saw his master smile like that, when Beaumont paused on the stairs and turned.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Fowle...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t put your wages on a bet in favor of the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>He was grinning again.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>March 30</p><p>Parsloe\u2019s, on St. James\u2019s Street, was a rather nondescript establishment for an organization that wielded such power over the hearts of English chess players. Elijah stepped down from the carriage and held out his hand for Jemma. Perhaps forty people were jostling for space around the path leading to Parsloe\u2019s, held back by some annoyed-looking footmen.</p><p>\u201cMay the best man win,\u201d she said to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her, all right,\u201d came a shout. \u201cThat\u2019s the duchess! Look at that hair!\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s twinkling smile disappeared from her face and she began walking up the path, suddenly looking like a duchess rather than a mere woman. As if duchesses were a breed apart, Elijah mused, following her up the path. Beings whose hair towered and who walked as if their feet were not quite touching the ground. Jemma did it brilliantly. She looked sublimely beautiful and outrageously expensive.</p><p>Belying Elijah\u2019s assessment, a portly woman in a tattered stole said, \u201cShe\u2019s not wearing that many joowels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wears them on her slippers,\u201d Elijah told her.</p><p>The portly woman\u2019s mouth fell open but nothing came out of it, even when the sharp-nosed woman behind her said, \u201cMrs. Mogg, you be talking to a duke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth are all of you here?\u201d Elijah asked Mrs. Mogg, seeing that Jemma was inside the door and beginning the lengthy process of removing her pelisse, chip hat, gloves, and all the other accoutrements worn by a duchess out-of-doors.</p><p>Mrs. Mogg didn\u2019t seem able to summon words, so her friend spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s all over London. A duke and a duchess are going to battle another duke for a place in this here club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let anyone watch the game,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said, finally opening her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take hours,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cYou should come back around...oh...four of the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d Jemma called.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s calling you,\u201d the sharp-nosed woman said.</p><p>\u201cJust like I might call my Henry,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said, still staring at Elijah. Her tattered stole rose and fell with her breaths, giving its little fox head the odd semblance of life. \u201cI\u2019m putting my money on you,\u201d she breathed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah was used to accolades from his peers in the House of Lords, and he bowed just as deeply. \u201cYou do me too much honor, madam.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, and the fox rose into the air, looking as if its sharp glass eyes were about to blink.</p><p>Elijah went inside, thinking that he really had to speak to Fowle. A betting circle within Beaumont House was one thing, but involving greater London in such foolishness wasn\u2019t appropriate.</p><p>The upper floor of Parsloe\u2019s opened into a large ballroom, now dotted with small tables and chairs. Hopeful members faced the wall, Elijah realized immediately; club members faced into the room and seemed to pride themselves on playing with a certain \u00e9clat.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Parsloe has been kind enough to allow us to eschew the opening round of play,\u201d Jemma said to him.</p><p>The head of the Chess Club bowed. \u201cIt is the least I can do, given Your Graces\u2019 famed skill at chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Villiers,\u201d Elijah said, scanning the room. He was disappointed. It wouldn\u2019t be a true battle unless the duke showed up.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace never attends before the late afternoon,\u201d Mr. Parsloe said. \u201cBy that point all the first and second round plays will have been completed. There\u2019s a hierarchy of play, you see, and members are accordingly rated first, second, or third tier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers?\u201d Elijah said, eyebrow up.</p> <p>\u201cStrictly third tier play,\u201d Parsloe said, \u201cthough he does do the honor of dropping by the Chess Club frequently and engaging in play with whomever is available. His Grace is the top-rated player in the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fun this is!\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cWell, dear Mr. Parsloe, please do give me an opponent.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parsloe hesitated, but three or four gentlemen were already bounding toward Jemma. Lord Woodward Jourdain was in the forefront, but he was elbowed to the side by Saint Albans, who swept Jemma off to a table.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess will be fine,\u201d Elijah said, rocking back on his heels. \u201cCould you find me an opponent, Parsloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Grace. Please forgive me: it\u2019s just that we have only one female member, and I wasn\u2019t quite certain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer Grace will neither expect nor desire special treatment,\u201d Elijah assured him.</p> <p>\u201cLord Woodward would be an excellent partner for Your Grace,\u201d Parsloe said, after one more look at Saint Albans and Jemma. \u201cHe is a second tier player who tends toward eccentric but lively play.\u201d</p><p>Elijah bowed. \u201cI would be honored.\u201d Two minutes later he knew he had the man, but it was amusing to see how quickly he could bring the game to a halt.</p><p>Jemma generally found Lord Saint Albans to be a bit of a dunce, but with an acute eye for clothing, which she truly appreciated. Today he wore a high wig, paired with a coat of iridescent turquoise silk. Obviously, they could not begin the game without a preliminary discussion of their attire. His enameled buttons; her overskirt retrouss\u00e9e dans les poches; even her laylock slippers were admired.</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect much of the game. But it turned out that Saint Albans\u2019s clever\u2014albeit often vicious\u2014comments sprang from a quick mind. Of course she won, but only after a bit of delicate manipulation with her rook.</p><p>\u201cThat was quite fun,\u201d she told Saint Albans, who was blinking down at the board as if surprised. \u201cI thought moving your King\u2019s Knight to Queen\u2019s Bishop Three was inspired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d he asked, and then, pulling himself together, \u201cYour skill at chess is remarkable, Your Grace. You beat me in only eight moves. That has never happened before.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cShould I play someone else?\u201d There was by now a deep circle of observers around them.</p><p>Mr. Parsloe appeared. \u201cA win, Your Grace? May I suggest that you take Lord Feddrington for your next opponent?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m rated higher than Feddrington,\u201d Lord Wig-stead pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI need you to play another opponent,\u201d Parsloe said, bearing him off.</p><p>\u201cI much enjoyed Lady Feddrington\u2019s ball last fortnight,\u201d Jemma told her opponent as a nimble-fingered footman replaced all the chess pieces.</p><p>\u201cChess isn\u2019t as much fun as dancing, eh?\u201d Feddrington had the jovial look of a man who thought a woman didn\u2019t truly have the brains to play such a cerebral game as chess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to playing you,\u201d Jemma said, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cYour fame precedes you,\u201d Feddrington said, \u201cbut maybe I can still teach you a thing or two. I beat that fellow Philidor when he was here, and he\u2019s reckoned to be the best that France has to offer.\u201d</p><p>One of the bystanders snorted, and Feddrington threw him an unfriendly look. \u201cOf course, Philidor beat me a time or two as well. Chess is like that. Even the best can\u2019t win all the time.\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled and moved a pawn. A short time later Feddrington was frowning, and the circle of onlookers around her had grown deeper. \u201cI call that a smothered mate,\u201d she told him sweetly. \u201cAnd speaking of mates, how is the duke faring?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parsloe appeared to escort Feddrington from the seat across from her, and the footman leapt to action, resetting the board.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace has just won his second game,\u201d Mr. Parsloe said. \u201cHe is now playing Mr. Pringle. May I introduce your next opponent, Dr. Belsize? Dr. Belsize is one of our very best players in the second tier.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Belsize was a cheerful-looking gentleman wearing a pair of large spectacles. \u201cI do believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d Jemma said, racking her brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Dr. Belsize said. \u201cBut I have common enough features, Your Grace. One nose, two eyes, all the rest of it. People often think I\u2019m a long-lost uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a scientist! I heard you give a talk at the Royal Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored to think of Your Grace as a member of the audience. And now I am unsurprised to find your interests extend to chess, unlike many of your fair sex. I find that science and chess are intrinsically related.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parsloe inspected the board and stepped back. Jemma knew within a move or two that Dr. Belsize was a formidable opponent. There was actually a moment when she hesitated, thinking she would have difficulty disentangling herself if he...but that was thinking five moves ahead, so she made the play.</p><p>He missed the opportunity, and the chance to make the game a truly competitive one. Jemma swallowed a little sigh. This was why she preferred not to play strangers, for the most part.</p><p>\u201cYou are now on to the third tier,\u201d Mr. Parsloe confirmed a few minutes later. \u201cWould Your Grace wish to rise and refresh yourself, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Jemma stood up amid a chorus of congratulations. She looked around for Elijah, and spotted him sitting opposite a man with a mustache like a kitchen brush. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next step?\u201d she asked Parsloe.</p><p>\u201cThird tier games are played strictly by hierarchy,\u201d he said. \u201cSince you last beat Mr. Belsize, who is rated number sixteen, you will play the next available player with a lower number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd His Grace?\u201d she asked, nodding at Elijah.</p><p>\u201cShould the duke win this match, he will be rated above Mr. Pringle at number twelve.\u201d</p><p>Jemma swallowed her annoyance at the fact that Parsloe had been giving her opponents at a lower level than he gave to Elijah. It was up to her to prove her skill; she could educate the Chess Club by beating her husband, not to mention Villiers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two hours later she had just tidily vanquished another opponent when Villiers made his appearance. She was seated facing the wall, and surrounded by a circle of onlookers. She didn\u2019t have to raise her eyes to know of Villiers\u2019s arrival, however. The men to her left suddenly melted away.</p><p>And there was Villiers: hair unpowdered, naturally, and tied back with a ribbon. He wore a coat of deep cinnamon, embroidered in black. His heels were high and his legs muscled. She smiled to herself and made a final move.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate,\u201d she told her stunned opponent.</p><p>As she understood it, there remained only two players between herself and membership. Jemma smiled sweetly at her latest victim, stripping off her gloves to wiggle her fingers.</p> <p>Mr. Parsloe was looking slightly distraught. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said to Villiers, \u201cthe Duke of Beaumont has beaten Mr. Potemkin, which means that the duke now challenges you. The Duchess of Beaumont will play Mr. Potemkin in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Jemma rose from her chair and held out her hand for Villiers to kiss. \u201cI advise that you beat my husband with all due expediency. He\u2019s deeply cunning, for all he possesses an honest face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall take your advice to heart,\u201d Villiers replied, bowing with a gorgeous flourish of his coat.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I shall beat you,\u201d Jemma said, letting it all go to her head for a moment.</p><p>Villiers gave her his customary cool glance. \u201cYou are, of course, welcome to try.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma sat down again, dismissing Villiers from her mind. Mr. Potemkin must be a redoubtable opponent, she thought, rated as he was, at number two behind Villiers. The last thing she wanted was to be cut from the tournament now.</p><p>Mr. Potemkin turned out to be a Russian man with a shy smile and a brutal style of attack. His weakness, Jemma discovered, was greed. Through a series of brilliant sacrifices, allowing him to pile her pieces on his side of the table, she closed mercilessly on his queen.</p><p>And won.</p><p>Mr. Potemkin didn\u2019t blink at the board. Of all her opponents, he was the one who had followed every move, understanding the advantages, the positions, the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cYou are brilliant,\u201d he said in a heavy accent, rising to his feet and bowing deeply.</p><p>\u201cThat was a beautiful game,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI thank you for it.\u201d</p> <p>Then she turned to Villiers and Elijah. She had been left to win the last game without audience, as the entire population of Parsloe\u2019s was watching with bated breath as the two dukes battled it out.</p><p>She strolled over and the men parted before her like the Red Sea. She saw at once that Villiers had control of almost all of Elijah\u2019s pieces, certainly all the rank and file. The audience was murmuring to each other, convinced that Villiers had yet again brought down an applicant to the Chess Club.</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, we\u2019ll never have a new member!\u201d Feddrington said clearly.</p><p>But Elijah looked amused. She knew him, knew that look of deep satisfaction in his eyes.</p><p>She turned back to the board with a frown. There wasn\u2019t a sound in the whole building as Villiers reached forward one hand, marked with a deep ruby-colored signet ring, and took a pawn.</p><p>Suddenly, she saw it! Villiers would be forced to capture Elijah\u2019s bishop. Elijah raised his eyes and smiled at her. Two more exchanges, and then Villiers, still silent, moved his queen. Elijah reached forward, moved his knight again.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate,\u201d he said, his deep voice as unruffled as his face.</p><p>The crowd broke out in a sound somewhere between a howl and a squeal.</p> <p>\u201cYou trounced me,\u201d Villiers said, staring at the board. \u201cDamn well trounced me.\u201d He looked up. \u201cYour play has improved since we were boys.\u201d</p><p>Elijah shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve played the occasional game with the duchess. I suppose her brilliance has rubbed off on me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parsloe was bowing deeply before Elijah. \u201cYour Grace, may I welcome you to the London Chess Club? It is a true honor...you are the first new member in some years. In fact, since the Duke of Villiers did us the honor of joining the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m likely not to be the last,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cAfter all, my duchess has yet to play the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are free to admit more than one member,\u201d Parsloe told him hastily.</p><p>Villiers was kissing Jemma\u2019s hand again. \u201cAh, what a pleasure to play another Beaumont. I feel as if I am virtually a member of the family.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sat down. \u201cAnd just like the dramas that recur in the best of families, I fully intend to eviscerate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have often remarked how grateful I am to have been spared a sibling,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>The footman backed away, and Parsloe quieted the room with one look. Jemma moved her pawn to King Four. In the last year, she and Villiers had played a number of games. They were matched in daring, she knew. He was an inventive player. In order to win, she needed to think far ahead.</p><p>He steadily built up a nest of pawns. Jemma watched. She could do herself no good by dashing into a counterthreat without thinking it out first. But finally...finally...she saw it. A brilliant combination, only seven moves ahead.</p><p>For the first time, she raised her eyes from the board. Elijah was standing to her right. Their eyes met and she saw that he knew, he\u2019d seen the possibility, he approved.</p><p>Marriage, she thought, was a very strange thing.</p><p>She won.</p><p>\u201cYou will come to me for supper,\u201d Villiers said, speaking under the roar of excited voices replaying every move. \u201cNo, no, I insist. I absolutely insist. I am, after all, dejected. Positively melancholy. I never lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look it,\u201d Jemma said, cocking her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cMy natural dislike of losing is warring with my knowledge that I will now be able to enjoy excellent games on a more regular basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be happy to join you tonight,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>Jemma glanced from one man to the other. For childhood friends who hadn\u2019t spoken in years, they were rapidly mending their fences.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Villiers, you must be off your bacon today,\u201d Feddrington roared. He might have slapped Villiers on the back, but the duke was the sort of man not even Feddrington would dare to touch.</p><p>Villiers cast him a look under heavy-lidded eyes. \u201cYou wound me, Feddrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all lose sometimes,\u201d the man said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s a question. The duke and the duchess have both beat Villiers, and he\u2019s rated first in the club. So who\u2019s first?\u201d He turned to Parsloe. \u201cAre they to play each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless we shall play each other on many occasions,\u201d Elijah said, smoothly cutting in before Parsloe could name him number one, as Jemma was certain he was about to do. \u201cAs it happens, my duchess and I intend to play the final game in our rather widely publicized match in the very near future.\u201d</p><p>Villiers gave a little crooked grin. \u201cThe duchess had an equally publicized match with me some months ago, but she threw over the game. Shall we assume that she fights to the end with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch is the nature of marriage,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cWe shall make the outcome of the duke and duchess\u2019s match the key to rating these two players,\u201d Villiers said, laying down the law. \u201cShould the duchess win, she will become number one, and vice versa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jemma always meant to win her final game with Elijah. Now the only thing that stood between her and victory was her refusal to bed her husband, because for all that Elijah seemed to enjoy their wooing, she had no real expectation that he would come to understand her point of view.</p><p>She could bear being ranked number two. \u201cTonight,\u201d she said to Villiers, and swept from the room.</p><p>She found herself in the carriage, waiting for Elijah, who was engaged in conversation with a couple of elderly women. \u201cDid you know them from somewhere?\u201d she asked curiously once he joined her.</p><p>\u201cNot so to speak,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cMrs. Mogg was kind enough to bet on my winning the game with Villiers, so I felt I had to give her the news in person. She has a shilling sixpence riding on my beating you as well,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Jemma smiled. \u201cI do hope that she has some money laid aside for a rainy day. Because that shilling is lost.\u201d</p><p>Elijah leaned over. \u201cPride goeth...\u201d he said softly. Suddenly the air in the carriage changed, and every nerve in Jemma\u2019s body jumped to attention.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>The duke was a man who knew when a game was won, without even being played. Anyone who had seen the look in his eyes after he beat Villiers would have recognized his face when the duke and duchess stepped from the carriage in front of Beaumont House.</p><p>The duchess looked pink-cheeked, disheveled, and a little dazed.</p> <p>The duke was smiling.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>London town house of the Duke of Villiers</p><p>15 Piccadilly</p><p>That evening</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been here since Villiers was on the point of death,\u201d Elijah commented as they walked up the steps.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been here,\u201d Jemma said, wondering if she ought to hand her pelisse over to the duke\u2019s butler. He looked extremely old and frail; the weight of it might knock him to the ground. Elijah saved her the decision by taking off her pelisse and handing it directly to a footman.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace and his guests are in the sitting room,\u201d the butler proclaimed, tottering ahead of them.</p><p>Jemma walked into the room and almost checked her step. Villiers had invited the Marquise de Perthuis. And this was not the marquise who would be recognized in the Court of Versailles either. Rather than her customary frizzed, crimped wig, styled to be nearly as wide as it was tall, the marquise was clearly wearing her own hair, albeit powdered. It was dressed in loose ringlets all over her head, with some flowing down each side.</p><p>What\u2019s more, she had eschewed her black-and-white attire for a chemise gown, precisely the style that Corbin had declared too sensual for Jemma to wear. The marquise\u2019s gown was made of pale hyacinth blue lustring so delicate that the fabric floated behind her as she turned to rap the gentleman she was speaking to on the shoulder with her fan. He turned his head and Jemma realized it was Corbin. But she couldn\u2019t help noting that the marquise looked utterly delectable and outrageously sensuous.</p><p>\u201cThe marquise looks much better sober,\u201d Elijah remarked. \u201cShall we?\u201d Not even waiting for Jemma, he walked forward. The marquise\u2019s roguish smile turned to something else, something delicious and intimate.</p><p>Jemma\u2019s mouth tightened. Given the way the marquise\u2019s bodice dipped in the front, Elijah could probably see her nipples.</p><p>Villiers appeared at her elbow. \u201cDear me,\u201d he said, an obvious thread of amusement in his voice. \u201cDid I misstep by inviting my dear cousin to dinner? You seemed to have achieved civility, if not friendship, in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, your cousin is always a charming companion,\u201d Jemma said, watching Elijah bend his head to the marquise again. She was flirting with her fan now, eyeing him over the edge. Jemma had to admit that the marquise wielded a fan like a deadly weapon.</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t this just what she wanted?</p><p>Of course it was! She snatched her own fan, shook it open with a snap and sailed forward. She might not be wearing a chemise gown\u2014in fact, she was wearing a dress of silver muslin that covered every inch of her bosom\u2014but she was still the Duchess of Beaumont.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely you look!\u201d she cried, by way of greeting.</p><p>The marquise dropped her a curtsy that had the marked benefit of presenting all three gentlemen\u2014Villiers, Elijah, and Corbin\u2014with an excellent view of her breasts. \u201cAs do you,\u201d she said, her tone a little breathless. \u201cI adore muslin; I always have. Why, I was married in a dress quite like that.\u201d She smiled innocently. \u201cThough of course that was quite a while ago now.\u201d</p><p>Jemma knew that if she narrowed her eyes, it would honor that insult. \u201cIt is hard to countenance how old we have all grown, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, knowing full well that the marquise was only two years younger than she. \u201cWe must make a pact never to try to dress with the joie de vivre of the very young. There\u2019s nothing worse than a matron in a dashing style that only the youngest of women can wear with confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfidence is so essential to beauty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the marquise replied, neatly turning Jemma\u2019s insult on its head. \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing worse than an anxious woman. There can be nothing more aging than desperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Villiers said, a wicked smile playing around his mouth. \u201cYou both look rather purple in the face. It must be the heat from the fire. Madame la Marquise, do let me move you away from this annoying heat.\u201d And he scooped her away while Jemma was still planning her next riposte.</p><p>Elijah was called away to greet Lord Vesey, so Jemma turned to Corbin. \u201cJust when did she transform into such a hussy?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Corbin\u2019s eyes were dancing. \u201cOnly after the second glass of Champagne. Although that gown she is wearing suggests that the real marquise has been hiding behind all that black-and-white. I find myself very interested in what her husband will make of her transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in France,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSpared the sight of his wife wearing a gown that a demirep might find too debauched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s downing a third glass of Champagne,\u201d Corbin said thoughtfully. \u201cI never should have bought those two bottles at Vauxhall. Do you know, she\u2019s been telling me the last twenty minutes that she wants to visit the gardens again tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Villiers look quite good together,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThey have that same sort of French insouciance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you need to practice,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cYou looked like a disgruntled little spaniel when you were watching her flirt with your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never look like a canine!\u201d Jemma cried.</p><p>\u201cOne who lost her bone,\u201d Corbin added.</p><p>\u201cThis was your idea,\u201d Jemma said glumly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s working very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have to move to the second part of the plan: in other words, the point at which you cut out the marquise and start flirting with Beaumont yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hurrah,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Elijah is even interested in flirting. He\u2019s such a straightforward type of person\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing a good job of it now,\u201d Corbin pointed out.</p><p>Jemma whipped her head around. The marquise had escaped from Villiers and was standing in front of Elijah. He was laughing. \u201cShe can be very witty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wanted formidable competition,\u201d Corbin said firmly. \u201cYou have it. She\u2019s witty, a little tipsy, and making it all too clear that she is available.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt herself grinding her teeth. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest that you amuse yourself for a time before making a move toward your husband,\u201d Corbin said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not considered appropriate to glower at your spouse. Remember, there\u2019s nothing more aging than desperation.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout chess, no doubt?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI expect he\u2019s seething over that combination move I managed this afternoon. We can talk it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it look as if you\u2019re flirting with him,\u201d Corbin said, by way of farewell.</p><p>Jemma pranced up to Villiers without even glancing over at Elijah. Her host was leaning against the fireplace, staring down into the fire. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re truly suffering pangs over losing those chess games,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He straightened immediately. \u201cActually, I wasn\u2019t even thinking of them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him over the edge of her fan. \u201cYou played very well. I almost regret cancelling our blindfolded game.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen him look at others with a glance so cold and indifferent that it paralyzed; he had never looked at her that way before, but he did now. \u201cDon\u2019t shame yourself, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>And, when she opened her mouth to spit back at him, he raised a hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to find yourself in bed with me, blindfolded or otherwise. To pretend otherwise is to cheapen the friendship we have managed to build.\u201d</p><p>He looked directly at her. \u201cWhich I treasure. I have few friendships.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward involuntarily and held out her hand. He stared down for a moment as if he didn\u2019t understand what to do. Then his large, warm fingers curled around hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have behaved in such an insincere fashion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose there was a reason for it,\u201d Villiers said, throwing a glance across the room toward where Elijah was talking with the marquise. Jemma could hear her soft giggles.</p><p>\u201cSo have you really known the marquise since she was a young girl?\u201d she asked brightly.</p><p>\u201cShe was an awful little thing, as you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect she was one of those children who never smudged her dress and was adored by her governess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was as small and round as a shrub, one of those shrubs that looks innocent but is kitted out with thorns. I remember playing spillikins with her, and when it appeared she\u2019d lost, she picked up a stick and tried to stab me in the chest.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed.</p><p>\u201cShe did!\u201d Villiers protested. \u201cI can imagine that you were a little devil as well.\u201d</p><p>Jemma realized that their hands were still linked. But what did it matter? It was a small dinner, and she just heard Elijah laughing at another of the marquise\u2019s sallies. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t worried about her intimacies with Villiers. \u201cI was charming,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhereas you were undoubtedly a dreadful boy.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her from under his long eyelashes, and she felt that odd pulse of alarm again. \u201cTrue enough,\u201d he said, leaning a bit closer. \u201cFierce, bad-tempered, and, I realize now, inconsolably lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Leopold,\u201d she said, her hand tightening on his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you were lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hardly a wretched existence. I amused myself by giving the servants assigned to me a terrible time. The only person who could control me at all was Ashmole, my butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same butler you have now?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cHe used to spank me on a regular basis,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHe was fearless, for all that he was just a footman then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re not as bad as you let everyone think,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ideas about my sainthood,\u201d he replied with an indifferent glance. \u201cI keep Ashmole here because I can\u2019t be bothered to pension him off.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed at that, and reached up to tuck back a strand of Villiers\u2019s hair that had fallen from the ribbon tied at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo how long will you allow the marquise to trifle with your husband?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt seems like a strange type of parlor game. Clearly you feel strongly about her behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah needs to have fun,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have decided that he has been far too serious all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how much fun do you intend he should have? This is all sounding alarmingly depraved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that much fun!\u201d Jemma said, rapping him with her fan. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you could have such a dissipated thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have many dissipated thoughts,\u201d Villiers said lazily. \u201cThey\u2019re practically my stock in trade. I think I\u2019d better tell Ashmole to move supper forward. My cousin has drunk an alarming amount of Champagne, and the last thing I want is a drunken tr\u00e8s-coquette losing control of her stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair is still falling out of its ribbon, Leopold.\u201d Jemma tucked the lock behind his ear before she turned about, flipped open her fan, and began to saunter across the room. The marquise may have been half dressed, but she considered herself unrivaled in the art of flirtation.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later she had woken to a signal truth: she could certainly flirt, but only if the man in question showed interest.</p><p>The marquise and Elijah were tucked together on a small sofa. While Elijah stood up when she approached, there was something careless in the way he looked at her, and he immediately excused himself and sat down again, which was so extraordinarily rude that she could hardly believe it had just happened. Elijah was never rude.</p><p>Jemma stood in front of the sofa for a moment like a gauche debutante. \u201cDo allow me to join your conversation,\u201d she said, managing to keep her tone calm with an effort.</p><p>Elijah glanced up at her. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, blinking as if he\u2019d forgotten she was there at all. \u201cI shall pull up a chair for you.\u201d</p><p>The moment he stepped away to bring a chair, she seated herself beside Louise. \u201cHow are you tonight, dear marquise?\u201d</p><p>Louise eyed her a little blurrily and then smiled. \u201cI am enjoying myself. Your husband is the sweetest, most attentive man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine\u2014\u201d Jemma began, but then Elijah reappeared with a chair.</p><p>\u201cWe were discussing foolish antics from our childhoods,\u201d he said. His eyes slid directly past Jemma and focused on the marquise again. Perhaps on her bosom; Jemma couldn\u2019t quite tell.</p><p>\u201cVilliers and I were just discussing the same thing!\u201d Jemma said gaily. \u201cHe insists that he was an extraordinarily naughty boy as a lad.\u201d</p><p>At that, Elijah finally looked at her. \u201cGive me the boy and you give me the man,\u201d he said. There was something remarkably cold in his tone.</p><p>\u201cWere you naughty?\u201d she asked him, fanning herself slightly. This conversation was not going precisely as she had planned.</p><p>\u201cBetween the two of us, I expect that you would win that particular ribbon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was a bit of a madcap,\u201d the marquise put in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that,\u201d Elijah said, his tone caressing.</p><p>\u201cYou are, of course, lauded for being exceptionally stylish, but also for your irreproachable reputation.\u201d</p><p>The marquise giggled and fluttered her eyelashes at him. \u201cI assure you that I was a bit of a romp. My mother despaired of me. Why, I had a wild infatuation with Villiers. I took every opportunity I could to flirt with him, though my mother made it as difficult as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen have always shown an attraction to Villiers,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing, from a logical point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma realized there were undercurrents to the conversation that she wasn\u2019t grasping. Elijah leaned forward and took the marquise\u2019s fan from her hand, acting as if Jemma wasn\u2019t even sitting there. \u201cThis is exquisite,\u201d he said. \u201cA lovely dancing scene. It can\u2019t have been a gift from Villiers, of course, given as it is more coquettish than debauched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I would accept a gift from Villiers,\u201d Louise said, seemingly remembering her finicky disposition for a moment. \u201cI am a married woman, Your Grace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have accepted many such small gifts,\u201d Jemma put in. \u201cVilliers gave me an exquisite fan last year...dear me, I wonder what could have happened to it? It was one of my very favorites.\u201d She knew quite well what had happened to it. Her husband had taken one glance, thrown it to a footman, and she never saw it again.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll give you another,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cMy dear marquise, you appear a bit flushed. Shall we find you another glass of Champagne?\u201d</p><p>Jemma opened her mouth to say that further Champagne was inadvisable, or something along those lines, but the marquise had already bounded up from the sofa and was flouncing away on Elijah\u2019s arm before she could formulate the sentence.</p> <p>Leaving her alone on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHow the mighty are fallen.\u201d Villiers plumped himself down next to her and handed her a glass.</p><p>She turned to him and to her horror felt tears rising to her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s angry for some reason, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink your Champagne,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cOf course he\u2019s angry. Elijah has no interest in my cousin, a sweet little drunken duck of a woman. Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d</p><p>His tone was bracing, and the Champagne helped too. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to flirt with me,\u201d Jemma said a few minutes later, rather sadly.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cPerhaps he wants something more than a light flirtation with you. You are his wife, after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I intended to woo him this week,\u201d she said desperately.</p><p>\u201cMen can take only so much wooing. Not that I\u2019ve experienced much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the point. Elijah never had a chance to have the fun of flirting with a seductive woman. It was supposed to be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that Elijah considers it fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s certainly having a lovely time at the moment,\u201d Jemma said, drinking some more of her Champagne. She could see them across the room, standing close together and seemingly examining something in one of Villiers\u2019s cabinets.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he is. If you want my opinion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Jemma interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to flirt with the marquise, or with you either. Elijah is a serious man, Jemma. You have to understand that if you intend to love him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Did she love him?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were the best of friends for ten years,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cElijah was never any good at just tumbling around in the mud, for example. He always had to be building something, planning a town or an invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has never liked to play. It\u2019s not in his nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe plays chess,\u201d she said, defending him.</p><p>\u201cHe likes games of strategy. You might want to take that into account before you get your feathers too ruffled tonight. Now...speaking of chess.\u201d</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t want to speak of chess, but it was better than watching her husband laugh with another woman.</p><p>\u201cWe might view this all as a giant chessboard,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d All right, she couldn\u2019t stop watching. Did Elijah really have to touch the marquise on the shoulder in that intimate manner?</p><p>\u201cObviously, I am the Black King,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Finally she looked at him. He had that wicked little smile of his. \u201cAnd I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe White Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes Louise the Black Queen,\u201d Jemma pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd Elijah, as always, the White King.\u201d Villiers sighed, but his eyes were laughing. \u201cI told you I was becoming a saint, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall sacrifice myself,\u201d he said, rising and bringing her to her feet. \u201cThe Black King sweeps the Black Queen from the board. It pains me to do it. It\u2019s been such a day for losing at chess. I can hardly countenance my own defeats.\u201d</p><p>Jemma watched from the side of the room as Villiers nimbly drew his cousin from Elijah\u2019s side. She didn\u2019t approach Elijah, though. He didn\u2019t like to flirt, and his temper was uncertain. At dinner, Villiers sat at the head of the table, flirting outrageously with the marquise, who looked prettier every moment.</p><p>Elijah was engaged in a lively discussion with Lord Vesey about Pitt\u2019s India Act. Jemma and Corbin discussed the plate of fruit that the Duchess of Guise had worn atop her wig during her recent visit to London.</p><p>\u201cI preferred Lady Kersnips\u2019s stalks of barley,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cAnd you are not listening to me, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>In fact, she was eavesdropping on Elijah\u2019s conversation. Lord Vesey was inquiring about the aftermath of the riots. \u201cI was in the office of the chief magistrate day before yesterday,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cDid you know that Lord Stibblestich is the liaison between the House of Lords and the office of the magistrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear the man,\u201d Vesey grunted.</p><p>\u201cStibblestich\u2019s response to the riot is to suggest that they should all be shot.\u201d</p><p>Corbin was listening as well, and he cut in with a comment. \u201cThe papers adamantly concurred with that sentence. I had not heard there was dispute about the matter at all.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s gaze brushed over Jemma and turned to Corbin. \u201cStibblestich doesn\u2019t stop with the rioters. You see, the prisoners were bound to die anyway. The hulks breed disease and despair, and they would likely die within a few months, saving the price of the rounds of lead needed to shoot them. The hulks are not prisons; they are effective ways by which the government of England can dispatch large numbers of unwanted men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is reprehensible,\u201d Jemma said, pulling his attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cStibblestich maintains that since the rioters had nothing to lose by rioting,\u201d Elijah said, \u201cwe must be more aggressive in order to deter future riots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t mean to torture them before shooting them!\u201d Vesey said.</p><p>\u201cNo. He suggests we take all male members of each man\u2019s family into custody as possible accessories to crime. And place all those men on the hulks,\u201d Elijah continued relentlessly. \u201cEvery one of them. Elderly fathers, brothers, brothers-in-law, and male children over the age of eleven.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes slid away from Jemma as he turned to Vesey. \u201cYes, eleven. He has specified that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought he was a blackguard,\u201d Vesey grunted. \u201cHis father was the same. Hope you managed to head him off, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, while Stibblestich doesn\u2019t give a damn about the opinion of elected officials, he\u2019s still cowed by my rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Jemma whispered. That was what Elijah had been doing at dawn, when he left her without a note.</p> <p>He turned away as if he were too tired, or too disgusted, to even look at her any longer.</p><p>Corbin launched into a meandering monologue that touched on everything from the newest hats to the price of shoe buckles, as Elijah and Lord Vesey continued their conversation.</p><p>\u201cSurely this meal is almost over,\u201d Jemma said, interrupting Corbin a moment later. \u201cIt seems endless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even the rather extraordinary sight of our host flirting so outrageously with the marquise helps your ennui?\u201d Corbin asked. \u201cHer husband will learn of this by next week, even if he is in France. Just look how Lady Vesey keeps peering at them.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was what the marquise wanted. And in a way, the Duke of Villiers was an even better person for such a rumor, as Henri would never believe that Villiers wouldn\u2019t seduce his wife, whereas Elijah\u2019s Puritanical reputation might blunt the marquis\u2019s jealousy.</p> <p>\u201cI have such a headache,\u201d Jemma said, truthfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the dear marquise probably feels worse,\u201d Corbin said thoughtfully. \u201cShe\u2019s looking quite white. And swaying. Oh, dear.\u201d</p><p>In the fracas that followed the Marquise de Perthuis\u2019s collapse from her chair, Elijah appeared at Jemma\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful, Jemma thought. She looked like an old hag compared to the luscious, drunken marquise. \u201cIn truth, I should like to go home,\u201d she said, rising.</p><p>Elijah was nothing if not efficient. Two minutes later they were sitting in the carriage, heading home in total silence.</p><p>She spent most of the trip reminding herself that there were many reasons that people didn\u2019t like being married, and this just proved their point: spouses suffered black moods, and one simply had to endure them.</p> <p>\u201cWill you retire directly?\u201d Elijah asked, helping her off with her pelisse after they entered the house.</p><p>The only thing she wanted was to get away from all these emotions that she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI was intending to repair to the library,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a new chess set that I\u2019m eager to try out.\u201d</p><p>He prowled after her, without saying whether he would play or no. Fowle had set the chessboard by the fire. The pieces were made of gorgeously carved ivory and jasper, each one a small work of art.</p><p>Jemma sat down quickly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d She picked up the king. He was standing with one leg forward, arms crossed, a ferocious scowl on his face. His body was dwarfed by his crown, which loomed over him: a remarkable sphere, carved with open work.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d she said, holding it up, \u201cif you look inside you\u2019ll see another sphere, and another, smaller and smaller.\u201d</p><p>Elijah took it from her while she looked at a knight. He too was the embodiment of rage: riding his horse with a small hand raised above his head in a posture of utter fury.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you acquire this?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was a gift,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cLook, Elijah, the rook has a tiny person inside the window.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you say that I am a restrained person?\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked up. Her husband sounded as if he were speaking through clenched teeth. \u201cYes, of course I would, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn short, my face never takes on a seething expression like that on the face of this king.\u201d</p><p>She was starting to wish that she had just gone to bed.</p><p>\u201cThis is a gift from a man, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Elijah said, still with that curiously flat intonation.</p><p>\u201cIf you are planning to boil with rage over that fact,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe we should cancel our game until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis chess set is worth a small fortune.\u201d</p><p>Jemma put down the piece she was holding and rose to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly who sent it to you. And I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find this display of matrimonial jealousy somewhat surprising after the lavish attentions you paid to another woman this evening,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to mention her bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me names!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, and I know, that the kind of relationship the marquise and I have\u2014if one could even call it that\u2014was limited to a mild flirtation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly didn\u2019t look like that to me!\u201d Jemma interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhereas you and Villiers only exchanged commonplaces?\u201d</p><p>So that was the problem. \u201cIt was different,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWe talked of chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the two of you together,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cDo you know, Jemma, that I am besotted?\u201d He was speaking between clenched teeth.</p><p>Her heart thumped. \u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I can\u2019t stop watching you. It means that I watched you near the fireplace, touching Villiers, smoothing his hair, talking to him. That was no ripe, easily dismissed flirtation between a drunken woman and a man she decided to compliment!\u201d</p><p>Jemma opened her mouth but he swept on.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask exactly why you set that woman to flirting with me? I felt as if I were a steak on a string, being dangled before a dog. Just what did I do to deserve that, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be a punishment! I was trying to give you some fun! I thought if another woman wooed you, it would be fun for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know the truly ironic thing about this?\u201d Elijah asked.</p><p>Jemma was fairly sure she didn\u2019t want to know, but he didn\u2019t wait for her to answer. \u201cI told Villiers to go ahead with his seduction. I told him to try his best, because I was winning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d Jemma said, losing her temper entirely. \u201cYou discussed me? You discussed which one of you could have me? Were my feelings in the matter ever taken into consideration at all?\u201d</p><p>Elijah held up his hand. The chess king stood on his palm, arms folded, glaring. \u201cI told him to go ahead and court you, and look what happened.\u201d</p><p>Jemma frowned.</p><p>With one swift movement, Elijah hurled the white king straight into the fireplace. It shattered against the bricks. Jemma gasped, but by then the white queen was also in shards. Words choked her throat, but rather than utter them, she just folded her arms and waited. It was too late for the set. Once the king was gone, the set was gone.</p><p>She would have thought that Elijah might get tired of it, but no. Every single ivory piece smashed against the back of the fireplace, followed by the black pieces. They smashed more easily; she had to suppose that chalcedony was brittle.</p><p>Then her husband turned back to her. \u201cNow is my face calm and reasonable?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my limits, Jemma. I will not watch you and Villiers express your\u2014your love for each other in front of my very eyes. You played with his hair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou held hands with him. In front of a dinner party of some six persons. In front of your husband, you took his hand! I am a man, Jemma. You are mine, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong to no one,\u201d Jemma protested. She felt extraordinarily tired, and rather sad. This all confirmed her notion that Elijah\u2019s relation with Villiers was far more important to him than that with his wife. \u201cMay I inquire why my chess set had to go the way of the fireplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it was a gift from a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any man. Villiers. I lost my temper\u2014\u201d He caught himself, looking surprised. \u201cI lost my temper because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers didn\u2019t give me that chess set,\u201d Jemma said. She folded her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Strange sent me the chess set.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment of silence\u2014and she enjoyed every second of it. Finally, Elijah said, \u201cI apologize. I\u2019m sorry about the damn chess set, Jemma. But you can\u2019t behave like that in front of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014Because you\u2019re mine.\u201d His eyes claimed her with the same ruthlessness as his words.</p><p>\u201cAm I yours because you care about me, or because you don\u2019t want to share anything with Villiers?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stark silence in the room. \u201cWhy on earth would you think such a thing?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>She turned away, picked up the poker and stirred the shards in the back of the fireplace. \u201cBecause it is true. Because your possessiveness has more to do with Villiers than with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so. I cannot share you with any man, Jemma. I cannot.\u201d The words seemed wrenched from his chest.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>He caught her arm as she turned. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely Pitt is demanding your presence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I would be unavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...in the future? You told him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I cannot simply put aside everything that is important to me, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to qualify. I understand what you find important.\u201d She felt an overwhelming sweep of exhaustion. \u201cI suppose I can plan a diversion for tomorrow.\u201d Her tone was bleak rather than bitter, which was a triumph in itself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear it when you look like that,\u201d Elijah said, his voice savage. Then his arms were like steel bands around her and his lips took her mouth, hard and demanding. He lifted her off her feet, wrapping her in lust and desire.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a sound in the room, in the world, except for their hard breathing and little murmurs or groans. Only a tinkle from the jeweled flower in her hair striking the ground woke Jemma.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. And then a bit stronger: \u201cNo, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded thick and strained. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She pushed away. \u201cI won\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He made a hungry sound in the back of his throat. But he let her go. \u201cLet me be with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she remembered where she planned to go in the afternoon. It was as if life itself was conspiring to break down the last protection she had against him. She knew instinctively that going to bed with her husband would break her. It would leave her vulnerable to utter despair, not only because of his passion for work. But because when his heart\u2014</p><p>Her throat closed and she turned. \u201cI must go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Elijah never begged.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, not turning around as she almost ran for the door, intent on reaching her room before she wept. \u201cYou may accompany me. I have an appointment at three in the afternoon. I leave an hour beforehand.\u201d</p><p>Outside the room, she took a shaky breath and concentrated on climbing the stairs. Elijah was stripping away her defenses, one by one. And unless she was fortunate, tomorrow\u2019s excursion would break down the very last of them, leaving her broken.</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t being logical, or even fair, given that she was his wife. She\u2019d returned from Paris explicitly so her husband could bed her and create an heir.</p><p>It was practical. The honorable thing to do. And yet terror caught in her throat at the very idea. It had all made sense before...</p><p>Before she loved him so much.</p><p>She ran all the way to her bedchamber, but even so, a footman saw the tears on her cheeks.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>March 31</p><p>Elijah turned over from a confused dream in which Jemma was riding a white horse far ahead of him, disappearing into a wild, bramble-strewn forest. He was calling to her to wait, but she was too far ahead\u2014</p><p>\u201cWake up, damn it,\u201d a cold voice said.</p><p>He opened his eyes to find Villiers standing by his bedside. Vickery, his valet, was hurriedly throwing open the curtains.</p><p>As always, Villiers was magnificently dressed, from his coat to his snowy neck cloth. \u201cYou\u2019re a deep sleeper,\u201d he said, tapping his sword stick.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early.\u201d Elijah pulled himself up in the bed. Then he added, \u201cI\u2019m shocked. I thought you were the sort who didn\u2019t rouse until ten of the clock at the least, and after that would take the morning to dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Villiers said, all evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Elijah squinted at the windows. It couldn\u2019t be later than seven or eight. Jemma had promised to take him with her at two o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cStop smiling in that nauseating fashion,\u201d Villiers barked. \u201cYou make me feel ill. I\u2019ll wait for you downstairs. We have an appointment in forty minutes, so make your toilette a brief one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppointment?\u201d But he was talking to an already-closed door, so he swung his legs from the bed.</p><p>Vickery was nervously pulling clothes from the wardrobe. \u201cWill you wear the velvet today, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>The coat was black, like most of Elijah\u2019s clothing. \u201cI need an appointment with my tailor,\u201d he said. \u201cI no longer wish to look so funereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Your Grace.\u201d He drew out stockings, boots, a shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t appear as nervous when I am in a hurry to go somewhere,\u201d Elijah observed, pulling on smalls.</p><p>Vickery actually shivered. \u201cHis Grace the Duke of Villiers is so proper, so rigid in his dressing and clothing!\u201d</p><p>Elijah waited.</p><p>\u201cPerfect in every way,\u201d Vickery added, his voice hushed. \u201cAnd his valet...everyone knows Mr. Finchley is the best in London.\u201d He sounded as if the man were an alchemist who could turn lead into gold.</p><p>\u201cIs Villiers so difficult to dress, then?\u201d Elijah pulled pantaloons over his stockings.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2014but everything!\u2014must be perfect,\u201d Vickery said. \u201cHe has been known to tie his neck cloth fourteen, fifteen times. A fresh cloth each time, you understand. And everything next to his skin is the finest linen. Once he threw a pair of smalls out the window because they were inadequately ironed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody absurd,\u201d Elijah murmured. \u201cDo you iron my smalls, Vickery?\u201d</p><p>His valet looked offended. \u201cI iron only your neck cloths, Your Grace. I cannot trust anyone else with those. A laundry maid irons your intimates, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have a maid just for ironing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral,\u201d his valet said, kneeling to help him slip on his boots. \u201cHer Grace, naturally, has some three personal maids, as well as a laundry maid who works only with her garments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of London,\u201d Elijah marveled, \u201ctoiling away simply to keep two people adequately dressed.\u201d</p><p>Vickery was holding his wig. Elijah looked at it with distaste. \u201cThe Duke of Villiers never wears a wig,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cNever. His Grace sets his own fashion.\u201d Vickery\u2019s voice was reverent.</p><p>Elijah sighed. He wore his hair extremely short to accommodate a wig, and he had to admit that after so many years, he hardly noticed it anymore. He popped it on his head and accepted a walking stick.</p><p>\u201cWe have no time to break your fast,\u201d Villiers told him, when Elijah joined him downstairs.</p><p>\u201cJust where are we going?\u201d Elijah asked, taking his hat from Fowle.</p><p>But Villiers waited until they were in the carriage. \u201cI\u2019ve made an appointment with the best man for hearts,\u201d he said, rapping on the door to signal his coachman to take off.</p> <p>For a moment Elijah thought confusedly about breakfast meats, then the penny dropped. \u201cMy heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obviously not bothering to deal with these unpleasantries yourself,\u201d Villiers remarked. \u201cI find myself constrained to play the role of nursemaid. And it doesn\u2019t suit my personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresumptuous of you,\u201d Elijah observed, keeping his temper.</p><p>\u201cA truly presumptuous friend would tell your wife,\u201d Villiers said. His voice was so oiled and cold that he could have been speaking to his worst enemy.</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That explains a great deal about the last few days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour interference is quite unnecessary,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have saved my life, as my valet believes you to have done. Then we\u2019d both be rid of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are charming in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not morning,\u201d Villiers retorted. \u201cThis is the tail end of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been to bed?\u201d Elijah peered at him. Villiers appeared immaculately groomed. His hair was tied back in its usual velvet ribbon, and there wasn\u2019t a crease on his neck cloth.</p><p>A small smile played around Villiers\u2019s mouth. \u201cI was entertaining a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the marquise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouise was in no state to be entertained by anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLouise?\u201d Elijah repeated, at a loss for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThe Marquise de Perthuis,\u201d Villiers said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see a doctor, for hearts or otherwise,\u201d Elijah said flatly.</p><p>\u201cDid you faint yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for three days,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cPerhaps it will all go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pigs will fly, etcetera,\u201d Villiers said with a wave of his hand. \u201cPeople have accused you of many things, but never of cowardice.\u201d</p><p>Elijah digested that. \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may well be that he\u2019ll tell you that you have a rare fainting illness, and cure it on the spot.\u201d</p><p>Elijah snorted. \u201cMy father died of a defective heart, and mine is going the same direction.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s face grew so forbidding that Elijah didn\u2019t continue. \u201cIn that case,\u201d he said coolly, \u201cyou will do your wife the favor of tidying up your affairs. Perhaps we could have your coffin measured this afternoon, since you are so determined to die in the near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy affairs are in order,\u201d Elijah said icily.</p><p>\u201cHave you updated your will?\u201d Villiers paused, then added deliberately, \u201cIn the event that you have no heir, of course.\u201d</p><p>Elijah felt his heart, stupid defective instrument that it was, give a great thump.</p><p>Villiers continued, ruthless to the end. \u201cWho is to put your affairs in order if you die intestate? Not I.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s only reply was unprintable but heartfelt.</p><p>\u201cThe same to you,\u201d Villiers said serenely, and then they kept silence until they reached the doctor\u2019s offices.</p><p>Dr. Chalus was large-headed and bald. His wig sat on top of a stack of books; more books cluttered the floor and all the chairs. His offices were hung with blood-purple curtains, as if he didn\u2019t see enough of the color during the day, and they smelled distinctly of cabbage.</p><p>Villiers strolled in and after one pained glance focused on the doctor\u2019s shiny pate.</p><p>\u201cDo sit down,\u201d the doctor said, not bothering to look up. His servant paled, moved closer and repeated shrilly:</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers and the Duke of Beaumont. Two dukes are here to consult with you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Chalus hummed, deep in his throat, and finally looked up. His eyes were bloodshot and tired, and for the first time, Elijah felt a bit of hope. The doctor looked like a man working as hard to cure hearts as he himself was to cure the ills of English governance.</p><p>\u201cYour Graces,\u201d he said, looking singularly unimpressed by their presence in his office. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>By fifteen minutes later, though, it was clear that Chalus was having no more luck solving heart problems than Elijah had had in the House of Lords. \u201cYour heart is beating irregularly,\u201d he said. \u201cI can hear it clearly. At the moment it is quite fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do for it?\u201d Elijah asked, already knowing the answer. The doctor\u2019s eyes were far too sympathetic for his liking.</p><p>\u201cI have had small successes here and there,\u201d he told them. \u201cI am working on a medicine that will force urination when a patient has dropsy. I believe the swelling we call dropsy indicates the heart is about to give out. But your ankles are quite normal.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded.</p><p>\u201cFrom the sound of your heart, you may have a spasmodic defect, something wrong on the right side. Which is unusual: generally one hears problems with the left side. That may explain...\u201d</p><p>Dr. Chalus\u2019s voice died away and he looked as if he were listening to an argument only he could hear.</p><p>Villiers cleared his throat.</p><p>The doctor shook himself. \u201cYour heartbeat is tumultuous, but you are perplexingly free of some of the symptoms I would expect. Perhaps a structural defect on the right side would explain why you are not suffering from dropsy. I would love to know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you determine it?\u201d Elijah asked.</p><p>Chalus shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you gain your knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough autopsy of the dead,\u201d the doctor said, backing away to his desk. \u201cAnd for the most part, those patients who are wealthy enough to realize that they should see me are not inclined to allow me to examine their bodies after death.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded. He had no such inclination himself.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how frustrating the study of medicine can be. The only bodies I am able to examine are those of criminals. And when a man has been hanged, it is readily obvious why and how he died. That is not helpful in the study of hearts. You\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he said, turning to include Villiers in the conversation, \u201chow infrequently criminals suffer from dropsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Villiers said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is nothing that can be done,\u201d Elijah stated. He felt a remote airiness in his head, though it was nothing he hadn\u2019t surmised himself.</p><p>Dr. Chalus was sympathetic enough. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to offer you that isn\u2019t, frankly, a palliative. I am currently having some success by inducing my patients to inhale a vapor infused with fungi, or mushrooms. But as I say, I am trying to find a cure for dropsy, and you show no signs of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you are not the only physician studying hearts?\u201d Villiers said briskly. \u201cWho are your colleagues? Who else is experimenting with such medicines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarwin, of course,\u201d Chalus said. \u201cErasmus Darwin. But frankly, I consider him a fool, and his recent publications have been rather weak. There\u2019s a fellow that we\u2019re considering admitting to the Royal Society. He\u2019s had some luck, I believe...\u201d He went over to his desk and began rummaging about the great sheaves of paper.</p> <p>Elijah wasn\u2019t even listening. Villiers was right. He had to prepare his estate. He should summon his solicitor tonight.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>The doctor paused. \u201cYou present an unusual case, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can give me some sort of estimation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are fainting, you said, for short periods of time. Immediately upon vigorous exercise?\u201d</p> <p>Elijah shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHe was in a fistfight at Vauxhall last night and seemed in the pink of health afterwards,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut I found him unconscious, sitting in a chair one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tired,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cTired. If I\u2019m very, very tired, and I sit down...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rather lucky,\u201d Dr. Chalus said. \u201cMost patients can\u2019t tolerate vigorous exercise and you seem to be the opposite. How often does this occur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have these episodes perhaps once a week. More so if I am deeply exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recommend avoiding exhaustion, though I\u2019m sure that has occurred to you as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you have a month, perhaps a year. I apologize, Your Grace, but I can no more name the day of your death than I can entice a chicken to sing.\u201d</p><p>He went back to scrabbling among his papers. \u201cAh, here it is. William Withering. He trained in Scotland, though I believe he lives in Birmingham. He published a very interesting study of fungi; the Witheringia solanacea was given his name as a result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Villiers prompted.</p><p>\u201cIn more recent months he\u2019s had some remarkable results giving a reduction of Digitalis purpurea to heart patients. I have that piece here somewhere. Aha! You may keep that,\u201d he said, handing the papers to Villiers.</p><p>\u201cAs a member of the Royal Society, I can easily obtain another copy.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Elijah, who was putting his coat back on. \u201cI should be very remiss,\u201d Chalus began, and stopped.</p><p>Villiers raised his head. Elijah nodded at the doctor and spoke for him. \u201cYou wish to tell me that I might not have a month. I might die on your very doorstep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeath is an unwelcome visitor,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cWe might any of us be struck down by a wayward coach in the street outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cTrue.\u201d His lips felt numb. It was one thing to know of his father\u2019s fate and to surmise the same of himself. It was another to hear it so bluntly stated.</p><p>Villiers was bowing, so Elijah did the same. They walked out onto an ordinary street, in the ordinary sunshine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a coach to Birmingham,\u201d Villiers announced.</p><p>Elijah hesitated, and said nothing. There were some advantages to having known a man since you were both boys. There was no stopping Villiers once he took that tone.</p><p>\u201cI have to write Jemma a letter,\u201d Elijah said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI promised that I wouldn\u2019t leave the house without a personal note.\u201d He smiled rather crookedly.</p><p>\u201cThis qualifies,\u201d Villiers observed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write the letter when I get home and put it in the desk in the library, bottom left drawer, the locked one. Will you give it to her?\u201d</p><p>The word sounded as if it came from behind clenched teeth, but: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need at least a week,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cGod, but we haven\u2019t slept together yet, Leopold. And I want it to be joyful. I couldn\u2019t bear if she was afraid I would topple over, a corpse from the very act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are far more fit than your father was. He was quite robust, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlump,\u201d Elijah corrected.</p><p>\u201cI expect that made exercise more of a danger.\u201d Villiers leaned his head back against the velvet seat and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou finally look tired,\u201d Elijah observed.</p><p>\u201cYou could always do as I do,\u201d Villiers said with his coldly amused smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no point in sleeping if my partner is willing and energetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be very energetic,\u201d Elijah said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Marguerite. She is a widow still in the throes of mourning her elderly husband, or so her family thinks. They expect her to pray at his grave at least two hours a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tells me that the graveside is much more bearable after one of my visits,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. She\u2019ll want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all want you,\u201d Elijah said, amused. \u201cThe great Duke of Villiers...one of the richest men in the kingdom, and one of the most successful at evading the parson\u2019s noose. You pose a challenge, Leopold, and that is the most dangerous of all positions to be in.\u201d</p><p>Villiers shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mourn your fianc\u00e9e, do you?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cThe one who ran off with Jemma\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want what you have.\u201d</p><p>There was the stark truth of it, in the open between them. \u201cI know,\u201d Elijah said heavily.</p><p>\u201cNot Jemma,\u201d Villiers stated. \u201cBut a woman of her intelligence and beauty, who looks at me the way she looks at you. If I had what you have, even for one day, I believe I might die happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let your jealousy make you into a fool.\u201d Villiers\u2019s voice grated.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Elijah said again.</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else until the carriage drew up before Beaumont House. Then Leopold opened his heavy lidded eyes and met Elijah\u2019s. \u201cYou asked me once to keep wooing Jemma so that I could be there when you died. I would ask you to release me from that promise. I love her. But not in the way you supposed.\u201d</p><p>His words were sure and steady, and fell on Elijah\u2019s soul like a healing balm. \u201cHave you forgiven me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which of your multitudinous sins?\u201d Villiers asked, the sardonic bite back in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFor stealing your Bess those years ago...for turning my back on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019ll mourn the loss of my barmaid until death.\u201d</p><p>Elijah blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou always were a fool,\u201d Villiers murmured, closing his eyes again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Elijah warned.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you a note as well.\u201d He laughed aloud at Villiers\u2019s revolted expression.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>That afternoon</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Elijah asked, handing his wife into the carriage. It couldn\u2019t be a fashionable destination because as far as he could tell, Jemma was wearing small side panniers if any, and she certainly wore no wig.</p><p>She must have forgiven him for the tempest of the previous night because she smiled teasingly. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret. I\u2019ve already instructed Muffet as to our destination.\u201d</p><p>For the last nine years he had punished himself for having no wife\u2014or rather for having a wife in France. He had ignored the pleasantries of women who sought his company, avoided the eyes of women who sought money...satisfied himself alone, in his room. Infrequently and unhappily.</p><p>Now he felt like tinder about to flare. The curve of Jemma\u2019s lower lip, the faint scent of roses that clung to her skin...</p> <p>\u201cYou never used to like perfume,\u201d he commented, climbing into the coach after her. He thought of sitting beside her, but even without large panniers, her skirts still filled most of the carriage seat.</p><p>\u201cI rarely wear scent. I did today only because when I\u2019m naked, I feel more protected with perfume.\u201d</p><p>Her words seared Elijah\u2019s body and he heard his own hoarse voice as if it were another man\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be naked?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, the eternal smile of the Sphinx. Obviously, she had said all she intended. He spent the rest of the journey tormenting himself by imagining her soft and smooth, creamy white and delicate...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d she said crossly just as the carriage stopped.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look at you any other way,\u201d he said to her back as she descended from the carriage.</p> <p>Elijah descended onto a cobblestone street in a part of London he didn\u2019t recognize. It wasn\u2019t even a part of London whose smell he recognized. He knew the smell of coal that hung around the Inns of Court, and the smell of cloth dyes down by the Thames. Hyde Park\u2019s sooty poplars had no odor, and so the park smelled mostly of dust and sweaty horses. He knew when he was in Smithfield from the odor of dung that spread from it like a fetid gift. Limehouse, where the riots didn\u2019t take place...Limehouse smelled like the sea and the cheerful poor, like baking bread and buckets of urine thrown into the street at night.</p><p>But this street smelled like lilacs in a country garden. They were standing before a wall with a small door. An old wall, made of round stones and sand that looked old enough to date to the days of Henry IV, or even earlier than that.</p><p>He looked at Jemma but she wasn\u2019t going to tell him anything, obviously. So they stood there in the street and smelled lilacs drifting from somewhere, while a footman rang the bell hanging by the door.</p><p>A little monk in a rough-woven white robe opened the door. That was interesting, and not what Elijah expected. He hadn\u2019t thought clearly, but the question of nakedness jostled in his mind into a pleasant anticipation of sin, skin, pleasure...</p><p>A witch\u2019s brew of sensual experience that monks had no part of.</p><p>\u201cAs you requested, Your Grace,\u201d the man said, bowing. \u201cThe baths are ready.\u201d</p><p>Jemma stepped forward. \u201cWe are most grateful, Frater.\u201d His grizzled head quickly disappeared back through the door.</p><p>Elijah grabbed Jemma\u2019s arm. \u201cThere are no monks in England,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure that Henry VIII did away with them.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a monk. He just looked like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is he?\u201d</p><p>She drew him forward. Inside the old walls there was a great muddy courtyard made of ill-kept pavement though which poked blades of grass and stunted weeds. Lilacs grew in a tangled mess against the wall, pale flowers opening in the first signs of spring. Wild garlic had sprung up around the lilac, adding a touch of pungency to the air.</p><p>The door closed behind them. Across the courtyard, square-cut pillars rose to the level of a second floor. Most of the roof was still there, but to the right there was nothing but rubble. Ahead of them the \u201cmonk\u201d vanished into the maze of pillars. For an old man, he was remarkably nimble.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jemma said, taking Elijah\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Something was nagging at Elijah\u2019s memory but he couldn\u2019t bring it to the surface. Swallows were diving and reeling in the open courtyard, flying around the standing pillars, under the roof, and out the other side.</p><p>\u201cA Roman balineum,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cBaths,\u201d Elijah said, puzzling it out. \u201cI thought they\u2019d been torn down. Or fallen down, years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baths are this way.\u201d She led him among the pillars, curved to the right, and a floor paved with half-cracked and dingy blue tiles appeared. There had been mosaics there once. A single blue eye stared up at Elijah from a fractured tile, the curve of a lion\u2019s tail from another.</p><p>Jemma descended broad shallow steps and the air turned hazy. She walked ahead of him through a warm mist that clung to her hair and turned her pelisse from a rich ruby to a dimmer mauve.</p><p>Then they came out into the bath. It was very large, filled with clear water from which rose tendrils of steam. The room had walls of varying heights on three sides, and was sheltered on the fourth by a great bank of overgrown lilacs. There was no sign of the small monk. Without hesitation, Jemma walked around the bath and stood on the other side. He began to follow her, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s divided into men\u2019s and women\u2019s baths, don\u2019t you see?\u201d She pointed down into the clear water. The tiles on the bath\u2019s floor were intact, and clearly divided in two. He could see there must have once been a separating wall, but it had either disintegrated or been torn down.</p><p>The men\u2019s side, where he stood, depicted a battle scene, a confusion of rearing horses and spears. The women\u2019s side, where Jemma stood, depicted women bent over spindles, listening to a harp player.</p><p>Jemma smiled at him and took off her pelisse, dropping it on a bench. Underneath, she was wearing a much simpler garment than usual, one that laced in front. She began unlacing it as Elijah tried to pull himself together.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\u2014We\u2019re bathing.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head, raising one finger. \u201cSeparately. As befits a holy place.\u201d</p><p>He looked around. \u201cHoly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDedicated to Apollo. The Roman god of medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you know of this place, Jemma?\u201d He was astounded. He wouldn\u2019t in a million years have pictured his sophisticated, urbane wife frequenting a run-down ruin of a bath house. Under the water, brilliantly colored tiles glinted like fish scales sliding against each other. The spring air was just cold enough that steam drifted between them occasionally, like a transparent curtain.</p><p>\u201cHow is it heated? When did you first come here? Who was that man? And\u2014where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s down below, tending the fires,\u201d she said.</p><p>And the questions failed in his throat because she had finished unlacing and, with a simple gesture, slipped off her gown. She was wearing neither a corset nor panniers. Her petticoats must have been part of her gown, because now she wore only a chemise, and Elijah could see the lines of her hips, round and lush, the slender curve of her waist, the beguiling weight of her breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJemma,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She raised her arms and began pulling pins from her hair. It fell around her shoulders and below, the shining sleek color of old gold. She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen in his life. She would have made Apollo cry with desire.</p><p>Lust slammed into him along with an urgent, male, possessive claim. She was his, damn it. She was his wife, and he hadn\u2019t had her, hadn\u2019t been with her, hadn\u2019t taken her\u2014</p><p>He tossed off his wig. He wrenched off his coat and threw it on the bench behind him, pulling his shirt over his head\u2014</p> <p>Caught sight of her fascinated eyes through his lifted arms. He stayed there for a moment, arms crossed over his head, one hand holding his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI truly have to stay on my side of the baths?\u201d he asked. Elijah looked down at himself. Taking vigorous exercise at the boxing salon made him feel better after long nights of useless talk. So he supposed that his chest was more muscled than those of many gentlemen.</p><p>And...it seemed she liked that. Jemma\u2019s mouth was a perfect ruby circle. He bent over, slowly, and pulled off his boots.</p><p>\u201cI should take everything off?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. Damn, but he was enjoying this. \u201cEverything,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at herself as if she\u2019d forgotten that her body existed. \u201cI thought I\u2019d wear my chemise,\u201d she said, and then looked at him again.</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose I could wear my breeches.\u201d</p><p>He unbuttoned the top button of his waistband, watched her eyes. There were some wonderful things about having been married so long. One was that neither of them was a virgin.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed!\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>He unbuttoned another button, lazily. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She sketched a shape in the air. \u201cI know the shape of your body. I know you, Elijah. I could\u2014for years I could feel the shape of your shoulder, and your hip, in my fingertips.</p><p>His desire cooled for a moment, iced by regret. \u201cGod, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she overrode him. \u201cBut now you\u2019re so much\u2014so much larger. Your shoulders...your height. You must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stab of guilt in his heart was gone and he was laughing, laughing at the surprise in her voice, at the potent thread of desire in her eyes, at the way she was staring at him.</p><p>He undid the fourth and last button. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious about the rest of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may undress,\u201d she said regally. A wave of steam rose from the pool and turned her into a nymph, glimmering in her white chemise.</p> <p>He waited until the air was clear, until she could see every movement of his hands. Then he pulled off his stockings and turned his back.</p><p>She made a little muffled sound, and he turned around again, hands still on his breeches. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She was laughing too, but the laughter rode on a wrenching wave of desire. He turned his back again. \u201cYes! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>This time he turned with his pantaloons wrenched down just a bit. He knew the front was tented. And he knew that when it came to male equipment, his was larger than most.</p><p>\u201cHow long were we together, all those years ago?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She dragged her gaze from his front. \u201cTwo weeks? Three?\u201d One shoulder rose.</p><p>\u201cI think it was more. A month, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s one part of your body that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, one corner of her mouth quirking up in a wicked smile.</p><p>But he felt as if he had. As if the very sight of her turned him mad with lust. And he\u2019d never been mad with lust. Not for his young wife whom he hardly knew. Not for Sarah Cobbett, his unimaginative, if reliable, mistress.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop now,\u201d Jemma called, and there was something in that throaty call that shook loose a different Elijah than the man he knew.</p><p>He let his eyes range over her, linger on her breasts. Then he hitched down his pantaloons again, pulling his smalls with them. He knew she was watching, so he put his hand down his front and gave himself a slow caress.</p><p>He heard a gasp of laughter from the other side of the pool and met the eyes of his wife, felt that roaring, purring rage of lust through his body again. He had waited a long time to feel that, and perhaps its strength was ten times greater for the wait. He kicked off his pantaloons and stood there, letting her see what his side of the marriage brought her. Wondering, if the truth be told, about those famed affaires she had had while living in Paris. Two, he had heard, or perhaps three.</p><p>He thought, at the time, that it was her revenge, and her right. He had destroyed her dignity and her faith. She had the right to do the same. But she\u2019d chosen puny fellows to have affaires with, men who would never challenge her on any front.</p><p>Jemma pulled her gaze away without saying anything and began testing the water with her foot, one slender toe poking into the warm water.</p><p>\u201cNot in your chemise, I would hope?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t listen, of course. Jemma was unlikely ever to listen if the advice went against what she wanted to do. He waited while she walked down the steps into the bath, enjoying the curve of her hips, the pink glow of her skin, the way he could dimly see cloth clinging to her legs as she went deeper.</p><p>To his disappointment, she sat down on a middle step, the water swirling around her waist. The tips of her hair, thrown back over her shoulders, trailed in the water.</p><p>He moved down his flight of stairs. The water was as warm as a baby\u2019s bath. It was unfortunate that in his state of lust even the gentle lap of the water drove him into more of a fever.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She was leaning back against the steps now. Her white shift was turning transparent as the wavelets touched it. He could see her long slender legs sprawled on the steps, slightly askew. It was enough to make his blood pound in his chest.</p><p>Now the water was lapping at her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSo I stay on my side of the pool, and you stay on yours,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I came here to know you better.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, and the look in them should have been outlawed, just for the better good of all mankind. \u201cWe can talk,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He felt drugged, as if the air was disappearing from the pool.</p><p>\u201cTeach me something about yourself,\u201d she said. Her voice was soft but her gaze scorched him, lingering, admiring.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said. But his hand moved toward himself.</p><p>Fascinated, she lost her position for a moment and slid deeper into the water, just enough so her breasts were submerged. She pulled herself out, but the cloth had turned transparent, painted onto her body.</p><p>Elijah didn\u2019t want to be touching himself. He wanted to be touching her. He couldn\u2019t stop looking under the water, at the shadow between her long graceful legs. His hands slid down his body.</p><p>\u201cCan we come back here whenever we please?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She seemed so fascinated by his hands that it took her a moment to respond. Then she lifted her eyes to his, and he nearly grinned to see that they\u2019d turned smoky. His polished, sophisticated duchess was gone, leaving a woman whose cheeks were stained rosy and her eyes dark with desire, rather than by cosmetic art. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDid you ask something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just saying that we could return in the future,\u201d he said. There was something in her dazed expression that made joy pump through his body with the same urgency as lust. It occurred to him that however those Frenchmen had wooed his duchess, they hadn\u2019t woken her to her own sensuality. He would wake her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of sending a footman over the day before to request the baths to be heated. The caretakers support themselves, you know, so they\u2019re always glad of visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did you find this place?\u201d he asked conversationally. He spread his legs, enjoying the way his muscles flexed. He was built like a bull, much to his valet\u2019s disapproval, inasmuch as it made his pantaloons strain over his thighs in an inelegant manner. Jemma didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cMy mother enjoyed the baths,\u201d she commented, rather absently.</p><p>Elijah ran a hand up the inside of his thigh. His manhood jerked, desperate to be touched, desperate for more than a touch, if the truth be told. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a maternal sort of place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUmm,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhy did your mother bring you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old custom,\u201d she said, obviously struggling to come up with the right words.</p><p>He ran his hand over his own length, threw back his head with the pleasure of it.</p><p>\u201cWhen a young girl reaches womanhood...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe comes here?\u201d Elijah\u2019s hand tightened involuntarily at the idea of Jemma as a mere wisp of a girl. Shy, slender\u2014</p><p>Jemma had never been shy. He revised that. A rebel of a girl...</p><p>She was still talking about old customs, and Apollo\u2019s baths. \u201cWhat were you like at that age?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cRomantic. I believed in fairies, and magic healing springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a magic pool?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOne finds a magic spring in the depths of a dark wood, only after toiling for miles over hills and catching one\u2019s hair on brambles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that experience talking?\u201d he said lazily.</p><p>\u201cMy nanny was a great one for fairy tales. Aren\u2019t you going to continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue what?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand toward his thighs.</p><p>His hand slid back to his shaft. \u201cWould you like to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never have,\u201d she said. \u201cSeen anything of that nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have pleasured yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he whispered, and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWithout question.\u201d</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWill you demonstrate?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She seemed to turn even pinker. \u201cNo. Not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>But he felt as decadent as a Roman god. \u201cThat old monk won\u2019t show up, will he?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe would never come near the women\u2019s baths. We\u2019ll leave without seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s hand tightened on himself. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you,\u201d he said, hearing his voice fall into a deeper register. He kept his eyes on hers and let words slip from his throat...earthy, sexy words that a respected statesman like himself would never utter. Sentences, fragments, that dropped into a little groan, about suckling her breasts, spreading her legs, where he would kiss her...what she would taste like...</p><p>She looked boneless, lying back in the warm water, staring at him. He went on, using his gift for language to describe exactly how he would spread her legs, open her for his gaze and his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut you never kissed me like that!\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Somehow he had closed his eyes, lost in the pleasure, and opened them to find that she was sitting up, eyes narrowed. He stilled his hand, though it nearly killed him to do so. \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed any woman in that fashion,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI was too young and stupid, when we were first married, and I had no inclination with Sarah. My relations with her did not include her pleasure.\u201d The sourness of that was in the back of his throat. \u201cNot that she was uncomfortable,\u201d he added.</p><p>The thought was demoralizing, and just like that, his personal weapon drooped.</p><p>Jemma stood up and moved down the remaining stairs. The water came to just the level of her breasts, so it looked as if the water was caressing them. Was she coming to him? Breaking this foolish rule?</p><p>She walked until her pink toes touched the line between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s baths. Then, suddenly, she ducked under the water and came up a drenched nymph, a denizen of the seas, sleek and beautiful.</p><p>Elijah was down his stairs in a moment, across the water so fast that he caused a minor tidal wave. He didn\u2019t have to look down to realize that his weapon had leapt back to full life again.</p><p>\u201cSurely kissing is allowed in the baths,\u201d he suggested, leaning forward.</p><p>She shook her head. Wet, she looked mysterious, her eyes dreamy. He could see the romantic girl who came to the baths with her mother, the young wife in love with her husband, though it was an arranged marriage, and one where he paid her precious little attention to boot.</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d she said, and that wicked little smile was back. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>She was within his reach. His hands itched to shape the soft weight of her breasts, take a nipple into his mouth, run a hand down her sleek back. His heart was pounding\u2014</p><p>His heart was pounding, but regularly. In tune.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have ideas that you didn\u2019t attempt when we were married,\u201d she noted.</p><p>\u201cWe are married,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. We were\u2014\u201d She waved her hands in the water, and drops fell on her breasts, like the caresses Elijah wanted to give her.</p><p>\u201cStrictly under the covers,\u201d he said resignedly. \u201cI was very young, you know. And stupid. That goes without saying. And I was also very afraid.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her.</p><p>It was killing him to stand just before such a luscious body, Jemma\u2019s body, and keep his hands at his sides. His cock strained forward, as if unable to obey the command to stand still.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone ever tell you how and where my father died?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He hated sympathy, but not from her. It warmed something cold and miserable in his heart.</p><p>\u201cHe was entertaining some ladies,\u201d she said carefully.</p><p>\u201cThe Palace of Salom\u00ea,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe managed to keep some of the details from becoming public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there were two women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe true scandal wasn\u2019t the women,\u201d he said, resigned to telling her everything.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cA man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But my father was\u2014\u201d It was difficult to force the words past his throat. \u201c\u2014he was tied to the bed. His tastes were peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me a while to realize that engaging in more than the strictest interpretation of the act didn\u2019t necessarily include a spanking.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. The sound was delicious, charming, inviting. Shocking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cBut the idea of someone spanking you, Elijah, is absurd. You\u2019re such a duke. Even now, even naked.\u201d She waved her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked down at himself. \u201cI look like a man, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s the way you stand, as if you own the ground you stand on. And the way you hold your chin. There\u2019s something powerful about you, Elijah, bred in the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething rigid, you mean.\u201d He was resigned to being his hidebound, moralistic self. It was probably too late to relax.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I won\u2019t try to tie you to the bed with my corset strings, then,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He blinked for a moment and then realized she was laughing again. At him. His hands twitched, ready to lunge at her, pull her to his side of the baths. \u201cI\u2019m absurd, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he said a moment later.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s just that...well, I always thought it might be fun to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He stared. \u201cYou want to tie me to the bed?\u201d</p><p>She was blushing.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>But there was something in her eyes, something secret and delicious, something that turned intimacies into shared pleasure between a man and a woman rather than a horrid act, fraught with disgust.</p><p>\u201cMy mother probably shouldn\u2019t have told me all those details,\u201d he said. He made little waves with his hands, for the pleasure of seeing them lap her breasts.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven? Eight?\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked appalled. \u201cShe told you the details of your father\u2019s death just when it happened? All the details?\u201d</p><p>It had never before occurred to him how damaging that had been. His mother hadn\u2019t just told him of the circumstances of his father\u2019s death; her voice had vibrated with disgust and revulsion as she detailed the women, the leather the former duke wore, the humiliating truth of it.</p> <p>Jemma apparently could see it in his face. \u201cThat was very wrong,\u201d she observed. \u201cNo matter how egregiously your father behaved, she should have protected his memory in front of his only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she couldn\u2019t control her anger.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, a contented moment in which Elijah felt as if his childish disgust and fear were being washed away in the warm water.</p><p>\u201cDid any of those Frenchmen ever tie you up?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>Just like that, her face turned pink again. \u201cOf course not! And there weren\u2019t so many. You make it sound as if I had hundreds of lovers! There were only two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d He doubted he would ever feel comfortable in that position, but he could suddenly imagine winding a soft ribbon around Jemma\u2019s wrists. Tying her to the bed so that his oh-so-sophisticated wife couldn\u2019t stop him from doing whatever he wished to her body.</p><p>She must have read his thoughts in his eye. Her hands came up to cover her breasts, as if she were suddenly protective.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, tired of the limitations she set. The next second he had her in his arms, her soft body pressed against his. In between ferocious kisses, he told her all the things he would do to her once she allowed him to join her in bed.</p> <p>With a pile of ribbons.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d he said finally, raising his head from her mouth, running his hands down her back to her round bottom. Pulling her against him roughly. \u201cIf you truly insist that we should not be intimate in this bath, then may I accompany you to Beaumont House? And may I join you in your bedchamber later this evening?\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt as if the steam were rising from her body, rather than from the water. Elijah\u2019s eyes blazed down into hers with the same steady strength as his hands, holding her close against his demanding body.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. She knew it would break her heart, but she couldn\u2019t steel herself against him any longer. If she were truthful, it was already too late...it was far too late.</p><p>He was the man she loved. The man who loved honor more than his life, and certainly more than his wife. There was nothing she could do but allow him to revel in his conquest.</p><p>But Elijah surprised her. He ran his hands up her back with an achingly soft touch, and then moved back, away from her. The water felt like ice touching her thighs, her belly, the places where his skin had caressed hers. \u201cYesterday you said no.\u201d</p><p>He was so beautiful, with his grave eyes and marked cheekbones. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s prerogative to change her mind,\u201d she said, guarding her tongue so she didn\u2019t make a fool of herself and confess to loving him more than her life.</p><p>More than he loved his own life.</p><p>His smile was more intoxicating than wine, sweeter than honey. And because, after all, he was a man, it was more than a little triumphant.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Later</p><p>\u201cLady Banistre holds a charity ball this evening,\u201d Jemma said, entering Elijah\u2019s study. She thought she knew what his response would be but...</p><p>Elijah, intent over a document on his desk, looked up absently. \u201cWhat did you say? I apologize, I\u2019m writing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it important? Shall I come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can finish it later,\u201d he said, putting blotting paper over a sheet as she sat down on the arm of his chair.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, taken aback by how quickly he covered his work. Not that she wanted to see it, but...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I must pay a quick visit to my solicitor,\u201d he said. \u201cI may not be back to the house before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>Jemma wrinkled her nose. \u201cHow tedious. Can\u2019t it wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, no. I thought we might play chess this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d he added casually.</p><p>Her mind reeled. \u201cYou wish to play the last game of our match? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her calmly, every inch the duke. \u201cI think we should put the Chess Club out of its misery, and solve the question of who is the first-rated player.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt herself growing pink, remembering their agreement. \u201cBlindfolded?\u201d</p><p>His smile caused a fever in her blood. Without saying a word, he toppled her into his lap. But there was something different about his kiss, she thought dimly, something savage and despairing, something\u2014</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she said, struggling against the strength of his arms. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just writing a difficult note,\u201d he said, kissing her eyebrow. \u201cIt has made me ill-tempered, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo our chess game begins tonight, Duchess. At eleven o\u2019clock. I will give you one hour to try to win, blindfolded or no.\u201d His teeth showed very white when he smiled. \u201cAnd then I shall win.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sniffed and turned up her nose. \u201cPride goeth before a fall, Duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will fall before me,\u201d he said, his smile a blatant challenge. \u201cBackwards.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught at the blatant masculinity of him. The two French lovers she\u2019d taken, years ago now, had both been secretive and circumspect, thrilled by the fact that the woman called the most beautiful Englishwoman in Paris had chosen them. They lavished attention on her.</p><p>They didn\u2019t command. They weren\u2019t arrogant or possessive. They were grateful.</p><p>One could say they weren\u2019t dukes, and leave it at that. But the title didn\u2019t explain things, Jemma thought. The title didn\u2019t explain Elijah, and the way he was looking at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered, saying it again, even though he\u2019d explained before. \u201cYou let me go so easily, years ago.

You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cried,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou were crying as you walked onto the ship,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI knew then that I had ruined everything, ruined our lives. But you had the right to go. It was your choice, and I had to give you that choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, wrapping her arms around his waist.</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d be no better than my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that. You could have told me you were sorry...I would have stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be to treat you as my possession. It would have been unethical.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh, caught against his chest again, listening to his heart. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you\u2019re mine,\u201d he said, growling it. His arms tightened. \u201cAnd Jemma...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t wear clothing tonight.\u201d</p><p>The smile in his eyes was pure arrogance. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I never will understand. What if I said that I wanted to play chess with Villiers tonight instead of you?\u201d</p><p>There was an instant flare deep in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t think you will ever walk away from me again.\u201d His voice was soft, low.</p><p>Jemma had supper in her room, followed by a bath. Two problems came to her mind, and both stemmed from her memories of the first weeks of their marriage. In retrospect their intimacies had been, well, dull. She might not have had many or lengthy affaires in Paris, but to her mind, one learned most about the bed from talking to other women, anyway. And she had learned a great deal.</p><p>But meanwhile Elijah had dismissed his mistress and stayed at home by himself. Would he abhor her for the knowledge she\u2019d gained? What should she do, and when should she pretend ignorance?</p><p>What if he became enraged, disgusted, thinking her nothing more than a light-skirt? She\u2019d heard many times of women kissing men intimately, for example, though she had certainly never felt the impulse herself. But it felt different when she thought of Elijah. Even thinking of him in the baths made her feel flushed all over.</p><p>She would\u2014yes, she would like to\u2014</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t. The hard-headed side of her brain, the side that had successfully negotiated the intrigues that characterized Versailles, knew it deep down. Unless she played this adroitly, Elijah would feel a prickle of discomfort, a prickle of unease.</p><p>She had been an unfaithful wife, for all he kept saying that he allowed her to leave him because she \u201chad the right.\u201d</p><p>On the very verge of a panic, she stopped herself.</p><p>She was no timid mouse, to be frightened by a man\u2019s emotions. She was Jemma. And if she\u2019d had an affaire, it was more than half the fault of Elijah and his stiff-necked moral thinking that drove her away, by showing such cold indifference. What sort of senseless man waits to visit his wife until he knows she has taken a lover?</p><p>The thought was steadying, bitter though it was.</p><p>She would simply be herself. In bed and out of bed. She was too old to claim a virginity she no longer had, and too experienced to pretend that she wasn\u2019t interested in pleasure. In fact, she had a veritable passion for it.</p><p>And if there was one thing she remembered clearly about their early couplings, it was that there hadn\u2019t been quite enough pleasure for her. It was, after all, easy enough for a man to satisfy himself, but it seemed to be harder for women.</p><p>If she pretended to some sort of naivet\u00e9, she would risk finding herself in the position of a disappointed woman: in short, without what the French called le petit mort. And that was unacceptable.</p><p>She rose from her simple meal, feeling composed. Delicious though she found Elijah\u2019s tone of command, he would simply have to learn to take instructions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll serve a small collation to His Grace tonight,\u201d she told Brigitte. \u201cHe comes to my room for chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Your Grace,\u201d Brigitte said. \u201cAll of London knows...finally the chess match will be over!\u201d</p><p>Jemma was taken aback by that. It was bad enough that the household would encourage the bedding of its master and mistress, but all of London?</p><p>\u201cBecause of the wagers,\u201d Brigitte explained, catching the look on her face. \u201cThere are so many bets placed on the match between yourself and the master. Fowle says that the entire London Chess Club is riveted to learn the outcome. There are only two women in the Chess Club, you know, yourself and Mrs. Patton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard as much,\u201d Jemma murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe majority are betting in favor of you, Your Grace,\u201d Brigitte said happily. \u201cAnd if you win the match, you will be the top-ranked player!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall win,\u201d Jemma stated. She had spent years playing herself at chess\u2014with the twist that she played Black (for sin), and Elijah played White (for virtue). Or rather, since Elijah was in England, and she in France, she imitated Elijah, playing White. She knew his style of play: he had foresight, courage, and an uncanny ability to corner an opponent and smash his\u2014or her\u2014 resistance.</p><p>\u201cHow should you like to manage the game?\u201d Brigitte asked rather tentatively. \u201cI mean, with the two of you blindfolded...how will you manage the pieces? Shall you call the moves to me and I shall make the moves you request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Jemma said absently. \u201cLuckily Elijah and I are both masters.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte looked confused.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a board,\u201d she said, smiling at her maid. \u201cWe\u2019ll play it in our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your heads?\u201d Brigitte had obviously never considered such a thing.</p><p>\u201cUnless His Grace feels he hasn\u2019t had enough practice to keep the board in his head,\u201d Jemma said, grinning.</p><p>She had no idea whether Elijah had ever played without a chessboard, but he could do it. He was one of the best players she\u2019d faced in her life, better than the French genius, Philidor, better (sometimes) than Villiers. Though to her mind, Elijah, Villiers, and herself were fairly evenly matched.</p><p>No, that was a lie.</p><p>They each had different strengths: Elijah his steady, rational forethought; Villiers his sweeping battle plans; she her moments of brilliant and beautiful play.</p><p>But they had weaknesses too. Elijah would always find himself misled into questions of virtue. It was a passion for him: to carve life into black and white, good and evil, right and wrong.</p><p>It was all in the chess game.</p><p>Even blindfolded and in bed...She had to raise the stakes.</p><p>She knew exactly how Elijah saw tonight\u2019s game: as a means to an end, the end being her body and her bed. He would try to win, but what he really wanted was the last click of the pieces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whereas chess had been her dearest companion in the years of their separation, and it would be so now. What she needed to do was turn the chess to her advantage by distracting him.</p><p>The slow smile on Jemma\u2019s lips would have given Elijah pause, had he seen it.</p><p>\u201cBrigitte,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are a few other things that I will need for the evening, if you would be so kind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Jemma was curious about one thing in particular: what would Elijah wear when he appeared at her door? On reflection, she decided he would be fully dressed. To appear in a dressing gown would lack a gentleman\u2019s discretion, given the household\u2019s focus on their chess game.</p><p>For her part, she put on an utterly delicious nightgown. It was made of delicate silk in a cream color, lined with lace and covered by a matching wrapper. It was only when she was lying down, and the neckline shifted in a certain way, that one suddenly had a glimpse of a gorgeous cherry silk lining. That was something she had learned from a circle of Frenchwomen, years ago.</p><p>\u201cSurprise him!\u201d an older woman had laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWear a sweet-natured gown, and underneath, a harlot\u2019s scarlet. Play the innocent and then the rascal.\u201d She followed that advice with a few earthy suggestions involving the male anatomy, none of which Jemma had tried...but none of which she was opposed to trying.</p><p>Her face paint was so artfully applied that only a man of Corbin\u2019s perception would have known she wore any. Her hair didn\u2019t have a speck of powder. It fell over her shoulders, gleaming like bottled sunshine.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace will be a happy man,\u201d Brigitte said, pausing before she left for the night.</p><p>Jemma looked up, surprised. \u201cThank you! Though you and I know better than he how much of my beauty comes from Signora Angelico\u2019s brilliant designs, not to mention my favorite lip rouge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Brigitte said. \u201cI mean because you\u2014you are interested in this evening, no? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma sighed inwardly. Could life become yet more embarrassing? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Brigitte smiled brilliantly. \u201cHe is lucky.\u201d</p><p>Elijah appeared precisely at ten, which Jemma thought showed a healthy level of enthusiasm for the game, as well as\u2014no doubt\u2014what would likely follow it.</p><p>He was fully dressed. Naturally.</p><p>She opened the door, well aware that the candles placed around the room cast an extremely flattering light on her skin.</p><p>Being Elijah, his eyes didn\u2019t drop from her face. Instead he strolled into her room as if they were in the drawing room. He looked at the delicate little table set up by her bed, the delicious morsels Mrs. Tulip had sent up, the carefully draped scarves she\u2019d chosen to serve as blindfolds.</p><p>To her utter surprise, he started laughing. \u201cI feel as if I just happened into one of the great courtesan\u2019s apartments.\u201d</p><p>Jemma bit her lip, and then smiled swiftly. \u201cShould I demand a payment before, or trust on your gentleman\u2019s honor to provide payment after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, before,\u201d he said gravely, walking toward her. There was something in his eyes that cured the hiccup in her heart, the pulse of shame she felt at his first comment.</p> <p>\u201cMay I kiss you?\u201d His question was so simple, and so\u2014so Elijah.</p><p>She swallowed hard and said, \u201cOnly if I might return the favor.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head then, and gave her the kind of kiss that no man gives a courtesan. Or a mistress. Or anyone who is paid for the most intimate of pleasures. It was a kiss that started with a brush of the lips and a silent question.</p><p>A courtesan couldn\u2019t have answered, because she wouldn\u2019t have been able to read all the hundreds of ways that the question came to Jemma: through the touch of his hands on her shoulders, through the controlled stillness of his mouth, through the very tilt of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, telling him silently as well, brushing his bottom lip with hers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and looked in her eyes and then just folded her into his arms. It was as if they could try their wedding night all over again.</p><p>That first time, they hardly knew each other. She was terribly infatuated with him; he seemed barely to have registered her first name.</p><p>It was all different this time.</p><p>He let her go without another word. She took his hand and asked, \u201cWill you blindfold yourself...or would you like me to do it?\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAnd Elijah, if this reminds you too much of your father\u2019s predilections, we could simply skip the blindfold. It was a silly idea anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, and the grin on his face had nothing to do with the sorry fate of his father. He picked up a swath of pink silk that she had chosen for its exquisite match to her gown. \u201cI\u2019ll just put this on, shall I?\u201d</p><p>A moment later it was tight around his eyes and she was laughing helplessly, watching as he bumped into the end of the bed and stretched his arms out, trying to catch her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he accused her of unfairness that she picked up the unadorned white scarf she\u2019d chosen for him. He had caught her by then and was laughingly trying to pull her toward the bed.</p><p>The world disappeared once she tied the scarf around her head. \u201cGoodness,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Elijah\u2019s lazy, happy voice came from somewhere to her right.</p><p>\u201cAre you on the bed?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Lying here imagining you stumbling about the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWretch!\u201d she scolded, turning and walking toward his voice, hands outstretched. She bumped into the bed and fell forward.</p><p>Strong arms scooped her up and placed her next to him. \u201cI should have taken off my boots,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cWould it be cheating to start over? I\u2019m not sure I can manage that with the blindfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, wiggling about until she was fairly sure she wouldn\u2019t fall off the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot something too.\u201d There was a thump that sounded like a boot hitting the ground.</p><p>\u201cNot the Champagne,\u201d she said. She knew exactly where she was\u2014on the left side of her bed at the head\u2014and that meant the little table with the glasses of Champagne was just at her hand. Which it was. She just managed to touch a stem with her fingertips and then wrap her hand around it.</p><p>She realized that she could even sip Champagne.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot the chessboard,\u201d he said, amusement dark in his voice. \u201cDear me, we\u2019ll just have to think of something else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a chessboard! Are you\u2014\u201d She put out an arm. \u201cAre you returning to the bed?\u201d</p><p>The mattress sagged a bit, answering her question. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall give you a glass of Champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always move to my bed after this one is drenched,\u201d Elijah said cheerfully.</p><p>She managed to put her own glass back on the table and pick up his. Their hands bumped, but the glass was saved.</p><p>\u201cI shall drink the whole glass right now,\u201d he said in her ear. \u201cOtherwise I can\u2019t answer for its safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to see you as tipsy as the marquise,\u201d she said, trying to find her glass again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just\u2014\u201d There was a tinkle, then the sound of shattering crystal. \u201cI was just trying to find my glass,\u201d she said sadly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe bottle is still there. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He reached over her and apparently managed to grab the bottle. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just have to serve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And just how do you plan to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Suddenly she felt a warm, large hand on her hair, running like the softest caress she could imagine over her forehead. One finger paused on her nose, and was replaced by a kiss.</p><p>Another finger traced her lips, and a kiss followed.</p> <p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnywhere my hand can go, I can find with my lips. The possibilities are...limitless.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help giggling, but the truth was that being blindfolded made her feel uncertain. She had never, ever, made love without constantly checking the effect of her body on her partner\u2014whether it was Elijah, all those years ago, or her two French lovers.</p><p>In fact, her pleasure came more than a little from that, from the sense of control and power she got as a man eyed her breasts. As she adjusted her legs, just a little, and he let out a muffled groan. As she watched a man\u2019s eyes darken with lust so he looked as if he were in pain.</p><p>But now...</p><p>Blindfolded, she felt vulnerable, as if all her skills, her power, her attraction, were gone, along with her sight.</p> <p>\u201cI feel strange like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMaybe we should stop, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were on her lips, followed by the cold smooth edge of the Champagne bottle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink from bottles!\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cTonight you do.\u201d His voice was a purring command that made her feel even more vulnerable.</p><p>She drank. It gave her the oddest sensation, as if her senses narrowed to the icy, sparkling feel of the wine in her throat. Elijah wasn\u2019t touching her, but she could sense him there, his breath stirring her hair, his body just next to hers. He smelled delicious, like spice and soap and clean male.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d she said, trying to regain her sense of control.</p> <p>She heard a clink as he put the bottle down. \u201cNow let me see if I understand the parameters of the game. We\u2019re going to lie here, next to each other\u2014after all, the rules demand that we stay in bed\u2014and imagine the chessboard in our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never played chess without a board,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou might lose,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nuzzled her ear and she jumped. \u201cOr...you might lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, that\u2019s true as well.\u201d Suddenly she felt just the brush of his tongue. \u201cElijah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel as if we\u2019ll be lying next to each other, like those medieval tombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was distracting her, playing with her ear. His thumb was tracing circles on her throat.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, the tombs where Lady Whatsit and her husband lie next to each other in marble effigy, staring straight up. I think they usually have their hands arranged in prayer. Is that what we\u2019re to do...at least until the game is over?\u201d His voice dropped at the end of the sentence.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jemma said, trying to pull herself together. But she felt entirely unbalanced. She was stretched out on the bed, so it wasn\u2019t as if she could fall off. Elijah was playing with her, as if she were one of the treats arranged next to the bed, but she felt immobilized by her sightlessness.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this bother you?\u201d she said, turning her head toward him even though she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She could tell from his voice that he felt perfectly normal. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone,\u201d she said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d There was a thread of laughter in his voice that made her cross.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not enjoying this,\u201d she said, reaching up to take off the scarf.</p><p>But he knew, somehow. He suddenly rolled on top of her, and a large hand trapped her hands over her head. \u201cYou\u2019re changing the rules,\u201d he whispered, running his lips over hers.</p><p>His body was hard. The silk of her nightdress might not even have been there: she could feel every button on his pantaloons, the weight of his thigh muscles, the bulge of his private parts.</p><p>The horrible, unbalanced uncertainty of being unable to see transformed into something else, something unbearably erotic. His hands were over their heads, holding hers. She should have felt even more powerless...but it was the opposite.</p><p>Slowly she stretched up against him, rubbing like a purring cat. She didn\u2019t hear his low groan so much as feel it, with every fiber of her being. \u201cThis is better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo: you\u2019re White, and White moves first.\u201d She raised her hips slightly.</p><p>\u201cWe need some rules.\u201d His voice had darkened, deepened.</p><p>\u201cI thought the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time a player loses a piece, he or she gets a boon, a request. She can ask for whatever she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what you\u2019re doing now a boon?\u201d His voice was a low rumble; she was finding that rubbing against him made her feel happy.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she said demurely, subsiding flat on the bed again.</p><p>\u201cEvery piece? That could be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Or as few as five. It depends on how well you play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on how well I can keep the board in my head, you vixen,\u201d he said, nipping her lower lip.</p><p>She gurgled with laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that I think of it,\u201d he growled, \u201cyour play is marked by rushing all over the board and knocking my pieces off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I also frequently win through wild sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>He had kept still, so far, just allowing her to rub against him like a friendly cat. Now he pressed against her, just enough so she felt the strength of him. Her body instinctively sought his urgency, her legs cradling him.</p><p>Her mouth opened with the shock of it, and his lips covered hers.</p><p>Their kiss was devouring, fierce, indulgent, slow. He released his hold on her hands, and she wound her arms around his neck.</p><p>Slowly, Jemma realized that the best kisses are always blind. She tasted Elijah, let him explore her mouth, make his mark. She could feel what he was doing...she could feel what was happening.</p><p>Her gentlemanly husband had disappeared. The man on top of her was no gentleman. He wasn\u2019t her Elijah, her safe, ethical husband. He seemed to her like a highwayman, an outlaw, come to savage an innocent maiden, the kind of man who thrusts his tongue into a lady\u2019s mouth and then comes back for more.</p><p>The kind of man who suddenly pulls away, without a word. She felt him rise to his knees, and then a breeze as his coat flew to the side. She lay still, wildly excited, imagining Elijah as she\u2019d seen him in the Roman baths.</p><p>His shirt followed. \u201cTouch me,\u201d came a growl at her ear.</p><p>Jemma grinned. She deliberately clasped her hands behind her head. \u201cDid you win a boon?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause to the best of my belief, White goes first and you have yet to make a move.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and bit off something that sounded like an oath, except that Elijah never swore. \u201cPawn to King\u2019s Four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d she said. \u201cPawn to King\u2019s Four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said. His breathing sounded ragged. \u201cI need to concentrate. I can\u2019t think.\u201d He was still braced above her, his strong knees brushing her body on either side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut you\u2019re not afraid of the blindfold anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He moved away. \u201cI\u2019m sitting up against the headboard,\u201d he said a moment later. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join me?\u201d</p> <p>Jemma sat up cautiously. Now that he wasn\u2019t touching her, a sense of inadequacy and vulnerability flooded back. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d There must have been something tremulous in her voice, because his arms wound around her a moment later and he hauled her into his lap.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d he said. \u201cHolding you.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, she felt fine again. \u201cYour move,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d He felt around and came up with the bottle. His fingers touched her lips and then the lip of the bottle followed. \u201cDrink,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She let the Champagne cool her throat. He pulled the bottle away and drops ran down her face and neck.</p> <p>His fingers were there, feeling the cool drops, and a moment later his tongue followed. \u201cElijah,\u201d she breathed. He lapped the drops of wine from her throat, and a shiver went through her whole body, clenching her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour move,\u201d she repeated, shaking the feeling away.</p><p>\u201cPawn to Queen\u2019s Four,\u201d he said.</p><p>She answered instantly. \u201cPawn takes Pawn.\u201d</p><p>He gave a groan, but there was laughter in it. \u201cDo I have to give you a boon, or do you give me a boon? I forget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lost a piece, so you have a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow detailed may I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery detailed,\u201d she said, mentally lining up her next four moves. She planned to sacrifice three pieces in a row. And she planned to be very detailed in her requests, and she\u2019d be tremendously surprised if Elijah managed to keep track of the game after that.</p><p>\u201cI would like you to touch me. Touch my chest.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her smile all over her body. \u201cI would be happy to do that. Why don\u2019t you lie down?\u201d Since she had been in his lap, she ended up lying on top of him when he pushed himself flat.</p><p>She spread her hands over his chest, feeling the warmth of his skin under her fingers. His chest was wonderful, all hard muscles and textures that were entirely different from her own. But it wasn\u2019t enough to touch him with her fingertips; her breasts felt full and heavy. She leaned down, her lips grazing his face. The delicate silk of her nightgown slid over his body like water. He didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this kind of touch?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His answer was gasp and a prayer. \u201cYes.\u201d His hands were running through her hair, skimming over the blindfold, and everything she couldn\u2019t see on his face and couldn\u2019t hear in his voice, she knew from the tension in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d she murmured throatily, coming back to a sitting position. His hands fell to her hips and tightened there. It was odd and wonderful to be unable to see. She found his nipples, brushed them gently and then dealt them a rougher caress with her thumb. Still he said nothing, though she felt a tremor quake through his body.</p><p>\u201cQueen takes Pawn,\u201d he said. His voice sounded far too controlled for her liking.</p><p>Carefully she rolled off his body, a little afraid she would fall off the bed and end up ignominiously sprawled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYour request, milady?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am at your command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nightgown,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you take it off?\u201d</p><p>There was no fumbling from him. She lifted her arms over her head, expecting the whisper of silk, but instead strong hands clenched at her neckline. With one fierce ripping sound, she suddenly felt the kiss of air on her skin. He pulled the cloth away from her, without a touch. Still, she could feel him towering beside her.</p><p>\u201cKnight to Queen\u2019s Bishop\u2019s Three,\u201d she said, her voice a hungry whisper.</p><p>\u201cQueen to Queen\u2019s Rook\u2019s Four.\u201d</p><p>Jemma pulled herself together, quelling the hunger for his touch. \u201cKnight to Bishop\u2019s Three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnight to King\u2019s Bishop\u2019s Three.\u201d</p><p>How could Elijah\u2019s voice sound so untouched, so steady? \u201cBishop to Bishop\u2019s Four,\u201d she continued, pushing her voice above a whisper. The chess game in her head grew more complicated. Elijah was playing defensively, but brilliantly. She attacked, preparing to safeguard her king by castling. Elijah responded, attacking one of her knights. The dance of chess pieces became ever more intricate as they moved about the board.</p><p>\u201cPawn takes Pawn,\u201d he said some moments later.</p><p>\u201cMilady?\u201d</p><p>She felt a little dizzy. \u201cI have a two-part request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s legal,\u201d Elijah said. His voice was husky and dark, and ran like brandy through her blood. He didn\u2019t sound like Pitt\u2019s opposition in the Lords, like the bright young hope who would save the English nation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to\u2014to touch my breasts, just as I did your chest.\u201d She\u2019d never said such a thing out loud, and she had to steady her voice. \u201cIf you would be so kind. And I want you to tell me what it feels like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you how it feels for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she said, sliding flat and stretching her arms above her head to the wooden headboard.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you feel, since you can\u2019t see my breasts. I loved what you told me in the baths.\u201d</p><p>She felt maddened with desire, waiting for the touch of his hands. When finally\u2014finally!\u2014she felt strong hands cup both breasts, she let out an involuntary moan. And when he started moving his thumbs, she found herself shaking, her breath coming fast.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most beautiful breasts in the world,\u201d he said, and the guttural sound of his voice told her everything she needed to know. He was being a little rough now, and she couldn\u2019t help twisting up against his touch. \u201cI can\u2019t feel well enough with my hands to describe you, so...\u201d</p><p>His lips set trails of fire across her body. He spoke the whole time, talking of sweet curves and cherry something, but she wasn\u2019t listening. Without her eyesight, her body seemed to have taken over. She couldn\u2019t stop moving, twisting under his hands and his mouth, begging silently.</p><p>It was hard, surprisingly hard, to remember the chessboard. But she did, and they played on, until:</p><p>\u201cBishop takes Knight,\u201d Elijah said, his voice dark and sweet.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she said with a gasp, breaking free. She found his head with her hands and pulled him down to her lips. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s kisses were like words. This kiss was a rough caress, a controlled warning from the pirate king to the maiden. Tremors of fire crept down to Jemma\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cQueen takes Bishop,\u201d she said, shocked to hear the hunger in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a kiss like this,\u201d he whispered, and he thrust his hardness against the cradle of her legs. Their kiss was like a fire in the blood. Jemma found herself instinctively arching against him.</p><p>\u201cPawn to Queen\u2019s Rook\u2019s Three,\u201d Elijah murmured.</p><p>Then she tried to remember what move should come next. She knew it all...she knew the next move. But just when she almost remembered, Elijah ran a hand down her body and her mind went blank. Was it a pawn she meant to move? To take his bishop, perhaps? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stretched toward the table, and his body shifted deliciously against her. She was thinking about that, and trying to ignore the urgent signals her body was sending, when she suddenly gave a little scream. Elijah must have drunk from the Champagne bottle because cold lips slid across her throat.</p><p>Her skin felt as if it were burning. \u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, turning her head toward him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your turn to ask for a kiss,\u201d he said, laughter running through his voice. \u201cNot even if you beg, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never beg!\u201d Jemma said, instantly remembering the move she planned. \u201cKnight takes Bishop. Your boon.\u201d</p> <p>A cold tongue ran shockingly up her throat.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips trailed fire and ice across her cheek and hovered at the corner of her mouth. She opened her mouth, but his lips evaded hers. \u201cI\u2019ll have you begging,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, more than a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRook takes Knight,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>The very sound of his voice turned Jemma\u2019s legs to sweet fire. She tried to think of the next move, the one that was going to smash his game and win her the top spot in the Chess Club. He was braced over her, nuzzling her chin. He smelled wonderful, like clean male. His lips were tracing patterns on her cheeks.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think. The only thing she wanted to do was tear off the blindfold and run her hands into his hair. Kiss him again, and again.</p><p>\u201cYour move!\u201d he commanded. She didn\u2019t answer, and she felt his ripple of laughter as clearly in her body as in his.</p><p>Jemma suddenly realized something that she should have known all along.</p><p>There are times where winning at chess doesn\u2019t matter. She loved Elijah. She loved him with all her heart\u2014and that meant that she wanted him to win. Or rather, she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t have to win every game of chess.</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d she said huskily, and gave him a free kiss, one that had nothing to do with boons or chess pieces.</p> <p>\u201cYou win,\u201d she repeated. Then she reached up deliberately and pulled off her blindfold.</p><p>Only to meet Elijah\u2019s dark, smiling eyes.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not blindfolded!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI cheated.\u201d He rolled off her body and sat up.</p><p>Jemma pulled herself to a seated position as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014You cheated?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe it. Not only had Elijah the Perfect Paragon cheated by untying his blindfold, but he didn\u2019t seem in the least repentant.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you remove your scarf? Wait! I\u2019ve been running my fingers through your hair! I should have known\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He was laughing outright. \u201cYou must have been distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to win.\u201d He leaned forward to brush his lips across hers. \u201cI took my blindfold off the moment we began the game. I didn\u2019t want to miss even a moment of watching you.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cYou should have told me!\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes was tender and rough at the same time. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI never really saw you when we made love before. You were always under the blankets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to lie very quietly and pretend to be asleep while you dressed. Remember? We would sleep in the master chamber then.\u201d</p><p>He glanced indifferently at the walls of her chamber. \u201cNo difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is that you\u2019ve come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to you anywhere,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cJust come, and I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d she said, giggling.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t laugh with her. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you coming, all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was torn between the delicious feeling in her body and a small tingle of embarrassment. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, will you tell exactly what you like?\u201d</p><p>She felt a blush starting. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to tell me that the reputation of Frenchmen is exaggerated?\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing to admit. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d She might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. \u201cI never\u2014I didn\u2019t stay long enough\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched and she realized he was laughing. Laughing! \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you something important!\u201d she protested, giving him a little push.</p><p>\u201cI should have known it. I was in England, suffering the tortures of the damned because I was so convinced you had discovered far better lovers than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drop them because our intimacies were unsatisfactory,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cIt was because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always felt that I was betraying you. I would decide, in the most cold-blooded way, to have an affaire, but it never seemed to work. They were so tedious, and the bedding wasn\u2019t terribly interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were fools, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there something you learned from your mistress that you would like me to try?\u201d she said, clearing her throat.</p><p>His eyes were serious now. \u201cThere are things I\u2019d like to try, but none of them came from poor Sarah. I think perhaps we need to talk about her, since we keep circling the subject.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, but she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cA mistress appears with her private parts oiled, Jemma. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She could feel her eyes widening. \u201cSo that a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Before we were married, I did try to give her some pleasure. I would touch her breasts. She was a good woman, and I was fond of her. But after I married you, I lost all enjoyment in it. I used to simply take her. With few words, and with all possible speed.\u201d</p><p>Jemma bit her lip. Her body felt suddenly cold. \u201cWe both made some terrible mistakes. I should have fought for you. Instead I simply ran away.\u201d</p><p>They stayed silent a moment. \u201cWould you like to just\u2014sleep tonight?\u201d he asked, finally. \u201cThis has undoubtedly made you feel rather ill.\u201d His eyes were black with self-recrimination, somber.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to sit there and feel bad about a woman who was paid a fortune to make love to a man who had one of the most beautiful bodies in England,\u201d Jemma asked, \u201cor are you going to make love to your wife?\u201d</p><p>His mouth softened, but still he just looked at her, as if there were something more she had to say.</p><p>So she slid down onto her back and said, \u201cOf course, we still need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell what I learned in France.\u201d Elijah frowned, and she added hastily, \u201cNot from my two lovers. I\u2019m afraid those encounters were less than inspiring, which was undoubtedly my fault since I was both cold and apathetic.\u201d</p><p>His eyes definitely looked less somber now.</p><p>\u201cI learned a great deal from Frenchwomen,\u201d she said dreamily, running a hand down over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear every word,\u201d Elijah said, leaning over her, but not touching her.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that women love to be kissed, here?\u201d Jemma asked, running a finger straight down her belly and below.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard as much. And I would love to experiment.\u201d The throaty pleasure in his voice was entirely genuine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd did you know that some men enjoy a woman\u2019s kiss\u2014\u201d She let her eyes drift down to the relevant spot.</p><p>\u201c\u2014almost as much as they enjoy other acts? And that sometimes a woman\u2019s pleasure is increased if her lover strokes her at the right moment?\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked wild, like those of a man at the very limit of his self-control. \u201cJemma, are you done talking now?\u201d</p><p>Without pausing to give her answer, she turned over on her stomach, came up on her knees, and turned her head to look at him over her shoulder. \u201cI just wanted to say that an old Frenchwoman told me that this was the best position in which to conceive a child.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah made a hoarse, strangled sound in his throat and flipped her back over. Then he was looming over her, on his knees, looking into her face. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The words seemed to fall into the room like a blessing, like cool rain in summer. His throat worked and then he said, \u201cAh, God, Jemma, do you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than life,\u201d she said simply. \u201cElijah?\u201d</p><p>He was staring down at her as if she were made of pure gold. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you mind very much if we made love now? Because I think that I\u2019m about to go out of my mind.\u201d Her whole body was prickling and tremors kept running through her legs.</p><p>A corner of his mouth quirked up, and a hand settled on her breast.</p><p>It felt so good that she twisted under him, gasping, and finally managed to say, \u201cI need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d His lips replaced his hand, but it wasn\u2019t enough. They had been playing for hours, and she was mad for him.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d Her voice sounded childish to her ears, so she wound her hand hard into his hair and pulled his mouth to hers. She said it into the sweetness of his kiss, \u201cI need you now.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Beaumont was a man whom many in the English government had come to trust. If you told him there was a desperate need for something, no matter how difficult or impossible, he would do his best to satisfy you.</p> <p>Without saying a word, Elijah reared above her and a thumb stroked down her most delicate part.</p><p>Jemma twisted under him, crying out. His voice was as deep as the devil\u2019s itself, without a trace of the controlled statesman about it. \u201cYou are exquisite.\u201d His hand caressed her so that she arched again.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she whispered, and then lost track of what she was saying because his lips followed his hand. His tongue sent wild sensations rocketing through her body. She closed her eyes as if the blindfold were there again. Elijah was ruthless, controlling her desire, driving her higher and higher, closer and closer.</p><p>Finally, finally, he pulled back, pushing her legs even farther apart. \u201cOpen your eyes, Jemma,\u201d he growled. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She could no more disobey him than she could fly to the moon. \u201cPlease,\u201d she finally gasped. \u201cElijah!\u201d</p><p>She was small, and he was large, yet he stroked into her as if they had made love every night for years. It felt as if he were coming home, as if no time had passed. A dark pleasure burned down her legs, making her cry out.</p><p>The passion that gripped her had nothing in common with what she remembered of the awkward couplings of their early marriage. She had been unsure and embarrassed, those days, biting her lip to keep silent so he wouldn\u2019t be disgusted. Now she could no sooner control the moans flying from her lips than she could leap from the bed.</p><p>Yet still their rhythm didn\u2019t seem entirely right. He would thrust, and then she would arch up at the wrong moment. They bounced off each other rather than moving in unison.</p> <p>Elijah stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma gasped. There was a lovely, building heat in her legs, more intense than she\u2019d ever experienced, and she was desperate to chase the sensation. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t stop!\u201d She shuddered and arched against him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leading, Jemma,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked up at him.</p><p>He deftly pulled her arms over her head and imprisoned them with one hand. \u201cLet me,\u201d he said through his teeth.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t understand, even when he stroked forward again. It was so lovely that the heat seethed in her legs and she cried out.</p><p>Elijah stroked forward again, long and deep.</p><p>It was so intoxicating that she twisted up against him any way she could. She couldn\u2019t stay still.</p><p>He made a noise that was somewhere between a groan and a laugh and dropped her hands, pulling her hips up so her legs wrapped around him and she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d she cried, shocked by the vulnerability of her position. But he wasn\u2019t listening, just moving, and suddenly she got it, and pushed back against him at just the right moment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, between his teeth, his eyes intent, fierce. He kept moving that way, hard and deep, and she arched toward him frantically, at the right moment. The fire in her legs was spreading and making her seethe and tremble.</p><p>Elijah was looking down at her the whole time. The look in his eyes, the raw possession, made the feelings in her body spiral tighter and tighter.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d he said, deep and hard as his body, and she wrapped her arms around him and broke the way thunder cracks in the sky, into a before and after, into the Jemma-who-had-never and the new Jemma.</p><p>He came with her, into the fury and the heat of it, and the only thing she heard was one word, and it wasn\u2019t love, but mine, and that was good enough.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>April 1</p><p>Morning</p><p>Villiers looked with some distaste at the page delivered from Templeton\u2019s office. It contained a neat list of eight names and eight addresses. Why eight, one might ask? He, of all people, knew that he had six children. Or rather, to be precise, he had five children and was paying for six.</p><p>Yet the list explained nothing. There was an ominous feeling to it, as if Templeton, his little rat of a solicitor, had disappeared into a hole from which he wouldn\u2019t be re-emerging. And if that were the case, Templeton had likely taken a good amount of ducal coin with him.</p><p>Either the list implied that he now had eight children, which explanation he rejected, or two children were unaccounted for in a welter of addresses.</p><p>He sighed and summoned his coach.</p><p>The first address was a house in a respectable area of Stepney. He considered instructing a footman to knock on the door and simply fetch the child, but thought better of it. This was the place where lived\u2014the very thought made him clammy and slightly nauseated\u2014his firstborn son.</p><p>The woman who answered the door was pious, by the look of her. But there was a hint of spice in her eye. Villiers deduced that she had settled for piety when she couldn\u2019t find something more lively.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the Duke of Villiers. Are you Mrs. Jobber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She was clearly nonplussed by the appearance of a duke. Though of course Villiers did not fool himself that there were any in the kingdom who looked more ducal than he. This morning, he was wearing pale rose velvet and could have graced the king\u2019s court with ease.</p><p>Instead he was standing before a battered-looking little house. The irony was not lost on him. One might wear all the velvet in the world and still discover that one\u2019s children were living in a small house in Stepney. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come for my son,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>A flash of pain crossed Mrs. Jobber\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re taking him?\u201d</p><p>Of course she would have come to feel affection for the lad. Of course she would. It was what any reasonable parent would prefer. \u201cIf you would be so kind,\u201d he said, bowing.</p><p>She stepped back, holding the door open, so Villiers left his footmen outside and followed her into the shadowy house. It smelled like flour and apples. \u201cHe\u2019s just down for a nap,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cA nap?\u201d By Villiers\u2019s estimation, this child had to be twelve years old. He hadn\u2019t napped at that age. Well, as far as he remembered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to be quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all sleep together, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you take in many children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve five at the moment, four girls and he. He\u2019s a sweet one.\u201d She stopped and turned, her arms crossed over her bosom. \u201cDid someone tell you aught about the way I\u2019m raising these children? Because it\u2019s a lie. I never take more than five, and they have their own beds. They go to church of a Sunday, and wear a clean pinafore every other day. There\u2019s no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. But she seemed to be owed an explanation, though it irked him to do so. \u201cI have decided to rear my son in my own house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn your house?\u201d</p><p>He allowed a flash of annoyance to cross his face, and then stated, \u201cI shall rear my baseborn children under my own roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness me,\u201d she said, looking not the least afraid. \u201cThat does make me feel better about letting him go. I\u2019ve come to love him.\u201d She opened a door to a sitting room full of rather faded but clean furniture.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll wait here, I\u2019ll tiptoe in and bring him out. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll be a mite crotchety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am frequently crotchety,\u201d Villiers observed, sitting down. \u201cThe boy wouldn\u2019t be my son without the trait.\u201d</p><p>The boy was not his son.</p> <p>This child was as plump as a sofa, if sofas came in baby sizes. His eyes were like little dark currants peering out from all that fat. Villiers felt an instant dislike for him.</p><p>The baby apparently felt the same, given his bellows.</p><p>Villiers came to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been some mistake,\u201d he said to the woman, who was energetically patting the fat piglet and whispering things to it. \u201cMy son is twelve years old, and his name is Tobias.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a name he would have chosen, but it wasn\u2019t terrible.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He raised his voice over the child\u2019s blubbering.</p><p>\u201cMy son is nine years old. Perhaps even ten,\u201d he added, being rather uncertain about that matter himself.</p><p>She plumped into a chair, staring at him as if he\u2019d shocked her to the bone. \u201cYou\u2019re Juby\u2019s da. You\u2019re Juby\u2019s da? I never knew more than that he was a gentleman. Templeton promised that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duke is a gentleman,\u201d Villiers informed her, resisting the temptation to take out the sheet of foolscap in his pocket and consult it. \u201cAnd my son\u2019s name is definitely not Juby. It\u2019s Tobias.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all called him Juby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d That was regrettable. It sounded like the name one might give to a racehorse who would almost win the Derby, but not quite. \u201cCould you please call Tobias, and we shall be on our way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d the woman said, still staring. \u201cI do think I see some resemblance. He\u2019s got a way about him and you have it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would be so kind as to call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here anymore. Templeton said as how he had to go to school.\u201d Her face darkened. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you that I don\u2019t like your man Templeton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he sent the boy to school?\u201d Villiers inquired, wondering in the back of his mind why Templeton had provided this address, rather than that of the school.</p><p>\u201cHe would come here and look about the place as if he were a duke himself,\u201d she said, scowling. She\u2019d managed to get the little lump on her shoulder back to sleep. \u201cAnd he never gave the slightest bit toward a name day present or anything of that nature. Not Twelfth Night either. And then one day he ups and takes Juby off to school, without as much as a by-your-leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI placed no limitations on the child\u2019s support,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI regret that Templeton did not interpret my instructions to include appropriate gifts.\u201d He had never thought of such a thing himself. He made a mental note to have a generous amount sent to Mrs. Jobber on the morrow.</p><p>\u201cI can see from the sight of you that you didn\u2019t know of it,\u201d she said resignedly, rocking back and forth to keep the babe asleep. \u201cAt least you\u2019re here. There\u2019s many a man never even touches his child in the whole of his life, you know. The babes go from my house to an apprenticeship, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you give me the address of the school?\u201d Villiers inquired. The fat baby was drooling on her shoulder, and he felt a strong urge to leave the premises.</p><p>\u201cHe took him to Grindel\u2019s in Wapping,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have chosen it myself. Not for Juby. He\u2019s a smart one. He could be anything. You could have apprenticed him to a goldsmith, or even the rag-and-bone man, and he\u2019d be mayor of London someday. That\u2019s what we always teased him with. That he\u2019ll be mayor of London, just like Dick Whittington.\u201d</p><p>Villiers sighed inwardly. She followed him out, still talking of Juby. Just before the door he paused. \u201cHow many years had you the care of Tobias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was brought to me at just a few weeks,\u201d she said promptly, \u201cand Templeton took him from me two years ago. Horrid little thing he was as a babe, as thin as you can imagine.\u201d She lovingly caressed the plump back she held. \u201cNot like Edward here. Edward is the son of a baron, you know.\u201d She drew herself up. \u201cI take in only the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you adequately paid for your trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour guineas a month, just as I requested, and I thank you for that. Plus all doctor\u2019s expenses, though Juby wasn\u2019t one to get sick. Once I managed to get him plumped up, nothing stopped that boy.\u201d</p><p>Villiers groaned inwardly. So he was looking for a junior-sized sofa who went by a dubious name.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love Juby,\u201d she said. \u201cWe miss him so. He made dolls for the girls, you know. Out of string and bits of wood. They were always hanging on him, begging for a story.\u201d</p><p>Villiers had one thought in response to that information: Juby couldn\u2019t be his son. Impossible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an odd thing, you taking him in. Will he be in the stables? He does like horses.\u201d</p><p>Naturally he would, with that nickname. \u201cMadam,\u201d Villiers said, \u201che will not be in the stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be good in the kitchens,\u201d she prophesied.</p><p>\u201cThe cook will have a fit. That boy likes to eat.\u201d She beamed proudly.</p><p>\u201cI shall do my best to keep him fed.\u201d</p><p>She put out a hand and touched his sleeve. Villiers froze. He greatly disliked being touched. \u201cWill you let him visit me now and again? I\u2019ve seen him only two or three times since Templeton took him to Grindel\u2019s. He ran away once, but they took him back again. I do miss him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said courteously, stepping back so her hand slipped from his arm. Then he bowed again and left her there on the doorstep, baby sleeping on her shoulder.</p><p>He had a biting headache and a strong inclination to forget this whole idea. He couldn\u2019t have a child named Juby. It was inconceivable. He was Villiers. A duke.</p><p>How did he know this child was actually his? A gentleman\u2019s son, she\u2019d said. Surely Templeton would have mentioned that the child\u2019s father was a duke?</p><p>Everything in him recoiled from the distastefulness of the entire visit. The slobbering child, the ridiculous nickname, the shabby house.</p> <p>Gentlemen didn\u2019t worry about this sort of thing. A child born on the wrong side of the blanket was no real child of his.</p><p>Even he couldn\u2019t rationalize that assertion, though.</p><p>Tobias was his child. He remembered the mother, Fenela, well enough. She was a luscious girl, an Italian opera singer, who had been enraged when she found herself with child.</p><p>She had screamed, and he had laughed, and in the end he promised to care for the child when Fenela traveled on. As he recalled, he supported the entire opera company for some seven months. They continued their entirely pleasant nightly encounters until she declared that she hated both him and her swollen ankles.</p><p>Eventually Templeton had informed him of the existence of a son, and the child\u2019s settlement in a good establishment, and that was that.</p> <p>He even knew why Tobias had the name: because Fenela had been singing the part of an innocent maiden, seduced by the dastardly baron, Tobias. The baron courted the maiden\u2019s affections and lured her to an adulterous doom.</p><p>Except that the evil baron had turned into the flourishing, fat Juby.</p><p>Juby.</p><p>Villiers shuddered as he got into his carriage.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Later that morning</p> <p>Elijah woke with the distinct sensation that something was wrong. But what could be wrong? He and Jemma had finally fallen asleep as the first morning light was creeping through the curtains. Now he was lying behind her, her curvaceous bottom tucked against him, his arms around her.</p><p>He felt a pulse of joy...and yet the terrible sense of unease lingered. After a moment he slipped out of bed. Jemma made a little moue as his arms left her, and then she rolled farther into the pillows. Her hair was tousled and silky, the color of drowsy sunshine, just as he had told her.</p><p>The unease appeared again. Normally just the sight of Jemma fired his loins. But not this morning. With that realization came another.</p><p>His heart was misfiring. It had actually woken him up, which had never happened before. He sprang from the bed and walked a few steps. Sometimes even a small amount of exercise was enough to correct the timing. But his heart still bounded in his chest, as if it had forgotten the proper rhythm.</p><p>He would have to go for a ride; that often calmed its rhythm. He eased out of Jemma\u2019s chamber and retired to his own rooms.</p><p>He had finished his bath and was pulling on a coat when a footman scratched at the door. After a whispered exchange, his valet came back and said, \u201cMr. Fowle is very sorry to disturb you, Your Grace, but the Honorable Howard Cheever-Chittlesford is waiting below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Christ,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cSent by Pitt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, Your Grace.\u201d Vickery handed him his wig. \u201cHe is accompanied by another gentleman, Lord Stibblestich.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah groaned inwardly. Cheever-Chittlesford was a petty bureaucrat who prided himself on his eloquence, yet Elijah seemed to be the only one to notice that the man\u2019s eloquence was always employed in the wrong tactics. Cheever-Chittlesford was the sort who would comment, for example, that the slave trade had its place, and that Pitt shouldn\u2019t push too aggressively to abolish it.</p><p>Blackguard or no, Cheever-Chittlesford was a close advisor to Pitt, and Stibblestich was the liaison to the chief magistrate, so Elijah straightened his wig and prepared to go downstairs. Thankfully, his heart had settled down and was now dancing to a milder, if irregular, beat: not exactly steady, but not frightening either.</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford was standing at the window; Stibblestich had accepted a glass of brandy. In the morning.</p><p>Elijah strode into his library. When he was one of Pitt\u2019s advisors, he felt divided between himself and his rank. In the presence of Pitt, he was more an advisor than a duke.</p><p>Now he felt every inch the duke. And Cheever-Chittlesford, wily statesman that he was, realized it immediately. His bow was lower and more respectful than it was when they met in the House.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cheever-Chittlesford,\u201d Elijah said briskly.</p><p>\u201cLord Stibblestich. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford was not a man to rush into speech; Elijah had seen him allow others to instigate conversations thousands of times. Even better, he would provoke a flagrant battle, during which both sides would pour out their best arguments. He would listen silently, saying nothing, and then decide precisely when to seize control of the subject.</p><p>Stibblestich, on the other hand, was the perfect man to launch an argument. He rarely thought before he spoke, and therefore his words were invariably insulting. \u201cIt\u2019s the hulks,\u201d he said importantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been tasked by the king himself with coming up with a solution to those floating monstrosities.\u201d</p><p>Elijah kept his expression pleasant and uninterested. \u201cA difficult problem, as we\u2019ve already admitted,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suggested that we fire them,\u201d Stibblestich said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best solution. Fire \u2019em!\u201d He gave a couple of vigorous nods. \u201cThere\u2019s none but bloody-minded criminals aboard. They\u2019re a floating pestilence for the city, like rats...like\u2014like\u2014like rats,\u201d he finished, apparently unable to think of another word.</p><p>Elijah turned to Cheever-Chittlesford. \u201cOf course, removing the warships from their current use as prison barges is an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford looked discomfited, which was unusual. Elijah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cPrecisely what do you mean by \u2018fire them\u2019?\u201d he asked, turning back to Stibblestich.</p><p>\u201cBurn them down,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cIt\u2019ll take care of all our problems. We\u2019ll start over with the same problem, of course, but we can find somewhere else to house the new ones. The king himself was in danger during the riots!\u201d He opened his eyes so wide that his whole face seemed to stretch.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s heart gave a great thump. \u201cDo I take you to mean that you are considering burning the ships with prisoners inside?\u201d He could hear the pendulum clock behind him ticking very hard, as hard as his heart was beating. It was inconceivable...it was barbaric. He could feel, deep in his body, the frown that had formed on his face, the fury that was making his back rigid.</p><p>Stibblestich started to bluster, something about pestilence. Elijah turned to Cheever-Chittlesford, who looked at him with the shadow of an apology in his eyes, so Elijah knew that indeed the government was entertaining that thought. Something in him raged and despaired at once. They were so stupid, so stupid and violent.</p><p>With an effort, he summoned up the logical, calm voice that he used to show madmen the error of their ways. \u201cYou intend to burn the hulks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Stibblestich said. Satisfaction reeked in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBurning them where they are currently anchored?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point! We need to make a lesson out of this uprising. We can\u2019t just let it pass: the king\u2019s own yacht was violated by dirty, criminal hands. The king\u2019s noble subjects were fired upon. But that was not the worst.\u201d</p><p>Elijah frowned. \u201cWhat was the worst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duchess of Cosway was on that yacht! She was caught by those criminals, manhandled, perhaps violated\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford interrupted. \u201cThey held her briefly; she was rescued by her husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey pushed the Duke of Cosway into the water!\u201d Stibblestich said, his voice rising even higher. \u201cThe duke and duchess had to swim to shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Elijah said, wondering if his wife knew that her friend Isidore had taken an impromptu bath in the Thames.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had uprisings on the hulks in the past,\u201d Stibblestich said, \u201cbut as I\u2019ve told you before, this time they\u2019ve gone too far! We must make an example of them! They touched\u2014nay, they assaulted\u2014a peer. Two peers!\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford cleared his throat again. \u201cOf course, the duke and duchess do appear to be unharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the grace of God, who looks out for the just and innocent,\u201d Stibblestich said. His breath smelled like brandy and pickled eggs, and Elijah\u2019s stomach lurched.</p> <p>\u201cAnd also because the Duke of Cosway was able to knock those holding his wife to the ground,\u201d Cheever-Chittlesford added.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t make an example of this,\u201d Stibblestich said, \u201cthere\u2019ll be no end to it. People will be free to assault the highest in the country, to molest those of the highest blood. We cannot allow such an abomination!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe argument is that firing the one boat involved in the uprising would serve as a warning to other prisoners,\u201d Cheever-Chittlesford said, rocking back on his heels.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a bad man. But he was a pragmatic man, and Elijah surmised that he was facing considerable pressure. Nothing else could explain Cheever-Chittlesford\u2019s appearance at his house. Nothing other than the fact that Elijah had served as something of a conscience for Pitt, the one man who wasn\u2019t motivated enough by money or power to lay aside all sense of principle.</p><p>\u201cIt is wrong to burn those men inside the boat,\u201d Elijah stated. There, the decent truth of it was on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s against God\u2019s law and ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Parliament makes the laws,\u201d Stibblestich argued. \u201cTogether with the king. And sometimes the harshest remedies must be chosen for the good of all. Of course, each man would be allowed to make his last confession. We are not barbarians.\u201d</p> <p>But of course they were barbarians. The appeal to decency had to be made, as Elijah saw it. Cheever-Chittlesford knew. He knew it was wrong. But that wasn\u2019t the argument that would sway them.</p><p>\u201cYou intend to burn the ship with the men manacled inside,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cThere, in the presence of all London. Will you advertise this fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Stibblestich said promptly. \u201cHow else can we ensure that the criminal element understands the serious consequences of laying hands on a peer? Of rebelling against the punishment meted out to them by a thoughtful and understanding judiciary? It will serve as a lesson to all restless criminal minds who plan such riots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of those prisoners, as you know, served in the Royal Navy,\u201d Elijah said. He let that comment hang in the air for a moment. \u201cThere are former sailors in the hulks who stole as little as a loaf of bread because they were starving.\u201d</p><p>Even Stibblestich knew that returning soldiers were a vast problem in England. \u201cTheir home counties should care for them,\u201d he said lamely. But the counties from which these men came could not afford to feed and clothe a man on crutches, or a man with only one eye and one hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just imagine,\u201d Elijah said, \u201cwhat the citizens of London will think and feel as they watch the boat burn.\u201d</p><p>Stibblestich seized that, of course. \u201cLondoners love a good execution! We\u2019ve had hundreds watching around Tyburn when a murderer is being hanged\u2014or better yet, drawn and quartered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are not murderers, of course,\u201d Elijah said.</p> <p>\u201cThe murderers have already been hanged, with their cheerful audiences. Murderers do not find themselves in the hulks. These prisoners are the poor, those who stole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobbers,\u201d Stibblestich said, the word exploding off his tongue. \u201cThey beat and they rob. Generally the elderly. They will rob an old woman as soon as look at her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondoners will watch from the shores, no doubt,\u201d Elijah continued. \u201cThey will hear the screams.\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford\u2019s eyes flared, just slightly.</p><p>\u201cThe men will be trapped below, as the smoke begins to creep down. I imagine it will be something like the burning of witches, that happened back in uncivilized times...say in the realm of Queen Mary, she who is now nicknamed Bloody Mary. I\u2019m afraid that history does tend to dwell on this sort of event.\u201d</p><p>Stibblestich said, \u201cI doubt\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Elijah spoke straight over him. \u201cThe men will begin to scream. The flames will lick onward. And every person on the shore will know someone who knows someone on that boat. The mothers will likely try to throw themselves into the water at this point. They will begin to shriek.\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford\u2019s mouth was a thin line.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, they\u2019ll scream,\u201d Elijah said, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cI expect that the ship burning will be the one event that marks the entire reign of King George III. No one will ever forget it. No one on that shore, who watches that wholesale slaughter, will ever stop talking of it, not in his or her lifetime.\u201d He turned sharply on Cheever-Chittlesford. \u201cDoes the king realize that he stands to create his legacy by this single act?\u201d</p><p>The question of Pitt\u2019s legacy hung in the air, not to mention Cheever-Chittlesford\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, I doubt it would be anything near as dramatic!\u201d Stibblestich blustered. \u201cYou\u2019ll have us all in tears, talking of mothers and such. But the reality is that Londoners like a good hanging!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they do. A man who\u2019s been fairly caught and confessed\u2014for they always appear to have written their confessions, even the ones who can\u2019t sign their own names\u2014London does enjoy a good hanging of that nature. But men chained to the walls, forced to die slowly, in terror and excruciating agony, for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread?\u201d</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford cleared his throat. \u201cI am sure another solution will present itself.\u201d</p><p>Elijah knew better than to show the slightest sign of satisfaction. He\u2019d lost arguments, after winning them, by exhibiting pleasure in the outcome.</p><p>Cheever-Chittlesford\u2019s eyes looked like old metal coins, dull and impenetrable. But Elijah knew he had him. Cheever-Chittlesford would not allow the firing of the hulks. Elijah looked deliberately at Stibblestich, and then back at Cheever-Chittlesford. \u201cStatesmen are likely to be judged by those they have around them. Men of the highest integrity are a bulwark against depraved decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing depraved about it!\u201d Stibblestich said. His voice was quieter now that he\u2019d lost. He looked disappointed. He, for one, would have enjoyed standing on the riverbank and watching the ship burn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suggest you investigate sending such petty criminals to Australia,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large country, and far away.\u201d Cheever-Chittlesford didn\u2019t look convinced, so he added, \u201cIn years to come, it may be a thriving colony, capable of being taxed.\u201d</p><p>That made Cheever-Chittlesford look even more thoughtful.</p><p>Suddenly Elijah wanted nothing more than for these men to be out of the house, with their ability to discuss burning men alive, as if such a thing could ever be a reasonable proposition. As his rage receded, exhaustion followed in its wake.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you must forgive me, gentlemen. I have a previous engagement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cheever-Chittlesford murmured.</p><p>Finally, they left the library and were in the entry. Elijah heard Stibblestich\u2019s voice, sharp and scornful. \u201cOf course Bawdy Beaumont has an appointment. I hear he\u2019s caught the whore\u2019s disease. And you know where he caught that. Like father, like son. I always said it.\u201d His voice faded as he and Cheever-Chittlesford walked out the front door.</p><p>Elijah didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>There was a sound in his head, like that of a stream rushing downhill. He was so tired that his legs felt like bars of lead. He had to go back to bed.</p><p>But the distance between himself and the bedchamber upstairs seemed insurmountable.</p> <p>Jemma could not see him like this. He forced himself to move, feeling his heart thump angrily in response. The only thing his body wanted was to lie down, to slip into the blackness that waited at the edges of his vision.</p><p>He walked up the stairs steadily, by an enormous effort of will. At his door, he slipped through and closed it behind him, leaned back, head against the wood. Something was wrong with his vision, though, and the walls seemed to undulate.</p><p>The thought crossed his mind that he might not wake up this time. He had felt this terrible only once, after fainting in the House of Lords a year ago. A wash of regret went through his mind, but he pushed himself upright. He had had one wonderful night with Jemma.</p><p>He put a foot forward, and then another. It wasn\u2019t so far to the bed. The walls were turning gray and foggy, as if the solid wood were dissolving. He could feel his heart stuttering, dropping a beat, another beat.</p><p>He pushed himself forward. If he were going to die now, it would be decently in his bed. He could have been climbing a mountain, given the effort it took him, but he finally was at the side of his bed. He put his hands out and allowed himself to fall forward.</p><p>Then he thought about turning over for what seemed like a long time before he managed to do it.</p> <p>It was only when he was lying there fully clothed, and the familiar darkness was gathering and billowing around him, that Elijah thought of his father. He had spent the greater part of his life hating his father for dying in the manner he did, for living his life in such a wayward fashion. The facts of his father\u2019s death had shaped his life.</p><p>Yet if his father had not been immoral in such a flagrant fashion, would he himself have become a person whom statesmen visited for advice when they were considering a leap into cruelty?</p><p>He would have been merely another duke, trundling from his country estate to his town house, marrying the woman designated to be his duchess, going from cradle to grave without considering the impact of his own words, of his own life.</p><p>With that thought came a feeling of peace. Because his father had died young, Elijah had always felt time at his shoulder. And that drove him to work hard. It allowed him to sometimes intervene before a great injustice was served on the weak and needy.</p><p>It even drove him to bring Jemma back from Paris, to give them the indescribable joy they had shared the night before. His father had never found the love that he and Jemma shared.</p><p>The late duke had lived in a house full of portraits of beheaded men. Whereas he had lived, if only for a year, in a house graced by Jemma.</p><p>He slipped into the darkness, smiling.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p> <p>Elijah was rather surprised to wake up, but not surprised to find Jemma standing at his bedside, her eyes huge in her stricken face.</p><p>She said his name on a sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, the words coming with difficulty. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the attacks came\u2013I was a fool,\u201d she said, clutching his hand. \u201cI put it out of my mind. Was it because we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said quickly. \u201cStibblestich visited this morning.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, and he could see her make a visible effort not to renew her plea that he leave the Parliament. \u201cGive me some time,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll have that potion Vickery doubtless has ready-made, and take a short nap.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s lips were trembling, but she set her mouth and put down his hand. An hour or so later he was up, his headache gone, just the ache of regret in his chest.</p><p>He found Jemma in the library, staring at an empty chess board. He didn\u2019t think she was playing a game in her head. He dropped a kiss on her hair. \u201cWould you like to take a walk with me?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Her eyes were glazed with tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said helplessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a walk, but not here. I don\u2019t want to see Lady Lister next door, or anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the gardens of the Roman bath?\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe said we would go back, someday.\u201d</p><p>The truth of that stood between them silently. If they didn\u2019t go now, they might never go.</p><p>Servants have a way of knowing when it\u2019s the right time to be invisible. Without meeting anyone\u2019s eyes\u2014not Fowle\u2019s, not a footman\u2019s\u2014they were in the carriage. Jemma huddled under his arm like a wounded bird. And then they were at the baths.</p><p>It was raining: not hard, just enough to make spring look even greener. Every leaf appeared new, as if its paint was not yet dry, the color still vivid and glossy. Even the light looked green.</p><p>The little monk let them in, incurious as ever. He wore his hood over his face so all that could be seen was his nose. The nose nodded when Elijah said they would walk in the gardens, and the man hurried away, disappearing between the broken pillars.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Elijah asked, breaking the silence. \u201cDo you have any idea why he tends the baths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are five of them,\u201d Jemma said. Her voice was too controlled. She needed to cry, he guessed. \u201cCaring for the baths is all they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey certainly don\u2019t bother with the grounds.\u201d The gardens were as dilapidated as the baths themselves. They wandered down a path lined with overgrown shrubs. Flowering vines hung like horse blankets over the low walls, dragging down stones and tumbling them to the pavement.</p><p>The tree trunks were shiny black with rain, their leaves reflected in puddles at their feet.</p><p>\u201cI believe they spend their time in prayer,\u201d she said, when so much time had passed that he had forgotten the question.</p><p>\u201cPrayer to Apollo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe God of Healing.\u201d Her hand curled suddenly around his. \u201cOh, Elijah, would it be madness to ask them to pray for you?\u201d She started to turn about.</p><p>He dropped a kiss on her nose. \u201cYes, it would. I don\u2019t think people ask Apollo to grant favors. He gave humans the art of medicine, but he didn\u2019t promise to cure Lord Piddleton\u2019s gout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not suffering from a mild case of gout,\u201d she said tensely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you can always ask.\u201d</p><p>But she was thinking about it now. \u201cThe problem is where does one stop? If I ask the monks here, I\u2019d have to ask someone in the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe archbishop, at least,\u201d Elijah suggested. Against all odds, he was starting to feel oddly happy.</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cHow dare you smile at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t die today,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m walking with you, and you don\u2019t have gloves on, so I am feeling a pleasantly irresponsible wish to kiss your fingers.\u201d Which he did. \u201cAnd your mouth.\u201d Which he did.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most lovely mouth, Jemma,\u201d he whispered sometime later. \u201cIt\u2019s soft and full. It makes me want to bite you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was so beautiful that he kissed her again, and then because a man can\u2019t kiss a luscious woman and simultaneously feel despair, he started to feel something quite otherwise.</p><p>Jemma had her arms wound around his neck and didn\u2019t seem to take it in when he unbuttoned her pelisse and ran his hands inside.</p><p>He almost groaned aloud. The lush weight of her breasts, plumped in his hand, made him feel mad. It was the work of a moment to pull down the delicate pleated material hiding their beauty.</p><p>The gardens were utterly still. They had walked long enough so even the baths were out of sight. He couldn\u2019t hear a sound from the road, just the high clear song of a lark, rejoicing in the end of the rain shower.</p><p>If there was ever a moment since the world began in which a man ought to play Adam, and make love to his own Eve, this was it. Without further ado, Elijah spun Jemma to the side and plumped her down on a narrow bench at the edge of the path. She let out a little shriek that might have had something to do with the rain glistening on the marble seat.</p><p>But Elijah fell to his knees before her, ignoring her protest. He traced the curve of her breast with his hand and then followed that caress with his lips. She certainly protested: she even tugged at his hair. But he felt primitive and alive, suckling his wife with a passion bred by grief and joy intermingled. He knew her body, knew her soul, and so he wrapped his hands around her waist at the very moment Jemma surrendered. Her head fell back and a ragged cry came from her throat.</p><p>The smooth skin under his tongue tasted like milk and honey, like the most delicious food the world has to offer. He gave her a little bite; she gasped and the sound stoked his belly, sent fire raging up his legs.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, wrenching her bodice even lower so that he could give the same ministrations to her left breast, \u201cyou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Her body went rigid.</p><p>He gave her another little bite. \u201cNot literally, you fool.\u201d And licked her to ask forgiveness for his offense.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me names,\u201d she said, but her voice was syrupy and he knew he had her. He wasn\u2019t dead yet. He wasn\u2019t dead yet.</p><p>He stroked and nibbled until her whole body was trembling and she was clutching his shoulders closer, rather than trying to push him away\u2014and then he stood up. \u201cTime to be on our way, sweetheart.\u201d He caught her hand and brought her to her feet, loving the look of her. The contrast between her lush skirts and bare breasts, between her dazed eyes and ruby mouth.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>He loved it when his sophisticated Jemma got that look in her eyes, as if she were bereft because he had stopped touching her. As if her need for him was so great that she couldn\u2019t think about chess pieces or logic or any of those other things she did so well. So he kissed her again, just to make sure she was agreeable, and then pulled her down the path.</p><p>There was mist hanging in the air from the morning\u2019s shower, but he could see that the path ended in a little circle with a statue. Perfect. He couldn\u2019t give her time to think, so it was the work of a moment to have Jemma flat on her back, cushioned on his coat and her pelisse. He threw off his boots too, though she hadn\u2019t quite noticed.</p><p>\u201cJust a kiss,\u201d she said, starting to wake up. \u201cI don\u2019t mind kissing, Elijah, though this is terribly\u2014\u201d</p><p>He had to move quickly so he put a hand under her skirts. She was soft and wet, and the little noise that came from her mouth replaced all those anxious words she was trying to say. Every time she started again he changed his touch from light to deep, from a brush to a stroke. She did manage to gasp ridiculous things in between pants. Like \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cIs that rain?\u201d and \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>But he took his time, his fingers dancing, his mouth stealing her moans until she started bucking against his hand, twisting from side to side.</p><p>Still he waited...waited...moved his fingers in the kind of languid stroke that his own sweet Jemma could not resist, could not fight.</p><p>It started to spit rain again, just enough to cool them both off. She had stopped saying no, and was breathing his name over and over, like a song. There was something in the sound of it that made him feel such a wave of tenderness that he instinctively shook his head. Rather than say something foolish, he threw up her skirts and slid down so that he could feel with his fingers and his mouth every shudder that raked her body. Her hands wrapped into his hair and she gave a little scream, a cry of pure pleasure.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2014\u201d and she came with a force that shook her body from her toes to her fingertips.</p><p>It was his moment. He wrenched down his pantaloons and eased into her. She was swollen and silky, like milk wrapped around him. A thick groan broke from his lips.</p><p>But: \u201cI\u2019m worried about your heart,\u201d Jemma said. He looked down and her eyes were wide open, anxious\u2014terrified.</p><p>He brushed her lips with his own. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better. Do you know what I love, Jemma?\u201d He moved slowly forward, sliding into her, stretching her. She squeaked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be naked today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She arched up against him so that he nearly lost his train of thought. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be naked,\u201d she pointed out. But there was no real conviction in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou wear perfume when you think you\u2019re going to be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, pushing back against him at just the right moment.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you don\u2019t wear perfume. You smell so good,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her. \u201cYou smell like clean rain, and hot woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d She was trying to sound scandalized, so he ignored her.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201cHe lowered his mouth to her ear again and told her in detail what he meant to do. And then because his language had been thrillingly rough, he followed it up with kisses so sweet that he felt another pulse of nervousness. Making love wasn\u2019t supposed to be so\u2014so loving.</p><p>He shook the thought away, threw his head back, and pumped. But even as Jemma squeaked when he filled her, her hands clutched his shoulders, and her moan was of fear.</p><p>He opened his eyes. \u201cJemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid for you,\u201d she gasped. There was rain on her nose, and shining in her curls, and she was so beautiful that it took everything he had to stop the movement of his hips. Even so, he couldn\u2019t stop himself, and nudged forward just a bit. Just enough to make sure that she was with him.</p><p>She was, because she took a quick breath and her fingers bit into his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m covered with sweat,\u201d he observed, stilling again.</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d Her eyes went wide again.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s good. Remember, I told you that regular exercise has helped my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is. If you stop me now, it\u2019ll be a terrible shock to my body,\u201d he offered.</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cMy heart\u2019s steady,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, feel it.\u201d</p><p>Her little hands came up to his shirt and pressed. \u201cI can\u2019t feel anything,\u201d she cried, frustrated.</p><p>So with a groan of regret he pulled away, stood up and pulled his shirt over his head. She liked to look at him. He could tell the way her eyes darkened, just a bit. In a flash he was back where he needed to be.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re going to monitor my heart,\u201d he said, grinning because he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>She swatted him. \u201cElijah, we\u2019re making love in the outdoors, in case you didn\u2019t notice that. What if that little monk comes along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the rain?\u201d He snorted. \u201cThe man is snuggled up next to a fire somewhere drinking a toddy. That\u2019s what monks do. They certainly don\u2019t engage in gardening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you know!\u201d But she looked better for a little jousting: more like herself, and less like a frightened, white-faced woman he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cNow as I said, you\u2019re in charge of monitoring my heart, not that anything will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, I never faint when my heart is pumping. Exercise seems to make it go in a steady rhythm. It\u2019s only when I\u2019m resting or fighting with Stibblestich that it skips a beat now and then.\u201d</p><p>She clutched him. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re resting right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said, enjoying every evil moment of it. \u201cI\u2019d better stop resting. For my own good.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. He knew he had her. So before she could start arguing, he slipped back into the cradle of her thighs.</p><p>Sure enough, she protested. She had starting thinking in the two minutes it took him to remove his clothing. \u201cElijah! We really shouldn\u2019t do this. We\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re outdoors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay put,\u201d he told her. The sight of her had peeled away all his niceness, and now he was just one growling male again. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Rain was falling like an uncertain melody, just one drop here or there. One fell on her breast, glistening like a diamond.</p><p>He licked it off and then gave her a little bite and she apparently forgot that she was outdoors, because even a monk behind stone walls could have heard that shriek. Then he blew on her skin, and gave her another sweet, deep caress.</p> <p>It seemed that this particular duchess liked making love outdoors.</p><p>Finally, when he had her just where he wanted her, he came up on his knees and drove into her with one powerful stroke. She came. Just like that, with a wild cry, and a convulsion that damn near sent him over the edge too.</p><p>Being Jemma, she hadn\u2019t even recovered when she began patting his chest, trying to find his heart. He didn\u2019t stop; his whole body was intent on one mission, and one mission only.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it? Where is it?\u201d she moaned, patting him all over the right side of his chest.</p><p>\u201cWrong side,\u201d he managed. She was never going to settle down, so he took one of her hands and plopped it on top of his heart. Which was beating so hard that he could feel it in his ears\u2014but with perfect rhythm.</p><p>\u201cMy heart,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201cis happy, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pressed his chest, and then he saw her start to smile.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said, pulling back.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making love, Jemma. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d But he couldn\u2019t shape the words anymore. Instead he just stared at her as he thrust, at her beauty, at the deep goodness of her. She couldn\u2019t resist either. Her eyes squeezed shut and her arms flew restlessly around his arms, his shoulders, his chest, caressing him, leaving trails of fire, sliding down his back, clutching his rear.</p><p>He pumped harder and harder, until neither one of them had a thought for the rain. Not for anything but the two of them: God\u2019s creatures, lucky enough to experience His greatest pleasure.</p><p>Elijah lost control. The world narrowed to just the sweet smell of his wife, the taste of her skin, the movement of his hips.</p><p>Still, he waited to be sure that her fear was gone. Waited until she cried out and surged against him. And then he flew. The world dissolved into such acute pleasure that his bones flamed with it.</p><p>Blissful moments later, he rolled onto the slick stones, enjoying the cool, wet stone against his buttocks and back. His heart beat steadily.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Jemma asked, but there was a smile in her voice too.</p><p>\u201cMy body\u2019s happy,\u201d he said, stretching.</p><p>She was already sitting up, pulling her bodice into place.</p><p>Elijah just folded his arms behind his head and watched her. It felt wonderful to lie there, stretched out in the warm rain. He didn\u2019t give a damn if the monk came along. In fact, he didn\u2019t give a damn if the whole House of Lords decided to go for an afternoon stroll, happened down this particular path, and saw the Duke of Beaumont, lying naked on an old stone path.</p><p>No one told you that almost dying was so freeing. \u201cI could live here,\u201d he said dreamily. \u201cIn my house the birds would sing day and night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder that huge horse chestnut. We\u2019ll have a bed of eiderdown and make love every morning before the birds rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall miss my morning tea,\u201d Jemma said. She had managed to wrench her bodice up just enough so that it covered her nipples. The plump tops of her breasts looked ready to fall out at any moment.</p><p>\u201cThat gown will never be the same,\u201d he said, watching her. \u201cThat yellow part, that pleated cloth on top, looks as if a dog has chewed on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne did,\u201d Jemma retorted. \u201cAt least it covers my nipples now.\u201d She looked over and seemed to realize that he was making no attempt to dress. \u201cAre you going home like that? Or are you truly planning to sleep under the horse chestnut?\u201d</p><p>He was too happy to move. \u201cWhy not? My blanket could be made of those little green hearts it throws out in spring, the ones with little crimson centers.\u201d</p><p>Jemma being Jemma, she didn\u2019t break into a chorus of little remonstrances. Instead, she surprised him. Again. She turned around and lay down, her head on his bare stomach as the rain spattered her face.</p><p>\u201cI never imagined, ever, a duchess lying on the ground, being rained on,\u201d he said, after a time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really raining. But you\u2019re right. I suppose duchesses don\u2019t lie about in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith their naked husbands,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThat makes it even worse,\u201d she agreed. Her hair was all rumpled and fallen from its nest of curls, so he picked a spray of flowers and started poking blossoms in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, twisting her head so she could see him.</p><p>\u201cTurning you into a pagan goddess,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee Apollo there?\u201d In the center of the little stone courtyard was a statue of the god wearing little more than a shawl. He stood on a stone pedestal, its latticework woven through with knot grass and other weeds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoor soul. What\u2019s happened to his arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnocked off,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cHe kept his fig leaf, though. A man\u2014even better, a god\u2014likes to keep some things covered through the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks a bit scrawny,\u201d Jemma said critically. \u201cI like your legs better. Who knows what\u2019s under that fig leaf? You would need a fig leaf twice that size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. You\u2019ll insult the god, and right in his own backyard. There.\u201d He poked in a last few flowers. \u201cI\u2019ll have to be very lucky or Apollo will come to life and claim you for his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you remember, Apollo had no luck with women. Didn\u2019t Daphne turn herself into a tree rather than be with him? And now we know why. It was undoubtedly due to those bony little knees of his, not to mention the tiny fig leaf.\u201d Jemma started to sit up, so Elijah got up and pulled her to her feet. \u201cI am ready to return to being a duchess, if it means that my bottom can warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that for you,\u201d Elijah said with an exaggerated leer, cupping his hand over the part of her body in question. Her skirts were soaked, and he could feel her intoxicating, soft curve. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes contained such a beautiful smile that he had to stop and kiss her. \u201cAnd happy,\u201d he said a moment later.</p><p>She leaned her head against his chest. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said, but not: I\u2019m happy.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, the words rising from his heart naturally. \u201cI love you, Jemma. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>The joy in her face shamed him. \u201cTo find all this bliss, at the end,\u201d he said, holding her tightly. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it, Jemma. God knows, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the end,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cIf it is, I\u2019ve had more joy in the last week than in the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Her arms tightened around him and she said something, so low he couldn\u2019t hear. But he thought she said she loved him, and he knew that already.</p><p>He dressed, and kissed her a few more times, and they walked back to the little door where the carriage waited.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p> <p>That evening</p><p>Elijah had banished Fowle and the footmen, and there were only the two of them, down at one end of a long mahogany table with a great deal of silver reflecting the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to live like this,\u201d Jemma said after a few minutes of moving her food around her plate. Every time she looked at her husband, her throat tightened and she felt ill.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d Elijah offered.</p><p>He was eating. How could he eat? How could anyone eat, sleep, think in his situation? There had to be some way, someone, who could help Elijah\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you seen one?\u201d</p> <p>Her annoying, stubborn husband shrugged. \u201cVilliers dragged me to a physician who studies hearts. The man said I may live for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a doctor in Birmingham who\u2019s apparently doing miraculous things with hearts like mine. Villiers sent a carriage up there to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow uncharacteristically generous of him,\u201d Jemma said, ringing the bell. \u201cFowle, send around to the Duke of Villiers and find out when he expects his carriage to return from Birmingham. Wait for a response, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Fowle disappeared with all the efficiency of a man who recognizes a woman on the verge of hysterics.</p><p>\u201cDarling\u2014\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Not now.\u201d Her mind was racing. \u201cThere must be a way to cure this. There must be. The doctor in Birmingham will come here and cure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your supper,\u201d Elijah ordered.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen did Villiers send the coach? I heard of a very good doctor the other day. Siffle, I think his name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in the Morning Post,\u201d Elijah said, taking another bite of asparagus. \u201cHe\u2019s doing miraculous things with broken limbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Elijah said, pushing back his chair and holding out his arms.</p><p>She responded, then sat nestled against him, only to feel her heart beating furiously in her chest. Regularly. A scream threatened at the back of her throat.</p><p>He was stroking her hair as if she were a cat. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d She forced out the words.</p><p>They were both silent a moment. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not all right, but it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s acceptable,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cThis is not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d The raw pain in his voice silenced her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me as soon as I returned from Paris?\u201d She whispered it into his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve known...alone. You could have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had the chess match with Villiers. And I wanted to win you, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already had me,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cYou always had me, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted all of you. When you made the match with Villiers, I seized the opportunity to try to win you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have just told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? Would you have fallen in love with me again, as you have?\u201d She said nothing, and he gave her a little shake. \u201cAs you have, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you already,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was selfish. You didn\u2019t think that I wanted time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and buried her head in his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy as the last days. When you were wooing me, Jemma. When you were loving me. When you were laughing at me, or letting me make love to you. When you were making love to me.\u201d</p><p>Huge tears were burning in her eyes. \u201cI could have done all that a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may have another year. My faint in the House of Lords occurred over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>She heard the slightest note in his voice, knew he was lying. He knew, he knew. There was saltwater on her cheeks, the taste of it on her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me what I thought I\u2019d never have,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk as if you\u2019re dying tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it. I can\u2019t bear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Jemma. You were strong enough to leave me when I had to be left, and strong enough to come home when I needed you. You will care for my house, and my lands, and my poor Cacky Street men. You can bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall cry if I want to,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cOh God, I suddenly understand widows\u2019 weeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t listen to him. \u201cBecause if you die, I shan\u2019t want to wear anything but black,\u201d she said, a great sob rising in her throat. \u201cI shall cry for a year and a day in my blacks, and no one can fault me. I didn\u2019t understand why Harriet was still grieving for her husband although it had been almost two years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d He was almost shouting now, but Jemma was convulsed by grief, bending at the waist, ugly sobs tearing through her lungs. Elijah bent over with her, his strong, warm body curved over her back, holding her, warming her.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be true,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s not true, it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up then and carried her away to bed, and they lay there together while sobs shook her body. Because it was true. He was leaving her.</p><p>He had to leave her unless some sort of miracle happened...and neither of them believed in miracles. They were chess players. They were logical, and rational.</p> <p>And thus, brokenhearted.</p><p>After her sobs had quieted, Elijah said, \u201cJemma, I think you should leave me.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, her eyes burning, and stared at him incredulously. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible that you should have to live through this with me. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off because she was slapping him, great, open-handed slaps to his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to send me away again, Elijah! Don\u2019t you understand? Why don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p> <p>She was sobbing again. \u201cYou never get to send me away again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m a fool, Jemma. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her face was stricken but her eyes blazed at him. \u201cYou made a mistake and you broke us in half,\u201d she said. Her voice was quieter, but still passionate. \u201cYou keep saying that I\u2019m yours, Elijah, but the truth is that you are mine as well.\u201d</p><p>He heard the urgency behind her voice and he suddenly understood. She loved him. Loved him enough to forgive him for his mistress, for not following her to Paris.</p><p>But there was one thing he had to know. He cupped her face in his hands, noting absently that his fingers were shaking. \u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor not being able to stay with you forever. Because I would, Jemma. I promise I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, brushing his lips with her own. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>April 2</p><p>The next morning, Jemma retired to the morning parlor and began trying to understand how one lived with this kind of knowledge. It wasn\u2019t healthy for her to follow Elijah about, nervously demanding to listen to his heart. He disliked it. Besides, every time she listened to his chest, she heard skipped beats and her own heart felt as if it were filled with hot coals.</p><p>Yet she was wrung with fear. Her fingers trembled as she picked up the chess pieces. She was on the point of giving up, and joining Elijah in his study, when Fowle entered, a grim look on his face.</p><p>She sprang to her feet so quickly that she knocked over the chessboard. Pieces rolled on the ground. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Reading her mind, a look of deep sympathy crossed Fowle\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe is fine, Your Grace. Should His Grace faint again, I shall call you from outside the room, as I approach.\u201d</p> <p>She sank back down into her chair. \u201cThank you, Fowle.\u201d Her fingers were shaking like leaves in a high wind.</p><p>\u201cThe dowager duchess has arrived,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten that there had to be a reason for his entry. \u201cThe\u2014The dowager? The duke\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have placed her in the rose chamber,\u201d Fowle said.</p><p>\u201cShe expressed the wish that you would join her immediately. Apparently she intends to return to Scotland very shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn to Scotland?\u201d Jemma asked. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! I am certain she will change her mind. She will be making a prolonged stay with us. Please inform Mrs. Tulip.\u201d</p><p>Now Jemma understood the grim look on Fowle\u2019s face when he first entered. Her own memories of her mother-in-law were distinctly unpleasant. The dowager duchess was tall and angry. She carried herself like a man, and Jemma found her alarming.</p><p>Jemma had lived the first weeks of her marriage in a house full of portraits of Judith holding Holofernes\u2019s head (minus his body) because she was worried about the dowager\u2019s reaction if she removed them.</p><p>Of course, when she returned from Paris, she ordered all paintings removed without thinking about it twice.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Jemma said respectfully a moment later, dropping into a curtsy. As she raised her head, she realized that the dowager had hardly changed. She was still tall, and although she leaned on a cane, it gave her no air of weakness. In fact, the cane seemed more like Villiers\u2019s sword stick: an affectation that could serve as a weapon.</p><p>She had Elijah\u2019s beauty, with sharp angles and sweeping lines. But on her the angles looked enraged, and what was calmness in his face was irritation in hers.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d her mother-in-law said. \u201cI am grateful that you returned from Paris.\u201d</p><p>That was an auspicious start.</p><p>\u201cWe must sit,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy hip is quite troublesome these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry to hear that,\u201d Jemma said, seating herself opposite the dowager. \u201cDid Elijah write you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know.\u201d There was something in the dowager\u2019s face, a version of the same dread that she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI knew the moment I heard that he fainted in Lords. You don\u2019t appear to be with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear not,\u201d Jemma replied, wincing inwardly.</p><p>\u201cThat is, there is a chance that I am with child, but I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Elijah\u2019s foolish second cousin will inherit after all. The man pads everything, you know, from his thighs to his chest. But he is, at least, a discreet creature. A foolish lust for admiration is better than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jemma said, not at all sure what she was agreeing with.</p><p>They sat for a moment in silence. \u201cI came to ask you something,\u201d the dowager said, her fingers twisting the diamond cornucopia she wore on her bosom. Her fingers were swollen with rheumatism, and Jemma felt a pulse of sorrow. She remembered her mother-in-law sweeping through the house like a whirlwind, her voice as stinging as smoke in the eyes. Back then the dowager had few wrinkles and her fingers were strong.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jemma said again. The dowager fixed her eyes on Jemma\u2019s face, and they were so identical to Elijah\u2019s, like a dark flame, that Jemma added, \u201cAnything you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d the dowager said heavily, \u201cno, I insist that you cease all marital relations and maintain separate chambers.\u201d Her face was at once both mournful and belligerent.</p><p>Jemma swallowed a gasp. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband was known as Bawdy Beaumont,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cWere you aware of that?\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe died in the very act, wearing a frilly lace chemise and tied to a bed,\u201d the duchess said. There was no particular rage in her voice as she recounted the facts. \u201cHe was attended by several women wearing leather who were engaged in spanking him. I gather he took pleasure in something children strive to avoid, which says a great deal about his character.\u201d</p><p>Jemma murmured something. Her mind was racing, wondering if she should assure the dowager that Elijah showed no interest in wearing a chemise.</p><p>But the dowager was continuing. \u201cHe was always a greedy man. One nightwalker wasn\u2019t enough; he had to have three or four. We did our best to keep the details a secret. I paid hundreds of pounds to the procuress in charge of The Palace of Salom\u00e9.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised her eyes to Jemma. \u201cI waited a year, and then I had her arrested. She was stripped and marched through London for prostitution, left in the stocks for a day, and then sent to Bridewell. She died a few months later.\u201d There was unmistakable satisfaction in her voice.</p><p>\u201cElijah has no interest in such practices,\u201d Jemma said, hurrying into speech before her mother-in-law could say anything else.</p><p>\u201cI brought him up to be virtuous,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t take.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t?\u201d Jemma said, dumbfounded. There wasn\u2019t a person in England who wouldn\u2019t say that the Duke of Beaumont was virtuous. And they didn\u2019t even know about the Cacky Street Glassworks.</p><p>The dowager duchess looked unblinking at her. \u201cI know why you left for Paris. My son inherited his father\u2019s deviant tendencies. It was good of you to return, and attempt to produce an heir. If I hadn\u2019t already had a son, I would have left the country as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s customary for a man to have a mistress,\u201d Jemma said desperately, hardly able to believe that she was defending Elijah, after all her years of resenting that same mistress. \u201cYour son has no interest in the more...exotic practices that the former duke enjoyed.\u201d</p><p>The dowager curled her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t care about a mistress any more than you would have. But he couldn\u2019t keep the woman discreet, as other men do. He brought the woman into public. His own offices.\u201d She straightened her back and said calmly, \u201cRevolting. I gather that my husband also enjoyed being watched on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah wasn\u2019t being watched!\u201d Jemma gasped. \u201cHe was only trying to prove that his tastes weren\u2019t as deviant as those of his father. He was very young, Your Grace. By engaging his mistress to meet him in his chambers, he proved to all those who knew that he enjoyed normal intimacies. There was nothing deviant about it.\u201d</p> <p>The smallest noise made her lift her eyes. Elijah was standing in the open doorway. His face looked terrifyingly calm.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you refrain from marital intimacies,\u201d the dowager said, her voice tired and irritated. \u201cIf Algernon Tobier inherits the Beaumont dukedom because the current duke drops on the floor of the House of Lords, it will be unremarkable. But if a second Beaumont dies in bed with a woman, even if that woman is his wife, we will never live down the reputation. The Bawdy Beaumonts will go down in history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you cannot choose the hour of your son\u2019s passing,\u201d Jemma said, her voice shaking, so shocked that she actually forgot Elijah was listening.</p><p>\u201cIf Elijah dies in my bed, in a pleasurable moment, that is something I would welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d the dowager said heavily. \u201cWe duchesses live on, you know. My husband took his dissolute, frivolous self to the grave, but he left me to live through the titters and the veiled comments. He left his son to weather the debacle. He made me a laughingstock, and my son will do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needn\u2019t worry about a son since we have no children,\u201d Jemma said. She was so caught by inarticulate anger that she couldn\u2019t continue.</p> <p>Finally Elijah stepped into the room. He bent down and kissed the hand his mother held out to him. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve heard our subject,\u201d she said, her voice calm. But her fingers were twisting on the diamonds she wore on her chest.</p><p>\u201cI see my responsibilities to the line rather differently than you do, Mother,\u201d he said, seating himself next to Jemma. \u201cMy wife and I shall continue to attempt to create an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t keep her face as fierce and still now that her son was sitting opposite her. Jemma saw that and her anger fled.</p><p>\u201cElijah\u2019s heart is stronger than his father\u2019s was,\u201d Jemma told his mother, speaking to the grief, and not to what the woman was saying. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve heard of a doctor in Birmingham who is having excellent results with a new medicine he\u2019s developed. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elijah put his hand over hers and she stopped. \u201cI shall be very sorry if I leave you ashamed of me in any way,\u201d he said to his mother.</p><p>The dowager\u2019s fingers were clenched over her diamond. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. I cannot. I shall depart for Aberdeen immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAt least spend the night.\u201d</p> <p>The dowager\u2019s eyes skated to hers. \u201cYou will inform me when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Jemma said gently, standing up and pulling Elijah to his feet as well.</p><p>The dowager stood, looking up at her son as if from the bottom of a well. \u201cYou were a beautiful baby.\u201d</p><p>Elijah held out his hand and she clung to it. \u201cAnd you have a beautiful smile,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have always had a beautiful smile.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt hot tears pressing in her eyes.</p><p>Elijah smiled his beautiful smile, as if his mother hadn\u2019t just said he was deviant, and bent to kiss her cheek. \u201cI may well live for years, Mother.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s eyes met Jemma\u2019s, and they both knew the truth. His mother closed her eyes for a long moment, her fingers tight on those diamonds.</p><p>\u201cI shall stay for luncheon,\u201d she announced, hunching a bit over her cane. \u201cThen I shall begin my journey.\u201d</p><p>They talked of nothing over the meal. The dowager was clumsy, her swollen fingers causing her to drop her fork repeatedly and knock a glass of wine to the table. But Jemma, watching, thought that it was a heavy heart that made her so awkward.</p><p>That night, Elijah came to her room. She held out her arms, and he came over to her, warm and hard, his hand sliding up beneath her nightdress. \u201cWe should talk,\u201d he murmured. But his hands were already setting her aflame.</p><p>Jemma realized that in truth, she\u2019d been waiting all day for this. In bed with her, Elijah\u2019s heart beat strong and true. She didn\u2019t have to worry.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she said, her hands sliding lower on his body.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d she said. And then his eyes were like dark flames, like his mother\u2019s, but she pushed that thought away and kissed her way down his chest. Her fear was gone, blissfully gone, because she could feel the blood pounding through his body.</p><p>He said something, scrambled and inarticulate, but he arched toward her and she laughed and opened her lips.</p><p>He was hers, and he was alive, and that was good enough for the moment.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>April 3</p><p>Jemma kept Elijah in bed most of the next day. In the early afternoon, they found themselves lying on their backs, panting, the sheets twisted around their legs.</p><p>\u201cI need a bath,\u201d Jemma said groggily. She felt drained and happy. She had one hand on Elijah\u2019s chest, and his heart was beating strong and true. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we repaired a clock,\u201d she said, changing the subject.</p><p>He had his arms thrown over his head and was smiling up at the tapestry hanging over the bed. \u201cMy heart can beat normally when it remembers to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make love every day,\u201d Jemma ordered.</p><p>\u201cTwice a day. Morning and night so that your heart remembers the correct pattern.\u201d</p><p>Elijah laughed. \u201cIf you tell your friends that plan, every man in the kingdom will be pretending to faint.\u201d He rolled to his side, propping his head on one hand. \u201cI heard what you said to my mother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to pull her mind back from that hot, happy place. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you guessed why Sarah Cobbett came to my chambers.\u201d</p><p>Jemma raised her head. \u201cSo that was the reason? I used to think that it was just a question of saving time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get anyone to believe that I wasn\u2019t sneaking off to The Palace of Salom\u00e9 in the evenings. God, I was sick of being called Bawdy Beaumont. There was always scorn to it, just under the surface. I knew they were making jokes about spankings behind my back.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma wound her fingers into his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even really want a mistress. Oh, I wanted to bed someone...at that age, all you see are women, and each one is succulent, and delicious in her own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought every woman you saw was \u2018succulent\u2019?\u201d Jemma asked, utterly fascinated.</p><p>\u201cThey had breasts,\u201d he said, as if that was all the explanation anyone could wish for. \u201cAnd other parts.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, imagining Elijah walking down the street peering at women\u2019s breasts. It seemed so unlike him.</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have time. I was so determined to mend my father\u2019s damage, to change the reputation attached to my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother shouldn\u2019t have told you,\u201d she said, sorrowing for the eight-year-old boy who was told those details far too early.</p><p>\u201cShe is obsessed with the reputation of the Beaumonts, as you heard. And, of course, it was much harder for her. She knew he had mistresses, but she had no idea about the storm of scandal that would break over her head when he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad luck that he died at that moment,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI used to think about it a lot as a boy, puzzling over it. Why the woman\u2019s chemise? Why the spanking? Finally I grew old enough to realize that eccentricities of an intimate sort can\u2019t be puzzled out and explained. It gave me a passion for logical facts,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It sounds like a terrible burden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I found Sarah Cobbett,\u201d he said, staring up at the tapestry. \u201cAt first I thought it was enough to have a mistress, but then I realized that no one cared what I did when I wasn\u2019t in my chambers or in the House. They just assumed I was wearing lacy gowns and begging my mistress to spank me. So one day I told her to come to my chambers instead.\u201d</p><p>Jemma ran circles over his chest with a finger. She didn\u2019t like thinking of Elijah with another woman. But she could hardly be jealous of Sarah, under the circumstances. And Elijah\u2019s heart still beat smoothly under her palm.</p><p>\u201cIt was terribly awkward,\u201d he said, turning his head so he could see her. \u201cThe desk was uncomfortable. She wasn\u2019t pleased, but what could she do? After a while she got used to it and so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. After a month or so, everyone knew. They all slapped me on the back and said they thought it was a marvelous idea. Everything calmed down. But I was cautious, and I still had Sarah come to my chambers twice a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we married,\u201d Jemma said, wondering if she should even voice it, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you let Sarah go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of her in those terms. That is, I didn\u2019t think of the two of you in the same way. You were charming and luscious and soft under the covers. I know we weren\u2019t terribly good together, but I thought about you a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at that. \u201cIf you remember, we made love every night. I found you horribly distracting. I would be trying to listen to a speech in the House, and I would start thinking about how soft your mouth was, or about the curve of your bottom, and I would lose track of the argument entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had made love that very morning,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThat was what hurt the most. You turned from me, as if I were nothing more than an hors d\u2019oeuvre, and then you took her.\u201d Despite her best effort, a thread of pain ran through her voice.</p><p>Elijah groaned. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything to make you feel better about it. I remember feeling sated by you. I didn\u2019t want to bed her. But at that age, if a woman lies in front of you with her legs spread, you can manage it, even if you are tired. How could I have explained to Sarah if I didn\u2019t continue? There she was, and it had become part of my responsibilities in the House. If that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>In a male sort of way, it did. After all, she and Elijah had hardly known each other when they married; the marital contracts had been signed by their fathers years before. She had been in love with him, but he had no reason to feel the same emotion for her.</p><p>Suddenly he rolled over on her, and she felt him against her leg, urgent and hard again. \u201cYou are the most succulent of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d But his hand was on her breast, a rough caress, and he didn\u2019t answer in words.</p><p>That morning they had spent hours making love. He had kissed her shoulder blades and the backs of her knees. He had kissed her eyebrows and the tips of her toes. Now he took her fast and hard, without preliminaries.</p><p>Jemma kept her eyes open, and watching his face, loving him, felt again like a young bride in love with her husband.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered. The heat was building in her legs, starting to cloud her mind and pull her into some other place, a place without fear.</p><p>Elijah cradled her face in his hands and said something hoarse that she couldn\u2019t hear, but she knew what it was because their love was there between them. It hardly needed to be said.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>April 4</p><p>Fowle entered the study and bowed before Jemma. \u201cThe Duke of Villiers regrets to tell you that his carriage has returned from Birmingham empty; the doctor has apparently moved to London but did not leave a forwarding address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might also add that Mr. Twiddy and his two daughters arrived this morning, and I dispatched them to the country estate, as you had instructed.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded. \u201cThank you, Fowle.\u201d</p><p>Jemma heard the news with no more reaction than a tightening around her eyes. He wrapped his arms around her and tried to warm her up. \u201cWe never expected the doctor to come to anything,\u201d he said, wishing she\u2019d never heard of him.</p><p>\u201cI want to read his article,\u201d she said, stepping out of the circle of his arms.</p><p>\u201cVilliers has it; I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was gone. Elijah gritted his teeth for a moment and returned to his work. He was cataloguing the estate: going through it item by item. If Jemma wasn\u2019t with child when his heart gave out, then his hairless, brainless second cousin would inherit. He needed everything to be as clear as possible.</p><p>An hour later, he was writing a letter, instructing his cousin in clear language about how to oversee crop rotation, when Jemma burst through the door.</p><p>\u201cI have the piece. The doctor\u2019s name is William Withering. I\u2019m going to hire a Bow Street Runner to find him.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cA runner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve already sent Fowle to fetch one. Withering\u2019s work is rather interesting, Elijah,\u201d she said, sitting in a chair opposite him and waving the sheets in the air. \u201cWithering extracted a medicine from a flower. If you take an overly large dose, it acts like a poison. But in small amounts, it seems to cause an irregular heart to change its pattern and...\u201d Her voice died out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah laid down his pen. \u201cHe extracts this poison from a flower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe market at Covent Garden!\u201d She jumped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThere must be many poisonous flowers that have medicinal properties.

I can\u2019t tell from that.\u201d</p> <p>But Elijah\u2019s tutors hadn\u2019t drilled him in Latin for naught. \u201cPurpurea,\u201d he said, \u201cmeans purple. And the flowers were purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jemma cried.</p><p>But Elijah stayed behind his desk. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to become hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not overly hopeful. I am determined. I will not sit by and simply wait for you to die next to me. I will not!\u201d</p><p>When they reached Covent Garden, the flower stalls were closed.</p> <p>\u201cThe market is open Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,\u201d their footman said, after making inquiries.</p><p>\u201cStay with the carriage,\u201d Elijah told him, walking after Jemma. She was moving through the stalls at top speed, heading for the place where the old man sold his flowers. He hadn\u2019t had a proper stall; he\u2019d simply put out a few buckets of flowers for sale.</p><p>He rounded a corner to find Jemma staring at the back wall where the man had sat. \u201cThere\u2019s his stool,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back on Saturday and find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three days.\u201d</p><p>Elijah didn\u2019t like the implication that he might not live three days, but he could hardly protest. Jemma turned in a slow circle and then set off, like an arrow free of its string.</p><p>He walked after her. The closed-up stalls of the market had a melancholy aspect, as if they had grown tired and shut their eyes for the night.</p> <p>Finally he saw where Jemma was going. She had spied one stall with an occupant and was bending over the counter, talking to a little old lady wrapped in woolens.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which gentleman I\u2019m referring to?\u201d he heard as he walked up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a gentleman!\u201d the woman said with a gentle string of giggles. \u201cThat\u2019s Stubbins. Ponder Stubbins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Could you possibly tell me how to find Mr. Stubbins?\u201d</p><p>She giggled again. \u201cIt does sound odd to hear a \u2018Mister\u2019 attached to Stubbins\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he live close to the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait for the market again. Just a few more days, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll be here with daffodils, oh so many daffodils. And tulips. Do you like tulips?\u201d she asked Elijah.</p><p>He bowed and said, \u201cGood afternoon, ma\u2019am. I do like tulips.\u201d Though in reality he hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what they were. Certainly his cook, Mrs. Tulip, had nothing flowery about her.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I tell you something. I\u2019m that old that I allow myself a leeway now and then! You look,\u201d she said, leaning on the counter, \u201cezactly like my idea of a duke.\u201d Giggles once again burst from her mouth. \u201cNow isn\u2019t that something for both of us to laugh about! As if a duke would be coming down to the flower market to find old Stubbins.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and she actually turned a little pink. \u201cMy saints, but you\u2019ve got a pretty face,\u201d she added. \u201cI always says to my husband that someday I\u2019ll meet a duke. It\u2019s our joke. The duke\u2019ll take me away, see, give me a carriage with gold wheels to it, and make me his beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does your husband say to that?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cHe says as how what he gives me is better than a gold wheel any day,\u201d she said, giggling madly. \u201cBut here, even as you\u2019re not a duke, you won\u2019t want to find Stubbins until the market opens. He lives in a bad area. I don\u2019t even go there unless I has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cSpitalfields. I can\u2019t see the two of you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were there less than a week ago,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cCould you give us his direction? Does he live anywhere around Cacky Street?\u201d</p><p>Her giggles stopped and she narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re missionary types, aren\u2019t you? I know your sort. You\u2019ll be trying to turn Stubbins into some sort of churchgoer and make him wear a hat and the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would make me a miracle worker, not a missionary,\u201d Elijah pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you know that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just want to find the doctor who uses Stubbins\u2019s flowers for medicine,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly urgent, so could you please help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubbins lives in Wiggo Lane,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find him there or behind the mews, most likely. That\u2019s where he grows all his stuff. I think he even sleeps there sometimes.\u201d She didn\u2019t look like laughing now. \u201cYou\u2019re from the Watch, aren\u2019t you? You jist look like a duke, but you\u2019re really the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Jemma protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to drag him off to the workhouse and it\u2019ll be my fault. I wish I\u2019d never told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never put Stubbins in the workhouse,\u201d Elijah said mildly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve nothing to do with the Watch. As it happens, I am a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never!\u201d</p><p>Elijah gave her an extravagant bow. \u201cThe Duke of Beaumont, at your service, madam. I would take you away with me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis gold wheels are just made of brass,\u201d Jemma said, taking his arm.</p><p>\u201cOh my, and isn\u2019t it just like a fairy tale,\u201d the flower seller said. \u201cThe duke and duchess, and you loves each other, just like a tale, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt her smile waver. \u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do ya have a carriage with gold wheels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I have a beautiful bride,\u201d Elijah said promptly.</p><p>They found Wiggo Lane without a problem. It was one of the narrow channels that led off Cacky Street, not far from the glassworks. In the afternoon, Spitalfields looked utterly different than it had in the morning. People were sitting on stoops, and children were dashing everywhere, howling and shrieking with laughter. Laundry was hanging out to dry, nothwithstanding the fact that smoke billowed onto the clean cloth from cook fires in the street.</p><p>Finding Stubbins wasn\u2019t as easy as finding the lane.</p><p>\u201cHe used to live here,\u201d one man said, giving their footman an extremely unfriendly look. Most other people wouldn\u2019t even answer, but just backed away or stared at the coach with grim dislike.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Elijah said, watching James approach a man who looked as if he might knock the footman down before he gave out any information. He leaned forward and called, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Cow Cross, James!\u201d</p><p>The door was unlocked, as usual, the hallway dim, and Knabby came toward them squinting. \u201cIt\u2019s the duke again,\u201d Elijah said, \u201cwith the duchess as well.\u201d</p><p>Knabby was clearly surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you again so soon! Everyone\u2019s in the courtyard.\u201d He turned around and started bustling away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find someone who lives in Spitalfields,\u201d Elijah said, but Knabby was already through the door to the courtyard.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly as lively this afternoon. \u201cCully\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Knabby announced. \u201cSophisba\u2019s husband took her away again, and Mrs. Nibble went to stay with her sister, as has a stomach ulcer.\u201d</p><p>After greeting everyone in the circle, Elijah said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find Ponder Stubbins, who lives in Spitalfields and raises flowers. Does anyone know him?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence. Then Waxy said, \u201c\u2019Course it is the duke.\u201d But it was clearly a struggle between Spitalfields loyalty and glassworks loyalty.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mean him any harm,\u201d Jemma put in. \u201cWe only want to find a doctor who buys his flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Knabby said, sounding very relieved. \u201cIn that case, Stubbins is just around the corner. He lives somewhere, maybe on Wiggo? But he\u2019s never there as his wife is a proper terror. He sleeps behind the mews in Fish Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. We are most grateful for your help.\u201d Elijah made the rounds of the circle again, shaking the wavering hands that were held out in his direction, and they left.</p><p>The mews were a two-story wooden structure. The ground-story rooms were occupied by horses, busily producing manure, which made it easy enough to find Stubbins. They had only to follow the smell. It was a particularly rich, brown type of smell, perhaps because the back of the mews faced east, and sun struck the manure piles all morning.</p><p>Stubbins had everything neatly arranged. To the left were flower beds, and to the right were fresh piles of dung.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d he said, leaning on a shovel. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Jemma asked, shocked. \u201cYou thought we\u2019d follow you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, ma\u2019am, but your husband here. I reckoned he was curious about the manure, and I was right wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he started showing Elijah his arrangements. \u201cIt can\u2019t be too hot. Fries the flowers, I suspect. So I rakes it here, and then I give it, oh, four or five days. Sometimes I pour fresh milk on it.\u201d</p><p>That would explain some of the pungency, Jemma thought.</p><p>\u201cThen I pile it over here and mix in a little o\u2019 that and a little something else. Then I plant my seeds.\u201d</p><p>He showed them the shack where he kept his seeds, and Elijah looked at everything gravely and asked just the right sort of questions, and Jemma knew exactly why the Cacky Street Glassworks was doing so well. It was Elijah. He was grave and compassionate, and so honorable that people longed to be near him.</p> <p>A few minutes later Elijah led Stubbins to the question of the doctor.</p><p>\u201cHe used to live in Birmingham,\u201d Stubbins confirmed. \u201cAnd then he went to one of them far-off countries, but it didn\u2019t do the doctor\u2019s lungs any good, so he\u2019s back in London now. He has rooms on Harley Street, I think. \u2019Course I never go there because he just sends a man to pick up my flowers.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s heart was pounding in her throat. \u201cIt is he,\u201d she said, clutching Elijah\u2019s hand. \u201cDr. Withering! He\u2019s the one, Elijah, he\u2019s the one!\u201d</p><p>A moment later they were back in the carriage and racing to Harley Street.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>April 4</p><p>\u201cGrindel\u2019s in Wapping does not appear to be known to the headmaster of St. Paul\u2019s,\u201d Ashmole said, appearing like a bird of prey in Villiers\u2019s study. \u201cIn fact, the headmaster believes there are no schools in Wapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word from Templeton?\u201d</p> <p>Ashmole\u2019s eyes glinted with the fascinated delight that servants always display when one of their own goes bad. Villiers had seen it before. There was nothing more carnivorous than a household that had discovered a maid with child.</p><p>The butler drew himself up to his full height\u2014approximately that of a twelve-year-old boy. \u201cMr. Templeton has vacated his premises.\u201d</p><p>Villiers generally prided himself on his lack of reaction to unpleasant news, but he surprised himself with a hearty Anglo-Saxon oath.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely, Your Grace,\u201d Ashmole said, bobbing his thin neck in a gesture of solidarity. \u201cThat bird has flown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always money.\u201d Ashmole hadn\u2019t been head of the duke\u2019s household for years for nothing. \u201cHow much did you give him?\u201d He cackled. \u201cShall I let the gardener go and tell Cook to economize in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose he could get at a great deal, but he certainly had means to feather his nest.\u201d He followed up with a few more oaths.</p><p>\u201cWe can have a Bow Street Runner after him,\u201d Ashmole said.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t get the money back.\u201d But there was something darker in the back of his mind. \u201cWhy now? Why did he run now, Ashmole? It must be something to do with the children.\u201d</p><p>The old man stared at him, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cThe devil take him,\u201d Villiers said. He\u2019d given Templeton far too much rein. \u201cGet a Runner after him, not for the money\u2014because I\u2019ll never get that back\u2014but because I want to know about those damned children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace. Shall I send a footman over to Wapping to locate the school and fetch the boy?\u201d</p><p>Villiers pulled out the list Templeton had sent him just before he decamped to parts unknown. \u201cWe\u2019ll just stick to the one problem at the moment. I\u2019ll go to Wapping. Fetch me a carriage. And I need to see both Plammel and Philaster this evening, whether they\u2019re free or not.\u201d Those two lyrical names belonged to the unlyrical men who handled his business affairs.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re still in London,\u201d Ashmole cackled.</p><p>Villiers gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here,\u201d the butler said grudgingly. \u201cTempleton wasn\u2019t a man to share his profits.\u201d</p><p>Villiers was in a carriage five minutes later. Generally, he spent at least a half-hour with his valet before leaving the house. Since he maintained the affectation of never wearing a wig, he demanded perfection in his hair, not to mention gleaming boots, a shirt the picture of snowy perfection...</p><p>Today he simply left the house.</p><p>What the hell had happened to the children?</p><p>The children, an obstinate little voice in the back of his mind reproached him, those same children whom you didn\u2019t care a fig for a month ago.</p><p>Yes, those children. Why had Templeton run? Mrs. Jobber was kind, and had obviously provided a good home. But then his eyes narrowed. Why didn\u2019t Mrs. Jobber have the other children? There were five more of them, after all. Why were they not placed together?</p><p>And what had happened two years ago, when Templeton had taken the oldest boy away to school? Villiers was quite certain that he\u2019d never delivered any edicts about school. He\u2019d avoided speaking or thinking about the children, in fact. He\u2019d never asked Templeton for a report, the way he did on his wheat fields, or his tenants.</p><p>Guilt was such a tiresome emotion.</p><p>The village of Wapping seemed to live on the River Thames. Other places had houses and perhaps a river to the side. In Wapping, everything started at the river, and then jumbled up the bank any old how. There was a charming breeze, smelling of mud and dying fish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door to the carriage opened. \u201cYour Grace, Ashmole suggested that we go to the church. Would you like me to make inquiries?\u201d</p><p>Villiers waved the footman on and sat back, door shut. He felt like a fool, peering out of his window, but Wapping was fascinating. It wasn\u2019t exactly poor\u2014it was too lively to be contained by that paltry adjective.</p><p>Just out his window was a great flight of stairs leading down to the Thames. It was thronged by a mess of boys, breeches rolled up, playing in the mud. Apparently the tide had covered the steps and then rolled back, leaving a thick coating.</p><p>Villiers watched them for a time and then leaned back against his seat. He and Elijah had once larked about in the river that used to run between their estates. He corrected himself. One ought to surmise that the river was still there and not refer to it in the past tense.</p> <p>Just because he never chose to visit his estate didn\u2019t mean that it had ceased to exist.</p><p>The footman opened the door again. \u201cThe priest is not in residence, but the sexton reports that he knows of no Grindel\u2019s School for Boys.\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cOut with it,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s apparently a dissolute man by the name of Elias Grindel, who runs a pack of five or six mudlarks. Orphans, the sexton thinks. But he can\u2019t be the man you\u2019re looking for, Your Grace, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get his direction?\u201d Villiers cut him off.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Villiers gestured for the door to be shut. He would find Templeton and have him thrown into the Clink to rot. The carriage trundled off again, stopping after a mere five minutes. He stepped out onto a street that fell away on one side, plunging down toward the river with all the abruptness of a sawed-off board. There were more steps, and more children.</p><p>Villiers felt disgust twist in his gut.</p><p>They weren\u2019t playing in the mud. They were mudlarks. Boys who scavenged in the mud and the sewers to recover whatever they could for sale. And his son, Juby or Tobias, was likely down there as well. Some bit of his ducal bloodline was down there larking around in the muck.</p><p>Though \u201clarking\u201d was an altogether too pleasant word.</p><p>Grindel, once Villiers located him in a dingy house facing the river, was as belligerent a man as his name would lead one to expect. \u201cI don\u2019t have no boy named Tobias, nor Juny either,\u201d he said, lower lip jutting out so he looked like an obstinate hedgehog.</p> <p>\u201cJuby,\u201d Villiers corrected him.</p><p>Grindel just glared. \u201cI ain\u2019t had no dealings with a man called Templeton. I don\u2019t run a school for boys. You have the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>Villiers swung his sword stick casually in front of him, as if it were a cane and he were testing its weight.</p><p>\u201cI hear there\u2019s another Grindel, down in Bagnigge Wells. Mayhap he\u2019s started a school for boys,\u201d the man offered.</p><p>Villiers twirled his sword stick in his hand. The sheath gleamed with the promise that the rapier inside was designed to inflict damage. Finally, he placed the point downwards, and it sank into the rotten wood at his feet.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAnd that was just the sheath.\u201d</p><p>Grindel\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI want the boy named Tobias, sometimes called Juby. I want you to send someone to get him, now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Grindel asked. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to slice my gizzard because I\u2019m not running a school for boys? I don\u2019t even like boys. I can\u2019t stand having them around me.\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked around the filthy room that Grindel had labeled his \u201cstudy.\u201d It was a study without books. In their place were warped wooden buckets, barrels, and wicker baskets. A bucket at Villiers\u2019s feet was brimming with buttons, all shapes. He could see the open top of a basket full of coal, and a large barrel that seemed to be half full of wood chips.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do for a living?\u201d he asked genially.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no call for you to show interest,\u201d Grindel said, not moving. He was short and sweaty, and wore a yellowed wig. Strands of greasy hair poking out from under the wig confirmed his remarkable indifference to cleanliness.</p><p>Villiers poked with his rapier at another basket, precariously balanced on the sideboard. It toppled, and out fell a cascade of teeth. Human teeth, Villiers thought. He took a step back as the teeth rattled to a halt around his toes.</p><p>\u201cI collect things,\u201d Grindel said. His face was a miracle of blandness. Villiers prided himself on maintaining an expressionless face, but he had clearly met his match. \u201cI\u2019d rather Your Grace didn\u2019t overturn more of my things. A man\u2019s home, so they say, is his castle.\u201d His insolence was in the open now. \u201cEven to those who consider themselves above the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud to call myself above collecting the teeth of dead men,\u201d Villiers said. He had poked off the top of another basket with his stick, and found it to hold a small collection of silver teaspoons. It was hard to tell through the muck, but many of them seemed to be engraved with initials or even a ducal crest. \u201cYou are planning to return these to their rightful owners, are you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s lost to the river is lost, and that\u2019s the waterman\u2019s law,\u201d Grindel said.</p><p>The door at Villiers\u2019s back opened and he moved to the side just in time to avoid being touched. He was already mourning the fact that he had chosen to wear the rose velvet coat again. It would be a miracle if he managed to leave Grindel\u2019s study without touching anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil do you want!\u201d Grindel roared, his eyebrows turning into a solid line across his forehead. Villiers allowed himself a small smile. It seemed that Mr. Grindel was not quite as indifferent as he appeared.</p><p>It was a small boy, quite thin. He stamped into the room without showing much fear and said, \u201cFillibet\u2019s cut his foot so badly that part of it hangs right off. Not the part with the toes, the bottom part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that to me?\u201d demanded Grindel. He turned to Villiers. \u201cI\u2019m friends with all the neighboring boys and they do come to me for advice.\u201d Then he turned back to the boy with a ferocious grin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about a wound, son. You\u2019ll have to take him to the surgeon.\u201d</p><p>The boy looked quickly at Villiers and then back at Grindel. \u201cYou said we shouldn\u2019t go to the surgeon anymores, but Juby says if you don\u2019t take Fillibet, he\u2019ll die, and the parish constable will take you up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me up for it?\u201d Grindel roared.</p><p>But the moment he heard the name Juby, Villiers had unsheathed his sword. Now the blade gleamed with a dull cruel brilliance as the tip just nudged Grindel\u2019s grimy Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>\u201cJuby says,\u201d Villiers repeated softly. \u201cIt seems you do know of a boy named Juby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows Juby,\u201d Grindel said. \u201cI never says as how I didn\u2019t know him. I said I didn\u2019t have a school for boys, and I didn\u2019t have no Juby living in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t live with him,\u201d said the boy, eyeing the sword with great interest. \u201cHe says we stink. We mostly sleep down by the river or sometimes up in the churchyard. Juby likes it up there.\u201d</p><p>Villiers put just a touch of pressure on his sword. \u201cI will ask you one more time,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAre you acquainted with Mr. Templeton?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might as have met him,\u201d Grindel said. The sword seemed sure to pierce his throat, especially when Grindel swallowed nervously. He added: \u201cHe sends me a boy now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing debauched! Nothing like that around here. There\u2019s them as has boys for shameful purposes, but I ain\u2019t one of those. I run a clean house and I\u2019ve always said so. You ask the Watch. They don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuby says that the Watch never does a thing to you because you give them coin for it,\u201d the boy said. He was clearly delighted by the unfolding drama.</p> <p>Villiers looked sideways at the boy. He had a miserable mouselike face, streaked in dirt. \u201cFetch Juby for me, would you?\u201d</p><p>The boy took off promptly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think what you want that boy for,\u201d Grindel said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameless, the way that you swells use boys for depraved purposes.\u201d</p><p>Villiers smiled, and then exerted just a trifle more pressure. Grindel\u2019s eyes bulged as the tip of the sword bit his skin. \u201cI\u2019m not the depraved one. No more surgeons? And how much money did you accept from Templeton for Juby\u2019s schooling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaught even a shilling!\u201d Grindel squealed. \u201cI takes boys as a bit of charity work. Because otherwise they\u2019d be in the poorhouse and the parish\u2019d have to pay for them. You can ask any of the parish constables hereabout. They know what work I do. I pay the boys fair and square for what they get too. I might give \u2019em as much as three pence a day. That\u2019s over a shilling a week.\u201d</p> <p>Villiers withdrew his sword so suddenly that Grindel nearly lost his balance.</p><p>A single drop of blood made its way down his throat, but Grindel didn\u2019t bother to swab it. \u201cI know your kind. You\u2019re having a charitable moment, aren\u2019t you? Thought you\u2019d come out here and rescue a poorhouse boy, make him into a decent citizen. I wish you luck with that. Juby is a born criminal with a mind like a sewer. He\u2019s as corrupt\u2014\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s smile seemed, unaccountably, to frighten Grindel into silence. \u201cI would expect no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Grindel demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis poorhouse boy? The born criminal with the mind like a sewer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe boy you insisted that you knew nothing of? The boy whom you clearly were forcing to work for you under merciless and cruel circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what you like.\u201d Grindel\u2019s jaw jutted out again. It resembled the jawbone of a wild animal.</p><p>\u201cMy son,\u201d Villiers said. He took out a beautifully embroidered handkerchief and delicately wiped the blood off the tip of the blade. With a shudder he dropped the cloth on Grindel\u2019s table. \u201cI expect you can get at least eight pence for this. That\u2019s Belgian lace.\u201d</p><p>Grindel didn\u2019t even spare it a glance. \u201cYour son?\u201d</p><p>Villiers dropped his sword back into its sheath. \u201cI\u2019m taking him, of course.\u201d Making a lightning-quick decision, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll be taking all the other boys as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a depraved son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own good,\u201d Villiers said sweetly. \u201cYou said yourself that you dislike boys. They\u2019re so messy underfoot. It would do you some good to go rooting in the mud; you might lose that belly of yours. It seems that you, at least, have had plenty to eat.\u201d</p><p>Grindel would have lunged from behind his desk, but he was afraid of the sword. Villiers saw it in his eyes, just as he saw the raw hatred trembling in his fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI might add that Templeton seems to have run off to a rat hole somewhere. If I find him, his next residence will be the Clink. For life, Mr. Grindel. For life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d he said, knocking over another basket with one swift kick. Coals rolled across the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat a mess. I apologize for my clumsiness.\u201d In short order he upended four or five more.</p><p>The floor was littered with chunks of coal. They cracked under the feet of the boy who entered.</p><p>He was indescribably dirty. And there was a smell. But Villiers took one look at the boy\u2019s nose and his lower lip and knew. The facial details weren\u2019t even important: it was in his walk, and the unyielding tilt of his chin. Juby walked straight over to the desk and cast a cold eye on Grindel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for Fillibet to go to the doctor,\u201d he said, \u201cor I\u2019ll have the constables on you, you fat sodding excuse for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Definitely his son, albeit with a greater concern for humanity than he had ever managed to summon up.</p><p>Villiers just watched for a moment. Juby was so thin that he would give Ashmole a run for his money as the resident vulture. But his shoulders were held back firmly. Villiers could see the wings of them, poking through his ragged shirt.</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>The boy gave him a look out of thick-lashed eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sword stick?\u201d he demanded, by way of greeting. \u201cToad said that a nob was here and about to cut the throat of this disgusting grubber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you, watch who you\u2019re calling names,\u201d Grindel said, glowering at him. His fingers were twitching as if he longed to deliver a blow across the table.</p><p>The boy laughed at that\u2014and in his laughter was the final evidence, if Villiers needed it. Grindel actually flinched at the sound.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dare strike me again, Grindel, remember?\u201d His face was positively alight with glee. \u201cAfter what happened last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d Grindel said, spitting on the floor. \u201cThe city is full of lads who\u2019d be more than glad of my rates and my hospitality, as any of the boys will tell you. I\u2019m known for my fairness, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking all of them,\u201d Villiers said again, speaking for the first time since Juby had entered the room.</p><p>\u201cFetch all his boys,\u201d he said, meeting his son\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you to say so?\u201d the boy asked, jutting out his jaw precisely the way Grindel did.</p><p>Grindel barked with laughter. \u201cYou got more than you bargained for there!\u201d he said, his voice suddenly buoyant.</p><p>The boy slanted another glance at Villiers from under his thick lashes. \u201cWhat do you want us for?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not good for much. And you don\u2019t look like the type to be looking for an apprentice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019d like to be?\u201d Villiers felt as if he were operating outside his own body, watching himself speak to this boy who was a shadow of himself, a weedy, nasty, evil-tempered version of Leopold Dautry, Duke of Villiers. The only real difference being that he himself was muscled rather than skinny.</p><p>But the boy wasn\u2019t going to give an inch. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got nothing you would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me, son,\u201d Grindel said, chuckling like a maniac. \u201cI\u2019ll treat you right. I\u2019ll even pay for Fillibet\u2019s doctor if you ask me pretty-like.\u201d</p><p>Villiers found himself in the unusual position of being unsure of what to say.</p><p>\u201cI forgot Fillibet,\u201d the boy exclaimed, turning around. He jerked his chin at the smaller lad, who was waiting outside the door. \u201cFetch all the boys.\u201d The child ran.</p><p>Then he turned back to Villiers. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of those with a taste for the nasty, you will regret the moment you met me.\u201d His eyes were as cold as a November rainfall. Villiers knew those eyes; he saw them reflected in his glass every morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe don\u2019t want that,\u201d Grindel said, hooting. \u201cAin\u2019t you gonna tell him, then, Duke?\u201d</p><p>Villiers cast him a glance and Grindel shut his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my son,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home. I\u2019ll send the others where they\u2019ll be clean and well-cared for.\u201d</p><p>Tobias didn\u2019t say a word. Villiers felt a creeping amusement, and, to his surprise, even a streak of pride. He couldn\u2019t have known what to expect in response to that announcement, but he would have loathed an excited shriek of \u201cPapa!\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Tobias silently looked at Villiers\u2019s white-streaked hair, then at his rose-colored coat. His eyes lingered on the elaborate embroidery of yellow roses around the buttonholes, slid lower to his perfectly-fitted pantaloons, then to his boots, now slightly scuffed from toppling Grindel\u2019s baskets.</p><p>Tobias\u2019s glance might have shown some approval of his sword stick, but it wasn\u2019t hard to read the utter distaste in his eyes for the rest.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain of your claim?\u201d he said finally, as proud as if any man would be lucky to claim a filthy, odiferous boy nicknamed Juby as his offspring.</p><p>One might not wish for an exuberant display of filial excitement, but rank disappointment wasn\u2019t what Villiers would have envisioned either.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Grindel cut in. \u201cYou\u2019re the spitting image of the bloody-minded bastard, and it\u2019s bastard you\u2019ll be called from now on, and rightly so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter the bastard of a duke than a bastard by nature,\u201d Villiers said. He kicked a surfeit of teeth and buttons from under his feet and strode over to the desk. The family reunion was over, and he had one final piece of business to attend to.</p><p>Grindel inched back in his greasy chair.</p><p>\u201cMy son has a bruise under his eye,\u201d Villiers said. For the first time he heard his own voice\u2014its measured\u2014cold tones, and knew it to be a more mature version of that which he\u2019d just heard. He had passed on his most useful trait.</p><p>\u201cCould be he got in a tussle with the boys,\u201d Grindel said, slanting an eye toward Tobias. Grindel knew as well as Villiers did that the boy would never tattle about an injury. He wasn\u2019t the type.</p><p>Villiers sighed inwardly. His gloves were immaculate, or at least they had been that morning...</p><p>Grindel went over in a crash, taking two more baskets with him to the floor. He let out a squeal like a stuck pig from behind his desk. A final basket teetered, then tipped to its side. A torrent of silver spoons poured forth, the fruit of the boys\u2019 labors in the river and sewers.</p> <p>When he turned about, the door was thronged with boys. Five, maybe six of them, staring silently. They were as dirty as newly-pulled radishes and their thin legs were marked with scars.</p><p>Grindel groaned from the floor but didn\u2019t seem disposed to move.</p><p>\u201cSomeone take that basket and pick up all those spoons,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThere\u2019s another collection of spoons on the floor there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the silver buttons,\u201d Tobias said, without even the slightest flicker of an eyelash to show appreciation for the blow to Grindel.</p><p>\u201cTake them,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay for apprenticeships for you lot,\u201d he told the boys.</p><p>They didn\u2019t seem to understand, but Tobias scooped the spoons back into their basket with a few swift movements and thrust them at a boy. \u201cGo!\u201d The other basket of spoons, a box of silver buttons, and a third box with a lid, were out of the room before Grindel managed to lumber to his feet. \u201cHere you!\u201d he roared. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me stuff?\u201d</p><p>To Villiers\u2019s satisfaction, Grindel\u2019s right eye was fast swelling shut. \u201cYou\u2019re thieving from me! You\u2019re nothing more than a fleagler, duke or no. I\u2019ll have the constables on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort,\u201d Villiers said softly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find some other way to make a living. I\u2019ll be watching, and if I ever hear that a boy has set foot on these premises again, I\u2019ll have it burned down. With or without you,\u201d he added dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cI see the resemblance,\u201d Grindel spat.</p><p>\u201cYou do me an honor,\u201d Villiers said. Then he said, \u201cThat last was for my son. This one is for the rest of them.\u201d And his fist smashed into Grindel\u2019s other eye. Over he went, and this time Villiers strode out without pausing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the injured boy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tobias gestured toward a boy lying on the side of the street. Blood was running sullenly from a dirty cloth wound around his foot.</p><p>Villiers jerked his chin at the groom standing by his carriage. \u201cPick up this boy and carry him to the nearest surgeon. Then get a hackney and take him to Mrs. Jobber, in Whitechapel. The coachman knows the street.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to the five remaining boys. Tobias stood in front of them, shoulders back, chin raised. He had a defiant look in his eye.</p><p>Villiers gestured at one of his footmen. \u201cFind a hackney and take this lot to Mrs. Jobber. Get the address from the coachman. Beg my forgiveness, but ask her to wash and clothe them, as best she can. I\u2019ll set Ashmole to finding an appropriate school for them immediately. And give these to Mrs. Jobber.\u201d He gave him a handful of guineas.</p><p>\u201cA school,\u201d one of the boys muttered, his eyes bugging out.</p><p>Tobias seemed to relax a bit. \u201cWe\u2019ll do well there,\u201d he said. Adding, rather reluctantly, \u201csir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a sir,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou may address me as Your Grace.\u201d He sounded like a pompous fool. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to Mrs. Jobber\u2019s house, Tobias. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Tobias\u2019s face didn\u2019t change even a whit. \u201cNo. And my name is Juby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is Tobias. You are my son, and you\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will live with Mrs. Jobber. I will not live with you.\u201d His lip curled. The boys were watching, slackjawed.</p><p>Villiers thought for a moment about the advisability of designating Tobias to his remaining footman. It pained him to think of all that mud\u2014to give it a charitable label\u2014in his coach. But a hackney and a footman didn\u2019t seem right. It would put Tobias in the wrong footing in the household, though he\u2019d be damned if he knew what that footing should be.</p><p>\u201cYou will enter the carriage now,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing for it. His gloves were already a dead loss, and now the rose-colored coat was going the same way. With one economical movement Villiers picked up the boy and slung him over his shoulder.</p><p>The footman whipped open the carriage door, and Villiers tossed him in. Then he followed, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>The boy pulled himself upright instantly and sat there, uncompromising eyes fixed on Villiers\u2019s face.</p><p>Villiers saw no reason to continue the conversation. He sat down opposite and peeled off his ruined gloves.</p><p>There were two things going through his mind. One was the wretched realization that he had five children left to find. And the second was that he needed a wife.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Perhaps a woman would know how to talk to a younger version of himself. He certainly didn\u2019t.</p><p>He needed a wife today, or tomorrow at the latest.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Dr. William Withering had a terrible cough. Elijah and Jemma entered his anteroom only to hear, from the inner chamber, the truly distressing sounds of someone gasping and coughing at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe doctor is dying,\u201d Jemma cried with some alarm.</p><p>Elijah had jumped to the conclusion that a patient was in his last throes, but he thought it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to mention it. Jemma had that still, terrified look about her eyes that only really left her when they were making love.</p><p>He himself felt strangely happy. Ever since they\u2019d made love in Apollo\u2019s garden, he was at peace with his future, no matter how short. He escorted Jemma to a chair and then sat down himself.</p><p>She picked up a published article lying on the table and began to read. \u201cHe\u2019s experimenting with Jamaica pepper as a cure for lung problems,\u201d she said a few moments later.</p> <p>Dr. Withering appeared before Elijah could reply. He was a tall man with vivid bushy eyebrows that contrasted sharply with the tight curls of his powdered wig. His eyes glittered under the eyebrows, as if he were thinking fiercely, or suffering from a fever. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, bowing. And then, seeing Jemma, he bowed again, even more deeply. \u201cAnd Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to consult with you about your work with Digitalis purpurea,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes brightened even more, if that were possible. \u201cA fascinating subject! I have cause for reasonable optimism in my research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a heart ailment,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI should like a consultation with you, sir, if you can spare the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if you came to my inner chamber so I can examine you thoroughly. The heart is a complicated organ, and I\u2019m afraid that Digitalis purpurea\u2014 or foxglove, as it\u2019s commonly called\u2014has a narrow range of applications. Though I have a colleague who is...\u201d</p> <p>His voice trailed away as he led Elijah through a door. He had not given Jemma a second glance after establishing that he had a patient who required his attention.</p><p>Jemma removed her pelisse and bonnet and sat down again. She was quite alone, for the first time since she had learned of Elijah\u2019s illness.</p><p>Her mind skittered over the fact that should he die, she would be alone a great deal of the time, and she forced herself to stop thinking of it.</p><p>She had never been in a doctor\u2019s chambers before. (If medical attention were needed, the doctor always came to her, as was proper.) One entire wall of Withering\u2019s antechamber was taken up by a massive walnut cabinet, comprised of hundreds of small drawers. Some were pulled open and others closed, so the whole presented a chaotic appearance, as if it were a messy pile of blocks stacked by a child.</p><p>She got up and walked over, thinking an upright posture might make it easier to breathe. Each drawer was labeled in a quick hand, as if the writer hadn\u2019t taken time to shape the letters. Some of the contents had straightforward medicinal uses. A drawer marked LAUDANUM was filled with little vials, as she discovered by pulling it open and peeping inside. TOAD STONE read another. She gingerly opened it to find a small pile of pebbles.</p><p>BLACKB FEATH turned out to contain two dusty blackbird feathers, and RIVER WATER had a number of little vials. Some had only a drop or two inside, and others had dried up altogether.</p> <p>Numbly, she made herself look in more drawers. Many were full of powdery leaves. MUSTARD PLANT made her sneeze just by opening the drawer, and eventually she wandered back to her seat.</p><p>It was as if the clock had stopped moving. She sat in the dusty silence, watching the sun move across a harpsichord which occupied one part of the room. One had to suppose that the doctor was a musician.</p><p>Ordinarily, she was never bored. During idle moments, she would simply replay a chess game in her head, correcting herself or her opponent. But now she couldn\u2019t keep the board\u2019s construction in mind, and lost track of the play between the seventh and eighth moves.</p><p>She tried to read the doctor\u2019s treatise on the uses of Jamaica pepper, but found it hopelessly obtuse. The minutes ticked by. Finally she borrowed peppercorns and white allspice from their respective drawers in the specimen cabinet and set up her own makeshift chessboard.</p><p>She had just realized that she had completely missed a move by a White Knight that would win the Black Queen when Elijah and Dr. Withering came back into the room. She leapt to her feet. \u201cAre you able to help him?\u201d she demanded, without bothering with courtesies.</p><p>The doctor abruptly fell into a series of racking coughs, so deep that he bent from the waist.</p><p>\u201cThere is a possible treatment,\u201d Elijah said, taking her hands. But the look in his eyes made her smile die.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Possible\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFoxglove might help,\u201d the doctor said, having recovered himself. \u201cBut the consequences for failure are grave, and unfortunately, as I have explained to him, I must decline to treat His Grace.\u201d</p><p>Jemma paled and her hands tightened. \u201cBecause it\u2019s poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Withering has experienced some remarkable results,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cBut he is at the initial stages of his research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe possibility of giving someone an overly powerful dose is likely. I have advised His Grace not to attempt this remedy.\u201d The doctor bowed, obviously expecting them to leave his chambers immediately.</p><p>Jemma looked up into Elijah\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say this, Jemma. The doctor has seen many heart patients, and he is not sanguine about the time I may have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart is thready and irregular,\u201d Withering put in. \u201cBut I must emphasize that no one can tell the span of a person\u2019s life. I\u2019ve had heart patients whom I considered to be at death\u2019s door linger for months, even years.\u201d</p><p>But she could read the truth in his eyes...He didn\u2019t think Elijah would be one who lingered.</p><p>Jemma dropped Elijah\u2019s hands and said to the doctor, \u201cYour medicine has worked for some people, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has. But I have\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI have had a number of failures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that patients have died as a result of the foxglove?\u201d Jemma was not in a mood for euphemisms.</p><p>\u201cThey would have died in any case, from either dropsy or an irregular heartbeat,\u201d Dr. Withering said somewhat defensively.</p><p>Elijah moved behind Jemma and put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cThe duchess does not mean to imply any negligence on your part, Dr. Withering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is hard for a layman to understand the mysteries of science,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI am drawing closer to understanding correct dosages. I recently discovered that the leaves, once powdered, are twice as potent as the flowers. And the other day I made the serendipitous discovery that boiling that powder renders the effect fourfold as powerful.\u201d</p><p>Jemma could interpret that comment. Some unlucky patient\u2019s death proved the potency of his boiled medicine. \u201cHow did you discover the properties of foxglove?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI advised a patient of mine that there was nothing more I could do for him,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cHe was as swollen as a ripe plum, and I\u2019d tried everything I knew to cure his dropsy. He didn\u2019t agree with my assessment, and made his way to an old Gypsy woman known for her healing arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Gypsy!\u201d</p><p>Withering nodded. \u201cShe gave him a potion, and the symptoms of dropsy went away. Even more interestingly, his heart steadied. The moment I heard about it, I went around to find her, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the drink was made from foxglove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were some twenty herbs in the potion,\u201d Withering said with a trace of pride in his voice. \u201cIt took me nearly a year to narrow my study to foxglove, and then to begin to understand the remarkable qualities of this plant. It seems to have the ability to cure tumultuous action on the part of the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTumultuous action?\u201d Jemma asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cIrregularities,\u201d Withering explained. \u201cSkipped beats. Just as it soothes an overly rapid heartbeat, it also speeds up an overly slow one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe must find the Gypsy,\u201d Jemma said, picking up her bonnet.</p><p>Elijah laughed\u2014he actually laughed. \u201cIf we find the Gypsy and I drink the potion, I would need to keep taking it. Do I spend the rest of my life chasing a Gypsy down country lanes? She\u2019s a traveler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have a life in which to chase her, Elijah!\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her, and there was something in his eyes...She turned to Withering. Not many people could withstand Jemma at her most formidable, and the doctor wasn\u2019t one of them. He actually flinched. \u201cIn your opinion, does my husband have insufficient time to find this Gypsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not advise travel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI asked you a question,\u201d she said steadily.</p><p>The doctor fidgeted and then said: \u201cIn my opinion, your husband does not have much time.\u201d</p><p>Elijah intervened. \u201cMy heart lost its rhythm repeatedly in the time that Dr. Withering was listening to my chest, Jemma. Of course, I was lying flat, and that\u2019s the worst possible position.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. It seemed that Elijah had only a few days to live. She turned to the doctor again. \u201cHave any of your patients survived, or only the Gypsy\u2019s patient?\u201d</p><p>He bridled a little. \u201cI would not keep working with foxglove had I not had successes. There are a number of people, a significant number, who are thriving.\u201d He saw the look in her eye. \u201cBut I cannot give it to the duke. It\u2019s far too dangerous. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thoroughly understand. You have been experimenting with the poor,\u201d Jemma said, stepping closer to him. \u201cYou have been choosing your patients in Spitalfields, and who\u2019s to argue when they die in your chambers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the benefit of science,\u201d he said with a sort of gasp. \u201cThey come to me desperate. No one else can help them. I have done considerable service with the poor. I don\u2019t merely treat heart ailments: I have done my best with everything from dropsy to scrofula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a duke of the realm is a different proposition,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou must see that I am simply not at a stage in my research at which I can sufficiently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will give the medicine to my husband in the morning,\u201d Jemma stated. \u201cI will not allow him to die when there is a possible remedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy last patient expired,\u201d Withering gibbered.</p><p>\u201cWithin an hour of trying the remedy. It\u2019s too strong, you see. Boiling the powder gave it the power that I needed, but it went too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t go too far tomorrow morning,\u201d Jemma said grimly. \u201cPerhaps you can spend the night calibrating the proper amount by reconsidering the case of your lost patient. We shall be here at eight of the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot!\u201d Withering cried. \u201cI cannot! You do not understand, Your Grace! If the duke were to die here, in my chambers, I would be hanged. They wouldn\u2019t listen to me. And my work\u2014my work!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not right!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cHis work is important. He has lost some patients, but his discoveries seem to me critically important. If we were to force him to give me the medicine, and I were to die, he would be hanged, merely because I am a duke.\u201d He said it flatly. \u201cI cannot allow a man to be hanged on my behalf, Jemma, nor stop research that has the potential to help so many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that!\u201d she half screamed at him.</p><p>His face was like stone. \u201cI cannot be other than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so bloody good! Think of yourself for once, Elijah! Don\u2019t you want to live? Don\u2019t you want to stay here? What if I am carrying a child? What if\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked and she half turned from him.</p><p>\u201cI would give anything to stay with you.\u201d He took her shoulders in his hands, gripping her so hard that it hurt. \u201cI would give my dukedom, every penny I ever had, my right arm, to stay with you. To stay with our child if we have one. How could you even ask?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his beautiful dark eyes. \u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy money, my dukedom, my right arm, Jemma. But not another man\u2019s life and his work. Even if I were to somehow arrange it so Withering were exonerated, he couldn\u2019t continue his work. I would give anything that is mine to stay in the world. Anything!\u201d</p><p>His face twisted, and she knew\u2014knew with her deepest heart\u2014that he meant it. \u201cI cannot risk another man\u2019s life to save my own,\u201d he said, and in his eyes, despair warred with honor.</p><p>She could love Elijah for who he was, or she could wish that she\u2019d married another man altogether. \u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered, falling into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Withering said helplessly. \u201cIn another six months I believe I will have a much better understanding of the properties of the drug.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s mind reeled like that of a drunkard. \u201cI can\u2019t let you die,\u201d she said into Elijah\u2019s coat.</p><p>His arms tightened around her but he said nothing. She could feel his lips on her hair. It was over. They would go home, and tonight, or tomorrow morning, soon, too soon, Elijah would leave her.</p><p>She straightened, and pulled away from his arms, turning back to Withering. \u201cWhat are the symptoms of a patient dying of an overly potent dose of your medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe becomes nauseated and vomits,\u201d Withering said. \u201cHe sees auras, lights around ordinary objects. The end comes very quickly thereafter.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI will thank you to write down in detail the amount of boiled powder that you gave the man who recently died. We shall take the details with us along with the medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t allow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will know. Our entire household is well aware of the duke\u2019s heart ailment. He and I shall be alone tonight. Should the worst ensue, everyone will assume that the duke\u2019s heart has given out, which will be, in fact, the case. I will never say a word to anyone.\u201d She held Withering\u2019s eye. \u201cI do not ever tell untruths. I say to you now: I will not betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only I had six months!\u201d Withering cried, wringing his hands.</p><p>\u201cMight you perhaps gather some notes in case we decide to try this remedy?\u201d Elijah said to the doctor.</p><p>Withering looked at him blindly. \u201cI wish you had not found your way to my chambers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cbut Elijah is as well-known to the poor in Spitalfields as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, will you give us a moment alone?\u201d Elijah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write it down, but I don\u2019t approve; I don\u2019t approve!\u201d The doctor trotted from the room, still wringing his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re determined, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Elijah asked Jemma.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s your only chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if, in years hence, you come to doubt your actions?\u201d</p><p>She was so frustrated that she actually reached out and tried to shake him, except that he was so large as to be unshakable. \u201cWe\u2019re both in this marriage, Elijah! You and I are both here. I will be with you. You don\u2019t have to make all the decisions yourself. Please!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that you are making this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule number three of marriage,\u201d she said, \u201cis never to allow an ocean to come between us again.

Fowle had a meal waiting, so they ate. She felt curiously observant. The fish tasted of the sea. There were pickled peaches that tickled her tongue with the memory of summer.</p><p>Her lips kept parting, as if she had something to say to Elijah, and then closing again, stiffly, the words unsaid.</p><p>At last the meal was finished. She heard Elijah telling Fowle, as if from a long way off, that they would retire early. And then he asked for a bath.</p><p>Jemma knew what he was doing. Elijah would not want to put his servants to the work of washing his dead body. He would prepare himself.</p><p>She walked upstairs and felt their decision burning fiercely in her heart.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I should drink half a vial,\u201d Elijah said on entering her chamber following his bath. He was wearing a dressing gown, and had brought a small brandy glass with him.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Withering give his last patient a full vial?\u201d They had read the doctor\u2019s scrawled description in the carriage.</p><p>Elijah nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t we start with a quarter vial?\u201d Jemma suggested. \u201cIf it has no effect, you could take another quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems reasonable,\u201d Elijah agreed. He poured a quarter of the vial\u2019s contents into the glass. The concoction looked cloudy, and seemed innocuous. Jemma found herself wishing desperately that there were more ingredients\u2014perhaps a magic feather, or a touch of dew. It seemed preposterous to entrust one\u2019s continued existence to a single flower.</p><p>Elijah set the glass carefully on the mantelpiece and then pulled her into his arms. \u201cI am fortunate to have loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are fortunate. I am just so sorry that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand gently covered her mouth. \u201cWe have already made our apologies for the time we lost.\u201d Then he cupped her face, his strong fingers gentle on her cheeks, and looked into her eyes before bending his head. They spoke to each other in that last kiss. Jemma tried to give him a lifetime\u2019s worth of love and devotion. She felt the same fierce love burning in his tender touch.</p> <p>Too soon, he pulled back. \u201cYou may feel nauseated, but you will not die,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t allow it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a duchess,\u201d she said, not even smiling.</p><p>He kissed her again, fleetingly but so sweetly that her heart would have broken except that it had turned to something strong and like stone. Wordlessly, he emptied the glass.</p><p>They sat down together to wait. Jemma kept a hand on his chest. Two or three times she began to hope, and then would feel a double beat or a missed stroke.</p><p>\u201cI think I should take another quarter vial,\u201d Elijah said ten minutes later. \u201cWithering\u2019s patient, the one who took a full vial, is described as a plump man. Unless he was very tall, I am quite likely to weigh more than he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not plump,\u201d Jemma protested.</p><p>\u201cMuscle is heavier than fat,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI\u2019ve observed it among pugilists. A fat man weighs less than a muscular man of the same size.\u201d</p><p>He poured another quarter vial into the brandy glass and drank it before she could protest again.</p><p>Almost immediately he said, \u201cI am faintly queasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNausea is good,\u201d Jemma said quickly. \u201cIt shows the medicine is working. Do you see any circles around this candle?\u201d She ran to the mantel and snatched one up.</p><p>\u201cWho can tell?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cA candle has a natural aura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, look at my head then,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cNo, look at me! Do you see light around my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to find out if you have angelic status?\u201d he inquired, his mouth quirking up in a smile. He squinted at her. \u201cYes! I see feathery wings as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you make fun at a time like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t laugh in the face of death, when can you laugh?\u201d Then he added, casually, \u201cMy heart feels quite steady.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak, just put her head against the chest that housed that wonderful, regularly beating heart. A second passed, and another, and another. It continued to beat steadily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not skipping,\u201d she said, awestruck.</p><p>\u201cThe foxglove has forced it into a normal rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like making love to you. Medicine in a bottle instead of a bed.\u201d</p><p>Jemma chewed her lip. \u201cHow will we know when you should drink more? We forgot to ask.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and stretched. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to test it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, the wicked lively grin of a man without fear. \u201cI have to exhaust myself. Drive my heartbeat up.\u201d</p><p>Jemma backed away, shaking her head. \u201cNo, Elijah, I don\u2019t think that\u2014\u201d But he seized her. She managed to say, \u201cOnly if you allow me to feel your heart whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tire myself out making love to you. And then I shall drink a glass of cognac and lie flat on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too risky.\u201d</p><p>But he had her on the bed, her own great warm beast of a man, pushing her flat, kissing her. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Feel.\u201d And he pressed her hand to his chest.</p><p>There, under her hand, was the most wonderful miracle of all: Elijah\u2019s heart was beating strongly, steadily, as if it had never missed a beat in its life, and they hadn\u2019t even begun to make love.</p><p>Tears came to her eyes. \u201cOh, Elijah...\u201d</p><p>But the tears couldn\u2019t fall because his hands\u2014his lips\u2014he was everywhere. He had no shame.</p><p>At some point in the evening, after the household was in bed, they wandered down to the library. Jemma\u2019s hair was down her back and she was wearing only her nightdress, with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders.</p><p>Elijah poured himself a great glass of cognac. And then he poured one for her, since he didn\u2019t feel like drinking alone.</p><p>The warmth of the cognac seeped to her toes, but she kept walking around the room, unable to settle down. \u201cWe have to send a note to your mother first thing in the morning,\u201d she said, chattering. \u201cAnd Villiers, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd Dr. Withering,\u201d Elijah put in. He was lying on the floor, just as he had threatened to do.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your heart?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled and drank more cognac.</p><p>She came and stood over him. \u201cDrink faster. This can\u2019t be considered a proper test unless you are tipsy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said, and his voice sounded so sleepy that she thought he meant to return to bed. His hand wrapped around her ankle and gave a gentle tug. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Elijah...\u201d But she came to her knees beside him. His kiss was more joyful than desperate, more honey than lust. It banished her fears, replacing them with something stronger: faith that her husband would live.</p><p>Slowly those kisses changed to something else and fire crept up the back of her legs. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this again,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cO ye of little faith!\u201d He laughed at her, and sure enough the evidence of his ability was more than obvious. \u201cOf course, I must remain on my back. Exhaust me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Jemma shifted, moving to hover over him, allowing him to stroke her. Then with one powerful thrust of his hips, he lunged upward. A cry broke from her lips.</p> <p>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d Elijah gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma whispered. \u201cDo it again\u2014Oh!\u201d</p><p>She tried leaning forward and leaning back. She tried teasing him, and teasing herself. She let him kiss her breasts, and then sat back again so she could do some caressing of her own.</p><p>Finally she found herself beginning to shudder, driven to ride him with a steady, pounding beat. \u201cBeg me,\u201d she said, nipping his bottom lip with her teeth. \u201cBeg me to go faster, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her hips. \u201cI love it when you growl at me.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her knees and teased him by withdrawing. \u201cBeg me.\u201d She slid downwards with a wanton twist of her hips.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014never\u2014beg,\u201d Elijah gasped.</p><p>Jemma would have laughed, but she had to concentrate to keep desire from overwhelming her. She drove him mercilessly, dancing to the brink and then stopping just before he toppled into pure pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He spoke through clenched teeth, his body bowed in an effort to force her compliance.</p><p>\u201cAre you begging now?\u201d she asked, pushing his hips down so that a hoarse gasp came from his throat\u2014and then sliding away just as easily.</p><p>\u201cNo. Begging is shameful and you won\u2019t\u2014\u201d His voice broke off because she was reaching behind to caress him. \u201cGod,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cJemma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d she said, moving so slowly that her nerves danced with fire. Every inch of her body longed to drive him home, to ride him as fiercely as she was able.</p><p>But in a marriage, a true marriage, she couldn\u2019t be the only one who knew how to beg.</p><p>He was gasping now, his muscled chest heaving, but she was relentless, using her body, her fingers, her lips to drive him mad. Finally, reluctantly, he threw back his head and a guttural moan came from his throat. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p> <p>Before she could even react, as if the very hint of submission was too shameful to bear, he lunged up, flipping her over and driving deep. She clutched him desperately, gasping in his ear: \u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d</p><p>Elijah braced his hands on the floor and stroked forward with a primitive force that made her shriek. \u201cSay it,\u201d he said, between clenched teeth. \u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI love you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>They fell together into a place where there were only their two bodies, and their two hearts.</p><p>Beating together.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>April 5</p><p>Villiers couldn\u2019t sleep. He kept thinking about that boy up in the nursery. If you could call him a boy. And then there was Elijah. Was he still alive? Surely he would have heard if Elijah had died.</p><p>He rose at the first light of dawn and strode around his chamber, unable to settle his mind. He didn\u2019t know what to do next. Should he fetch another child? The idea was\u2014frankly\u2014terrifying. Perhaps it would be better to get a wife first, and bring a woman\u2019s hand into it. How long could it take to find a wife?</p><p>And then there was Elijah. He turned so quickly that his heel slipped and the rug crumpled behind him. He kicked it flat again.</p><p>Finally he cursed and rang the bell for his valet. He required a woman\u2019s advice about matrimony. Jemma was a woman. And Jemma was married to Elijah: he needed to know how Elijah was. In any case, he couldn\u2019t bear to be in his house anymore, not with that boy upstairs. One had to suppose he should go upstairs and say something to him. He shuddered at the very thought.</p><p>Villiers arrived at the Beaumont town house at the grotesquely unfashionable hour of eight o\u2019clock, fully expecting the butler to deny him entrance. By the grace of God, Elijah\u2019s butler wasn\u2019t at his post. Instead a round-faced footman informed him that the duke wasn\u2019t yet awake. \u201cFine,\u201d he said brusquely, throwing his greatcoat into the man\u2019s arms. The footman caught it reflexively, and Villiers strode around him. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the library. When the duke awakes, inform him that I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>He threw open the door to the room and stopped, frozen on the threshold. Then he stepped through the doorway and closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wake her,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>Jemma looked utterly delectable, of course. She appeared to be wrapped in little more than a blanket, and was sleeping as soundly as a babe in his friend\u2019s arms. At least Elijah had a dressing gown on. Somehow Villiers found himself able to view the scene without more than a faint pang of envy. The whole experience of rescuing his son made his feelings for Jemma seem far in the past.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up and about very early,\u201d Elijah observed.</p><p>\u201cI had an interesting day yesterday,\u201d Villiers said. Then he narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe foxglove works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart beat steadily for approximately thirteen hours after taking a dose,\u201d Elijah said, a huge grin breaking over his face. \u201cWhen Jemma wakes, I\u2019ll take another dose, as I only just started missing a beat or two in the last few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the medicine,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cDukes don\u2019t fetch things. Jemma dashed over to your house to fetch the article on foxglove, and now you\u2019re the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not living up to your ducal expectations?\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, yes,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWhat has happened to you? You look as altered as I. Did you know that your hair ribbon does not match your coat?\u201d</p><p>Villiers had grabbed it from the table and left his valet bleating something or other.</p><p>\u201cJust to demonstrate that dukes do fetch things, yesterday I went to fetch my eldest son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you successful?\u201d</p><p>Jemma murmured something and turned in her sleep. Bright hair spilled over Elijah\u2019s knees. Villiers realized with some surprise that he felt nothing.</p><p>\u201cThe boy had been consigned to a grotesque personage who ran a group of boys as mudlarks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah frowned instantly. Of course he, of all the dukes in the realm, would know precisely what a mudlark was, and how perilous their lives. \u201cHas he been injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis legs are somewhat scarred, but he seems well. Another boy appears likely to lose his foot from a great cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mortality rate is very high.\u201d</p><p>Villiers felt that like a punch to the stomach. \u201cAh. Well, my son appears to be alive. Very alive. In addition, he seems to be a hellion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d</p><p>Villiers ignored his sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI handed him over to Mrs. Ferrers, my housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handed your son over to the housekeeper? You don\u2019t know where he is sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat housekeeper?\u201d Jemma said, straightening up and yawning. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d With a groan she collapsed back onto Elijah\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWho else could take care of the boy? He was filthy. Was I supposed to do something with him?\u201d But it was a question he had been asking himself. Should he go up to the nursery and say something? Take the boy somewhere?</p><p>Jemma sat up again and threw back her hair. \u201cWhat the devil are you doing here, Villiers?\u201d She blinked and clutched her blanket a little higher.</p><p>\u201cI came to hear your good news,\u201d he said blandly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Then she beamed at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what were you saying about your housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe housekeeper has been assigned to care for one of my children,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI have five more children to find, and God knows what sort of living arrangements my solicitor made for them. He\u2019s gone missing, by the way, and I expect he\u2019s taken a quantity of money with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you put a Runner on him?\u201d Elijah inquired.</p><p>Villiers nodded. \u201cNot for the money, but in the event that I can\u2019t find one or more of the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must go look for the rest of them,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of children,\u201d she replied. \u201cPerhaps you should hire a nursemaid. In fact, you will need more than one, as well as a governess. Your housekeeper can find them for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot that,\u201d Villiers said, picking up his sword stick and examining it as if he\u2019d never seen it before. \u201cI need a wife. That is, I suppose I do need a nanny or two, or three. But I need a wife. And I\u2019ve lost two fianc\u00e9es so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need someone of a generous temperament, of course.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you certain that you wish to bring up these children in your own home, Leopold? You could place them in the country, with a good family, and visit them often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why it was, but he couldn\u2019t have Tobias sent away, where he might not be safe. Never again. Even though he was a repellent little monster. \u201cI was under the impression that you were quite enamored of your brother\u2019s illegitimate brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut last year Elijah threw a tantrum at the mere idea that the boy would be staying under our roof, and he was just the one child, rather than six,\u201d Jemma said, elbowing her husband.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be effective in Parliament at that point,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cAnd I was going about it the wrong way.\u201d He dropped a kiss on her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou need a woman who won\u2019t be terrified by the very idea of your children,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cwhich I think excludes the greater number of debutantes, don\u2019t you agree, Elijah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem,\u201d Elijah said slowly, \u201cis not how to handle these children now. It\u2019s what will happen to them when they reach marriageable age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall dower them,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI am one of the richest men in England, and much of it is unentailed. They shall marry whomever they please.\u201d He heard the arrogance of his father, in his voice, and his father\u2019s father\u2014and didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cPerhaps a nice widow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elijah said slowly. \u201cThe duchess would have to be of equal stature to Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. If we could find a duke\u2019s daughter,\u201d Jemma agreed, \u201cbetween the two of you, you might be able to compel the ton to accept the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that the Puritanical will ever accept the children,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>Villiers felt a wave of rage in his chest. \u201cThey are my children,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201cIllegitimacy is well-nigh impossible to overcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I need a duke\u2019s daughter,\u201d Villiers said, ignoring his doubts.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is finding eligible ducal offspring,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cNot to mention ones who might be convinced to marry a man in your situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou show me an eligible woman, and I\u2019ll take her,\u201d Villiers said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just take her,\u201d Jemma said, scowling at him.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the Duke of Montague\u2019s daughter,\u201d Elijah offered.</p><p>\u201cActually, Montague has three daughters,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThe eldest one is Eleanor. She\u2019s apparently quite proud. I\u2019ve heard tell that she won\u2019t even consider those of a rank below an earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am above an earl,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAre the other two as superior in their thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met the youngest Montague daughter only two or three times, but it seems to me that she was as full of her own consequence as her sisters. I believe it\u2019s a family trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the Duke of Gilner have a daughter?\u201d Elijah asked. \u201cI always liked him. He comes infrequently to the House, but he\u2019s thoroughly intelligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Lisette. But she\u2019s ineligible,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mad. Quite mad. She has never had a season. And everyone says it\u2019s because she can\u2019t appear in public at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be others.\u201d</p><p>Jemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall choose among the Montague daughters. Did you say the eldest is called Eleanor?\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cEleanor, Anne, and Elizabeth. They\u2019re named after three queens. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re in London at the moment, but I shall invite them to the house for tea upon their return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate that,\u201d Villiers said. He was beginning to feel worried about Tobias, as if the boy might flee if he left him alone too long. \u201cI\u2019m happy to find you so well,\u201d he said to Elijah. \u201cNow you should have a footman fetch that miraculous medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe you thanks, since you found the doctor who directed us to Withering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall take that as confirmation that I no longer need feel guilty about the fact you saved my life last year, after that duel.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t embrace. English dukes didn\u2019t flaunt affection, even under circumstances like these. But Elijah accompanied him to the door and their shoulders jostled together, just as they had in their boyhood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Duke of Villiers walked into the watery morning sunlight, thinking about duke\u2019s daughters named for queens.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Two months later, mid-June</p><p>1784</p> <p>All of London was talking about the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s benefit costume ball for refurbishment of the old Roman baths. It was rumored that at least four duchesses would attend, and perhaps even the King himself. Everyone, of course, would be dressed in proper Roman attire.</p><p>Mrs. Mogg and her friends were waiting outside the gate of the baths hours before the ball was due to begin.</p><p>They watched as scores of footmen carried in countless garlands of flowers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll wrap them around the trees, I\u2019ve no doubt,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said importantly. \u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont did just that at a party she had in Paris.\u201d Her friends all nodded. Mrs. Mogg was considered something of an expert on the Beaumonts. After all, she\u2019d talked to the duke himself twice. And she seemed to know everything there was to know about the couple.</p><p>\u201cThat was when they were living apart,\u201d she continued now. \u201cThe duchess was over in Paris, by herself, see, and the duke was here. But then she came back and they fell in love, just like a fairy tale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the best chess player in all England,\u201d Mr. Mogg put in. He had discovered that if he didn\u2019t go along with his wife\u2019s obsession with the ducal family, they had nothing to talk about. So in his own way, he had become an expert too.</p><p>\u201cNay, you\u2019re wrong there,\u201d a bystander said. \u201cThe Duke of Villiers is the best chess player. They just had in the paper as how he is the number one ranked player in the Chess Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s only because the duke and duchess refuse to play each other for a ranking,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said. \u201cI had a shilling and sixpence riding on the duke winning the game with the duchess, and he sent a footman to my house to tell me the match was off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d the man said, looking at her again.</p><p>Mrs. Mogg drew herself up, her fox head stole shaking with excitement. \u201cHe sent that footman right to my house, to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why won\u2019t they play each other?\u201d someone asked respectfully, as befitted a conversation with someone who knew a duke personally.</p> <p>\u201cI expect because of love,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said. \u201cThey\u2019re in love, you know. She calls him Elijah. I heard her, clear as I hear myself. \u2018Elijah,\u2019 she called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they really all going to be wearing sheets?\u201d someone asked her. He had a little notebook. \u201cI\u2019m reporting for the Morning Post, madam.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at her with respect. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard,\u201d Mrs. Mogg said, watching as the reporter wrote down sheets.</p><p>There are some people for whom the command to wear a toga is anathema. The Marquise de Perthuis, for example, received her invitation, shuddered, and dropped it in the fireplace. Wearing a shapeless white gown held no interest for her. Besides, she was packing to return to France. Having heard nothing from Henri, she had decided to shock him (and the French court) with the glory of her new chemise gowns.</p><p>Lord Corbin was similarly discomposed. How did one wear a proper wig with a toga? And what about shoes? Weren\u2019t ancient Romans prone to wearing roughly-made sandals that displayed one\u2019s toes? He went to the opera instead.</p><p>But most other English peers were braver than Corbin, or more curious. \u201cIt\u2019s held up on only one shoulder,\u201d Roberta, the Countess of Gryffyn, complained. \u201cWhat was Jemma thinking of? What if my gown falls straight to the ground while I\u2019m dancing?\u201d</p><p>Damon, the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s brother, dropped a kiss on her bare shoulder. \u201cShe was thinking that you would look utterly ravishing in a toga,\u201d her husband said huskily.</p><p>Roberta met her husband\u2019s eyes in the glass, and unfortunately that particular couple arrived quite late at the ball.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until some hours later\u2014after Mrs. Mogg, Mr. Mogg, the Morning Post reporter, and a small stalwart crowd had been standing long enough to be truly weary, and all the footmen and cooks and the rest had gone through the little gate\u2014that Mrs. Mogg really achieved fame.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Beaumont were the first to arrive. That made sense, since they were hosting the affair.</p><p>The reporter started writing busily, for here was a couple for whom the very design of the toga seemed to have been invented. The duchess wore her unpowdered hair in simple curls, with a lock or two falling over her bare shoulder. She had jewels in her hair and on her slippers. The duke looked like Socrates himself, the reporter scribbled, stopping for a moment to wonder whether Socrates was Greek or Roman. Well, it hardly mattered.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Mogg,\u201d the duke said, stopping with a bow.</p><p>The reporter stopped writing to stare. Did the duke just bow to Mrs. Mogg?</p><p>Sure enough, she was bobbing a curtsy and talking to him as if he were of no better rank than a dockworker. The reporter shook his head. There was no point in writing this down; no one would believe it.</p><p>A few hours later, the gardens of the Roman baths were thronged with Roman nobles\u2014or so it seemed. The trees were festooned with flowers and strands of pearls; twinkling small lanterns lit the darkest corners.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a triumph,\u201d Elijah whispered to Jemma.</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cDid the king tell you that he\u2019s going to undertake restoration of the baths himself? They should be a national treasure, he said.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cI\u2019m a bit sorry to have lost our secret place, but he\u2019s right. The mosaics need to be restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And then: \u201cWhy do you have that naughty look, Elijah?\u201d</p><p>He dropped a kiss on her nose. \u201cAfter the ball is over, Duchess...\u201d He ran a finger under the single knot that held up her toga.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>A drawling voice said, \u201cShould I return, or are you two going to continue making an exhibition of yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss off,\u201d Elijah said, turning his back on his oldest friend to gather his wife in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI need Jemma,\u201d Villiers said, sounding amused.</p><p>\u201cOr rather, I need a wife and she promised to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cDo let me go, Elijah. I promised to introduce Leopold to the Montague sisters. I just saw Eleanor, dressed as Caesar\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Elijah reluctantly let her go, just pulling her back at the last moment. \u201cLater,\u201d he said into her ear.</p><p>And then watched her walk off with Villiers, knowing that the high flush on his wife\u2019s cheeks had nothing to do with face paint.</p><p>As the night wore on, the gardens gradually emptied of revelers. Some of the lanterns winked out, giving the paths the air of a wild bacchanalia. Carriages drew up continually outside the little stone wall, taking away groups of chattering noblemen. The hems of their togas were black with dirt; they themselves were replete with gossip; it was accounted a brilliant night by all.</p><p>Finally, Mr. and Mrs. Mogg were the only two people still waiting outside the gate. \u201cBut the duke and duchess haven\u2019t come out!\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here for hours, Marge,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you, but I\u2019m done with this here waiting. We must have missed them. Or they left through another gate. Look, all them servants have left, and the place is dark now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mrs. Mogg finally allowed herself to be drawn away, though she could hardly believe it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have missed him. There must be another gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course there is,\u201d Henry said stoutly. \u201cThey probably left early. Too many people in that there garden, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>But in fact not all the lanterns were out. There were still glowing lights hanging from the columns of the baths themselves, and the duke and duchess were wandering hand in hand in that direction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never been here at night,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s magical, Elijah. Just look at all the stars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d her husband said.</p><p>They walked between the dilapidated columns, turned right and descended the stairs to the baths. Jemma stopped. \u201cOh, Elijah!\u201d</p><p>In the golden light of the lanterns hanging around the baths, the pool looked like a purple sea. The entire surface was covered with hundreds and hundreds of floating violets. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery violet Stubbins was able to force in his new frames,\u201d Elijah said with satisfaction, \u201cand more sent in from the country.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cExtravagant man!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to do this all evening.\u201d He slid the knotted cloth of her toga off her shoulder. It fell to the ground, leaving her in nothing but an extremely naughty pair of cherry-colored stays.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find that under your toga!\u201d Elijah said. His voice darkened at the very sight of her slender long legs topped by stays that pushed her breasts forward, as if they longed for a man\u2019s touch.</p><p>Jemma took a step toward him with a sultry swing of her hips. \u201cYour toga, Duke.\u201d With one finger, she pushed it off his shoulder.</p><p>Unlike the duchess, the duke had chosen to wear nothing under his toga.</p><p>Jemma broke into laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good idea,\u201d Elijah said, grabbing her. His hands slid down her back, over her stays, shaped her bottom. \u201cUnfortunately, every time I caught sight of you I had to turn away and think hard about chess, because the front of this damned toga tented in the most obvious manner.\u201d</p> <p>He picked her up and carried her straight into the water. They made a little path through the violets, as fragrance drifted into the air. \u201cOh, Elijah,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cthis is the most romantic night I could ever have dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what interesting fact Stubbins told me this morning?\u201d he asked, striding through the violet sea.</p><p>\u201cDoes it involve manure?\u201d she asked, leaning her head against his chest, just for the reassurance of hearing the steady beat of his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou can eat violets.\u201d He placed her carefully down on the edge of the bath, where he had arranged for long cushions to be placed on the cold marble, just as the Romans had.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you planning?\u201d Jemma said. She stretched languorously, loving the way his eyes ran greedily along the lines of her legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn you into a pagan goddess,\u201d he said, nimbly pulling out the pins that held up her curls, and then turning to the ties holding up her stays.</p><p>Jemma lay back and smiled at the open sky. Far overhead, stars were shining, though the roofless bath seemed like the most protected room in the world. Elijah was tucking flowers in all her ringlets. He stood back and looked at her. She rolled over on her side and propped up her head with one hand. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a debauched Roman matron than a goddess,\u201d he observed. He reached forward again.</p> <p>Jemma squeaked. \u201cNot there too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cIn fact, given that violets are edible, we should consider your body a banquet. Put a violet everywhere that you would like me to...taste. Do you see what I am doing, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning me into a flower bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am having fun. Just as you taught me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over to give him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being extravagant,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m risking bankrupting the duchy to blanket you in flowers. I\u2019m flirting with you, and now I\u2019m going to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm...\u201d Jemma rolled to her back and held out her hand for violets. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, dropping them onto the slope of her breast. \u201cOh, and here.\u201d She loved it when he kissed her stomach. \u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>The next hour or so was delicious from a culinary\u2014and a personal\u2014point of view.</p><p>It was only when they were sitting twined together on the steps leading down to the pool, enveloped by the warm water, that Jemma said, \u201cElijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at those broken tiles over there, Jemma. I do believe there used to be a mosaic depicting Apollo and Daphne on that wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI taught you how to have fun. And you taught me something just as important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love praise,\u201d he said, nuzzling her. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taught me that not all games need to be won. And that I don\u2019t always have to be in control.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d There was a deep, male satisfaction in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve become quite used to begging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gift in return.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were grave now, looking into hers. \u201cWhat gifts haven\u2019t you given me, Jemma? Besides my life?\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again, loving him. Then she picked up his hand and put it gently on her belly. \u201cThis is my gift.\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>\u201cJemma!\u201d</p><p>She started laughing at the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014You\u2019re having a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d she corrected him.</p><p>He had both hands on her tummy now, spanning her with ease. \u201cAre you certain, Jemma?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen pregnant woman and you\u2019re very slim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d she protested. \u201cYou simply haven\u2019t noticed. Look!\u201d And she stood up. She thought her stomach formed the sweetest, most delicate curve she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Elijah rose from the water, drops flying from his muscled body, and without pausing fell to his knees and put his lips to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh, Elijah!\u201d Jemma said, putting a hand on his dark hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me my life, Jemma...twice over.\u201d</p><p>In the end, she cried.</p><p>He was too happy for tears.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>An appalling number of years later</p><p>There were times when the Duchess of Beaumont felt quite irritated about growing old. Her right ankle hurt sometimes. Her hips were a little rounder than she would have preferred. Her hair was emphatically no longer pure gold.</p><p>Even now, for example, as she bent over to adjust the knot of pearls on her slippers, something creaked in one knee and she straightened quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy the frown?\u201d Elijah said, entering the chamber and stripping off his riding coat. He had been in Hyde Park with Evan, their eldest. Without waiting for an answer, he continued, \u201cI have to tell you what happened while we were riding. Your friend, the Duchess of Cosway, stopped me because she wanted to know more about the Cacky Street helmets. She had the idea that perhaps their village smith might use something of the same nature.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, how is Isidore?\u201d Jemma asked with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since our Twelfth Night ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed the same,\u201d Elijah said, pulling off his boots. \u201cBeautiful woman. Not as lovely as you, of course. But more importantly, I think she has a good point about smiths making use of something to protect their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jemma picked up her manuscript. She had been working all morning on her latest project, a treatise entitled The Beaumont Chess Series: Complex Problems for Master Players. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, darling. I\u2019ve been writing all morning. I thought I\u2019d stow this in the library and go for a walk. Would you like to join me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t told you what happened yet,\u201d Elijah complained. He took off his shirt.</p><p>Jemma put her book back down and sat to ogle her husband as he undressed. Even now, at sixty, Elijah was still lean and muscled. She had grown a little plumper, but he maintained the exercise practice that he insisted was half of the reason his heart was still\u2014even now\u2014beating as steadily as the pendulum of a clock.</p><p>\u201cIsidore was accompanied by one of her daughters. The younger one, with the extraordinary eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucia has her mother\u2019s eyes,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIsidore\u2019s eyes tilt up at the corners in precisely the same fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, between us, Lucia looks like a harem dancer,\u201d Elijah said. He was down to his smalls now, and Jemma thought he looked delicious. His legs were as powerful as they had been at thirty-five. It was such a pleasure to still desire her husband, these many years later, that she couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYou sound a little moralistic,\u201d she teased. \u201cLucia is a very nice girl and no harem dancer. When she debuted last year, she had at least four requests for her hand, and one of them was from the Earl of Derby\u2019s heir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d Elijah protested. \u201cAny normal unmarried man\u2014except for Evan\u2014would have gravitated to Lucia\u2019s side like steel to a magnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan ignored her,\u201d Jemma said resignedly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just like me,\u201d Elijah said, for perhaps the fourteen-thousandth time since Evan was first put in his arms. It was undeniably true that their eldest son\u2019s grave, intelligent eyes looked exactly like his father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so passionate about furthering his study of heart ailments that he can\u2019t stop thinking about his latest experiment, even when a woman as beautiful as Lucia shows interest.\u201d</p><p>When Rosalind was born, Jemma happily recognized a bit of herself in one of her children. Rosie\u2019s bright hair and laughter had kept Evan from being too solemn as a little boy.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until their third, Marguerite, came along that Jemma saw herself and Elijah combined in one child. Marguerite would passionately argue one minute for the life of a frog that Evan planned to dissect, and then turn about and argue just as passionately for the right to wear Spanish blue rather than white for her debut.</p><p>\u201cI know, darling,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cEvan is just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d Elijah looked up. \u201cLaugh if you like. But that boy is twenty-five years old, and he shows no signs of being interested in looking for a wife. Perhaps we should have arranged a marriage for him.\u201d</p><p>Jemma got up and wrapped her arms around Elijah\u2019s chest. \u201cHe\u2019ll find his own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn arranged marriage worked for us. At this rate, he\u2019ll never get married. And I think that Cosway might welcome the suggestion for Lucia. Perhaps I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma told him. \u201cMarguerite is going to force Evan to accompany her to balls this season. He\u2019ll find someone on his own.\u201d</p><p>Elijah snorted. \u201cDid you hear that Marguerite slaughtered poor Villiers at chess again last night? He\u2019s going to refuse to pay us visits at this rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou know, Elijah, I think your heart may be missing a beat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked unconcerned. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd you know what resets this particular clock in the best possible fashion.\u201d</p><p>The smile on his face was positively wicked. \u201cIt is two in the afternoon,\u201d he said with mock severity. \u201cAre you trying to lead me astray? I had plans to work on\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned her mouth to his chest and his voice broke off.</p><p>A moment later he picked her up and laid her on the bed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lift me,\u201d Jemma protested. \u201cI\u2019m too plump for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love carrying you,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cHave I told you how grateful I am that you stopped wearing all those panniers and petticoats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, gasping a little because his hands were wandering.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are not plump. What you are is delicious, Jemma. Every time I see you, I want to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Elijah,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLast night at supper,\u201d Elijah said, pausing for a moment and looking down into her eyes, \u201cMarguerite was nattering away with one of Villiers\u2019s boys, and you were talking to Rosalind about a new modiste. And I couldn\u2019t concentrate on what Villiers was saying at all because I kept looking at you and thinking about how you taste, and how you smell, and how soft you feel...\u201d</p><p>He stopped talking, but only to give her a kiss. </p> </body></html>"]
