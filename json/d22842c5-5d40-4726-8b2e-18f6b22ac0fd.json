She was bait.</p><p>Zach was here. She could feel him nearby, drawing closer with every beat of her heart, as if somehow he\u2019d become a part of her. She wasn\u2019t ready for him to show up yet. She needed more time to prepare herself for what she had to do and what it might cost her.</p> <p>The fine hair along her limbs lifted, and she felt a tingling run over her skin. She\u2019d felt it before, the night Zach had marked her skin, and she knew what it meant. Zach was closing in.</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t sure she could do this\u2014lie in wait for him to come to her\u2014but she had no choice. The fate of the entire human race depended on her ability to fool him into thinking she needed his help\u2014that she believed the lie he told, that he was one of the good guys. She knew better. Her mother had made sure of that.</p><p>As far as she was concerned, most people weren\u2019t worth the trouble she was bringing down on herself, but Helen Day was. And the Sentinels had her. Zach was her only way inside the compound where Helen was being held prisoner, her only way to help Helen escape.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hands shook as she wiped down the worn wooden tables. The bar where she worked had just closed and was nearly empty. There was one man in back, cleaning the small kitchen. She could hear him singing in Spanish as he worked. Gus, the bar\u2019s owner, was at the cash register, figuring up tonight\u2019s sales. From the grin on his weathered face and the way her feet and back ached, she was pretty sure he\u2019d made a killing.</p><p>The lump in her apron pocket from her tips wasn\u2019t as big as she\u2019d hoped it would be. Not as many people paid with cash as they used to, and Gus liked to hold on to her money as long as he could, so she wouldn\u2019t see those tips until her paycheck. Not that she was going to be here long enough to collect it. She was sure Zach would find her before then.</p> <p>The idea made her skin heat and her mouth go dry; it made her shake with fear and something else\u2014something hot and illusive she couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>Too bad. It was time to suck it up. Helen needed her. Lexi had to free her friend, and then find a way to undo whatever brainwashing Helen had suffered. Thank God she had the Defenders of Humanity on her side. Those big ol\u2019 redneck boys seemed to know what they were doing, even if they were a bit . . . intense about it. If anyone could deprogram Helen, it would be the Defenders.</p><p>Lexi upended the chairs onto the table so she could sweep and mop. She\u2019d just picked up the last chair when the skin on the back of her neck tingled with awareness. She looked over her shoulder to see who was watching. Gus\u2019s head was bent over a calculator. The mirror behind him reflected the dim room. She caught a glimpse of pale green eyes in the mirror and froze in panic for a split second, her heart pounding as it primed her limbs to flee. Then she realized it wasn\u2019t Zach. It was just the eyes of the leopard tattoo on her shoulder staring back at her from beneath the edge of her tank top.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t here yet. She still had time to get a grip.</p><p>Relief made her sag against the table. She was going to have to find a way to control herself before he showed up for real. And based on the tingling of her skin where his mark glowed beneath the tattoo, that wasn\u2019t going to be long. This time when he showed up, she wouldn\u2019t run.</p><p>Lexi had spent most of her life running, and she was sick of it. She wanted a real home with a real bed, not the backseat of her car and a rest-stop bathroom, or maybe a cheap motel room if she was lucky. If she couldn\u2019t have a real home, then the least she could do was make the Sentinels suffer as much as she had. After what they\u2019d done to her mother, Helen and countless others, they deserved whatever they got. And then some.</p> <p>Lexi turned to get the mop from the kitchen and caught sight of those leopard green eyes again, only this time, they weren\u2019t staring at her from a tattoo.</p><p>Zach was here. Watching her.</p><p>Lexi froze, unable to move, or even breathe.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready. She wasn\u2019t strong enough to face him yet. The urge to flee rose up in her, and she fought against the desperate panic, gritting her teeth and clenching her fists.</p><p>Zach made no move to attack her. Instead, he lounged in the doorway, one broad shoulder propped casually against the frame. He watched her with the uncanny stillness of a predator. His brown skin blended into the shadows falling over the paneled walls, making his light eyes stand out even more.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart kicked hard, though she wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he\u2019d surprised her or because that was just what he did to her. Even in her dreams he had the ability to make her sweat with his hot stare.</p><p>He was bigger than she\u2019d remembered, or maybe that faulty memory was just her mind\u2019s way of helping her face him down by making him less threatening. His straight black hair was different from the way it had been the last time she\u2019d seen him\u2014tied back like he was ready to go into battle.</p><p>Maybe he was. Lexi had no idea what to expect now. For all she knew, he was here to kill her despite his pretty words, and all the planning she had done with the Defenders would be for nothing.</p> <p>I need you, honey. He\u2019d said that only days ago. Said it in a way that made her resolve melt.</p><p>She had to stay calm and act casual. Move slowly. He was like a wild, predatory animal, and she was afraid that if she moved too fast, he\u2019d pounce.</p><p>Lexi gave him a level stare, letting him know she\u2019d seen him. Pretending that she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>Zach smiled, showing off his bright white teeth. It wasn\u2019t a smile of greeting. It was a smile of conquest. Victory.</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard, trying to work some moisture back into her mouth. \u201cGus, I\u2019m taking off early,\u201d she told her boss, keeping her eyes locked on Zach, watching for sudden movements.</p><p>\u201cLike hell you are. Not until the floors are mopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Gotta go,\u201d she said. \u201cFamily emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does now,\u201d said Zach. His rich baritone voice sank into her skin, making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d asked Gus. \u201cAnd how did you get in here? The doors are locked.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he pushed off the wall with a powerful bunching of muscles and stalked toward her. Lexi held her ground through sheer force of will. She would not run. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Zach told her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d His green eyes held her still, mesmerizing her like she was some kind of prey\u2014a timid little bunny rabbit frozen with fear. The image pissed her off enough to drive away some of that fear.</p><p>He was closer now. Too close. Lexi\u2019s breathing sped until her head spun, and she was sure she\u2019d make herself pass out.</p><p>\u201cYou need some help, Alex?\u201d asked Gus.</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d asked Zach, lifting a black brow in question.</p><p>Lexi tried to give him an indifferent shrug, but her spine felt stiff and rusty. \u201cNew town, new name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew look, too,\u201d he said, his eyes roaming over her body like the territory belonged to him. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had blond spiky hair when he\u2019d met her. Since then, she\u2019d dyed her hair back to its normal color\u2014a plain, average brown. It was longer, too, falling over her nape, baby fine and completely limp after her long shift.</p><p>\u201cYou look . . . softer.\u201d He said it like it was a good thing, and Lexi suddenly wished she hadn\u2019t gotten rid of her spikes. At least she could have used them to put out his eye if he got too close.</p><p>Which he was doing right now.</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d questioned Gus again, this time with more force. He had a gun back there behind the bar and wasn\u2019t afraid to use it. Typical Texan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told Gus, lying through her teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s just an old friend.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s smile widened. \u201cI just came by to catch up on old times.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, and Lexi knew she couldn\u2019t flinch away. Gus would know something was up, and although Gus wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest guy on the face of the planet, he had given her a job when no one else would. She couldn\u2019t repay him with trouble. And Zach was definitely that. More than six feet and two hundred pounds of walking, talking trouble.</p><p>His wide hand wrapped around her wrist, and he pulled her toward him. Lexi went, ensuring Gus\u2019s gun was kept safely tucked away. She let Zach wrap his arms around her. She wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do. Strangle her? Grab her and haul ass out the door? Heaven knew he was big enough to fling her over his shoulder and run out of here before anyone could stop him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t do any of that. All he did was engulf her in a hug.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s mind sputtered, trying to make sense out of his action. Her arms were limp at her sides. She couldn\u2019t even find the presence of mind to push him away. She tried to convince herself that it was because she didn\u2019t want Gus to get hurt, but part of her knew better. As much as she feared what Zach would do to her, as much as she hated him and his kind for ruining her life and the lives of countless others, there was still something about him that called to her\u2014something that quieted the rioting corners of her soul. Maybe it was just his handsome face or his mouthwatering body. Or maybe he was already brainwashing her and she just didn\u2019t know it. That was how brainwashing worked, right?</p><p>His hands roamed over her back and down her bare arms. His skin was warm against hers, rough with calluses and utterly manly. She was pressed hard against him, subjected to every devastatingly muscular inch of his chest, abs and thighs. Her hands itched to reach out and see if he felt as good under her fingers as he did against her body, but she held back.</p><p>He was her enemy. Lexi couldn\u2019t forget that. Problem was, it was easy to forget right now. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been hugged, but she was sure it had been nothing like this.</p><p>His scent enveloped her, sliding inside her with every breath she took. She felt her body relaxing and knew this had to be some kind of trick the Sentinels used to subdue their prey. A chemical weapon. One that was working like a charm.</p><p>Against her better judgment, her cheek settled on his chest and she could hear the strong, steady beat of his heart. The shimmering necklace he wore pulsed with color, swirling in an almost hypnotic display. His arms were thick, hard bands holding her in place, locking her against him, but he wasn\u2019t hurting her, as she\u2019d feared. In fact it was just the opposite. She could feel a subtle vibration running through his limbs, like he was being careful not to crush her.</p><p>Lexi pulled back, hoping to end the hug, but Zach didn\u2019t let go. His grip was desperate. Unbreakable.</p><p>He buried his nose in her hair and pulled in a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d he whispered as if he\u2019d been worried about her. \u201cI didn\u2019t get here too late.\u201d</p><p>Those were not the words of a murdering madman, but Lexi knew better than to be tricked.</p><p>\u201cIs Helen okay, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach pulled back then, just enough to look down at her. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Happy. Just like you\u2019ll be once I get you home.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, he was practically admitting he was going to brainwash her. She couldn\u2019t let that happen. Helen needed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d said Zach. \u201cWhen the phone cut off last week, I was sure you were dead\u2014sure I\u2019d be too late.\u201d</p><p>Lexi prayed he couldn\u2019t see the guilty flush she could feel spreading over her face. That phone call last week had been one hundred percent theater, designed by the Defenders to get Zach to come running. She\u2019d pretended to be in trouble, calling him for help. Her frightened voice, the pounding on her motel room door, the way she disconnected the call. It had all been a carefully devised lie to trick Zach into coming for her.</p><p>And it had worked like a charm.</p><p>He ran his hands along her arms as if checking for injury, or maybe trying to convince himself she was fine.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know what to make of it, and it left her reeling in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWere you attacked? Did you get hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lexi knew he\u2019d have questions, and she had practiced her lie over and over, but with his hands running over her, so warm and caring, she could hardly remember the line. \u201cNo. I was in a cheap motel room. It was just some drunk guy looking for his cheating girlfriend. I shouldn\u2019t have called and bothered you, but I was scared.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes closed in relief for a brief moment, and she saw his mouth move as if offering a silent prayer of thanks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Gus. \u201cI hate to interrupt your little reunion, but this floor isn\u2019t going to mop itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d said Zach. \u201cBut Lexi\u2019s\u2014Alex\u2019s\u2014days of mopping are over. She\u2019s coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>Gus\u2019s eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cThat true?\u201d he asked her. \u201cYou leaving with this guy?\u201d</p><p>Best to just get it over with and get out of here before anyone else could get hurt. The longer she put off the inevitable, the worse it would be. \u201cYeah, Gus. I\u2019m going with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been running from something,\u201d said Gus. \u201cIs he it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Zach still hadn\u2019t let go of her. His hand was splayed across her lower back, holding her close to his warmth. He looked down at her, and his leopard green eyes practically glowed with anticipation. \u201cTime to go, honey.\u201d</p> <p>Honey. He always called her that, like he cared about her. Like he wasn\u2019t planning on brainwashing her and killing her for her blood.</p><p>Then again, Lexi figured turnabout was fair play. Her trunk was packed with explosives, thanks to the Defenders\u2019 plan. Once Zach took her back to the compound where he lived, and she got Helen out, she was going to detonate all that C-4 and kill every one of the Sentinels she could. Including Zach.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Lexi was safe. Zach could hardly believe it, even though she stood right there in front of him, so beautiful it made his eyes sting. He\u2019d nearly collapsed with relief when he\u2019d cleared the bar\u2019s entrance and seen her safe and sound. The doorframe kept him from falling, and he stayed there for a full minute, just watching her move, soaking in the sight of her whole and safe. Whatever trouble she was in, whatever he\u2019d heard over the phone last week hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>He\u2019d found her in time.</p><p>It took Zach another minute to steady his breathing and get enough control over his emotions to even think about approaching her. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. He couldn\u2019t scare her away. Not again.</p><p>When he was sure he wouldn\u2019t hurt her with his desperation to get her in his arms, he finally allowed himself to go to her. And now here she was, pressed up against him, right where she belonged.</p><p>He stroked her arms, trying to rub away the chill that roughened her skin. He wasn\u2019t sure whether the goose bumps were from cold or fear, but either way, he was going to take care of it for her. Whatever she wanted, whatever she needed, anything in his power to give would be hers.</p> <p>She felt good under his hands. Maybe too good. His fingers closed around her slim arms and he had to remind himself to be careful. Go slowly. Don\u2019t scare her away again.</p><p>Zach had planned for this moment for weeks\u2014every day since he\u2019d met her on June 27, a day he\u2019d always celebrate as the beginning of his salvation. He\u2019d gone over their reunion again and again\u2014a million different permutations filling up his brain until it was clogged with possibilities. In every single one, she\u2019d stayed by his side because that was what he wanted.</p><p>Based on the way she held herself stiff in his arms, apparently reality wasn\u2019t going to be quite so easy.</p><p>He\u2019d lost her once. She\u2019d run away. The bloodmarker he\u2019d left on her hadn\u2019t worked right and he couldn\u2019t find her. Even though it was supposed to be impossible, she\u2019d managed to find a way to hide from him. It could happen again if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>Zach planned on being really careful.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d he told her. He dug in his back pocket and pulled out a small velvet pouch. It took some doing to open the thing one- handed, but he wasn\u2019t about to let go of her with his other hand. If he had his choice, he\u2019d never stop touching her again.</p><p>He pulled the delicate gold chain from the bag and dangled it in front of her. The bar\u2019s neon signs glinted off the links, giving it a tacky sparkle.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA present. For you.\u201d One that would make sure he didn\u2019t lose her again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept it,\u201d said Lexi. Her dark eyes were locked onto the thing like it was a poisonous snake.</p><p>\u201cSure you can. I had it made just for you. You don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings, do you?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and looked up at him. Those bittersweet chocolate eyes were full of questions and more than a little apprehension, but Zach would take care of that soon enough. All he needed was some time alone with her to explain and everything would be fine.</p><p>It had to be. Zach was nearly out of time.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lexi. Just let me put it on you. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll get you something else.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the bracelet again, licked her lips and pulled in a fortifying breath. Her chest vibrated with silent fear.</p><p>She was afraid.</p><p>Zach fought the urge to fold her in his arms again and hold her until she got used to him and knew he\u2019d never hurt her. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the way these things worked. She needed time. She needed him to prove to her that not only would he not hurt her, but he\u2019d kill anyone or anything that tried to.</p><p>If things worked out, he\u2019d have a lifetime to show her what she meant to him. Several, actually.</p><p>Pain pounded at his body, and the need to stake his claim screamed at him to act, but he held on. He still had a few more days\u2014long enough to do this right. He\u2019d already lived with the pain for decades; he could live with it for a few more days. Lexi was worth it.</p><p>Slowly, she held out her arm. Her fingers trembled, but Zach pretended not to notice. She was a little woman\u2014only about five feet tall\u2014but her independent streak was anything but little. Lexi was a fighter, and he still had the scar to prove it.</p><p>Every time he saw the small puncture wound on his arm, it made him grin. Once he\u2019d calmed her and showed her how to use his power, she was going to be unstoppable. A fierce warrior maiden. Lexi the Avenger. The stuff of legends.</p><p>Zach fastened the bracelet around her wrist, loving the feel of her silky skin brushing against his fingertips. She had dainty bones, though he\u2019d never dare say that to her face for fear of more scars.</p><p>He\u2019d made the jeweler resize it twice so it would fit just right. And it did. It was loose enough to be comfortable, but didn\u2019t dangle so much it would get in the way. More important, it wasn\u2019t loose enough for her to slip it off over her hand.</p><p>He pretended to adjust it, straightening out the links while he pulled in tiny specks of power from the air around them. It hurt like hell to absorb any more energy, but he had no choice. He needed it to activate the magic Gilda had embedded in the bracelet\u2014the magic that would make it impossible for Lexi to escape him again.</p><p>With a subtle click, he felt the sleeping power inside the gold links come alive, sending sparks cascading up his arm and down his spine.</p><p>So did Lexi.</p><p>Her dark eyes widened and she struggled against him, trying to pull away. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The barkeep looked up from his tallying. His weathered face darkened, and his body shifted. He was reaching for a weapon behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, honey,\u201d said Zach. He took her by the wrist and tugged her along behind him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou hold on there,\u201d said the barkeep. \u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere with you unless it\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Gus,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cYou\u2019ll only get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show him hurt.\u201d The man cradled a shotgun in his hands, looking comfortable enough with the thing that he probably slept with it at night. Not good. Birdshot hurt like hell, and buckshot could blow his arm off or worse. Zach couldn\u2019t let himself become incapacitated now. Especially not when it meant that his blood would be spilled, the scent drawing every Synestryn demon from miles around, leaving Lexi unprotected.</p><p>Not going to happen.</p><p>He shoved Lexi behind him and held up his hands. \u201cEasy, now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, come over here,\u201d Gus ordered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cReally. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just call the sheriff and let him sort all this out,\u201d said Gus. \u201cMake sure your beau here doesn\u2019t have any unpleasant history.\u201d</p><p>Involving human police was only going to make things messier. And he certainly didn\u2019t have time to sit in jail while the last leaf on his lifemark withered and died.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a hurry,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>Gus reached for the phone, never once taking his eyes off Zach. \u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Gus,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cJust let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, Alex. I don\u2019t much care for the idea of you being alone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt her,\u201d said Zach through his teeth. \u201cI\u2019d die before I\u2019d let something happen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone with him.\u201d Lexi\u2019s emphatic statement made Zach\u2019s heart sing. He wasn\u2019t sure if she meant it or if she was putting on a show for Gus, but either way, it worked for him.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d asked Gus.</p><p>Lexi gave Zach a hard shove, pushing him aside so she could step out in front of him. Zach kept his hands to himself, barely. And then he saw the tattoo of a leopard on her shoulder and was shocked to stillness. Jungle vines and stylized leaves started at the point where he\u2019d placed his bloodmarker on her right biceps and wound up her arm and over her shoulder. The leopard was peering out of that foliage, staring right at him from underneath the strap of her tank top.</p><p>Zach had seen his reflection in the mirror often enough that he recognized his own eyes when he saw them.</p><p>It was odd seeing them in the skull of an animal\u2014like he was some bizarre kind of Slayer. What was even odder was the fact that Lexi would permanently mark herself with any image that reminded her of him. Last time he\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d tried to kill him. He liked to think that the few conversations they\u2019d had on the phone since then had convinced her to let go of her violent urges, but he sure didn\u2019t think he\u2019d sweet-talked her enough for something like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Gus,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cJust let us go in peace. We won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>Now she was talking. He wanted to kiss her for defusing the situation before it could escalate and complicate things further.</p><p>Hell, he just wanted to kiss her, period.</p><p>Unfortunately, that would have to wait until he got her out of here. At least until he got her to his truck.</p> <p>\u201cYou got my cell number?\u201d Gus asked Lexi.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse it. Call if you need me. I\u2019ll keep it on all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gus. Sorry about the floor. Keep whatever you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Gus\u2019s eyes narrowed and he scowled at Zach. \u201cYou make it sound like you\u2019re not coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi looked up at Zach and there was a deep sadness darkening her eyes. He wanted to wipe it away, destroy it so it could never come back to haunt her again. Problem was, he was convinced that most of that sadness was somehow his fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Good-bye,\u201d said Lexi, then led Zach through the door out into the night.</p><p>The night air was warm and thick, and filled Zach\u2019s lungs with the scent of earth and asphalt. A pair of aging lights high overhead drew a cloud of bugs, and lit the cracked parking lot just enough to destroy his night vision and create deep pockets of shadow around the few remaining cars.</p><p>Lexi headed for her beat-up Honda and Zach was hot on her heels. He hadn\u2019t quite forgotten just how pretty her ass was, or the way it made his mouth water with the need to feel his hands cupping her cheeks while he kissed her senseless. As much as he hated it, he ripped his eyes away from the lovely sight and scanned the surrounding area for Synestryn. He wasn\u2019t about to let one of those snarlies take them by surprise and ruin his chances of fulfilling every one of his fantasies with Lexi.</p><p>And after so many weeks, he had a lot of those. Now all he needed to do was get her to go along with his plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not riding with you,\u201d she announced on her way to her car.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know that the bracelet she now wore prevented her from getting more than a few yards from him, but he didn\u2019t think it was diplomatic to bring it up just yet. If she tried to run, then she\u2019d know. And if she tried to run, she deserved finding out the hard way.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>Her words hurt, but he ignored the pain. He was good at that. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>Zach grabbed her arm and gently pulled her to a stop. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him for a long moment. Anger tightened her mouth, making him want to kiss it away.</p><p>She poked a finger into his chest. Hard. \u201cYou put your mark on me and chased me all over the country, making it nearly impossible for me to stay in one place long enough to find work. Do you have any idea how much gas costs? I had to pawn nearly everything I own just to keep my car moving so you wouldn\u2019t catch up with me.\u201d</p> <p>The thought of her suffering like that made him sick. That hadn\u2019t been his intention. She ran; he followed her. How could he not follow her when he needed her so much?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you run?\u201d It was a question he\u2019d been dying to ask. Why was she so afraid of him? He\u2019d never hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I run? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou kidnapped Helen. And Miss Mabel. I didn\u2019t want to be next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapped?\u201d Well, Zach figured it probably had looked like that now that he thought about it. \u201cDrake needed Helen. And we couldn\u2019t leave Miss Mabel behind to fend for herself once the Synestryn showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey showed up because of you,\u201d she said, poking him again.</p><p>At this rate, he was going to be bruised. \u201cWell, yeah, but it\u2019s not like we can help that.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and shoved her hand into her apron pocket to retrieve her keys. \u201cWhatever. Just tell me where we\u2019re going, and I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of running, Zach. It\u2019s over. You\u2019ve won. I give up.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, wanting to smooth away the pain he saw lining her face. The weariness. In the dimness of the bar, he hadn\u2019t been able to see just how tired she looked, but now he did. She had dark circles beneath her eyes, and they were red, like she hadn\u2019t slept for days.</p><p>Zach knew how that felt. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019d slept. He\u2019d been too busy searching for Lexi ever since that terrifying phone call.</p><p>Before he could touch her, she flinched away and took a big step back, bumping into her car.</p><p>\u201cGet whatever you want to bring with you, and I\u2019ll put it in my truck,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t want to fight with her. They were a team now\u2014or at least they would be once he got Lexi alone and explained everything to her. Surely she wouldn\u2019t deny him. He needed her too much to even consider the possibility.</p><p>\u201cYour car looks like it\u2019s going to fall apart.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and stared at the cracked asphalt. \u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Zach looked into the back window and saw a pillow and blankets. Tucked in the back window was a ratty teddy bear with one missing eye. Taped to the back of the passenger\u2019s seat were half a dozen photos of a woman Zach guessed was her mother. Lexi was in some of them, young and smiling. Her mother hadn\u2019t been smiling in any of the photos.</p><p>She meant it literally. She lived in her car.</p><p>Zach\u2019s heart broke. How long had she been living like this? And how much of that was his fault for not finding her sooner?</p><p>There was no place for her to move away from him now with the car at her back. He could have hugged her and given her comfort, but he worried it would only bruise her pride. So, he pretended that he didn\u2019t feel sorry for her and said, \u201cFine. You drive. I\u2019ll ride with you.\u201d</p><p>Her head shot up and she gave him a skeptical frown. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>Zach shrugged. \u201cSure. I don\u2019t mind. It won\u2019t kill me to leave my truck here overnight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Lexi\u2019s car wouldn\u2019t start. She used every trick she knew, and none of them worked. Twelve years and nearly two hundred thousand miles and this was the first time her faithful Honda had ever failed her when she really needed it.</p><p>Maybe the thing knew she was planning on blowing it up.</p><p>Lexi pounded her palm against the wheel and let out a frustrated growl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey,\u201d said Zach, his deep voice steady and soothing. He reached over from the passenger\u2019s seat and cupped her shoulder, stroking warm, gentle circles over her bare skin. \u201cI\u2019ll get someone to tow it back home. I have a friend who knows how to fix damn near anything. He\u2019ll have her up and running again in no time. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to make her feel better. Why was he being so nice when he was planning to kill her eventually? It didn\u2019t make any sense, and made Lexi want to scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my car,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Lexi had too much C-4 in the trunk not to worry. She repeated, more emphatically this time, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not moving and I\u2019m not about to let you sleep in it. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her head around and glared at him, thankful for a reason to be angry\u2014to vent some of her frustration and fear out on him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me what to do. I\u2019ll sleep in my car if I damn well please, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Zach blew out a resigned sigh and nodded once. \u201cI can see you\u2019re not going to make this easy, are you?\u201d</p><p>Lexi just glared at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Have it your way. I can\u2019t exactly say I\u2019m surprised.\u201d He got out of the car and strode toward a shiny black truck parked about fifty feet away.</p><p>When he was ten feet away, Lexi started to fidget. She felt restless and twitchy. She wanted to get out and go after him, though she had no idea why. Maybe it was her sense of duty bugging her\u2014if she didn\u2019t go with him, he couldn\u2019t lead her to the Sentinel compound. She would never find Helen to rescue her.</p><p>By the time he was twenty feet away, she felt like her insides were covered in mosquito bites, and it was getting harder to breathe. She itched all over, but couldn\u2019t figure out where to scratch to make it stop. Her eyes kept going back to Zach and his long, powerful strides.</p><p>She needed to follow him. Get closer.</p><p>At thirty feet, Lexi gave up caring about why she needed to go to him and just went. She jumped out of the car and grabbed her suitcase from the floor of the backseat. Every step she took toward him made some of the itchy restlessness inside her ease.</p><p>She looked at the gold bracelet dangling on her wrist and scowled. He\u2019d done it again. He\u2019d marked her, only this time, there was no way she could cover it with a tattoo to mask its power, the way her mother had taught her to do.</p><p>Lexi tried to unclasp the thing, but it wouldn\u2019t budge\u2014like it was welded shut. She tugged at it, but all she managed to do was scrape some of her skin away. Damn it!</p><p>Zach waited by his truck, holding the passenger\u2019s door open for her. He had known this would happen. She could see satisfaction glowing in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have stopped chasing me.\u201d</p><p>His strong fingers pried the suitcase from her hand, and he set it in the bed of the truck. When he leaned past her, she caught the scent of his skin, warm from the night air. He smelled spicy and completely delicious. Her head spun and she resisted the urge to grab his massive shoulders to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>It was a big mistake.</p><p>Zach whirled around and grabbed her by the waist. He lifted her up onto the high bench seat and he didn\u2019t let go. He held on to her, his big hands nearly spanning her waist. His fingers curled into her flesh, and his green eyes glowed with anger and something else she couldn\u2019t name. Something dark and desperate.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Lexi. And I don\u2019t mean that in the sense of I need you so I won\u2019t be lonely or some shit like that. I need you to live. I need you to help me keep the rest of my people alive. I\u2019m running out of time fast, and you\u2019re the only one who can save me from becoming a monster. I\u2019m not taking any chances that you\u2019ll get away again, even if it means chaining you to me.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay. She hadn\u2019t been ready for that kind of confession. Nor was she ready for the way it made her feel . . . important. Necessary. She had no family and few friends, and she\u2019d always been sure that if she disappeared no one would really notice. Maybe she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Then again, maybe this was the way the Sentinels got to their victims, telling them what they wanted to hear.</p><p>Lexi straightened her spine and stiffened her resolve to stay immune to his charms. She lifted her wrist and the gold links glinted under the security light. \u201cYou already have chained me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth lifted in a slight grin full of naked desire. \u201cNot nearly as tightly as I want to. I\u2019m trying to give you time to get used to the idea, but let me be perfectly clear. I plan on making you mine. I plan on tying you to me as close as a woman can be. I\u2019m not playing games, and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlavery. Mom was right about you. You enslave humans and bind them to do your will.\u201d</p><p>He gave an amused grunt. \u201cHardly. You\u2019ve been listening to too many bedtime stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you are, Zach. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p> <p>He slid his hands up along her spine and leaned in closer. He surrounded her with his heat and his strength, and for the first time in a long time, she felt safe. And totally confused.</p><p>His mouth was level with hers and she couldn\u2019t help but notice how soft it looked. The crazy part of her that had already been brainwashed wanted to kiss him. The sane part of her was screaming at her to run away before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cJust what do you think I am, honey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA killer.\u201d Who made her feel safe, even though she knew it was only a trick.</p><p>\u201cThat much is true,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I try to be selective about the things I kill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying you only kill the bad humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I would never purposefully hurt a human, Lexi. At least not so long as I remain myself.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that, and she was too distracted by the feel of his warm fingers stroking her nape to figure it out. Every time he touched her, it felt better. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she\u2019d lose herself. Forget her mission.</p><p>She had to get her car to the compound where he lived. She didn\u2019t dare risk taking the explosives out of her trunk for fear he\u2019d figure out what they were and ruin their plans.</p><p>\u201cRemain yourself? What, are you like Jekyll and Hyde or something?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her mouth and licked his lips. She was sure he was thinking about kissing her. And God help her, now she was thinking about it, too.</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go. It\u2019s not safe out here in the open. I feel like we\u2019re being watched.\u201d</p><p>The Defenders. She\u2019d nearly forgotten about them. They were probably watching right now, making sure she did what she\u2019d said she would. Making sure they didn\u2019t have to kill her, too. They\u2019d warned her about what would happen if she turned on them\u2014if she let the Sentinels brainwash her, too.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere safe. Where we can be alone.\u201d</p><p>Alone with Zach. Alone with his kissable mouth and sexy body. Alone with his casual strength and tempting lies.</p><p>Lexi was so screwed.</p><p>Jake Morrow watched Lexi ride away with the Sentinel, leaving her car and all the carefully prepared explosives behind. Dad was not going to be happy.</p><p>Jake tensed as he waited for his father\u2019s explosion of temper. After almost thirty years of watching, learning when to duck the blows, Jake knew it wouldn\u2019t be long in coming.</p> <p>Hector Morrow surveyed the men gathered in the small house across the street from the bar where Lexi was working. His gray brows drew together, and Jake caught himself before he took an involuntary step back. Ever since his sister, Mindy, had been killed by the Sentinels, Dad had been a mean sonofabitch, but Jake was no longer a kid to be knocked around at his father\u2019s whim. He was a grown man and knew how to hit back. Harder.</p><p>The men shifted uncomfortably under Hector\u2019s hard scowl. Most of them were young and ambitious, the sons of men who had been members of the Defenders of Humanity for years.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you was responsible for keeping her car running?\u201d asked Hector in a drill sergeant\u2019s boom.</p><p>The men looked at one another, at a loss for what to say.</p><p>Jake stepped forward. \u201cI changed her oil two days ago. If anything went wrong, it was my fault for not catching it.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s skin darkened with his fury, and Jake straightened his body to its full height\u2014two inches taller than the man who\u2019d sired him. Two inches taller and a good fifty pounds of muscles heavier. Jake was pretty sure his father hadn\u2019t failed to notice.</p><p>\u201cOur entire plan has gone to hell because you couldn\u2019t keep one lousy car running?\u201d</p><p>Jake crossed his arms over his thick chest. \u201cLexi is smart. She\u2019ll find a way to contact us. We\u2019ll fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really believe she\u2019s smart? Are you that much of a fool, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. I guess we\u2019ll just have to give it some time and see who the fool is, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Hector rubbed a hand over his crew cut. The iron gray hair was cut with such precision he could have calibrated a laser level off of it. \u201cThis was our one shot at locating the Sentinel\u2019s compound. If you\u2019ve messed it up, there\u2019s going to be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Story of Jake\u2019s life. He was used to dealing with the consequences of his actions by now. \u201cLexi will find a way to contact us and let us know where they\u2019re taking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better pray to God that\u2019s true, son. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to have to find another second-in-command. We\u2019ve never been this close to getting payback for what those bastards did to your sister. I will not tolerate failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want revenge as much as you do. We\u2019re not going to fail.\u201d Jake was sure Lexi was going to pull this off. She hated the Sentinels as much as they did, though for different reasons than the ruined crops and poisoned land they left in their wake. The Sentinels had killed her mother just like they\u2019d killed Mindy\u2014sending their pets in to tear her to pieces.</p><p>The thought of his older sister\u2019s death still had the power to keep him up at night. He\u2019d been only five, but he still remembered peeking through the slats in the bedroom closet door where she\u2019d hidden him to keep him safe. She held the rifle she\u2019d gotten for Christmas in her hands, keeping her aim steady. She\u2019d waited to fire until the last second, knowing that the point-blank shot had the best chances of taking down the huge monster. But that .22 round had been no match against the giant, clawed beast that ripped her apart. If Hector hadn\u2019t come in with more firepower, Jake would have been next.</p><p>Jake knew his dad blamed him for his sister\u2019s death as much as he blamed the Sentinels for sending the creature that killed her. And he was right to do so. Jake was the one who\u2019d stayed out in the yard playing after dark when he knew better. He was the reason that monster had found them.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to fail,\u201d said Hector, \u201cbut you might. Don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll give you any slack just because you\u2019re my son.\u201d</p><p>A sharp band of grief tightened around Jake\u2019s heart, despite the fact that he knew it would do no good. \u201cNo, Dad. That thought never even crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Joseph Rayd looked around his office at the men he trusted most. They weren\u2019t going to like what he had to tell them. Then again, that was pretty much the story of their lives these days.</p><p>As the only bonded Theronai around, Angus, Drake and Paul were the most steady men in the group. Their pain was gone, and he trusted them to think straight and to make sure he didn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks. All three of them had too much to lose to allow Joseph to do something stupid.</p><p>The others weren\u2019t so lucky. Nicholas Brand was holding up pretty well. He\u2019d been through some nasty fights, to which the multiple thin scars crossing his face could attest. But even so, he seemed to be keeping himself together. Maybe it was the puzzle of all those techno gadgets he loved that helped him block out the pain.</p><p>Iain Terra was another story entirely. Joseph had no clue what went on behind those dark eyes, but he knew that every time Joseph had needed him, Iain was there, sword in hand. The man was more than lethal. He made killing look beautiful\u2014like some kind of exotic art. Once his lifemark was barren, they were all in trouble. They needed him too much to lose him.</p><p>And then there was Tynan\u2014a Sanguinar. Like all the members of his race, he was beautifully made. Tall and lean, with icy eyes that Joseph was careful not to look into for too long. Just in case. Joseph didn\u2019t trust Tynan like he did the others in the room, but he trusted him to stay true to form. Tynan looked out for his own, and because of that\u2014because they were all in danger\u2014Joseph needed him on board.</p><p>\u201cIs this going to take long?\u201d asked Drake. \u201cI need to get back to Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cExhausted. She and Gilda have been working at repairing the wall for almost a week now, and they\u2019re running out of steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d said Angus, Gilda\u2019s husband. \u201cWe\u2019re only halfway through the broken section and the progress gets slower every day. The women aren\u2019t regaining their strength fast enough to keep going like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Andra?\u201d asked Joseph, looking at Paul.</p><p>Paul shook his head. His hair looked like he\u2019d been running his hands through it, making it a mess. \u201cAndra\u2019s great if you want to blow shit up, but she\u2019s not so good at putting it back together. She\u2019s still so new to her power, and although she\u2019s been trying, all this repair job does is frustrate and exhaust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cTake her off the wall. Put her on perimeter guard with the men. If something comes at us before the wall is back up, she can blow it up all she likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That\u2019ll help. Maybe she\u2019ll be able to spend more time with Nika that way.\u201d</p><p>Nika. Andra\u2019s younger sister. During an attack when she was a child, Nika\u2019s consciousness had been splintered and cast into the minds of dozens of sgath\u2014creatures the Synestryn used to hunt their prey. None of the Sanguinar had ever seen anything like it before and didn\u2019t know how to heal her.</p><p>What they did know was that she was capable of saving the life of one of his men. They just hadn\u2019t figured out which one. Every free man here had gone to her bedside and looked for a sign she might be compatible with them. No one saw or felt a thing.</p><p>Joseph looked to Tynan, who was one of the most gifted healers they had. \u201cHow is Nika?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still hasn\u2019t regained consciousness,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t seem to be growing any weaker. If we find her Theronai, it\u2019s possible he would help her mind heal enough that she can wake.\u201d</p><p>If they found him. So far, they hadn\u2019t had any luck. He prayed one of the Theronai from outside these walls could save her. They needed her too much to let her slip away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI\u2019ve sent out word that she\u2019s here to all the other men. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Theronai start showing up in droves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them to hurry,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer we can keep her body alive with her mind in its current state.\u201d</p><p>Joseph didn\u2019t like the idea of a bunch of strange men tromping through Nika\u2019s bedroom, but if that was what they had to do to save her, then they would. He still had men in the field who had not yet been able to return and see if Nika could save them. He wanted them to have first chance before he started bringing in Theronai from other countries. If none of them was compatible, then he\u2019d send word overseas to the strongholds there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace has been helping us keep an eye on her, and she\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d said Joseph, \u201con Tynan\u2019s advice, I\u2019ll give orders for all the Theronai to track down sgath and kill them. If parts of her mind are in the sgath, killing them may help free her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc has been doing that for days now and it appears to be helping,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d</p><p>Joseph wanted to ask more questions. He wanted to go to Nika to see if she could save him, but he didn\u2019t dare. He was the leader of the Theronai. His needs had to come last, after those of all his men. He promised himself that before he called the leaders overseas, he\u2019d go to her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about those wounded in the attack?\u201d asked Joseph, hoping to distract himself with duty.</p><p>Tynan\u2019s eyes lit with an icy glow for a split second\u2014so brief that Joseph wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d seen it. \u201cCain is still unconscious. Logan, Alexander and I are doing all we can, but it\u2019s not looking hopeful. There are a few wounded humans, all of whom will recover.\u201d</p><p>But they\u2019d lost two. Rosemary and Dylan had died protecting their son.</p><p>The weight of that loss hung heavy around Joseph\u2019s heart. Dabyr was supposed to be a place of safety and refuge. He\u2019d promised all the humans they\u2019d be safe here.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong, which made him wonder what else he\u2019d been wrong about. How many other mistakes had he made? And how many of these mistakes were going to mean the suffering and death of those he was sworn to protect?</p> <p>\u201cIf you need anything, let me know,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>Tynan gave him a formal bow of his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, on to why I\u2019ve brought you all here. It\u2019s not good news.\u201d</p><p>Drake rolled his eyes and scoffed, \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>Joseph hated speaking the words, but he had no choice. \u201cWe all believed that our walls were safe, that the Synestryn couldn\u2019t get in unless they came through the front gate. Obviously, we were wrong.\u201d</p><p>The men shifted uncomfortably. Except for Iain, who sat utterly still, his face expressionless.</p> <p>Joseph knew they were all thinking the same thing. There was no way to keep the humans here safe if those walls didn\u2019t hold. There weren\u2019t enough of them left to stand guard and still fight the war. If the walls fell, they\u2019d have to choose which vow to uphold\u2014protect the humans, or kill the Synestryn and protect the gate.</p><p>\u201cThe good news is that the wall didn\u2019t fall because it was weak, or because the magic embedded in it had failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d asked Drake.</p><p>A bitter taste flooded Joseph\u2019s mouth. \u201cSomeone inside Dabyr let them in. They sabotaged the protective stones and created an opening.\u201d</p><p>Thick, stifling silence filled the room. It had taken Joseph hours to digest the news Nicholas had given him. He figured he owed his men at least a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d asked Iain, punctuating the question with the hissing ring of steel on steel as he drew his sword.</p><p>Joseph held up a staying hand. \u201cStand down, Iain. We don\u2019t know. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn this?\u201d asked Angus. The lines on his face deepened with fear. He had more to lose here than anyone\u2014both a wife and a child. The only Theronai child left to them.</p> <p>Joseph looked at Nicholas and gave him a slight nod.</p><p>Nicholas rose gracefully to his feet. \u201cI went over the video surveillance of the attack. The breach happened at a point covered by two cameras. Both of them had been disabled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t some sort of glitch?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cYes. I went back through the video to the point where the cameras stopped working. They were disabled one at a time. Whoever did it was visible on some of the hidden cameras, but they knew enough about our security to keep their face averted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Iain in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I got some footage of the back of his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>Nicholas flicked a nervous glance at Joseph. Iain\u2019s sword was still out, gleaming with lethal intent.</p><p>\u201cPut the blade away, Iain,\u201d ordered Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d said Iain. His voice was cold and steady, just like his dark gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to kill anyone until we are sure who this is and question them. Now put the sword away.\u201d</p><p>Iain sheathed his sword.</p><p>Nicholas opened his laptop computer and typed in a few keystrokes. He spun the thing around so the rest of the room could see the video footage. The image was clear, but there wasn\u2019t much to go on\u2014just a few flashes of the back of a man\u2019s covered head. One shot of a gloved hand.</p><p>\u201cAnyone recognize him?\u201d asked Nicholas.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s someone who lives here?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cCould it have been an intruder?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I checked all the entries through the front gate for the ten days leading up to the attack and he doesn\u2019t fit any of the people who came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be a human,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It\u2019s hard to tell just what his build was like under the baggy sweatshirt, but he could have disguised himself\u2014made himself look bigger so we\u2019d think it was one of our own.\u201d</p><p>Tynan had been quiet through all of this, but Joseph saw the slight frown marring his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Tynan?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI can find out if any of the humans know about this. All I have to do is feed from them and search their memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might look suspicious,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cNot now. Not when there are so many still wounded and in need of aid. Put out the call for blood, and that will help mask our true task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else helping you with this. I don\u2019t want anyone outside of this room to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThen I suggest you don\u2019t let any of the other Sanguinar heal you. If you\u2019re in need, you must call me, or the others will learn what you\u2019re trying to hide.\u201d</p><p>Joseph didn\u2019t like that one bit. Neither did any of his men, judging by their looks of disgust.</p><p>\u201cWe have no privacy with you leeches around,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>\u201cBut the dozens of cameras and electronic locks that track your comings and goings are agreeable?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t screw with our heads,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>Tynan held up his hands. His fingers were long and elegant, like he was born to be an artist or surgeon. \u201cAll I mean is that a secret like this doesn\u2019t stay secret for long. Not in a place like this. We need to find out who this man is fast or he\u2019ll be gone before we can. Assuming he isn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cNicholas, I want you to compile everything you can on this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on it. I\u2019m also working on a program that will try to identify him based on his appearance by comparing his movements on this video with current images the cameras pick up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d asked Angus.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s not a hundred percent, but it will help weed out people who couldn\u2019t possibly be our guy. I figure if we can get our list down to a couple dozen possibilities, it will make things a lot easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cIn the meantime, I want you all to keep your eyes and ears open and your mouths shut. Angus, Paul and Drake, try to keep this from the women if you can. They have enough on their plates right now without having to worry about this, too.\u201d</p><p>The three bonded Theronai nodded their agreement.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we do find him,\u201d said Iain in a cold, emotionless tone, \u201cyou all can have your fun with him and question him all you like, but when you\u2019re done with him, he\u2019s mine to kill.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t take Lexi to the compound as she had hoped. Instead, he pulled up into the driveway of a modest farmhouse just north of the Texas-Oklahoma border, well off the beaten path.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d she asked, eyeing the house. It was dark inside, but the light on the front porch was burning bright in welcome. No way was it big enough to be the compound she and the Defenders were after. There were supposed to be dozens of these guys running around.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of our Gerai houses. We\u2019ll be safe here so we can get some rest,\u201d said Zach. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p><p>She was tired, but only because she\u2019d been working every shift available for the past week. She knew after her phone call to Zach, she wouldn\u2019t have much time, and she needed enough money to keep her and Helen safe once they were free. \u201cI can take a turn driving. Just tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Zach slanted her a suspicious look. \u201cYou just want my keys so you can run away again.\u201d</p><p>She held up her bracelet and waved it at him. \u201cHow can I run when I\u2019m wearing this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but if anyone could find a way, it would be you. I wouldn\u2019t put it past you to gnaw your own hand off if that\u2019s what it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I\u2019ve spent way too many weeks hunting you to make the same mistake twice. But on the off chance that you find a way, I want you to have this.\u201d He pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and handed her a thick stack of bills. Hundred-dollar bills.</p><p>Lexi looked at the money, staring at it. There had to be nearly two thousand dollars here. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cIf you are on your own again\u2014if anything happens to me\u2014I don\u2019t want you to have to take a job at a seedy place like that one. I bet the men there like to paw at your ass, and I just can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d never had this much money at one time in her life.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it,\u201d she finally managed to squeak out. She held the money out to him.</p><p>Zach took it, folded it in half and shoved it into the front pocket of her apron. \u201cYou might need it. I don\u2019t. Just consider it payment for all that gas I made you burn running away from me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could find an answer to that, he got out of the truck and grabbed her suitcase from the back. Lexi watched him shove the keys deep in his front pocket. She wanted to know where they were in case she did make it out of this mess. Not that it was likely. Unless there were some bolt cutters or maybe even wire snips in that house. Gold was soft enough that even a sturdy pair of scissors might get her somewhere.</p><p>And even if she did get free, what then? This was her opportunity to save Helen\u2014to take out a bunch of dangerous maniacs before they could kidnap anyone else. She couldn\u2019t run away from that. She couldn\u2019t leave Helen to fend for herself.</p><p>Zach opened her door and offered her a hand down. He had nice hands. Strong, wide hands with just enough roughness to make her more sensitive skin tingle when he touched her.</p><p>When. Not if. She\u2019d been with him all of three hours and she\u2019d already lost it. At this rate, she\u2019d be kissing his ass by dawn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which didn\u2019t sound like an entirely bad thing. If his ass was as nice under his jeans as it looked, she could really enjoy herself.</p><p>Lexi pulled in a deep breath, reaching for her resolve\u2014her freaking sanity. She couldn\u2019t let him get to her, no matter how appealing the package. She couldn\u2019t let him hug her anymore. She couldn\u2019t let him touch her. She couldn\u2019t let him make her want things she knew weren\u2019t real.</p><p>Helen was real. The danger was real. The rest of it\u2014the tingly sensations she got when he touched her\u2014was just pretend. A trick of the mind.</p><p>She ignored his offered hand and jumped out of the truck, landing on his booted toe.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even flinch. Instead, he gave her a knowing smile. \u201cAm I getting to you, honey? Maybe grating up against that independent streak of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing about me. Don\u2019t pretend like you do.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the door, felt behind the porch light and pulled out a small magnetic box holding a key. \u201cI know plenty. Helen has told me all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen doesn\u2019t know me that well, either. I\u2019ve only known her for a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell that by the way she talks. I swear she acts like you grew up together.\u201d Zach opened the door and peered inside before letting Lexi enter. \u201cShe worries about you a lot, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi refused to let him see how much that bothered her. Helen was the one in trouble, and yet she worried about Lexi? There wasn\u2019t a more caring person on the face of this planet, and Lexi felt honored to have known Helen, even for as short a time as she had. With any luck at all, they\u2019d have plenty of time to really get to know each other. \u201cYou should call her and tell her I\u2019m coming. Better yet, let me use your phone and I\u2019ll tell her myself.\u201d</p><p>Zach stared at her for a long moment, making her want to squirm under his pale gaze. Finally, he unclipped his phone from his belt and handed it to her. \u201cNo funny stuff,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike calling the police. I don\u2019t have time to deal with them, and I swear that if you make me, I\u2019m going to turn you over my knee and spank you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. He was insane if he thought she\u2019d let that happen. She\u2019d kill him first. \u201cYou could try. But I promise you wouldn\u2019t try twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little thing like you hurt me? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall we test that theory?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>He grinned and winked. \u201cMaybe later. After I\u2019ve eaten. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to need to keep my strength up with you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Zach left the room, flipping on lights as he made his way to the kitchen. Lexi waited until his head was in the fridge before she dialed Helen\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cDid you find her, Zach?\u201d answered Helen. Her voice wavered with fatigue, making Lexi wonder just how much she\u2019d been through. \u201cIs she safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey ya, Helen. It\u2019s Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s relieved exhale filled the line. \u201cThank God, you\u2019re okay. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t paying any attention to her, but she guessed he was still listening to every word she said. She couldn\u2019t very well tell Helen that the terrified phone call she\u2019d made last week was a trick\u2014a way to get Zach to come for her.</p> <p>And it had worked. Better than she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cAll you need to know now is that I\u2019m coming to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! I\u2019ve really missed you. So has Miss Mabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s there, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The Sentinels couldn\u2019t clean away her memories enough to make it safe for her to live in her home, so they brought her here. They even managed to heal some of her arthritis so she doesn\u2019t even need a walker anymore. Pretty cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>Lexi was speechless. They\u2019d healed Miss Mabel? Why would they do that? She was too old to fight anything they wanted to do to her. They could have fed from her, taken all her blood and left her for dead in her home. No one would have ever known who had murdered her.</p><p>\u201cLexi? Are you still there?\u201d</p><p>Lexi cleared her throat. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Just . . . figuring some things out.\u201d</p><p>Helen lowered her voice. \u201cIs Zach okay? He wasn\u2019t doing so well last time we talked to him.\u201d</p><p>Lexi glanced into the kitchen. He was slicing an apple. Watching her.</p><p>She turned around and moved away from the doorway, down the narrow hall. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be right, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really long story, but I swear it has a great ending. Just listen to your instincts and you\u2019ll be fine. You both will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense, Helen.\u201d Then again, why would she? She\u2019d been mind-fucked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not now, but give it some time. He\u2019s a good man. He deserves to be happy. They all do.\u201d</p><p>Happy? Clearly, the Helen Lexi had known was gone. She\u2019d been completely turned around, brainwashed into believing whatever they told her. It took every bit of strength Lexi had not to let the tears stinging her eyes fall. She was too late. Even if she got Helen out of there, she wasn\u2019t sure she could save her.</p><p>The Defenders had warned her this might happen, but until now, Lexi hadn\u2019t wanted to believe it.</p><p>\u201cIf you have anything there you can\u2019t part with, pack it and be ready to go,\u201d said Lexi. Her voice broke, but she held the tears back. \u201cHave Miss Mabel do the same.\u201d She had no idea how she\u2019d get both of them free, but she had to try. She couldn\u2019t leave Miss Mabel behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d asked Helen.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk now. I\u2019ll tell you everything when I get there.\u201d Assuming she managed to get Helen away from her captor long enough to talk privately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but I\u2019m not leaving Drake. I love him.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was ready for her resistance. She knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy to extract Helen from their clutches. \u201cI won\u2019t make you,\u201d lied Lexi. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d asked Helen. \u201cI know you\u2019re planning something. I can hear the gears in your head turning from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning anything.\u201d Another lie, but a necessary one. \u201cJust forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t trust these guys, but you\u2019ll see when you get here how wrong you were. They\u2019re not the monsters you think. I swear. I was wrong about my vision. About Drake. He\u2019d never stand by and watch me die.\u201d</p><p>Of course that was what she\u2019d say. They\u2019d probably tricked Helen into believing her vision of her own death wasn\u2019t real. They\u2019d made her believe it, just like they made her believe that Miss Mabel was alive and well when she was probably lying dead on the floor of her house in Kansas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d said Lexi, just to appease Helen. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Drake\u2019s a great teacher. I\u2019m sure Zach will be, too.\u201d</p><p>Over Lexi\u2019s dead body.</p><p>She felt Zach\u2019s eyes sweep over her a moment before the heat of his body soaked into her skin. She hadn\u2019t heard him approach, but he was standing right behind her, almost touching her.</p><p>For how long? What had he heard?</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, Helen. See you soon.\u201d Lexi hung up the phone and handed it back to him.</p><p>He was close. Too close. And he looked angry.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see her, Lexi?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr are you planning something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that if you let me live long enough, then yes, I\u2019m going to see Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I let you live long enough?\u201d Zach scrubbed a hand over his face in frustration. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I\u2019m not going to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He could say it until the sun winked out and she still wouldn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWhat\u2019s left of my mother is buried in San Antonio. She\u2019s the only family I had. I\u2019d like to be buried beside her if it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>His face darkened, and she heard his back teeth grind together. \u201cNo one is going to be burying you anywhere. Not while I still draw breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what the Sentinels told my mother, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d whispered Zach. \u201cYou\u2019ve really been through hell, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t even bring herself to nod. He knew the truth. He\u2019d probably been part of the torment her mother had been through\u2014part of the reason Lexi had been dragged from one place to another for as long as she could remember.</p><p>The anger melted from his features and he cupped the side of her face in his hand. Concern wrinkled his dark forehead and shone bright in his pale eyes, making them glow. His thumb feathered lightly over her cheek-bone, stroking her skin until it tingled.</p><p>This felt too good to be real. She tried to remember that, but still, it took every ounce of willpower she had not to lean into his touch. Not to lose herself in the comforting warmth of his caress.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot. All I can say is that part of your life is over now. I\u2019m not going to let anything hurt you ever again.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt the strength of his resolve wash over her. His words were a promise given by a man with unnatural power. Her mother\u2019s journal said that meant he had to keep that promise.</p><p>Then again, maybe that was just one more lie they\u2019d designed to make humans complacent and manageable.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she told him. She\u2019d meant to put more heat into her words, but they\u2019d come out as a breathless whisper.</p><p>He shifted his stance, closing the distance between them. The intoxicating heat of his body soaked through her clothes and into her skin. His spicy scent wrapped around her, making her head spin. Tingling sparks of energy spilled from his hand where it cradled her face. The urge to rub herself up against him to absorb more of that energy was driving her mad. She couldn\u2019t think straight when he was using these weapons against her. All she could think about was how to get closer to him.</p><p>Lexi licked her dry lips. Zach\u2019s eyes zeroed in on the small movement. His pupils dilated, swallowing up the pale green until only a thin rim of color remained. He looked hungry, like the predator he was, but Lexi couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>Her fingers clenched around hard muscle, and until then, she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d reached for him. She was holding his arms, gripping his biceps like a lifeline. He was vibrating with tension beneath her fingertips. She felt his muscles bunch and shift and then his arm was around her body, pulling her closer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to fight him. She didn\u2019t push him away. And she didn\u2019t know why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head lowered until his nose was only a scant inch from hers. Lexi\u2019s breathing sped, and her heart kicked hard. He was going to kiss her and she was going to let him. God help her, she needed him to kiss her. She didn\u2019t even care anymore that it was a trick. She wanted him too much to care.</p><p>His hand slid from her cheek to the back of her head. He tilted her head back so it was at a better angle. She could feel his big body shaking with need. Or maybe she was the one doing all the shaking. She couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m going to kiss you now, right?\u201d he asked, his deep voice low in the quiet house.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t speak. She gave a slight nod of her head. Not only did she know it, she craved it.</p> <p>Zach closed the distance another minute fraction of an inch. Lexi closed her eyes and gave in. He was her enemy, but it hardly seemed to matter anymore. If she was doomed, she wanted to go out like this\u2014kissing a man who made her blood race and her body melt.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust like you\u2019re wrong about all the rest.\u201d</p><p>With that, he let go of her and stepped away.</p><p>Lexi had to grab onto the wall to steady herself. Her head was reeling and her body was aching with the loss of his touch. She opened her eyes just in time to see him close a bedroom door behind him. She slid down the wall until she was sitting on the faded carpet, hugging her knees.</p><p>He didn\u2019t come back out. He didn\u2019t attack her. He didn\u2019t do anything. He just stayed locked behind that door.</p> <p>Lexi waited in agony. She shivered with cold and confusion. Why hadn\u2019t he kissed her? She would have let him. Hell, she would have let him do a lot more than just kiss her.</p><p>And what did he mean about her being wrong about all the rest?</p><p>As the fog of lust faded from her mind, she realized that this was a good thing. She didn\u2019t want him to kiss her or do anything else. He was the enemy. She wanted to kill him.</p><p>Didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Lexi covered her face with her hands and let out a frustrated growl. He\u2019d done this to her on purpose. He was using his evil magic to confuse her. To manipulate her.</p><p>This was what the Sentinels did. They tricked their prey into compliance. They used them and then they killed them. Her mother\u2019s journal had been clear about that.</p> <p>Then why had he stopped? Zach had her where he wanted her. Why stop there?</p><p>Lexi pushed herself up onto her wobbly legs. She needed to think\u2014to get away from him long enough to clear her head. She couldn\u2019t run away because she had to finish her mission and rescue Helen, but she could put enough space between her and Zach so her brain would start working again.</p><p>She turned to go find something to snip this bracelet off her wrist when she heard a deep groan of pain coming from behind Zach\u2019s door. It stopped as if cut short; then there was a thud like something heavy had landed on the floor. Maybe a two-hundred-plus-pound man?</p><p>What if he was hurt?</p><p>Lexi was reaching for the doorknob before she realized that this was probably another trick. Put her off balance, then make her come running to him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to work. She wasn\u2019t going to fall for a con like that. Her mother had taught her well, and it was about time Lexi started listening.</p><p>She heard another groan filter through the door and had to cover her ears. Her feet felt heavy and her stomach twisted with nausea, but she managed to walk away from Zach without looking back.</p><p>Zach was dying.</p> <p>His body heaved under another wave of pain so intense it blinded him. Sweat soaked his clothes and the clinging fabric grated against his skin until he was sure he was bleeding. He tried to crawl into the bathroom to wash the blood away so it couldn\u2019t draw the Synestryn to Lexi, but he was too weak. His limbs shook and even pulling in another breath left him exhausted.</p><p>He was such a fool. He should have never walked away from her like that. He\u2019d been so close to kissing her\u2014so close to claiming her as his own\u2014but something held him back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust him. He wanted to prove to her she could, and the only way he could think to do it was to show her his restraint.</p><p>Bad plan.</p><p>And now he was paying the price. He\u2019d had his chance to taste her sweet mouth and walked away from it, and it was killing him. Literally.</p><p>Another pulverizing wave of pain slammed into him and forced the air from his lungs. Tears streamed down his face, cooling his hot skin. Every muscle in his body quivered under the force of resisting the agony of his swelling power. Huge fists of energy pounded on his insides, demanding that he go to Lexi and force her to let it out. Make the pain stop.</p><p>But it was too late for that. He couldn\u2019t go to her now. He couldn\u2019t even lift his head. All he could do was lie there and listen to the pitiful sounds of pain welling up from his throat.</p><p>He was pretty sure it would be the last thing he heard.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Lexi stood on the front porch. It was as far as she could go without feeling that nagging itchiness the bracelet caused when she moved away from Zach.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to clear her head, but all she could think about was the noises she\u2019d heard coming from his room.</p><p>He was in pain.</p><p>She told herself she didn\u2019t care. She told herself that he deserved it for all the lives he\u2019d ruined.</p><p>Well, you\u2019re wrong. Just like you\u2019re wrong about all the rest.</p><p>What had he meant by that? What was she wrong about? Was it just another trick?</p><p>He could have kissed her. He could have used his bad mojo to enslave her right there in the hallway and she wouldn\u2019t have done a thing to stop him. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Damn it. This was all too confusing. He\u2019d turned her world upside down, making her question what she\u2019d been taught all her life.</p><p>Well, there was one way to find out if he was playing her, and she was going to call his bluff.</p><p>Lexi marched back into the house, found a nice, sharp knife in the kitchen and flung Zach\u2019s door open.</p><p>The room was dark. She flipped on the light switch.</p><p>At first, she thought he wasn\u2019t even in here anymore because she didn\u2019t see him. Then she heard a sound coming from the far side of the bed\u2014a low gurgling sound like he was choking.</p><p>Lexi hurried around the bed and found him lying on his side, curled into a tight ball. He was sweating and shaking, and his eyes were rolled up in his head like he was having some kind of seizure or something.</p><p>Panic slid through her limbs, taking over. She dropped the knife and knelt beside him. Her hands moved over his arms and up to his face. She had no idea what to do to help him, but she remembered hearing somewhere about people choking on their own tongue.</p><p>She moved his head so she could see into his mouth, but the instant her fingers touched his cheek, the gurgling noise stopped. He pulled in a deep, shuddering breath and his body stopped shaking.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes rolled around like they were loose in his skull, but apparently, he\u2019d been able to see she was there.</p><p>\u201cLexi,\u201d he whispered, his voice rough and ragged like he\u2019d been screaming for hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said, at a total loss.</p><p>His hands fumbled blindly over her body until he found her bare arms; then he pulled her to him. Lexi didn\u2019t fight him. Whatever was happening to him, he seemed better now, and she didn\u2019t want to mess that up, as stupid as it seemed.</p><p>She let him arrange her body until she was lying on her side, facing away from him. He curled himself around her and held on tight. A few seconds later, she felt him tug on the back of her shirt until her lower back was bare; then he pulled the front of his shirt up. Lexi tried to straighten her clothes, but he blocked her attempts and pulled her back against him until bare skin met bare skin.</p><p>His skin was hot and damp, tight over his corded muscles, and a flood of energy sank into her spine, sapping her will to move. It felt too good to fight him. She was totally out of her element here and nothing in Mom\u2019s journal had said anything about feeling like this. It was like touching happiness. Blissful contentment.</p><p>Zach\u2019s chest vibrated with a satisfied growl and she knew then that he was feeling it, too. Whatever this thing between them was, it was good. Maybe it was just one more trick designed to enslave her, but she really didn\u2019t care. She was too sleepy to care.</p><p>She\u2019d give him ten minutes. Then she\u2019d move away. He\u2019d be better by then and she would leave him and find her bearings. She\u2019d read Mom\u2019s journal and remember why she was supposed to stay away from him\u2014why she shouldn\u2019t let him touch her.</p><p>It was only ten minutes. She was sure that small amount of time wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Nika watched Madoc through the trees. His powerful body was protected by a heavy leather jacket that did nothing to hide the bunch and swell of his muscles as he cut down the sgath that crossed his path.</p><p>In a small corner of the beast\u2019s mind that she now occupied, sadness and anger rose up at the death of its brothers. It wanted to lunge at Madoc and rip out his throat. It wanted to drink down his rich blood and feast on his flesh until there was nothing left but bones.</p><p>Nika gathered her will and forced the beast to remain still while she used it. She ignored its need to kill, and watched as Madoc sliced another sgath in two.</p><p>He moved so beautifully\u2014a deadly, fluid grace that made her feel protected just knowing he was near. If only her human body hadn\u2019t been so weak, she would have gone to him and told him how much she needed him, asked him why he no longer came to touch her hand.</p><p>The mouth of the sgath she inhabited moved and she realized she was trying to speak to him. Of course, no human words could come out of her muzzle, and all she managed to do was let out a low growl.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s head swiveled her way. His sword was dripping with black blood, and he had to step over the furred bodies of the beasts he\u2019d slain to come closer.</p><p>He moved cautiously, his eyes narrowing in the darkness of the forest. A snarl twisted his blunt features as he closed the distance between them. He was only feet away from her now, and a thrill ran through Nika\u2019s borrowed body.</p><p>She wanted him to touch her. To hold her.</p><p>She tried to tell him, but again, the words could not come out. How was she going to reach him?</p><p>\u201cI see you, you furry fucker,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away now.\u201d</p><p>He was going to kill her\u2014or at least he was going to kill the body she now inhabited. As much as she hated feeling Madoc strike her down, she also knew it was safer for him if she stayed in the sgath\u2019s mind until he struck, holding the beast from attacking him.</p><p>Nika couldn\u2019t watch. She closed the sgath\u2019s eyes and froze it in place. The bite of the blade across her shoulder made her flinch and she heard herself let out an eerie howl of pain. Another hot slice of pain went through her chest and this time, she felt her heart sputter as blood spilled out of it, wetting her fur.</p><p>She opened her eyes, hoping Madoc would see some piece of her inside the sgath, but instead, she saw some huge, hulking beast high in the trees over his head. It had six eyes and they were all staring right at Madoc, glowing with hungry fire.</p><p>The sgath was nearly dead, and she leapt from its mind before it took her with it.</p><p>As she passed by Madoc, she tried to whisper in his ear that he was in danger, but made no sound. She tried to stroke his skin and warn him, but felt nothing. She was less than air and so light, she was already being sucked back into her wasted human body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t help him here. She had to get back out into the night and find a way to tell him he was being hunted.</p><p>Nika\u2019s real eyes opened and she was in a room she vaguely recognized. Not the hospital, but Andra\u2019s new home.</p><p>The sweet woman who\u2019d been caring for her body sat in the corner, knitting. She had a halo of dark curls, and sad brown eyes. Her fingers moved fast and sure, and stitch after stitch was left in their wake.</p><p>Grace. That was her name. Grace would help her.</p> <p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d said Nika. Her voice was thin and ragged, barely audible in the silent room.</p><p>Grace\u2019s head snapped up and her eyes locked on Nika\u2019s. They widened in surprise; then she rose from her chair and came to Nika\u2019s side, letting her knitting fall to the carpet.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d said Grace. \u201cDon\u2019t try to speak yet. Let me get you some water first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time. Madoc is in danger.\u201d</p><p>Grace poured water into a plastic cup and held a straw to Nika\u2019s lips. \u201cHave a drink.\u201d</p> <p>Nika drank just to get the woman to listen. \u201cCall Madoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I don\u2019t know his number. Let me get your sister.\u201d</p><p>Andra had listened to her before. She would again. Grace dialed a number. \u201cNika\u2019s awake. She wants to call Madoc.\u201d</p><p>Nika heard the faint buzz of Andra\u2019s voice through the plastic.</p><p>Grace looked at Nika. \u201cWhat do you want her to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook up in the trees. Above him.\u201d</p> <p>Although she looked confused, Grace repeated what Nika had said to Andra, then, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d She hung up and sat on the edge of the bed. Her fingers stroked the back of Nika\u2019s hand\u2014the first real contact she\u2019d felt in a long time. \u201cAndra\u2019s on her way. She\u2019s calling Madoc right now, and doesn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>How could Nika not worry? Madoc was out there alone. If anything happened to him . . .</p><p>\u201cHave another sip of water,\u201d urged Grace.</p><p>Her lips felt dry and her body was almost too weak to swallow, but she did as she was told.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d asked Grace.</p><p>\u201cI need to go back out there with Madoc. He needs me.\u201d A frantic sense of doom settled over her, weighing her down. She couldn\u2019t lose him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a skilled warrior.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t understand. No one did except Andra, and she only listened sometimes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go back to sleep\u2014go find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d said Grace. \u201cJust stay awake until Andra gets here. Let her talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s eyes were heavy. Being awake was hard. She felt so alone when she wasn\u2019t with him.</p><p>The door flew open and Andra stood there, breathing hard and pink from exertion. \u201cNika, baby,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>Andra crossed the room and Grace moved out of the way.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Madoc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him about the monster in the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d already found it and killed it by the time I called him.\u201d</p><p>Relief poured through Nika like cool water, washing away her panic. She clutched Andra\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Andra gave her a teary smile. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired. I want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay here, baby. You\u2019re not strong enough to travel yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take my body,\u201d explained Nika.</p><p>Andra frowned at her and smoothed her hair back from her head. From the corner where Grace was hovering came, \u201cDo you want me to call Tynan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tell him Nika\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Tynan. I want Madoc.\u201d No one listened to her and Nika started to wonder if her mouth in this body was working right.</p><p>She was slipping back into sleep, unable to stop it from sweeping her mind away. She wanted to stay awake so she could see him, but that was no longer possible. She was too weak to even go seeking out one of the sgath.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d soothed Andra. \u201cI\u2019ll bring him here. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Madoc,\u201d said Nika as she drifted away from the world.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Zach was dead. He knew he had to be, because he\u2019d been alive for centuries and nothing he\u2019d experienced had ever felt this good.</p><p>He cracked open his eyes and saw the top of Lexi\u2019s head. Her soft brown hair was a total mess, like he\u2019d been rubbing his face over the fine strands for hours, tangling them with his beard stubble. Based on the bright light of day filtering in from beneath the curtains, that might have been the case.</p><p>His body was curved around hers, touching in as many places as possible. She was warm and pliant, and the feel of her sweet ass pressing against his hard dick was enough to make him believe in heaven. His arm was wrapped tightly around her, holding her in place, and his fingers had sneaked up under her shirt to curl over her ribs, right below her breast. The feel of naked Lexi skin under his hand was too good to be true. He had to be dead, or dreaming.</p><p>Slowly, the fog filling his head started to burn off enough for him to take in his surroundings. He wasn\u2019t dead. He was lying on the floor of the Gerai house with only the outdated carpet to cushion their bodies. It wasn\u2019t nearly soft enough for Lexi, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure yet how to fix it. His brain was still fuzzy and his blood simmered with a slow burn of sexual arousal.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t had sex. He knew it for a fact because there was no way he would have forgotten something like that. Besides, they were both still dressed and on the floor. Zach liked to think he was suave enough to at least have put her on a bed before taking her.</p><p>So, if he hadn\u2019t seduced her, how had he gotten her here?</p><p>The last thing he remembered was pain. Mountains of it crashing down on top of him, crushing the life from his body. He wasn\u2019t sure how he survived it, but he really didn\u2019t care. As long as she was here, in his arms, the pain was all worth it.</p><p>Lexi shifted in her sleep, reaching up like she was searching for a pillow. Zach moved his arm so it cushioned her cheek and she settled back to sleep.</p><p>She said she didn\u2019t trust him. The gleam of a large knife lying at her feet proved she\u2019d meant it. So why was she here, lying next to him?</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t question his good fortune. She was here and that was enough.</p><p>He yawned, ready to settle down for another few hours of rest with the woman of his dreams. The expansion of his chest pressed him tighter to her back and she went stiff in his arms.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d woken her up.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered over her hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you. Go back to sleep, honey.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Lexi had other plans. She pushed herself up and Zach let her go. It was too early for a wrestling match, and every muscle in his body still ached from whatever had happened to him last night.</p><p>She scrambled away from him until she was pressed against the wall. Instantly, his body tensed against a wave of pain. He sucked in a breath and tried to relax into it, let it wash over him. He knew how to deal with pain. He could do this.</p><p>In an effort to distract himself, he stared at Lexi. Her hair was a disaster and her eyes were puffy from sleep, but she was still the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen. He could wake up to a sight like that every day for eternity and still not have enough.</p><p>She rubbed her eyes and looked at him from head to toe. Her gaze paused, widened and backed up as she saw his erection, but there was nothing he could do about that. So she knew he wanted her. It wasn\u2019t exactly a big secret.</p><p>A frown creased her brow and she rubbed the spot under her breast where his hand had been while they slept. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His muscles were locked up, hard and painful, and his dick was even worse, but he could deal with all of that. What he couldn\u2019t deal with was the look of fear Lexi wore.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cYour pants are still on, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and her fingers moved to the waistband of her jeans, which were still securely buttoned. Hell, she still had on that short, pocketed apron from work. Some of the coins had spilled out onto the carpet while she slept, so Zach collected them and handed them to her.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t take them. She stared at his hand and stood, putting even more distance between them.</p><p>Great. Back to square one.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Lexi,\u201d he said. There was a hint of begging in his voice and he hated it. He\u2019d never had to beg for anything in his life. \u201cI could have done whatever horrible thing you think me capable of last night if I\u2019d wanted to, but I didn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that prove to you I\u2019m not going to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trick. Your skin is poisonous. Drugged. That\u2019s why it feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Zach was hung up on the making her feel good part for a second longer than he should have been. The idea he could do that to her made his blood heat. She\u2019d inadvertently told him how to get to her, and he had every intention of exploiting the weakness.</p><p>Lexi was meant to be his, and now he knew how to convince her it was true, too.</p><p>He tried to hide his slow smile of victory, but based on the way her dark eyes widened, he was pretty sure he\u2019d failed. \u201cIt\u2019s not poison, honey. It\u2019s chemistry. You and I are meant to be together and that feeling is nature\u2019s way of letting us know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Zach ignored the insult and stood. She shifted her hips, signaling her intent to run, but he moved fast, blocking her in. She was trapped between the wall and his body and he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>He caged her in with one arm while he drew his finger lightly over her cheek. She was too soft to be real, and his eyes fell shut so he could soak in more of her. Little sparks of power arced between them, bleeding off a minute portion of the energy churning inside Zach. Some of the pain bled away with it. His finger slid lower until he traced a path over her throat, where his luceria would soon be.</p><p>Lexi let out a soft moan, though whether it was pleasure or fear he couldn\u2019t tell. He could hear her rapid breathing, and feel the brittle tension tightening her limbs. His hand spread out across her throat until he could feel the delicate ridges of her collarbone beneath his fingers.</p><p>More sparks wriggled into her body and she sucked in a fast breath.</p><p>Zach looked down at her. His dark skin stood out in stark contrast against the paleness of hers. Even in dim light, Zach would be able to see his hands sliding over her body, pleasing her.</p><p>He could hardly wait.</p><p>Her head was tilted to the side, and her hands were tight fists. Her body vibrated in time with the faint current of power trickling into her from his palm.</p><p>He wanted to kiss her, but his instincts told him that restraint was the best way to get to his ultimate goal. Once she was his, he\u2019d have forever to kiss her, to touch her.</p><p>\u201cStill think I\u2019m lying?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>Her eyes were the color of bittersweet chocolate and when she looked up at him, for just a moment, he thought he saw a flash of insecurity. \u201cPlease stop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo what, honey?\u201d</p><p>Lexi wrapped her fingers around his wrist. Her hands were small, but her fingers were graceful and strong. She tried to tug his hand away, but Zach didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you seduce me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We\u2019re going to be good together. I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zach leaned over her and put his mouth near her ear. \u201cOh, yes. You and I were made for each other. The sooner you accept that, the more time I\u2019ll have to make you come. You want that, don\u2019t you?\u201d He punctuated the question with a pulse of energy so powerful he could hear it crackle.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She bit her bottom lip between her teeth and he could feel her heart hammering faster beneath his hand.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me. Let me show you how good it can be for us.\u201d He slid his tongue along the curve of her ear, making her shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cJust let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I have to pee.\u201d</p> <p>It was an escape tactic and he knew it. He should have known she wasn\u2019t going to make any of this easy on him.</p><p>Zach sighed and grudgingly backed away. Lexi fled his arms, stumbling as she headed for the bathroom.</p><p>His dick ached with need, but it was going to just keep on aching.</p><p>He\u2019d almost had her. He was sure of it. He\u2019d felt her resolve crumbling. In fact, he was amazed that she\u2019d been able to walk away. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t walking anywhere for a while. Not until he got himself under control.</p><p>The toilet flushed, the faucet turned on and off again and yet she still didn\u2019t come out.</p><p>Zach sighed. Apparently, their chase was not yet over. Part of him thrilled at the idea of chasing her, but the rest of him was just tired and hurting too much to want this to go on.</p> <p>He rubbed his chest. The single leaf on his lifemark had withered more since yesterday. It was time for her to stop running.</p><p>He stood in front of the door and crossed his arms over his chest. There was no window in there. No way out but the one she went in.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stay in there forever, and when she came out, he\u2019d be waiting.</p><p>Lexi pressed the wet cloth over her face, hoping it would cool her fevered skin.</p><p>What the hell had she been thinking, letting him touch her like that? Was she insane?</p><p>Yes. Without question. She was totally certifiable.</p><p>She scrubbed viciously at her ear, trying to rub away the feel of his hot tongue gliding over her skin. Just the memory of it made her knees weak enough she had to lock them to stay upright. Whatever magic Zach was using on her was potent stuff. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to be able to resist him long enough to rescue Helen, but she had to find a way.</p><p>The Defenders had warned her this would be hard, but until now, she\u2019d figured they just didn\u2019t know her very well. Because she was small, people saw her as weak and fragile. She was anything but.</p> <p>Except where Zach was concerned.</p><p>Lexi growled in frustration, turned on the cold water and dunked her head under the faucet. The chill drove the breath from her lungs, but at least it helped clear her head of the fog Zach had filled it with.</p><p>She had to think. Come up with a plan. It wasn\u2019t like she had to resist him for a year or anything\u2014just long enough to get them to the compound. The Defenders were sure it was somewhere in the Midwest, so she didn\u2019t have that far to go with Zach. Maybe a day\u2019s drive.</p><p>Just one day. She could keep his tongue off her ears\u2014or her anywhere else\u2014for that long.</p><p>\u201cNeed someone to wash your back, honey?\u201d came Zach\u2019s deep voice through the door.</p><p>Even his voice made her body soften along with her resolve. She needed to gag him, or maybe plug her ears. And she definitely needed more clothes on. The less bare skin she had for him to touch, the better.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen. Anything else I can get you?\u201d</p><p>Some dry panties sounded nice, but she wasn\u2019t about to tell him that. \u201cMy suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, honey. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gone nearly long enough before she heard his hard knuckles tapping on the door. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it outside the door.\u201d</p><p>Sultry amusement colored his voice. \u201cAfraid the big, bad wolf is going to eat you all up?\u201d</p><p>Only if she was really lucky. It had been way too long since she\u2019d been with a man, and this thing Zach did to her was reminding her just how much she\u2019d been missing. Even the insinuation of him kissing and licking her was enough to make her dizzy.</p><p>Lexi grabbed the sink to steady herself against the barrage of images he\u2019d put in her head. She was sure that if he ever did get her naked, she\u2019d feel like the luckiest woman alive, right up to the point where he killed her.</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d she said, but it came out sounding more like a feeble question than an insult.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want. Just open the door and leave the rest to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ever, Zach.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped low so she had to strain to hear it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time now, honey. You can fight me all you like, but in the end, we both know how things will be.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he and all his buddies were going to be little pulpy bits of flesh staining the landscape.</p><p>For some reason, that plan didn\u2019t sound nearly as good as it had just last night.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Zach watched Lexi eat. Seeing her mouth move over the fork was the sexiest thing ever. Then again, there wasn\u2019t much about her that wasn\u2019t sexy. Her sweet, compact body and killer ass drove him crazy. The glimpses he kept getting of the tattoo at the base of her spine were going to end him up in the loony bin if he didn\u2019t get to see just how far down under her jeans it went. And the contrast between that spiky- haired, bad girl persona she\u2019d used when he first met her, and the softer, more vulnerable side of her he was seeing now was the kind of thing that fueled a man\u2019s fantasies. She was every kind of woman he\u2019d ever wanted, all rolled into one. Even that independent streak of hers turned him on.</p><p>Every single Theronai at Dabyr was going to want her. He couldn\u2019t take the chance that she would want one of them back. He had to stake his claim before he took her home\u2014get her to wear his luceria so all the men would know she was off limits.</p><p>He slid another pancake onto her plate in the hopes she\u2019d let him watch her eat a little longer.</p><p>Lexi wiped her mouth on a napkin and leaned back in her chair. \u201cHow long will it take us to get back to your home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach considered lying to her, making her think it was farther away than it was so he\u2019d have more time alone with her, but that wasn\u2019t how he wanted things to start out between them. Honesty was important to him. If he wanted it from her, it only seemed fair to be the one to offer it first. \u201cAbout nine hours, but I\u2019m not ready to leave yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of coffee to stall for time to think. He didn\u2019t want to mess this up. Lexi already had some wrong ideas about his world, and he wasn\u2019t sure just how well she was going to like what he had to say.</p><p>Finally, he came up with, \u201cI don\u2019t want to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Okay. Share what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Lexi blinked fast a couple of times, but other than that, her face was stoic. \u201cPlease tell me that means something other than what I think it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other men at Dabyr\u2014my home\u2014are all going to want you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers twisted the paper napkin until it shredded. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She was afraid. He\u2019d seen the look enough times to know that, despite that straight spine and high chin, she was shaking on the inside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never hurt you, Lexi. None of the men would, no matter what you might think. We all want the same thing\u2014to have you by our side for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>She grunted, but it sounded more relieved than disbelieving. \u201cI hardly think so. And even if that was the case, I\u2019m not looking for any . . . relationships right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be looking for one, but one found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Zach reached for her hand, wanting to touch her, but she jerked away before he could. She folded her hands in her lap, pretending that she hadn\u2019t just rejected him.</p><p>Disappointment sliced through him, but he let her go. Now wasn\u2019t the time to push. Finesse would get him much farther. \u201cI need you, Lexi. I\u2019ve never hidden that fact from you. Even after you stabbed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that was temporary insanity,\u201d she said, \u201cor that you were simply lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word I\u2019ve ever said to you has been the bare, honest truth. I need you, and I\u2019m not going to share.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her coffee mug, and Zach saw the dark liquid vibrate under her shaking fingers. Great. Either he\u2019d scared her more or pissed her off. He was guessing scared, since if he\u2019d pissed her off, she probably would have dumped the hot coffee in his lap. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to start from the beginning. Stop me if I lose you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded, but she didn\u2019t look at him. Definitely scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much you know about the Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Just what my mom told me, and what she wrote in her journal.\u201d</p><p>That was something, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the Sentinel races. Have you heard of the Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Since before I could walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then I can skip the part where we\u2019re all out to save humanity and guard the gateway onto another world. Here\u2019s what you might not know. The Theronai pair up into teams of one man and one woman. The man can collect energy from the environment and store it, and the woman has the ability to channel that power, but can\u2019t store any of her own. Are you with me so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure she meant it, but he pushed on, hoping to get through this as fast as possible. \u201cWe pair up, but when we do, it\u2019s a permanent kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but not always. There have been rare cases in our past when family members paired up, but for it to work, there has to be some kind of close bond. The longer a couple is together, the stronger they get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Drake wanted Helen, right? Because she was one of these women?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes narrowed and a mutinous kind of anger tightened her mouth. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>So, she didn\u2019t like the idea. Fantastic. That was going to make things so much more difficult, and he didn\u2019t have time for that. Even with the trickle of power she\u2019d absorbed through their contact, Zach was still suffering. He had a tidal wave of pressure waiting to get out, and not long to make it happen.</p><p>He\u2019d checked his leaf earlier and it was shriveled and brown, barely clinging to his tree.</p><p>\u201cI can prove it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Zach wrapped his fingers around her wrist. She felt so good under his touch that he almost forgot what he was doing. A swirling sea of blues and greens churned inside the band around his finger. \u201cSee the way the color in my ring changes when I touch you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi licked her lips and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more green and blue than any other color. Plus, you feel those little sparks of power arching between us, right?\u201d</p><p>Again, she nodded, but she hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off the ring.</p><p>\u201cThose are signs that you\u2019re like me. You\u2019re a Theronai.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d There was more than just the heat of denial in her voice. There was something else\u2014a kind of frantic desperation, like he\u2019d told her she only had a week to live.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t accept who she was yet, but he understood that. Like Helen and Andra, she\u2019d been raised as a human. Once he showed her his world, she would come to accept everything soon enough, just like the other women had.</p><p>Lexi tried to pull her hand away, but Zach tightened his hold. He needed this contact to remind him there was still hope. Still time.</p><p>He made his voice sound casual as he continued. \u201cSo, this connection that we have allows the power to flow between us. The longer and stronger that connection is, the more power can flow at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you run out?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI can run low, sure, but there\u2019s more all around us, in the air, in the earth\u2014everywhere. It soaks into me whether or not I want it to, which is why I need you. I\u2019ve already absorbed more power than I can hold. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>She was still staring at his ring and the hypnotic movement of colors within it. \u201cAnd you think I can stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can siphon off enough to reduce the pressure. Enough to keep me alive. That\u2019s why I need you.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, and he gave her the time to absorb what he\u2019d said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t cooperate?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThen I die\u2014or at least my soul does. I won\u2019t be one of the good guys anymore. I won\u2019t care about right or wrong, only about what I want.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was a thin whisper of sound. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something they teach in schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I never went to school. My education was a little more . . . practical than most. I learned all about the Sentinels and never once heard any of this.\u201d</p><p>It made him wonder just what she\u2019d been taught and how much of it was complete bullshit. \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you, honey. I\u2019m putting it all out in the open. I want you to know what I\u2019m asking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>He put his finger under her chin and tipped her face up so she\u2019d look at him. He wanted to know she saw he was serious. \u201cI want you to wear my luceria. I want you to be my partner. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Her head shook slightly. Zach wasn\u2019t sure she knew she was even doing it. \u201cI barely know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. I understand that this is scary for you. It\u2019s all new and strange, but it\u2019s not entirely a one- sided deal. You do get some fringe benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing. If you agree to do this, you\u2019ll have the ability to wield magic.\u201d</p><p>She jerked out of his grasp and moved her chair back so she was out of reach. She didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of looking at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want any part of your world.\u201d</p><p>Zach ignored the insult and continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll hardly age with the passage of centuries. We live a really long time, unless we\u2019re killed in battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he wasn\u2019t always fond of that part, either, but it was necessary. At least he had a purpose.</p><p>He scoured his brain, hoping to find something she would want\u2014something to convince her to save him. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be alone again. You\u2019ll have a family. A home.\u201d</p><p>On his last word, her eyes shot to his face as if searching for some kind of trick. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d want to be part of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d He could see it in her eyes, the way they narrowed with mistrust.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide right this second.\u201d He wanted her to\u2014he wanted the grinding pain to go away\u2014but he could wait until she was sure. \u201cIt\u2019s a big decision. Ask me anything you want and I\u2019ll tell you the honest truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this what Helen did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer than she was before she was with Drake. Our jobs are dangerous, but we\u2019re careful with our women. You\u2019re rare and we take every precaution to keep you out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you coddle her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Helen goes into battle against the Synestryn right alongside the men. We need her there, but we make sure that there are plenty of swords between her and the teeth and claws. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume I am. If I do this, you said it\u2019s permanent, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of. It\u2019s meant to be permanent. You give me a vow, which was traditionally that a woman would fight by her man\u2019s side forever. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the vow is fulfilled, the luceria falls off and you\u2019re back to where you were before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you?\u201d</p><p>He hated telling her this part, but he\u2019d promised he\u2019d give her the truth, so he would. \u201cIf we haven\u2019t bonded completely, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die,\u201d she guessed, seeing through his euphemism.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to give me the power to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The power to save me.\u201d</p><p>His hands were splayed flat on the table, where he\u2019d been keeping them in sight so he wouldn\u2019t scare her anymore. He didn\u2019t want her to be afraid of him. He didn\u2019t want her to be afraid, period.</p><p>Her eyes went back to his ring, which, without her contact, had gone back to a slow swirl of shimmering iridescence.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Shit. Here was the sticky part. He had to be careful to be honest without scaring her away with his intentions. Regardless of what happened between them, he wasn\u2019t letting her go. \u201cIf you refuse to help me, I\u2019ll take you back to Dabyr and see if there are any other men there who are compatible with you\u2014men you could save. You can have your pick, of course, assuming there are others like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few days left at best. Then I go into my final battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you would let yourself die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather than become like the things I fight? Yes. But let me be clear, Lexi. It\u2019s not what I want. I want to live. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>Zach shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll have years to get to know each other. I already like you. Given time, I\u2019ll come to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You can\u2019t predict who you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. I\u2019ve seen it happen dozens of times over my lifetime. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a reason that not all female Theronai are compatible with all the males? I figure that the magic used to power the luceria is smart enough to know who will make good partners and who won\u2019t.\u201d Slowly, so she would really hear him, he said, \u201cYou and I were meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>He ached to touch her again, but she had stayed out of reach and he was doing his best to respect her choices right now. There would come a time when he would no longer be able to let them matter\u2014when the lives of his family would take priority and he\u2019d force her to go home with him\u2014but they weren\u2019t there yet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this right now. I can\u2019t decide.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment nearly crushed him, making it hard to breathe. In all those fantasies of his, she\u2019d always wanted him. She\u2019d run into his arms and claimed her place beside him willingly. He\u2019d never stopped to consider that she might not want him until now.</p><p>Zach wanted to push her, but it was a big decision for her. She had to make it with her eyes open. No tricks. No lies.</p><p>If Zach gave her the whole truth, and she still didn\u2019t want him, he\u2019d find a way to deal with it. As long as she was safe at Dabyr, it would have to be enough to satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you all the time I can.\u201d Two days, maybe three. It wasn\u2019t long to convince a woman to spend the rest of her life with him, but he had to try.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think better in the car. We should get moving.\u201d</p><p>Toward Dabyr and all the other men there who would no doubt want her, too. He\u2019d never once wished his brothers ill, and the fact that the thought even crossed his mind now proved to him just how little time he had left.</p><p>Lexi had practically memorized her mother\u2019s journals and there was not a single word in them that supported anything Zach had said.</p><p>The Sentinels want your blood. They use it to fuel their magic. They feed it to their pets.</p><p>And yet she\u2019d spent the night with Zach, had been completely vulnerable, and he hadn\u2019t so much as spilled a drop. Maybe he was tricking her\u2014lulling her into a false sense of security\u2014but it didn\u2019t feel that way.</p><p>Of course, her instincts had always been off where Zach was concerned. Nothing new there. From the moment he\u2019d touched her that night at Gertie\u2019s Diner, her world had been upended, and nothing made sense.</p><p>They\u2019d been driving for hours and she still didn\u2019t know what to think of his proposal. Spend eternity with him. Never aging. Never alone.</p><p>She\u2019d have a home. After all these years of running, she\u2019d be able to stop. She\u2019d have her own bed, maybe even be able to collect a few things beyond mere necessities. It seemed too good to be true, and that was what worried her most. Anything that was too good to be true probably was.</p><p>Lexi watched the landscape slide by the window as they drove north. They\u2019d slept in late, and hadn\u2019t hit the road until well after noon. Now the sun was starting to set. Pretty soon, the monsters the Sentinels kept as pets would all come out to play.</p><p>At least she\u2019d slept hard, was well rested and in better shape to face them than she had been in weeks. That was something to be glad about.</p><p>\u201cDo you want anything to eat?\u201d asked Zach. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close to Wichita and there\u2019s plenty to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything sound good?\u201d</p><p>Someplace with lots of people and bright lights. \u201cWhatever is fine.\u201d</p><p>Zach sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve completely freaked you out, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle bit.\u201d It was the understatement of the year.</p><p>He laughed and the sound rolled around in her ears, making her smile, right up until he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexier than a woman who can make me laugh. Just thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight right now,\u201d she told him. \u201cEven if I decide to help you, and I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t, there will be no sexy stuff of any kind between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flashed her a brief, amused look. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t sleep with men I don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn to trust me if you let yourself.\u201d</p><p>When hell froze over, maybe. \u201cNot likely.\u201d</p> <p>His hand wrapped around hers, holding it against her thigh. A swarm of electric tingles slid into her, making her body buzz. Her head fell back against the headrest and she let the giddy feeling sweep over her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to work on that,\u201d he said, but she could barely make sense of the words. \u201cI\u2019ve got a goal now, and I\u2019m a very goal-oriented kind of man.\u201d</p><p>She just bet he was. She doubted there was much he\u2019d let get in the way of what he wanted, and right now, that was her. A loud, crazy part of her was cheering over the news, so she told it to shut the hell up.</p><p>Lexi needed a distraction. Something, anything, to keep her from imagining just what kind of lover he\u2019d be. Goal oriented, indeed. It was enough to make her squirm in her seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my car? Getting it running and back in my hands will go a long way toward helping me trust you.\u201d</p> <p>A slow smile warmed Zach\u2019s face. He was too handsome when he smiled. Too tempting. \u201cIt\u2019s already taken care of. I left your keys at the Gerai house, and as we speak, our men are likely repairing the engine. Once they\u2019re done, they\u2019ll drive it to Dabyr and you\u2019ll have your wheels back.\u201d</p><p>Unless they found the explosives hidden in her trunk.</p><p>They weren\u2019t obvious, and someone would actually have to search through her meager belongings to find the locked box filled with C-4. And then they\u2019d have to break the lock to get in and see what was inside.</p><p>The good news was, if they did that, she\u2019d know the Sentinels weren\u2019t as trusting and helpful as Zach led her to believe. She\u2019d know for sure they weren\u2019t on her side, and she\u2019d have no trouble blowing them all to hell if she got the chance.</p><p>At least that was what she kept telling herself.</p><p>Zach was giving her a funny look. \u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you suddenly look sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick. I\u2019m hungry. I want steak,\u201d she blurted out, hoping to distract him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want steak.\u201d She hadn\u2019t had it in years, and thanks to him, she even had enough money to pay for a nice meal. Lexi staunchly refused to think of it as her last meal. She was going to get out of this mess alive and well with Helen and Miss Mabel in tow.</p><p>He laced his thick fingers through hers and said, \u201cThen steak it is. I know just the place. It\u2019s a little out of the way, but more than worth the drive.\u201d</p><p>And once they got there, she was going to call Jake Morrow, her contact in the Defenders, and let him know she hadn\u2019t abandoned her mission.</p><p>Chapter 8</p> <p>Joseph looked up from his desk to see Iain Terra filling his doorway. His black eyes sparkled under the bright office lighting, but his face was a blank, impassive mask. He waited in silence, even after Joseph had noticed him.</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d asked Joseph. His eyes burned, and he knew he wasn\u2019t going to sleep again tonight. There were too many things to be done and too many dreams to haunt him when he closed his eyes.</p><p>Everyone was counting on him to be some great leader. Didn\u2019t they all know he was just one single man? One no more capable of keeping his people alive than any other Theronai?</p><p>For what seemed like the millionth time, he cursed his position even as he accepted it. He would not fail. The lives of countless souls depended on him.</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor,\u201d said Iain. His deep voice was quiet, but carried easily across the office.</p><p>\u201cSeems there are lots of those floating around these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this one.\u201d</p><p>Great. More problems. \u201cSpit it out, Iain. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there Synestryn with the faces of human children?\u201d</p><p>No beating around the bush there. Too bad, too. Joseph wasn\u2019t ready to publicly acknowledge the spin that news had put on the war. He still wasn\u2019t entirely sure the Sentinels hadn\u2019t already lost and just didn\u2019t know it yet. Between that, the broken wall and slow repairs, the news that the European stronghold was crumbling from internal politics, and the constant, pounding pain in his head that made it hard to concentrate on the best of days, things were looking pretty bleak.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s true,\u201d said Joseph, \u201cbut I\u2019d really rather you not help spread the rumor any farther than it already has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Iain.</p><p>\u201cWhere what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did they find these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure there are no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you leaving. I need you here, at least until the wall is back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wait, it will be too late,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>\u201cToo late for what? Gilda and Angus already took care of the threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I do that the Synestryn won\u2019t stop with one. I\u2019m going to find out how they are doing this and stop them.\u201d</p><p>Joseph rubbed his temples, breathing deeply as the pounding worsened. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better that way. Most of the men here would balk when they saw what they had to destroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re just going to march into a nest and start killing things that look like our children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not our children. I\u2019ll be able to remember that where someone like you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was right. Joseph wasn\u2019t sure he could bring himself to do what was necessary, but Iain seemed to be. No one else had volunteered for the job.</p><p>\u201cFine. Check it out. Talk to Angus if you need more details. He was there.\u201d Joseph unrolled the map of known Synestryn nests and attacks.</p><p>Iain stepped up to the desk and watched where Joseph pointed. The dot identifying this incident was easy enough to spot. It was the only one on the map that was baby pink.</p><p>How fucking fitting that was.</p><p>Joseph looked away from the map. There were too many dots on it to count, and they were getting closer to Dabyr every night.</p><p>This had to stop. He had to do something\u2014come up with some great plan\u2014or nothing else he did was going to matter.</p><p>Five hundred thirty-seven people. That was how many were counting on him just here under his own roof. That didn\u2019t include the humans outside these walls who were preyed upon every night, or the other Sentinels scattered across the planet. It didn\u2019t include the who knew how many people there were in Athanasia right now who had no idea how close the Sentinels were to losing the war. The gateway into their world protected them, but only so long as he and his men stood guard and kept it safe. Once they were gone, there would be nothing left to stop the Synestryn from flooding that world, too\u2014nothing left to stop them from slaughtering everyone there and heading on to the next planet.</p><p>No pressure.</p><p>Iain turned to leave without saying a word. Joseph felt compelled to say something, but he had no idea what. The man was going to do something Joseph knew he could never do himself. He was going to hunt down the greatest weapon the Synestryn had ever created\u2014monsters with the faces of children. And then he was going to kill them.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d was all Joseph could think to say.</p><p>Iain stopped at the doorway and turned around. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about careful and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s about having a strong stomach and remembering what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m your man.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way Iain said that bothered Joseph. It sounded empty. Hollow. Emotionless.</p><p>Maybe Iain was out of time, and this was his last heroic act. Joseph couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask. He didn\u2019t want to say good-bye to his longtime friend. \u201cAre you saying you can do this and still sleep at the end of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I sleep?\u201d said Iain; then he was gone. Joseph couldn\u2019t even hear his heavy footsteps echoing in the silent hallway.</p><p>Lexi had her doubts when they pulled into the gravel parking lot of the run-down restaurant. It was at the end of a long dirt road, miles from the highway, and completely out of the way, but the parking lot was full for the dinner rush, which had to mean something in this mostly deserted part of the world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go use the ladies\u2019 room,\u201d Lexi told him.</p><p>He looked at her wrist to make sure the bracelet was still in place, chaining her to him. When he saw she hadn\u2019t found a way to remove it, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll get us a table. Don\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Lexi walked back to the doorway that led to the bathrooms and pay phone. There was plenty of change in her pocket from her tips last night, and she started plugging them into the phone. She dialed Jake Morrow\u2019s number, which she knew by heart, praying he\u2019d be around so she didn\u2019t have to leave a message.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, sounding mistrusting in that single word of greeting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi. I don\u2019t have long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fine. I just wanted to let you know to leave my car be. Zach is going to have it repaired and brought to me once I reach the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching it, and someone towed it to the mechanic\u2019s place earlier today. I talked to the owner and he said it had all been paid for up front\u2014whatever needed to be done. He\u2019s supposed to call when it\u2019s fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach must have already got his men on it.\u201d Lexi leaned over, and peered out of the doorway, checking to make sure Zach wasn\u2019t headed this way. She saw no sign of him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with this?\u201d asked Jake.</p><p>He sounded worried, and she wanted to hug him for his concern. Of all the Defenders, he was the only one who seemed to be worried about what would happen to her. The others all saw her as some sort of tool to be used and disposed of as necessary.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll try to call again when I can, but this was the first phone I\u2019ve had access to that didn\u2019t belong to Zach. I didn\u2019t want him to be able to trace your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get into trouble, don\u2019t worry about that, okay? Just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go before he comes looking for me. Sit tight and I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Lexi. Stay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jake. You, too.\u201d Lexi hung up and went to find their table.</p><p>As she neared, Zach smiled at her, like he was happy to see her. Like she was a friend.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s stomach twisted in shame. He had no idea what she was planning. Of course, that was the point, but somehow telling herself that didn\u2019t make her feel any less like a lying bitch.</p><p>They try to trick you. They use mind powers to suck you in. Then they suck you dry and leave your corpse to rot.</p><p>Mom\u2019s words of warning. There were hundreds more like them, too. Lexi had to remember that and steel herself against any guilt she might feel. This was a job. She was doing the right thing\u2014saving countless human lives. Whether or not she enjoyed the job was irrelevant. Someone had to do it, and she was the best candidate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, she shoved away any residual guilt and pretended that everything was fine. She wanted to be here, having a nice meal with Zach. She wanted him to take her to his home. She wanted to be friends.</p><p>Pretending was easier if she forgot why she was doing it, so that was what she did. Ninety minutes later, she was stuffed full and more at ease with Zach than she would have ever thought possible.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t grilled her about her decision to become his partner, or talked about anything serious over dinner. Instead, he\u2019d talked about small things, like how he\u2019d found this place so far off the beaten path one night when his car had broken down, and how he and his buddies had a contest to find the best places to eat across the country.</p><p>He claimed he was the reigning champion, and Lexi had to agree.</p> <p>But once they stepped out of the restaurant\u2019s door, his charming, almost playful demeanor suddenly changed. His pale eyes were bright and watchful and he casually maneuvered Lexi so that he was between her and the open farmland around them.</p><p>Zach walked close enough to her she could feel the heat of his skin flowing between them, the tension cording his muscular body. He pulled in a deep breath through his nose, like he was smelling the air.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d asked Lexi. Anxiety made her mouth go dry, and she was sure everything was most definitely not okay.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Zach as he grabbed her arm and rushed her toward the truck, practically carrying her to get her to hurry. They were parked at the far side of the lot. The dinner rush was over and all the cars that had filled the lot before were now gone, leaving the place nearly deserted. The cool night air suddenly felt chilly against her skin, and only the heat of Zach\u2019s strong fingers around her arm kept her from shivering.</p><p>\u201cI think we might have visitors,\u201d said Zach in a tight voice.</p> <p>\u201cVisitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynestryn.\u201d</p><p>She blurted out, \u201cYour pets are here?\u201d before she could stop herself.</p><p>Zach gave her a sharp frown. \u201cThey\u2019re not our pets, Lexi. I don\u2019t know where you heard that, but the Synestryn are anything but friendly, loyal dogs. They\u2019re our enemy, and will kill us if they find us. I can\u2019t risk you like that.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t risk her? What about him?</p><p>He unlocked the truck and pushed her up into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cTake the keys,\u201d he told her. \u201cI need to keep my hands free to fight.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed her arm\u2014the one wearing the gold chain bracelet\u2014and closed his eyes for a brief second. A hot spark of power shot through her wrist and the bracelet fell free. He grabbed it and shoved it in his pocket.</p><p>Lexi gave him a questioning frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you trapped by my side if things get ugly,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fear skittered around inside her belly, threatening to shove her meal up and out of its way. \u201cUgly?\u201d</p><p>An eerie howl split the night, silencing the crickets chirping nearby. \u201cThere\u2019s a map in the glove compartment. On it is a dot in red ink northeast of Kansas City. That\u2019s Dabyr. Go there. Tell them who you are and they\u2019ll let you in. I\u2019ll catch up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sitting high in the truck, she had a good view of the cornfield. Tall stalks of corn parted as something big came closer. Several somethings.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave these people here to fend for themselves. I\u2019ve got to stay and fight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wink. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to help me yet, though I wished like hell you were. Go now. There\u2019s no more time.\u201d</p><p>Zach shut her inside the truck and drew a sword that had been invisible only a moment ago. He walked away, toward the edge of the cornfield, his stride confident and steady.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand fumbled on the key, trying to separate the one she needed from the rest. It went into the ignition on the third try, and the truck started easily. Not at all like her ancient Honda.</p><p>Whatever was out there in the corn was getting closer fast\u2014it was only fifty yards away now. Zach had moved to the edge of the tall stalks, putting himself between the people in the restaurant and whatever was headed his way. He lifted his blade to a ready stance, and stood there, waiting.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t want to leave him here alone. He said those things weren\u2019t his pets. The way he was acting proved he wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>Another deep howl make Lexi jump. Thick, oily fear closed around her throat until she could only pull in short, shallow breaths.</p><p>She needed to get out of here. Zach could take care of himself. He wouldn\u2019t have gone out there alone if he couldn\u2019t. Would he?</p><p>Her feet couldn\u2019t touch the pedals, so she slid the seat forward. The first Synestryn broke through the field, coming into sight.</p><p>It was a huge, hulking beast, as wide as it was tall. Long tusks erupted from its jaw, dripping with saliva. It had a thick snout and was covered in long barbs from top to bottom. Its spiny skin glistened wetly in the dim light, and all those barbs rattled as the thing laid eyes on Zach.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s body seized up in terror. She\u2019d never seen anything like it before.</p><p>A loud hissing noise came from the thing, and Zach fell to the ground, flattening himself against the dry earth. Dozens of barbs shot out of the monster\u2019s skin and some of them embedded themselves in a nearby tree. Only a fraction of an inch of the long spike remained sticking out of the hard bark.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t want to think about what would have happened to Zach\u2019s body had they hit him. He was hard, but a hell of a lot softer than that tree.</p><p>Before she\u2019d had time to even make sense of what she was seeing, Zach was back on his feet, sword in hand, closing in on the monster. His sword flashed as he attacked, but Lexi didn\u2019t watch. A movement farther out in the field demanded her attention.</p><p>There were three more things out there closing in fast. She didn\u2019t know if they were the same things that Zach was fighting or not, but she was pretty sure that it didn\u2019t really matter. Four against one were not the kind of odds a man survived.</p><p>She tried to convince herself it didn\u2019t matter if he survived. She didn\u2019t need him anymore. She had his truck, money, a map to Helen and her car on its way. She had everything she needed to get to Dabyr and blow it up. He\u2019d even unchained her, freeing her to run away without getting sick.</p><p>Why had he done that? Because he didn\u2019t want her hurt? Or because he knew he was going to die?</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t understand why he would free her when he\u2019d been clear that he intended to imprison her for life.</p><p>What she did know was that until she separated the truth from the lies, she couldn\u2019t let Zach die.</p><p>She put the truck in gear and floored the accelerator. Gravel spun out from the wheels, but the truck got moving in a hurry. It careened toward the field, and she aimed it at the paths two of the monsters were making in the dry corn. They were the only two close enough together she could get them both at once.</p><p>A quick glance Zach\u2019s way told her he\u2019d taken care of the first monster, leaving it in gory pieces on the ground. A second one sprang from the corn, shooting its barbs as it went. Zach\u2019s body arched as he dodged the spray, but his shoulder lurched backward as one of the spikes hit its mark.</p><p>Oh, crap. That couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>Lexi pulled herself back to her driving just as the front bumper hit the first monster, followed closely by the second. The truck jumped into the air a couple of feet, and she heard a popping hiss come from at least two of the tires as the barbs punctured them.</p><p>A loud sound, like hail hitting the truck\u2019s roof, ricocheted from below. Three of those nasty spikes shot up through the floorboards only inches from her feet, flew past her, and lodged in the truck\u2019s headliner.</p><p>Lexi shrieked, and instinctively jerked away from the attack. Without her foot on the gas, the truck slowed fast, sweeping a wide swath of cornstalks beneath it.</p><p>She checked the rearview mirror, looking for signs of movement from the two she\u2019d crushed. They were lying in wet heaps, twitching, but not getting up.</p><p>She shoved the accelerator down, pulled hard on the wheel, and turned the truck around for another pass. Frantically, she scanned the area where she\u2019d last seen Zach and saw nothing\u2014not even movement in the corn or the tip of his blade reflecting above the stalks.</p><p>Panic took a tight hold of her, hollowed her out, like she was floating just above her body. It seemed like it took forever to get the truck headed the right way.</p><p>Was Zach hurt? Dead?</p><p>The thought left her cold and shaking.</p><p>She steeled herself against what she was going to do next just as the deflated wheels crunched over the monsters\u2019 bodies. If they got up now, she knew it was time to run.</p><p>Lexi pulled the truck to a stop, worried that Zach might be hidden in the corn. Lying broken and bleeding. If she hit him, she\u2019d never be able to live with herself.</p><p>She left the truck running and jumped down from the cab. A wet, dripping sound came from beneath the truck, but she told herself that it was just condensation from the air conditioner, not squishy bits of monster guts.</p><p>Weaponless and desperate, Lexi pushed her way back to where she\u2019d last seen Zach. The corpses of two monsters were lying there, slowly leaking thick, black blood into the soil.</p><p>Zach was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cZach!\u201d she yelled. She didn\u2019t even care if any of the people left in the steakhouse heard her. The Defenders and her mother had always told her they had to keep all this monster stuff hush-hush, but she didn\u2019t give a shit about that right now. She needed to find Zach.</p><p>She called his name again, but got no answer. Then she thought she heard something. A deep moan.</p><p>Lexi stopped in her tracks, letting the rustle of cornstalks settle around her.</p><p>There it was again. It was definitely a moan.</p><p>She moved toward it, chanting Zach\u2019s name, praying he was okay\u2014better than he sounded.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. His big body was sprawled on the ground, his sword lying a few feet away. Blood wet the shoulder of his T-shirt. She couldn\u2019t see the barb, and didn\u2019t know if it was embedded in him, or if it had gone all the way through. His dark skin was shining with sweat even as his body shook with chills.</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d she breathed as she went to his side.</p><p>He opened his eyes and the pupils were tiny pinpoints of black. Not a good sign. \u201cGo, Lexi. They can smell my blood. More will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts if you think I\u2019m leaving you here. We\u2019re leaving together.\u201d</p><p>She pulled on his good arm, trying to get him up onto his feet. Man, he was heavy, but she managed to get her shoulder under his and, with his help, she got him up. He was wobbly and she gritted her teeth against the strain of keeping him up. The man was packed with heavy slabs of muscle and probably weighed twice what she did.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t get him into the truck while he could still help, she never would.</p><p>\u201cSword,\u201d he said, sounding almost panicked.</p><p>\u201cLeave it. You can get another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He veered toward the thing and Lexi had no choice but to help him get there or let him fall. Apparently it was too important to leave behind.</p><p>She steadied him with one hand while she picked the weapon up, but had nowhere to put it. Frustrated, she shoved it under her arm and pinned it to her side, praying she didn\u2019t slice one of them open on the wicked blade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Satisfied, Zach cooperated with her again and they headed for the truck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she panted under his weight, grateful she was no pansy. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to last much longer,\u201d he told her. \u201cPoison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you\u2019re not. Just tell me what to do.\u201d</p> <p>They made it to the truck and she propped him up against it while she fumbled to open the passenger door. She got it open; he went in headfirst, collapsing on the seat, but it was good enough.</p><p>Lexi tossed the sword on the floorboards at his feet, shut the door and ran around the truck. She was going to be driving on the rims, but that was just too bad. No way was she sticking around long enough to fix the tires and see what else showed up.</p><p>\u201cDuct tape,\u201d whispered Zach.</p><p>She had no idea why he wanted it, but she didn\u2019t stop to ask stupid questions. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBox. Under the seat.\u201d</p> <p>She found it and was already pulling up the end. \u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTape my wound shut. Throw the shirt out as a diversion. The blood.\u201d</p><p>Right. They could smell it.</p><p>Lexi went to her knees on the seat and pulled hard on Zach\u2019s T-shirt. He hissed in pain, making her stomach turn, but she didn\u2019t slow down or try to be gentler. Now wasn\u2019t the time for gentle. Or slow.</p><p>The shirt came off, soaked with blood and sweat. She used it to wipe away the trickle of blood leaking out of the puckered wound. She couldn\u2019t see if the barb had gone through or not, but she needed to stop the bleeding, so she used a strip of tape to bandage him up, covering both the front and back of his shoulder. It was going to hurt like hell coming off, but they\u2019d deal with that later. Assuming they lived long enough.</p><p>\u201cThrow the shirt out the window. If they don\u2019t fall for it, throw me out.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi squelched the surge of panic rising inside her. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the door handle, but Lexi hit the power lock button and it didn\u2019t open for him. He tried to operate the switch on his side, but his fingers were shaking so hard, he couldn\u2019t seem to make them work. He slumped back on the seat and his arm fell limp at his side.</p><p>Lexi put the truck in gear and headed for the road. Zach\u2019s shirt was in easy reach, ready for her to throw out, but she wasn\u2019t going to do it this close to the restaurant. She didn\u2019t want to draw more monsters here where all the nice, defenseless people were.</p><p>Both front tires were flat and she had trouble steering, but she managed to get them three miles down the road. The shirt went out the window and she kept on going.</p><p>Zach was making low, pained noises, but he hadn\u2019t said a word to her in several minutes. He was lying limply on the seat, sliding around whenever she took a turn. She reached over and pressed her hand against his forehead.</p><p>He was burning up.</p><p>A sick, helpless fear rose up inside her. This was just like when Mom had died. She\u2019d found her too late. There was nothing she could do. Lexi had been a teenager, lost, alone and afraid.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go through that again. This time, she had to do something to stop it.</p> <p>Keeping one eye on the road, she felt over Zach\u2019s hot skin until she found his waistband and the cell phone clipped to it. She knew Helen\u2019s number by heart. She dialed it as she checked the gas gauge. Only a quarter of a tank left and they weren\u2019t making good time. The engine was screaming, but the missing tires were really slowing them down, making progress difficult, even with power steering.</p><p>It took Helen several rings to pick up. \u201cHello.\u201d She sounded winded and her voice was faint with fatigue.</p><p>\u201cHelen. Zach\u2019s in trouble. He\u2019s been poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>There was a scratching sound on the line.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice came over the phone, strong and confident. Drake. \u201cLexi, are you safe?\u201d</p><p>The question startled her. She hadn\u2019t expected to be talking to Drake, nor would she have thought that her safety would be the first thing on his mind.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Zach\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Zach let out a deep moan and Lexi gripped the wheel harder. \u201cIt was some kind of porcupine thing. A spike went through Zach\u2019s shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one?\u201d asked Drake.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he conscious?\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard to ease the tightness in her throat. \u201cNot really. He\u2019s sweating and shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, okay? We\u2019re going to fix him up, but I need you to stop his bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready did. He had me duct tape over his wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work,\u201d said Drake. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKansas. In his truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He took me to a steakhouse out in the middle of nowhere.\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember the name and started to panic all over again.</p><p>Drake must have sensed it in her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lexi. I know the place, but you can\u2019t stay put. You have to keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but the front two wheels of his truck are out, and we\u2019re nearly out of gas.\u201d</p><p>She heard him utter a vile curse, but it was muffled, like he\u2019d covered the mouthpiece, not wanting her to hear. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Someone will be nearby who can help. Just stay off the main roads so you don\u2019t get pulled over by police, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can do that.\u201d She hoped. \u201cCan you figure out where the closest hospital is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman doctors can\u2019t help him, but give me two minutes and I\u2019ll find someone who can.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Helen\u2019s voice came back on the line, full of mock cheerfulness. \u201cHey, Lexi. Drake went to find you help, but how about we catch up on old times while he\u2019s working on it.\u201d</p><p>It was hard keeping the phone to her ear while steering the truck, but Lexi needed the lifeline of her friend\u2019s voice to keep her steady. Too much was happening too fast. \u201cHow about you start by telling me why you sound so tired when I call. Don\u2019t they let you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping them rebuild a wall. It\u2019s exhausting, but necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought there were lots of burly men there. Let them do the heavy lifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not physically building it. I\u2019m shoving a bunch of magic into it to make it stronger. Pretty cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t sure cool was the word she\u2019d use, but she didn\u2019t want to get into an argument over her opinion about it right now. \u201cIf you say so. Did you pack up your stuff like I asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Lexi, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t talk, I understand. Just say something mundane and I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m free to say whatever I like. I just think you might have gotten some wrong ideas about these people somewhere along the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re making you say that, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Helen let out a weary sigh. \u201cListen, it will be easier to talk in person once you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming I make it that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d said Helen. \u201cI see the leader of the Sentinels across the yard. He\u2019s already on his phone, likely calling in men from all around you to come help. They won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>The idea of a bunch of men like Zach closing in on her was more than a little daunting. She could barely keep her head about her with one big, sexy Sentinel. More than one was going to be too much to handle. \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want a bunch of people hunting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not hunting you, Lexi. They\u2019re going to help.\u201d</p><p>Lexi remained unconvinced. At least if she knew help was on the way, she could leave Zach somewhere where his people would save him. She didn\u2019t have to stick around.</p><p>\u201cOh, hold on a sec,\u201d said Helen. \u201cDrake\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>He came back on the line, his deep voice filling her ear with calm confidence. \u201cRonan is going to meet you at a Gerai house near where you are. He\u2019s like a doctor. He can help Zach, okay?\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t sure if she could trust anything Drake said, and she was even less sure she wanted this Ronan person near her. The good news was that if it was only one man, Lexi would have no trouble leaving while he was busy helping Zach. She\u2019d find a way to swipe the man\u2019s keys and head to Dabyr by herself.</p><p>Lexi straightened her spine, and hoped she wasn\u2019t making a huge mistake. \u201cJust tell me where to go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Grace barely managed to get the heavy tray through the door of the suite without spilling it. There was enough food here to feed at least three Theronai, but she only cared about getting one of them to eat.</p><p>Torr.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped eating more than a week ago and no amount of logic or begging had worked to change his mind. She was done playing nice. There was no way she was going to watch him slowly starve just because he wanted to die.</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t ready for that yet, and probably never would be.</p><p>Joseph Rayd, the leader of the Sentinels, was in there with him when she entered, speaking in low tones. Neither of the men noticed her entrance.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Joseph, his voice hard and unyielding. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my life. My choice. If I still had working legs, you\u2019d respect my wishes.\u201d Torr\u2019s angry plea made Grace\u2019s stomach clench hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sending you to the Slayers to be murdered. You still have enough leaves left to last you two or three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo or three useless years. I can\u2019t fight. I\u2019m draining away precious resources we don\u2019t have to spare. Do you have any idea how much blood the Sanguinar have wasted on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a waste, damn it. They\u2019ll find a cure to this thing. Just give it more time.\u201d</p><p>Torr was silent for a long moment. \u201cI hurt too much, Joseph. You\u2019d think that because I\u2019m paralyzed that it wouldn\u2019t hurt anymore, but the pressure keeps building. I can\u2019t even exert myself enough to relieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about meditation?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried. It no longer helps.\u201d</p><p>Grace heard the pain choking him from across the room and had to bite her lip to keep from rushing to him and offering whatever meager comfort she could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Tynan to you,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cHe can inject you with his blood and help ease the pain, if only for a while.\u201d</p><p>Torr shook his head slightly. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t go that way. I\u2019m going to die sober so everyone knows I was in my right mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die at all. I order you to eat until we find a cure.\u201d</p><p>Torr pushed out a scathing laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re really reaching, man. Just let it go. I have.\u201d</p><p>Joseph placed a hand on Torr\u2019s shoulder, even though Torr couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cI won\u2019t give up on you. You need to know that.\u201d</p><p>Grace decided that it was time to make her presence known before she overheard something she shouldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up on him either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joseph looked at her, and hurried over to help her with the door. To Torr, he said, \u201cI see I\u2019m not the only one with your best interests at heart.\u201d He gave her a gallant nod. \u201cGood evening, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace averted her gaze, feeling the sudden urge to curtsy. Of course, had she done that, she would have dropped the tray full of food, so she settled for bowing her head. \u201cMr. Rayd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph. You can call me Joseph like everyone else here.\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t. The man had earned a place as the head of a powerful group of people. If anyone deserved her respect, it was him. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, keeping her eyes down, tracking his hands.</p> <p>She knew he\u2019d never hit her, but some habits were harder to break than others. Learning to dodge fists was one of them.</p><p>Joseph held the door while she moved inside, easing away from him. \u201cSince you\u2019re here, I\u2019m going to go see to my work. Thank you for taking care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Grace.</p><p>Joseph left, leaving Grace alone with Torr. \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d came his gruff voice from the living room. His back was to her. He was staring out into the night, watching the slow progress of the broken wall being rebuilt in the distance.</p> <p>\u201cI brought you dinner,\u201d she told him, keeping her voice carefully neutral.</p><p>\u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>Grace ignored his rudeness and grabbed a TV tray to set her load on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even spare her a glance.</p><p>She stepped in front of his wheelchair and crossed her arms over her chest. His long body was strapped in, keeping him upright. He didn\u2019t look healthy at all. He was a little thinner, of course, but that wasn\u2019t what bothered her. It was the dark circles under his eyes and the dullness in his skin and hair that had her worried. They hadn\u2019t been there earlier this morning when she\u2019d come by to check on him before work. He\u2019d really given up on living.</p><p>His amber eyes slid over her body from head to toe and back. Everywhere his gaze touched heated more than a little. As much as she hated to admit it, she liked the way he stared at her like she was something he should dip in chocolate and lick clean.</p> <p>Coming from another man, it might have intimidated her, but not Torr. He couldn\u2019t hurt her. He couldn\u2019t even move, and she felt completely safe with him.</p><p>\u201cLasagna, chicken alfredo or pepperoni pizza?\u201d she asked him. He had a weakness for Italian food and Grace was not above using that weakness shamelessly.</p><p>He said nothing, but his eyes slid past her, dismissing her to look out his window again. Beard stubble shadowed his jaw and she made a note to give him a shave before she left tonight. The idea of having a reason to touch him was too appealing to resist.</p><p>An impatient sigh built up in her chest, but she refused to let it out and let him know he was getting to her. Patience and stubbornness were the key here and Grace was armed with plenty of both.</p><p>She pulled up a chair in front of him and took the lid off the first dish. Steam from the lasagna wafted up, filling the room with the scent of fresh roasted garlic. She put a bite on the fork, but rather than bringing it to his lips as she had countless times before, she ate it herself.</p><p>Torr blinked in surprise, but said nothing. She heard his stomach rumble beneath his loose sweats and it was all she could do not to cry.</p><p>He was letting himself die\u2014the only man who\u2019d ever made her feel safe. A rarity like him wouldn\u2019t come around more than once in a lifetime, and she wasn\u2019t going to let him go without a fight.</p><p>\u201cAnything new on rebuilding the wall?\u201d she asked to break the silence, then took another bite.</p> <p>\u201cNo. They should have been done by now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough manpower. Or womanpower, as the case may be. They can only go as fast as Helen and Gilda are able.\u201d</p><p>Torr\u2019s mouth tightened, and his jaw clenched. She could practically feel him aching to go help his brothers, and wished there was something she could do to ease him. No matter how long or hard she thought about it, nothing came to her. She couldn\u2019t heal his spine, or make him walk again, and that was the only thing he wanted.</p><p>She took another bite, though swallowing it was hard. Her throat was tight, and she had to fight the tears that seemed to well up inside her whenever she saw Torr hurt.</p><p>He eyed the tray, then gave her a knowing look. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve made up my mind. Joseph won\u2019t give me an honorable death, so I\u2019m choosing this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving up too soon,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Sanguinar were going to find a cure for me, they would have done so by now. All I\u2019m doing is wasting valuable blood when it\u2019s needed elsewhere. I even offered to let Tynan bleed me dry, so at least I\u2019d be of some use, but he refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth saving.\u201d This time, she couldn\u2019t stop the tears from stinging her eyes. She turned away so Torr wouldn\u2019t have to see her weakness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Her name on his lips sent a shiver running through her. His voice was low and gentle, void of the scathing anger that she\u2019d become so accustomed to.</p><p>\u201cBut what about the rest of us? We\u2019re not ready to give up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ever be? It\u2019s easy to have hope when you\u2019re not the one locked inside this chair all day and night. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d take your place if I could.\u201d</p><p>His voice hardened with anger. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow that. No one deserves this fate. Especially not you.\u201d</p><p>Grace sniffed quietly and tried to be subtle about wiping her eyes on her sleeve. She had to hold it together. She was only making things harder on him and she didn\u2019t want that. He had enough to bear.</p><p>She went to him and knelt in front of his chair. \u201cPlease, Torr. Give it some more time.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his gaze sliding over her face in an almost tactile way. \u201cI\u2019ve lived longer than you ever will. I\u2019ve spent my life fighting evil and being useful. It\u2019s time to let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there may be a woman out there who can save you\u2014one like Helen or Andra.\u201d Just the idea was enough to make Grace\u2019s stomach knot with jealousy, but she ignored that selfish reaction. She wanted him to get better, even if it meant he never looked at her again.</p><p>\u201cIf there is, I\u2019ll never find her. And even if I did, who\u2019s to say it would do any good? I was poisoned, Grace. My spinal cord practically melted where that slug thing attached itself. You don\u2019t just fix something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You\u2019re guessing.\u201d</p><p>His mouth flattened. \u201cWhy do you care so much?\u201d</p><p>Grace had to look away. She couldn\u2019t let him see the truth in her face\u2014how easily she\u2019d fallen for him. How much she loved him. \u201cYou helped save my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you hanging with Iain or Alexander, and they were both there that night, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t need me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, Grace.\u201d His words hit her like a fist and she barely heard the rest of what he said. \u201cI\u2019m beyond needing anyone. All I want now is to be left to die in peace.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand and pressed it to her cheek. It was cold and limp and lifeless, but she held on to it, needing him to touch her, even if he couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cJust give it another few weeks. For me.\u201d</p><p>She watched him swallow, his throat moving as if suddenly dry. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel guilty. My injury wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was at least in part. If you hadn\u2019t saved me and my brother, you never would have been in the position to be poisoned by that thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. You\u2019re a good, noble man. You\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as noble as you think I am,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it for a second. \u201cYou keep telling yourself that if you want, but you\u2019re not going to convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Grace! I\u2019m not some kind of hero.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at his harsh tone, but held her ground. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks darkened and his eyes lit with something she\u2019d never seen before\u2014something dangerous and hypnotic. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. And if I could move, you\u2019d know that for a fact because I would have already had you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Shock filled her lungs, making her dizzy. She grabbed his knees to steady herself and looked up at him, floundering for a hold on reality. \u201cYou mean . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. The idea that he\u2019d want her was too ludicrous to even consider.</p><p>\u201cSex. I mean sex, Grace. I would have used your convenient case of hero worship to get between your legs. I would have fucked you and gone out to fight the next battle\u2014find the next conquest\u2014before you\u2019d even had time to wake up and know I was gone.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, making her curls sway around her face. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You\u2019re just saying that to scare me away so I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not a real man anymore, but I bet if we got creative, I could still make you come with just my mouth. That might be something worth sticking around for.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Grace\u2019s insides vibrated and her skin felt like it was being zapped with an electric current. She had to get away\u2014put some space between them.</p><p>She was halfway to the door when she realized what he\u2019d done, and came to a dead stop. He\u2019d been trying to scare her away. He\u2019d meant to make her run and it had nearly worked.</p><p>Grace closed her eyes and prayed for strength. She didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d meant any of what he\u2019d said, or if it had all been a game, but she was going to call his bluff.</p><p>She locked the door and closed the bolt so no one could walk in, then crossed the room and pulled the curtains shut over the sliders.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Torr.</p><p>Her body was quaking inside, and a fine sweat had beaded up over her back, but she was going to do this. She couldn\u2019t let him die.</p><p>Her fingers went to the buttons on her shirt. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you what you want,\u201d she said, proud of how her voice was sure and steady.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>The first button popped free and she saw his eyes lock on her hands. \u201cIt means I\u2019m going to let you . . . do that to me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even say it. She wasn\u2019t strong enough. \u201cI\u2019ll take off one item of clothing for every bite of food you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, some kind of joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Another button opened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to play?\u201d She had tried to sound seductive, but had no clue if she\u2019d pulled it off. She\u2019d never undressed for a man before.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was weaker and less emphatic than before.</p><p>Her hands stilled. \u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want to see me naked?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw bunched, but he didn\u2019t look away. Nor did he deny it.</p><p>Grace slid her fingers down to the next button. It popped free and she opened her shirt enough that he could see the edge of her bra. It wasn\u2019t fancy or lacy, but Torr didn\u2019t seem to mind. He seemed more interested in what it covered.</p><p>She stepped closer and leaned forward. Her breasts weren\u2019t huge, but they were big enough that she was used to men staring. She\u2019d never liked it quite as much as she did right now, watching Torr\u2019s pupils widen and his cheeks darken with desire.</p><p>He was getting into this, and heaven help her, so was Grace. She felt a small thrill of power course through her, but even more than that, a sense of victory. She could see it in his face. She\u2019d won.</p> <p>\u201cOne bite and the rest of the shirt comes off,\u201d she coaxed.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d growled Torr. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can and I am.\u201d She forked up a bite of lasagna and put it to his lips. \u201cOpen wide.\u201d</p><p>He gave her one angry glare before his eyes were drawn back to the vee of her shirt. Then he opened his mouth and ate the food she\u2019d offered.</p><p>Good to her word, Grace freed the rest of the buttons and slid the fabric from her shoulders.</p> <p>She thought it would make her feel dirty, or like some kind of whore, but instead, all she felt was relief. She\u2019d gotten him to eat and that was what really mattered.</p><p>Torr watched her move, his face a mixture of anger and lust, and some desperate kind of hunger she\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>He nodded to the tray of food and then his eyes fixed on hers. \u201cMore, Grace. I want more.\u201d</p><p>Grace was down to her bra and panties when Torr finally came to his senses. It wasn\u2019t easy, either, because she was built like his favorite wet dream. Her breasts were full and round, as were her hips, yet she still had a small waist that made him wish for his hands to work just long enough to feel her skin. All her soft curves reminded him of the women he\u2019d lusted after in his youth, centuries ago, before magazines dictated how a woman was supposed to look. Her legs weren\u2019t miles long, but they were just the right length to wrap around his hips and hold on tight while he thrust inside her.</p><p>Not that he was ever going to be that lucky. She was almost naked, standing in front of him, and his dick couldn\u2019t be bothered to even notice, much less react. His mind was totally primed and ready to go, but his useless body just sat there, mocking him for his inability to act.</p><p>Angry regret hit him hard, and he wanted so much to let this fantasy play on\u2014to let her finish what she\u2019d started and make him feel like even a fraction of the man he\u2019d once been.</p> <p>But he couldn\u2019t do this to her. She was too sweet and kind. She didn\u2019t deserve to be turned into his whore.</p><p>And that was exactly what he was doing to her. He was forcing her to strip, paying her in meager bites of food. All because she didn\u2019t want him to die.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he told her as she reached behind herself to unfasten her bra. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Grace stilled in that awkward position. \u201cI won\u2019t go back on my word, Torr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>A pretty blush slid over her skin, rising onto her cheeks. She tried to cover herself with her arms, as if she was suddenly ashamed of her beauty. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do this out of some sense of duty,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou feel like you owe me. You don\u2019t. Please, put your clothes back on. I\u2019ll eat.\u201d</p><p>Torr had never seen anyone dress as fast as she did. If he\u2019d had any question about whether or not she was doing this because she wanted to, he knew now she wasn\u2019t. Not that he was surprised. Why the hell would anyone want to get naked with a cripple like him? Grace deserved a real man\u2014one who could give her whatever she needed. One who could keep her safe from the Synestryn who wanted her blood.</p><p>She sat down between him and the tray of food. She was still blushing and she wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze. Not that he blamed her after humiliating her like that.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like next?\u201d she asked in a wavering voice.</p><p>\u201cIce cream,\u201d he told her. He knew she didn\u2019t have any on that tray and he wanted to give her an excuse to leave. He guessed she wouldn\u2019t come back, either. She\u2019d send someone else and he\u2019d never see her again.</p><p>It was probably best that way. If she did come around again, he wouldn\u2019t be able to think about anything but how beautiful she was standing in front of him, nearly naked. He\u2019d think about it, and she\u2019d see him thinking about it, and be embarrassed all over again. All that was left for them was awkwardness and he didn\u2019t want that for her.</p><p>One way or another, he wasn\u2019t going to live much longer. Eventually, Joseph would see there was no hope and give him his death. The less attached to Torr Grace was when he died, the better it would be for her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d said Torr, knowing she had no intention of coming back ever again.</p><p>The man Drake sent to heal Zach was waiting for Lexi when she pulled up to the tiny house. Had Drake not been with her on the phone, giving her turn-by-turn directions, she never would have known anyone lived this far off the beaten path.</p><p>The house was run-down, tiny, maybe twenty feet along each wall and already brightly lit. Beside it was a black van, and on the cement steps leading into the house stood a tall, lean man. As Lexi turned, and the truck\u2019s headlights hit his face, she got a good look at him.</p><p>He was gorgeous\u2014the kind of man that made women stop thinking and start stripping. His pale eyes seemed to throw off bits of icy blue light as the headlights hit them. His mink brown hair was swept back from his wide forehead in an artful wave, and his long black leather trench coat waved slowly in the summer breeze. He started toward the truck before she\u2019d finished parking, and his movements were smooth, almost glidingly graceful.</p><p>Lexi killed the engine just as he opened Zach\u2019s door. \u201cI\u2019m Ronan,\u201d he announced as he pressed his pale hand against Zach\u2019s head and another against his bare chest. The large tree tattoo covering Zach from his left shoulder to somewhere well below his waistband seemed to sway as he breathed. The branches were bare from what Lexi could tell, and her mother\u2019s journal had warned her to be wary of men marked like this. They were dangerous predators\u2014killers walking around in human suits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lexi,\u201d she told Ronan as she got out of the truck to help. As heavy as Zach was, Ronan was going to need her help now that he was totally out of it.</p><p>Ronan shifted Zach\u2019s body to the edge of the seat.</p><p>\u201cDrake said the Synestryn that injured him had quills. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one, I think. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still in there.\u201d</p><p>Ronan nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get him inside and check it out.\u201d Then he lifted Zach out of the truck like he weighed nothing.</p><p>Sickening fear rose up in Lexi\u2019s gut, making her suck in a breath. Ronan wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>These people were not her friends. They\u2019d killed her mother. They\u2019d kidnapped Helen. They wanted her blood.</p><p>Ronan arched a perfect brow at her. \u201cOpen the door for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lexi shook herself and nodded. She had to play along. Pretend to be nice, unsuspecting prey. Right up to the point she triggered the detonator.</p><p>Then again, maybe just getting Helen and Miss Mabel out would be enough. Lexi wasn\u2019t a killer or a soldier. She wanted no part of this war. All she wanted was to be left alone in peace.</p><p>Of course, to get that peace\u2014to earn it for all of the humans out there who had no idea what was really going on\u2014she had to kill those who hunted her. If she was ever going to be free to stop running, she had to make a stand. It shouldn\u2019t matter to her that her enemies were gorgeous men who pretended they wanted her to be safe. It was all just an act.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>I just think you might have gotten some wrong ideas about these people somewhere along the line.</p><p>That was what Helen had said. She seemed sure that Lexi was the one who was wrong, and she\u2019d been living with them for more than a month.</p><p>But what about Mom\u2019s journal? What about all those lessons about how the Sentinels used humans for sport and food? Mom had seemed sure, too.</p><p>Lexi wished she could say the same.</p><p>\u201cAre you squeamish?\u201d asked Ronan. He had a rich, deep voice\u2014cultured, like he\u2019d been raised outside of the States, or in some fancy boarding school.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to need your help.\u201d He laid Zach down on the only bed in the house.</p><p>\u201cSure. Need me to get something out of your van? Medical stuff?\u201d she asked. All she needed was his keys and she was out of here.</p><p>Ronan looked up at her, his gaze so intense, she felt like he\u2019d taken hold of her face and wasn\u2019t letting go. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a fool?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m offering to help?\u201d</p><p>He stood, towering over her. Lexi was used to it, and refused to feel intimidated. As far as she was concerned, being shorter only meant it was easier to reach out and twist his balls, leaving him in a heap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, Lexi Johns. Everyone does. Zach has been chasing you for weeks. I\u2019m not going to let you flee and have him coming after me when he wakes.\u201d</p><p>Busted. Time for plan B. All she had to do was come up with it. \u201cSo he will wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether it was one or two quills that hit him.\u201d</p><p>That news left Lexi reeling. \u201cAre you saying that\u2019s all the difference there is between him living and dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and my intervention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you waiting for? Doctor him already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I know you\u2019ll stay put while I do.\u201d He gave her a small smile\u2014one that made him so pretty, she forgot to breathe. \u201cShall I bind you physically, or would you prefer to give me your vow to stay here?\u201d</p><p>Lexi took an involuntary step back. The idea of him tying her up or locking her in a closet made her sick. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me your word you\u2019ll stay here until I\u2019m gone, and not try to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she lied, just to get him to back off. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>When she felt a sudden pressure fall upon her body, pinning her in place, she realized her mistake.</p><p>Never promise them anything. They can bind you to their will.</p><p>Her mother had warned her and she hadn\u2019t listened. Now it was too late.</p><p>Ronan\u2019s smile widened. \u201cFirst time making a promise to one of your own kind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t respond. She felt trapped and helpless. She wasn\u2019t like them. She was human.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cIt gets easier.\u201d</p><p>Lexi seriously doubted it.</p><p>\u201cFix him,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave her a little formal bow of his head. \u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Madoc wished he was anywhere else but standing beside Nika\u2019s bed. He had no business being here, but Andra had claimed Nika had asked for him.</p><p>She\u2019d asked and he\u2019d practically broken the land-speed record getting back to her side.</p> <p>So much for his good intentions to keep his distance. Madoc stood there, stiff and uneasy, unsure what to do now that he was here. He should never have come.</p><p>Nika barely made a lump in the bed. Her white hair had been washed and brushed until it shone, and it was fanned out around her head. She was thin, fragile, almost ethereal. Breakable. If he got too close, he was sure he\u2019d accidentally hurt her.</p><p>Andra looked at him expectantly, like he had all the answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want me to do?\u201d he asked</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just sit with her and hold her hand, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching her,\u201d he told Andra.</p><p>She ground her back teeth in frustration. \u201cFine. Then just sit your ass down until she wakes up again.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He wasn\u2019t going to be locked into babysitting duty. He had sgath to kill. He was up to seventy-two kills so far this week. If he had anything to say about it, he\u2019d exterminate the fuckers from the face of the planet before year\u2019s end.</p><p>Maybe then Nika would be okay.</p><p>\u201cI can only stay a few minutes,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>Andra\u2019s jaw clenched and her mouth tightened like she didn\u2019t want to spit out the words. \u201cYour safety was the first thing on her mind after being unconscious for more than a week. I\u2019d think you could be a little more caring.\u201d</p> <p>No, he couldn\u2019t. Caring was for men with souls. His was shriveled up. Only the frigid black ring he wore kept the last leaf on his lifemark from completing its fall. That leaf hung in stasis over his ribs, frozen midfall. His lifemark was bare. His soul was as good as dead. He didn\u2019t care about anything anymore but killing and fucking. And Nika wasn\u2019t good for either of those.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d made an oath as one of the Band of the Barren\u2014the secret, invitation-only group of Theronai that kept those with bare trees like him from being discovered and sent to their deaths. He\u2019d promised to pretend he was still one of the good guys so none of them would be discovered. If one of the Band was outed, he knew every Theronai alive would be searched for signs of treachery. The fake leaves tattooed on his lifemark wouldn\u2019t fool anyone looking too closely. For now he had to play the part as he\u2019d promised Iain he would. He had to act like he would have before his soul had died.</p><p>It was either that, or let them send him to the Slayers to be murdered along with all of the other brothers in the Band.</p><p>Not a fucking chance.</p><p>Madoc let out a long sigh, and eased himself onto the edge of the bed. Nika\u2019s body shifted toward the depression in the mattress.</p><p>He tensed, worried she\u2019d bump into him and get bruised or something. But she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t even touch him, which was for the best. At least that was what he tried to tell himself.</p><p>Andra looked at her watch. \u201cJoseph said that three more Theronai reported back here to come see Nika. They should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let one of them play babysitter.\u201d</p> <p>Andra\u2019s long body flopped into a chair and she covered her face with her hands. She looked tired, and Madoc had a split second of worry for her. Odd.</p><p>\u201cI hope to God one of them is compatible with her. Tynan says it might save her, restore her sanity.\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s stomach clenched against a punch of jealousy. He didn\u2019t want any other Theronai near her, as stupid as that was. He wanted to be the one to save her, which was utterly ridiculous. He\u2019d been near her for long enough to know it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>In fact, based on the speed at which his ring was losing its color\u2014its life\u2014he was out of time for miracles of any kind. Even if a compatible woman walked through the door right now, it might not be soon enough. Once the colors were gone, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bond with anyone, compatible or not. He\u2019d be broken, a wasted shell of what he was born to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No empty words of hope?\u201d asked Andra. Her eyes were shut, like she was too tired to bother keeping them open.</p><p>\u201cHope is for people who haven\u2019t pulled their heads out of their asses far enough to see reality,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cAh. An optimist. Lovely.\u201d She let out a wide yawn.</p><p>Madoc snorted. \u201cGo take a nap. I\u2019ll stay until the others get here.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded on the main door of Paul and Andra\u2019s suite. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re off the hook,\u201d said Andra. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She left the room and was gone longer than he\u2019d expected. Maybe she was interviewing them or something.</p><p>Eventually, she came back with a trail of three Theronai behind her. Each one had a smear of blood on his shirt from where he\u2019d given Nika his oath to protect her.</p><p>She looked a little green, and more than a little uneasy as she stepped aside and let the men see Nika.</p><p>Madoc knew all of them, of course. He\u2019d been fighting by their sides on and off for several centuries. That didn\u2019t mean he trusted them. Not around Nika. He was going to stay put until they left.</p><p>Or until one of their rings started reacting to her.</p><p>Just the idea was almost more than he could stomach. He clenched his fists and stood from the bed. He didn\u2019t want an up-close view of the show to come.</p><p>Nika let out a small whimper, so low he wasn\u2019t sure Andra had heard it. If so, she made no reaction.</p><p>Madoc frowned and held himself back from going to check on her. He could see the even rise and fall of her breathing from here. That was going to have to be good enough.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Andra. \u201cThis is my sister, Nika.\u201d</p><p>The hopeful, reverent looks on their faces made Madoc want to pound his fists into something. How dare they look at her like that\u2014like she was already theirs?</p><p>Neal stepped forward first. He still wore his leather jacket, likely fresh from the hunt. His dark hair was dusty, and there was a smear of dirt on his cheek. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to take a fucking shower before coming here.</p><p>Fucker.</p><p>He looked at her with eyes that glittered with intelligence. A laugh line at the corner of his mouth deepened as he smiled. He reached out toward Nika\u2019s bony, frail hand and it was all Madoc could do to stay on his side of the room.</p><p>He wanted to sweep Nika up in his arms and take her away from all this. She was too weak to have these men pawing at her.</p><p>Neal watched his ring as he took her limp hand in his. Madoc watched, too.</p><p>Nothing happened. His ring\u2019s colors stayed fixed.</p><p>Nika whimpered and pulled her hand away.</p><p>Madoc let out a long sigh of relief and Andra\u2019s sharp gaze met his. \u201cProblem?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d growled Madoc, giving her his patented fuck off scowl.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked Neal.</p><p>The man\u2019s face fell, wiping out all signs of laugh lines from his face. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded once, and motioned for the next man to step up. This one was Morgan Valens, womanizer extraordinaire. He didn\u2019t waste time, simply walked up and stroked his dark-skinned hand over Nika\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Madoc was going to have to kill the fucker for touching her so intimately. His hand was on his sword, ready to do just that when Morgan stepped back, almost stumbling away from her.</p><p>Nika\u2019s eyes popped open and stared at Morgan in horror. A high, pained sound rose up from her throat, and Madoc crossed the space to her side. Before he realized what he was doing, he was sitting on the bed and had pulled Nika practically into his lap.</p><p>She saw him and her clear blue eyes filled up with tears. \u201cYou came back,\u201d she said and buried her face against his neck.</p><p>Morgan shook his head, looking like he\u2019d seen a ghost or something. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that woman is, but she\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d asked Andra. \u201cShe had some kind of reaction to your touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good one. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Andra put her hand on Nika\u2019s arm. \u201cNika, baby, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s arms went up around Madoc\u2019s neck and she hung on tighter. When she didn\u2019t respond, Andra said to Madoc, \u201cCheck and make sure she\u2019s not hurt.\u201d</p><p>Like he was some doctor. Shit.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t know how to dislodge Nika without touching her, and if he touched her, he might hurt her, too.</p><p>As carefully as he could, he tugged her away from his neck and checked her face for damage. \u201cDid that fucker hurt you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Nika\u2019s skin was red and a welt had risen where Morgan had touched her. She nodded her head, her eyes bright with tears. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Madoc was going to have to kill him. There was simply no way around it.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s usual smile was nowhere to be found. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I hurt you, Nika. Truly. I won\u2019t touch you again.\u201d He left the room like it was on fire and Madoc was glad to see him go.</p><p>Neal gave Nika one last longing look, and then left right behind Morgan.</p><p>Samuel Larsten stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Nika. Madoc had to squelch the urge to curl his body around Nika and hide her from his sight.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help,\u201d said Samuel in a quiet, smooth voice. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to help you, Nika.\u201d</p><p>Her body quivered against Madoc\u2019s. He could feel her bones poking him wherever they touched. She was weak. Fragile. He wanted her to rest and heal.</p><p>Despite what Madoc wanted, Nika needed to find the man who was meant to protect her. For all he knew, that man was Samuel.</p><p>He reached out toward her. His left hand was covered in burn scars, making his ring almost glow clean and pristine in contrast.</p><p>Nika looked at his hand and sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cUgly, huh?\u201d asked Samuel with a self-conscious smile. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to hurt me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that either. If you want, I can come back later,\u201d said Samuel.</p><p>Nika\u2019s throat moved as she swallowed nervously. Her fingers found Madoc\u2019s hand and she squeezed hard. The skin where Neal had touched her was red, too, and he thought he could see small blisters forming along her delicate skin.</p><p>Samuel looked past Nika to Madoc. \u201cYour touch doesn\u2019t seem to hurt her. Are you sure she\u2019s not yours?\u201d</p><p>Madoc said nothing. Instead, he held up his left hand, showing Samuel his faded ring.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s face blanched and he gave a short, curt nod. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He saw Madoc was out of time, and yet he didn\u2019t gloat or show even the smallest sign of relief. A spark of respect for the man lit up inside Madoc. If Nika was going to end up with anyone besides him, he wanted it to be a man like Samuel.</p><p>\u201cGive him your hand, Nika,\u201d urged Madoc.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She curled her legs under her and scooted farther onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others did,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>Andra looked from Samuel to Nika with that same kind of hope he\u2019d seen in the men. Madoc wasn\u2019t privy to everything Tynan had told Andra about Nika\u2019s condition, but it was clear she thought this was Nika\u2019s best shot, which meant it probably was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra\u2019s voice was soft and quiet. \u201cWe need to find out if he can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want his help,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>\u201cBut you need it, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to force you,\u201d said Samuel. \u201cI\u2019ll come back a little later, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Nika. \u201cNot later. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>Nika held out her hand and her body tightened as she cringed against the pain she thought was to come.</p><p>Samuel brushed the tip of his finger over her hand and Nika jerked back. His mouth turned down in a resigned grimace. As they watched Nika\u2019s skin darkened and turned a bright, angry red. This time the blisters came fast, bubbling along her skin as if she\u2019d been burned.</p><p>He said to Nika, \u201cGuess I\u2019m not going to be able to help you. I\u2019m truly sorry for the pain I\u2019ve caused you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Not as sorry as Madoc was. He knew this was just the beginning of her suffering. More men would come every day now that they knew she was here. They\u2019d all want to touch her. Hurt her.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Madoc told Andra.</p><p>Andra gave him a tight nod. \u201cApparently not. I\u2019m going to go talk to Tynan. Can you stay here with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore important things than making sure Nika doesn\u2019t try to wander off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t trust me,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But Nika does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you leave me again,\u201d said Nika. She sounded tired, worn out from her ordeal with the men. She didn\u2019t whine or beg, she simply said, \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. How could he say no to that?</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Madoc told Andra. \u201cI\u2019ll stay, but only for a little while. Hurry the hell back here, or get Grace.\u201d</p><p>He felt Nika smile against his neck, the soft skin of her cheek stroking his skin, his luceria. Andra shut the door, closing them alone in the room together.</p><p>Madoc tried not to panic. He wasn\u2019t going to hurt Nika. He was going to be very careful and make sure he didn\u2019t make any mistakes. All he had to do was sit here and let her hold on to him until she fell asleep.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. Her body relaxed and he eased her back under the covers where she belonged. Then, he moved the chair to the farthest corner of the room and sat his ass down.</p><p>He itched to go back to her, but he didn\u2019t dare. She was safer with him all the way over here. The farther he stayed away from Nika, the better it would be for both of them.</p><p>It took almost an hour for Ronan to finish whatever the hell it was he\u2019d done to Zach. He\u2019d sent Lexi to burn all the bloody tape and bandages, and when she came back, she realized that Ronan had been drinking Zach\u2019s blood.</p> <p>An odd kind of fascinated disgust held her in place. She stood in the doorway, staring. Ronan lifted his mouth from Zach\u2019s wrist and there was no blood, but there was something different about Ronan now. His skin had a healthy flush to it and his face didn\u2019t seem quite so gaunt as before.</p><p>Ronan stripped his heavy trench coat from his body and rolled up his sleeve. He took a syringe out of his medical bag and slid the needle into his vein.</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s the sick one here,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>Ronan pulled the plunger out and the empty syringe filled with a pale yellow liquid. That glowed.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! What the hell are you?\u201d she asked before she could think twice about it.</p><p>Ronan gave her an amused grin. \u201cA Sanguinar.\u201d</p><p>Vampire. Mom\u2019s journal had dozens of pages going into detail about how dangerous the Sanguinar were. They could hypnotize their prey with a single glance and drain their blood in mere seconds. They had long, sharp claws and fed on the pain of their victims.</p><p>And Lexi was trapped in this house with one of them.</p><p>Her heart kicked hard and she backed up, slamming her head into the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you get ahold of yourself, little girl,\u201d chided Ronan. \u201cZach doesn\u2019t have time for you to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Ronan rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. I can hear your heart racing.\u201d</p><p>He could read her thoughts, too. Mom had said so.</p><p>Oh God. What if he knew what she was planning\u2014that she was going to blow them up? What if he\u2019d already read her mind? She was so dead.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, Lexi. I need you to help me hold him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, hoping to stall for time to figure a way out of this mess.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m getting set to inject him with the antidote to his poison and he\u2019s not going to like it. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt when it was inside of you.\u201d</p><p>Ronan crossed the small room in two steps. His eyes glowed with angry blue light, and his jaw was bunched with frustration. \u201cYes, it did. And it made me more than a little cranky, so I suggest you start cooperating.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm and tugged her bodily back to the bed and pushed her down so she was sitting on Zach\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cTry to keep him still,\u201d said Ronan; then he injected that glowing yellow stuff into Zach\u2019s arm.</p><p>The reaction was immediate. Zach thrashed and a scream of pain tore from his lips. Lexi\u2019s heart jumped into her throat and she bit her lip to keep from crying out in response to his pain.</p><p>Zach kicked, and she had to scramble to position herself so she wouldn\u2019t get hurt by his powerful body. Ronan had practically draped himself over Zach\u2019s torso and seemed to be holding him down with little effort. Lexi wasn\u2019t so lucky. She kept Zach from hurting either of them, but that was about it. Her ribs were going to be bruised from his struggles.</p><p>After what seemed like half a year, the violent reaction subsided and Zach settled back onto the bed. He was sweating and shaking and making pitiful, agonized sounds that made her stomach clench in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do something for him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ronan fetched his coat from where it had fallen on the floor and pulled it on. \u201cI\u2019ve already done what I can. I\u2019m not strong enough to ease his pain, too.\u201d</p><p>He was so flipping casual about it, Lexi wanted to scream. \u201cThere has to be something you can give him.\u201d</p><p>Ronan pinned her with a bright, hungry gaze. \u201cThere is one way. You could give me your blood. That would allow me the strength to ease his pain.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her blood. Just like her mother had told her. Fear closed in around her, thickening the air with its stench. She had to get away before it was too late.</p><p>Lexi backed up, stumbling over the leg of the bed. \u201cNot a fucking chance, vampire boy. Stay back.\u201d</p><p>Ronan held up his hands, palms out. \u201cAs you wish. Let him suffer. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were his friend.\u201d</p><p>An amused, almost condescending smile played at the corner of his full mouth. \u201cWe Sanguinar have no friends. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need him to survive. Just as he needs you, young Theronai.\u201d</p><p>Lexi refused to believe she was one of them. It was just one of the tricks they used to ensnare unsuspecting humans. She was smarter than that. She knew the score. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>One second he was on the far side of the room; the next, he was right in front of her, holding her face in his chilly hands. His touch was gentle, but she felt his restrained strength vibrating through his arm. She feared that if she flinched, he\u2019d break her neck.</p><p>His eyes flared with a burst of light, and Lexi felt herself falling. He was so pretty. She could stare at him forever.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust let go. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to do that. It was dangerous; she just couldn\u2019t remember why.</p><p>From somewhere far away, she heard Zach\u2019s low moan of pain.</p><p>\u201cHe needs you, child,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cYou need to go to him now. Soothe him. If he lives through the night, he\u2019ll recover fully. You should help him.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Zach needed her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour presence. Your touch. Bare skin on bare skin.\u201d</p><p>She could do that. Even more, she wanted to do that.</p><p>\u201cYou can touch him all you like. Anywhere you like,\u201d said Ronan.</p><p>Just the idea was enough to make her insides go liquid with need. Zach was laid out for her enjoyment. She could run her hands over him and no one would ever know.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d purred Ronan. \u201cSuch a good girl.\u201d</p><p>His praise warmed her and made her feel giddy. Something wasn\u2019t exactly right here, but whatever it was, it couldn\u2019t be that important. Not as important as listening to Ronan and staring into his eyes. And certainly not as important as getting her hands on Zach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here tonight and call me if his condition worsens, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The urge to nod was strong, but she held back. She couldn\u2019t stay. She had to run. She didn\u2019t know why, but she knew it was important. \u201cNo. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. It\u2019s safe here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t sure, but surely Ronan wouldn\u2019t lie to her. \u201cIt\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><p>His thumb stroked the side of her face and the light in his eyes glowed brighter for a moment. \u201cYes. And you\u2019ll be with Zach so you can touch him.\u201d</p><p>Safe and touching Zach. That sounded nice.</p><p>Ronan had to leave the house before he took Lexi\u2019s blood against her will. She smelled so sweet, so pure. He was sure that the power thrumming through her veins would be rich and intoxicating.</p><p>And he so desperately needed that strength. He was tired. Hungry. His insides were twisting against the emptiness no normal food could ease.</p><p>He needed blood. Lots of it. He needed a rich source so he could replace the power that healing Zach had depleted. A source like the woman inside that ragged little house\u2014the one he had mesmerized so easily with his gaze.</p><p>She would have given him anything if he\u2019d taken only a little more time with her. He could have had her blood as well as her body. She was such a pretty, almost pixie-like woman that the idea was more than a bit tempting.</p><p>Too bad Lexi wasn\u2019t human. If she had been, he would have fed from her without regard to her wishes. But whether or not she believed it, she was a Theronai. Protected. If he fed from her against her will, he\u2019d be practically declaring war against her people.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t happen. The Sanguinar needed the blood of the Theronai too much to risk alienating them.</p><p>But not for much longer.</p><p>Project Lullaby was going well. It was only a matter of time before the Sanguinar would once again be free to do as they pleased\u2014before they would once again be the strongest of all the Sentinels.</p><p>Ronan wasn\u2019t sure whether he should look forward to that day, or fear it.</p><p>Hunger twisted Connal\u2019s belly. He could smell his food nearby, smell the fear shimmering out from her where her captor hid her in the darkness.</p><p>The alley where Zillah had chosen to meet was a dirty stretch of pitted asphalt in downtown Kansas City that reeked of human garbage and greasy rain puddles. Most of the lights here had been shot out, leaving conveniently deep shadows. Not that Connal needed the light. Even as weak as he was, he could still see through the stifling darkness to where Zillah waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome closer,\u201d he hissed, his vocal cords vibrating like razor wire strung too tight.</p><p>\u201cNot until you show her to me,\u201d said Connal. He was too hungry for Zillah\u2019s games, nearly wavering on his feet with his need for blood.</p><p>Zillah shoved the woman in front of him, taking no more care for her comfort than he would have for that of a used newspaper. She stumbled, but Zillah\u2019s iron grip held her on her feet.</p><p>She was young, perhaps two decades old. Her dirty hair hung limp around her gaunt face, stiff with tangles. He didn\u2019t know what color it would have been had she been clean, but now it was a dull, dirty brown, falling nearly to her hips. Her arms and neck were riddled with angry red marks where others had fed from her and not bothered to heal the wounds. A glazed, wild look filled her eyes, though she never quite met Connal\u2019s gaze.</p> <p>How long had she been a prisoner of the Synestryn? Had she ever known freedom? Or had she been born into their hands?</p><p>Not that Connal cared. As long as her veins were full, nothing else mattered.</p><p>He moved forward, gliding over the rough ground, hoping she\u2019d look at him for just a moment. That was all he\u2019d need to ensnare her, trap her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well,\u201d said Zillah. \u201cThe wall surrounding Dabyr crumbled as you said it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet Sibyl remains with us. You failed to keep her.\u201d After the chances Connal had taken, that failure scraped against his too-thin patience.</p> <p>Zillah shrugged, and his movement shifted the frail woman. \u201cThere will be other opportunities. We\u2019re patient.\u201d</p><p>But Connal wasn\u2019t. He needed to feed. He needed to feel this woman\u2019s blood sliding down his throat, filling his belly, drenching him with its power. He wasn\u2019t going to make it to sunrise without her, and waiting for Zillah to give him the necessary permission was driving him mad with impatience.</p><p>\u201cHer bodyguard is still unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should be the one to tend him. Feed from him and finish what we started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t act so openly. You know that. If I\u2019m discovered, they won\u2019t simply kill me. They\u2019ll strip my mind to pieces searching for your identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for that to happen yet,\u201d said Zillah, as if he\u2019d already considered allowing it to happen. \u201cI have another task for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Not until you\u2019ve let me have her. I need to feed.\u201d</p><p>The woman stood listless inside Zillah\u2019s grasp. Even when Connal spoke of drinking her blood as so many others clearly had, she displayed no reaction.</p><p>Zillah tossed her toward Connal, and if he hadn\u2019t caught her, she would have simply crumpled to the street like so much garbage.</p><p>He held her by the shoulders, feeling the frail bones beneath his hands, smelling the stink of her unwashed body. She looked up at him then, and he could see now there was no life in her hazel eyes, only bleak acceptance. All that remained of whatever she had once been was a hollow shell of flesh.</p><p>Connal wanted to feel pity. He wanted to be the kind of man who would whisk her away and save her, but he wasn\u2019t. He was too desperate for that. Too hungry.</p><p>He laced his fingers in her matted hair, pulled her head back to bare her neck and bit deep.</p><p>Sweet, perfect power flowed over his tongue, making the hungry beast within him roar in triumph. Her pulse pounded in his ears, against his lips, a steady counterpoint to the frantic gulping sounds rising from his throat.</p><p>His food struggled weakly, but he held her still, taking his fill, knowing it would never be enough, even if he drained her dry.</p> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he heard Zillah hiss, too close for safety. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt the child.\u201d</p><p>Child?</p><p>Connal\u2019s food was wrenched from his arms, spilling precious drops of blood down her neck as well as his chin. He scooped up the mess with his fingers and licked them clean.</p><p>Zillah slid his too-long finger over her open wound and her skin closed beneath his touch, stopping the flow.</p><p>Connal shook himself, trying to clear his head of the blood haze fogging his thoughts. Power streaked through his body, burning him from the inside out.</p><p>Rage welled up inside his chest. He wanted to pound something to the ground, to grind it under his heel until nothing remained. The need for violence twisted within him until he was reaching toward the woman, toward Zillah.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d was all he said, and that single command, nearly a whisper of sound, froze Connal in place.</p><p>A slow, steady smile bared Zillah\u2019s sharp teeth. \u201cI see our alterations worked. Lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat alterations? What have you done to me?\u201d demanded Connal.</p><p>Zillah slid his hand over the woman\u2019s belly. His gray skin stretched over his fingers, giving the extra joint on each digit a deathly quality. \u201cShe carries my child. My weapon. You drank his blood and now you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already doing what you wanted. You didn\u2019t need to resort to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I? I could smell your sympathy for the woman a mile away. It was only a matter of time before you did something rash. Now, I no longer need to worry.\u201d</p><p>Connal tried to move, but his body refused to respond. It was as if he was a toy and only Zillah had the remote control. \u201cThere must be something you want. Just tell me and let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d said Zillah. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take a box back to Dabyr for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d</p><p>Zillah smiled. \u201cThe Theronai\u2019s death. This lovely little creature will hunt and incapacitate their women, making them appear dead. You will declare them dead and bring their bodies to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be caught and killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re of no use to me and you may as well die.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Zillah would kill him. Or worse, stop feeding him.</p><p>Panic seized Connal, making his words come out rushed and breathless. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>Zillah\u2019s smile widened, baring his sharp teeth. \u201cFor your sake, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Lexi shook herself, trying to get rid of the drugged feeling that fogged her brain. Ronan had done something to her. She was sure of it.</p><p>Anger flared bright in her gut, burning off the remaining fog that plagued her.</p><p>That bastard. She was going to kill him for fucking with her mind like that\u2014or at least twist his nuts until he wished he was dead. Then she\u2019d make him undo it. Whatever it was.</p><p>She rushed out to the living room and through the front door just in time to see him get behind the wheel of his van and drive away. She got as far as the bottom step before that same sickening, itchy feeling she\u2019d gotten from the bracelet swarmed over her, making her skid to a halt. Her insides twisted and she clutched her stomach in an effort to figure out where to scratch. Nothing helped.</p><p>The need to go back inside overwhelmed her. With a frustrated shout, she turned around.</p><p>Defeated, Lexi shut the door and leaned her head against the inside of the cool wood.</p><p>She was no match for these men. She had no magical powers and hardly any knowledge of what they were capable of. That had been made crystal clear when Ronan had tricked her into promising to stay here.</p><p>Just until Ronan was gone, which he was now.</p><p>She could leave. At least she thought she could.</p><p>Lexi peered out the window, looking for any signs Ronan was still nearby. It was dark, but she saw no glow of headlights in the distance or plume of dust from his passage over the gravel roads.</p><p>He was gone. Could she go now, or did her vow still hold her captive?</p><p>Lexi opened the door and stepped outside, bracing herself for that awful feeling. It didn\u2019t come. She took another step and it still didn\u2019t come. She was halfway to the truck and feeling fine.</p><p>She could leave now and be free. The keys were in her pocket. The money Zach gave her was in her suitcase. She could make it last a long time\u2014go into hiding where not even Zach would find her. She\u2019d splurge on a new tattoo to cover the bloodmarker that had shifted farther down her back, and he\u2019d never be able to find her. She would take the map revealing the location of the Sentinel compound back to the Defenders and let them deal with saving Helen. Heaven knew they were better equipped to handle something like that than she was.</p><p>But what about Zach?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even sure he was going to live through the night, and even though she\u2019d planned on being the one to kill him just yesterday, something had changed. She couldn\u2019t leave him here to die. Not if there was anything she could do about it.</p><p>So, what now? Was she going to patch him back up so that the Defenders could kill him? So she could?</p><p>Lexi rubbed her hands over her face in frustration. If Zach had been like Ronan, this whole mess would be a lot simpler. But he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d been kind.</p><p>He\u2019d given her money so she could survive on the run. He\u2019d taken the bracelet off her wrist, releasing her so she could flee to safety without him. He\u2019d gone out to face those monsters rather than let them attack the people in the restaurant.</p><p>Those were not the actions of an evil killer. They were the actions of a caring, protective man.</p><p>Maybe Zach was the one Sentinel worth saving. Lexi had to follow her instincts and take the risk that she was wrong. She\u2019d never be able to live with herself if she didn\u2019t at least try to save him now so she could find out if he\u2019d lied.</p><p>Of course, nothing in Mom\u2019s journal helped her when it came to dealing with monster poisoning.</p><p>Bare skin to bare skin.</p><p>It was probably some kind of trick Ronan was playing on her, taking advantage of her ignorance. But for what purpose? It wasn\u2019t like he stuck around to laugh at her when she fell for his trick.</p><p>Lexi went back into the house and stood beside Zach. His body was bathed in sweat; his chest was bare except for the large tree tattoo. Even from here, she could see the branches swaying in time with the wind outside. His muscles stood out in hard ridges, fighting the pain that poison or the antidote was causing him. The wound on his shoulder had closed up, but it was still an angry red pucker marring his smooth brown skin.</p><p>Even with the wound, his body was beautiful. Touching him would be no hardship.</p><p>He shifted on the bed and a deep sound of pain welled up from his lips. He was hurting and she had to make it stop.</p><p>Bare skin on bare skin.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t a joke, but some way of getting her to go along with whatever nefarious plan they had. If so, it was probably going to work. The idea of standing there while he suffered made her sick.</p><p>Lexi wet a cloth in the sink and went to Zach\u2019s side. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was wrong about him or not, but she was sure that she couldn\u2019t sit by and do nothing.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed and pressed the cloth to his face, wiping away the sweat. He sucked in a shocked breath and his eyes fluttered open.</p><p>A look of relief so intense she could feel it heat her skin crossed his face. He reached up with a trembling hand and touched her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lexi tried to give him a reassuring smile. \u201cPerfectly safe. So will you be, once you get a little rest. Ronan patched you up.\u201d</p><p>His hand fell to his chest as if he were too exhausted to hold it up. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t give him your blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m keeping it all.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed again and he let out a long breath. \u201cGood. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, he was back asleep again, leaving Lexi reeling. He hadn\u2019t asked if he was going to be okay. His sole concern had been for her.</p><p>That kind of selflessness was not like any version of evil she\u2019d ever encountered. In fact, even good, decent people would have at least inquired about their condition. But not Zach.</p> <p>Maybe Helen was right and Lexi had been wrong all these years. Or maybe his concern was some kind of act meant to confuse her.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. She was tired of being afraid. Tired of being confused and alone. One way or another, she was going to get to the bottom of all of this or die trying.</p><p>With a deep breath for courage, she lay down next to Zach and pressed her body alongside his. She hiked up the front of her shirt so her bare tummy touched his side, and draped her arm across his chest.</p><p>A weightless warmth sank into her skin, giving her a sense of utter contentment. Whatever it was about him that made her insides sing was still working, and she was glad for the momentary diversion from reality.</p><p>Her stomach was full, no one was chasing her and she had a gorgeous man in her arms. As far as she was concerned, that was as close to heaven on earth as it got.</p> <p>Zach woke up to a need so intense he could hardly breathe. His skin felt too tight, and brittle, like it would rip apart if he dared to fill his lungs. His body was on fire, his blood pounding hot and hard through his limbs. His dick throbbed, aching to feel the slide of Lexi\u2019s body as he filled her. Only she could ease him, but she never did.</p><p>He\u2019d been dreaming of her again. Hot, fevered dreams that left him shaking and sweating, on the verge of paradise, but never reaching it. He couldn\u2019t touch her in his dreams. She taunted him, swinging her hips and blowing him a kiss as she ran away. He couldn\u2019t catch her even though he knew she was running into danger.</p><p>He called her name, but no sound came from his lungs, only hot, desperate breaths of air that left his chest bellowing under the need for more oxygen.</p><p>Zach rubbed his eyes, trying to rid himself of the heavy sleepiness that plagued him. His elbow brushed against something soft draped over him.</p><p>Lexi.</p><p>She nestled beside him. He didn\u2019t need to open his eyes to know that. He could smell the sweet, fresh scent of her body and feel the soft cushion of her baby-fine hair on his chest. Her skin was cool against his, drawing away some of the heat scalding his insides.</p> <p>His arms were weak, but he forced them to curl around her and hold her close. He couldn\u2019t let her leave him. Not ever.</p><p>She yawned and pushed herself away from his body, robbing him of the cooling comfort of her skin. He tried to stop her, but he wasn\u2019t strong enough. The poison had left him helpless and hurting.</p><p>Lexi pressed her wrist against his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re still hot. Let me get you some aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just come back down here,\u201d he told her through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cThen at least let me get a cold cloth. It can\u2019t be healthy for you to be so hot.\u201d</p><p>She started to move off the bed, but Zach grabbed her wrist, stopping her. \u201cNo. Stay.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned at him, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll only be a second.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let her go, not even for that long. He needed to feel her skin on his. All of it. Her touch was the only thing that could cool his blood.</p><p>Zach used a surge of strength to pull her onto the bed, then pinned her under him. The effort left him panting in exhaustion, but at least he had her where he wanted her, where he needed her.</p><p>\u201cLet me up, Zach.\u201d Her tone was hard and cold.</p><p>He didn\u2019t listen. Instead, he shoved her shirt up over her breasts and pressed his bare chest against her body. Her bra irritated him, but he wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d let him take it off, too. In fact, the way she was wriggling under him, he wasn\u2019t sure she was going to stay put for long.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he told her. \u201cYour skin is so cool and soft.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his cheek to hers and couldn\u2019t resist the urge to slide his hands down her sides. He felt the subtle contours of her ribs, the narrow span of her waist, and finally, the gentle swell of her hips where they were bared by her low- rise jeans. Everywhere he touched, hot ribbons of power fled his body, sinking into hers. It felt so good, his head spun, and he started to shake.</p><p>Lexi went still beneath him and her voice was filled with apprehension. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust need to touch you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He buried his nose against her neck and filled his lungs with her scent. Sweet. Clean. His.</p><p>He had to taste her. Just a little.</p><p>The tip of Zach\u2019s tongue slid out, barely grazing her skin, but it was enough to go to his head. She tasted of salvation and woman and something else he couldn\u2019t name. Something powerful and elusive that belonged only to her.</p><p>Lexi shivered beneath him and her hands snaked around his waist and clutched at his back. \u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d she asked him in a soft, almost fearful tone.</p><p>Was he hurting her?</p><p>Zach pushed his head up so he could look at her face and make sure. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive moving away from her, and his arms were shaking like crazy, but if he was hurting her, he\u2019d find a way to leave her alone.</p><p>He saw no sign of pain on her face. Her eyes were closed and her lips were parted. Her head was angled to the side, giving him better access to her neck. A deep flush painted her skin a rosy pink and he could see her pulse racing in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm. It\u2019s . . . sliding inside me and I can\u2019t make it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to try,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cBut it feels too good. It\u2019s got to be some kind of trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trick. Just let go.\u201d He was hard and aching, his erection pressing painfully against the confines of his clothing. He wanted them both naked, stripped of all the barriers that separated them so he could take her properly and give her the kind of pleasure that would bind her to him forever. But he wasn\u2019t strong enough yet to keep her from running, and if he tried to strip her, his skittish Lexi would definitely bolt.</p><p>Every moment he spent touching her made him stronger, even as it drove him closer to losing control. If he could stay awake just a few minutes more, he\u2019d have everything he wanted.</p><p>A wave of heat mingled with his power rose up inside of him and washed out over them both. Lexi sucked in a shuddering breath, pressing her breasts against his chest. The breath came out as a low moan of pleasure and Zach nearly came just hearing it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good,\u201d he told her. \u201cSo soft.\u201d He stroked the side of her face, but his hands were clumsy and he feared he\u2019d poke her in the eye. Instead, he settled for splaying his fingers through her baby-fine hair.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t let you do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d Her voice wavered with uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Lexi.\u201d The words were all mangled. He was getting so sleepy, he could hardly support enough of his weight to keep from crushing her, so he rolled over so they were on their sides, facing each other, his arm clamped around her.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYou need a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBare skin on bare skin,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s what Ronan said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bleed off the heat,\u201d he realized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d said Zach, even as he felt himself fading fast. He\u2019d been poisoned before, and it took a while to recover. That was all. He refused to die and leave Lexi alone and unprotected.</p><p>He could hardly keep his eyes open anymore, even though he loved the sight of her so close to him. He could see a scattering of freckles over her cheeks and the way the skin between her eyebrows puckered whenever he said something she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked, finally looking into his eyes.</p><p>She was so beautiful he thought his heart would beat its way out of his chest. He\u2019d never tire of looking at her, not if he was lucky enough to have her by his side for millennia.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not dying until I get to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi watched Zach\u2019s eyes shut as he lost the battle against sleep. She thought it would help her relax to no longer have him looking at her like she was his salvation, but it didn\u2019t. Her body was tense, humming with some kind of weird energy she\u2019d never felt before\u2014like she was mainlining a Red Bull or something.</p><p>She smoothed his hair back from his face, enjoying the silky feel of it sliding through her fingers. He was such a handsome man, in a rough, dark way\u2014nothing like pretty boy Ronan. Stubble shadowed his wide jaw, which was clenched in pain, even in his sleep. Her pale fingers glowed against his brown skin as she traced her fingertips over his cheek and across his lips.</p><p>Zach moaned, low in his throat, and the arm he had wrapped around her tightened. She probably should have pulled her shirt down, but the feel of his body on hers was too good to resist. Everywhere his skin touched hers, she felt his heat and power soaking into her. It was almost intoxicating.</p><p>Maybe he was drugging her, making her pliant to his plans. If so, she wasn\u2019t even sure she cared anymore. She\u2019d never felt more alive. More needed.</p><p>It was a potent thing to be needed. She\u2019d been alone for seven years now, roaming the countryside, with only herself to think about. Before that, it had been just her and Mom, and Lexi had been the needy one.</p><p>But the tables had turned and she was now important to someone else. Vital. She wasn\u2019t just rattling around the countryside, letting the years roll by while she kept hidden and alone.</p><p>In fact, lots of people needed her. Not only Zach, but all the Defenders were counting on her.</p><p>To kill.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s stomach gave a hard heave of nausea and she scrambled off the bed toward the bathroom. She made it to the toilet, but nothing came up. She just knelt there, on the cold tile, trying not to think about what she\u2019d agreed to do.</p><p>It had seemed like such a good idea. A righteous quest to slay the dragon.</p><p>But now that dragon lay sleeping in a room only a few feet away, letting out low grunts of pain because she\u2019d left him. He wasn\u2019t a terrible beast like she\u2019d thought. He was a man\u2014or at least close enough to one that she could no longer see quite so many differences.</p><p>Confusion and indecision had never been problems for her before. She needed to ground herself, to remember what was important and what she trusted. What was real.</p><p>Mom\u2019s journal. Lexi needed to reread it, regroup and resolve herself to the path she\u2019d chosen\u2014all while staying close enough to Zach to ease his fever, just in case he was what he seemed.</p><p>With any luck at all, she\u2019d find some clue in those pages as to why Zach didn\u2019t seem like the monster she\u2019d once believed he was. And if not . . .</p><p>If not, then Lexi was going to have to suck it up and grow a thicker skin. She couldn\u2019t let the Sentinels keep killing people and ruining their livelihoods, no matter how good one of them made her feel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>Nika fought against the tug of the monsters, steeling her mind against the strength of their call. She didn\u2019t want to be with them tonight. She wanted to be with Madoc, in her real body, and revel in the fearlessness surrounding him.</p><p>When she was close to him, she wasn\u2019t afraid. She felt almost normal. Madoc strengthened her with his presence.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to be with her. He\u2019d made that clear when he\u2019d left her while she slept. He\u2019d left and he hadn\u2019t come back.</p> <p>The idea of sleeping alone frightened her. She needed him to keep the monsters from pulling her apart while she slept. Why didn\u2019t he understand that?</p><p>Andra came into Nika\u2019s room just as she finished pulling a big sweater over her head. The sweats she\u2019d borrowed from Andra hung low on her bony hips and pooled around her ankles, but they helped keep her warm against the chilly air-conditioning inside Dabyr.</p><p>She was feeling stronger\u2014hungry for the first time in what felt like years. She\u2019d already had three meals since she\u2019d woken, but was ready for another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said Andra. \u201cThe men are waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Nika had only regained consciousness for a handful of hours, but since then, seven Theronai had come to see her. To touch her.</p> <p>She tried not to be afraid, but without Madoc here, it wasn\u2019t easy to fight off the pain and panic of so many strangers pawing at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let them touch me,\u201d she told her sister. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d The blisters from the last batch still hadn\u2019t healed.</p><p>Andra\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI know it does, but it\u2019s the only way to be sure. They\u2019re good men, Nika. They don\u2019t mean to hurt you. In fact, one of them may be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want their help.\u201d They weren\u2019t Madoc.</p><p>Andra looked down from her impressive height, giving Nika that look of desperate concern she\u2019d come to know so well over the last eight years. \u201cI know, but there\u2019s no other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me do this.\u201d Panic started leaking into her stomach, driving away the hunger under its crushing weight. Nika couldn\u2019t stand the hands of the men on her. They all wanted something from her, and she felt their desperation sink into her more with every touch. She\u2019d just reclaimed enough of her mind that she was starting to feel whole again, and then all these men came along, each one of them wanting to take a little piece of her away with them.</p> <p>They left her with slivers of their need and pain, shoved them into her skin like needles, so deep she couldn\u2019t dig them out.</p><p>Andra sat down on the bed next to Nika and took her hand. Andra\u2019s fingers were long and strong and capable, unlike Nika\u2019s bony, weak fingers.</p><p>She wanted so much to be strong like Andra. To know what was real and what wasn\u2019t. To be able to stay inside her mind and not be flung across space into bloodthirsty monsters until she no longer knew who she was.</p><p>Andra stroked the back of her hand in a soothing circle. \u201cI hate doing this to you, baby. I really do, but Tynan is convinced that the best thing for you is to find your Theronai. Once you do, he can help you heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc is helping,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>Andra\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI know. He\u2019s been out killing off sgath right and left and that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Andra looked away, toward the door like she wished she could escape. Her eyes darkened until they were the same rich sapphire color as the luceria around her neck.</p> <p>Nika\u2019s hand went to her own throat, which was bare and bony, and she felt a sense of loss.</p><p>\u201cMadoc has checked and double-checked. You\u2019re not compatible,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cHow can he be sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, baby. It\u2019s what he wants, too. All of the men want you to be the one who can save them, but it just isn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Nika refused to believe her. \u201cIf Madoc isn\u2019t meant to be mine, then why am I drawn to him? Why is he the only person besides you who makes me feel safe?\u201d</p><p>Andra stroked Nika\u2019s hair back from her face and a wavering sheen of tears glittered in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick of your mind, baby. Like all the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the blisters? Are they a trick of my mind, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. But I don\u2019t want you to worry. We\u2019ll find the one who can help you.\u201d</p><p>Nika wasn\u2019t so sure. She was broken. She might never find the man who could give her the gift of magic.</p><p>And if that man wasn\u2019t Madoc, she didn\u2019t even want to try.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there with you,\u201d said Andra. \u201cThere are only two men this time, so it won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Nika. She sounded like a willful child, but she didn\u2019t care. She was tired of doing things she didn\u2019t like. Tired of having no choices. Everyone told her what to do. She was almost twenty- one and more than old enough to make her own decisions.</p><p>\u201cWe can wait until tomorrow if you want. They won\u2019t like it, but they\u2019ll wait for you. I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re not feeling well enough to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Nika. If she wanted people to start treating her like an adult, she was going to have to act like one. Do the hard things. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</p><p>And then, once the pain subsided, she\u2019d slip out of her body and go find Madoc. He wouldn\u2019t know she was there, watching him hunt, so he couldn\u2019t run away. It wasn\u2019t as good as feeling his body, solid and strong against hers, but if it was the only way she could be with him, then she\u2019d take what she could get.</p><p>Angus answered the tentative knock on his door, expecting Joseph to be the one standing there, looking for a report on the progress on the wall. Not that there was much to report. The women were exhausted and progress had slowed almost to a halt. At this rate, they were going to be out there in the dead of winter, building the damn thing back up.</p><p>But, instead of Joseph, Tynan stood there, his beautifully gaunt face pinched with hunger and fatigue.</p><p>It was nearly dawn and from the looks of it, this was no social call.</p><p>Great. Just what Angus needed to end his shitty day. More shit.</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d he asked Tynan, standing firm in the doorway so the man knew he was not welcome inside.</p><p>\u201cIs Gilda still awake?\u201d Tynan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll have to talk to her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to her. I need to talk to you. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Angus hid his surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s throat bobbed as he swallowed. His slender hand reached for the doorway as if to steady himself. \u201cPlease. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Angus wasn\u2019t about to wake Gilda after the day she\u2019d had, so he stepped out into the deserted hallway and quietly shut the door behind him. \u201cOkay, talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might have done it,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cI think I might have found a way to cure your people\u2019s infertility.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared bright inside Angus, but he clamped down hard on the emotion before it could wake Gilda. Not only did she need her sleep, but he knew without a doubt that she wouldn\u2019t share his happiness at this news.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, hearing the way his voice wavered with a mixture of relief and excitement.</p><p>Tynan shook his dark head and his eyes shut as if the motion made him dizzy. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I need to test my theory on someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. You want to test it on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed the logical choice. The other men are newly bonded and may have issues with a child so soon.\u201d</p><p>But he and Gilda had been together forever. Long enough that Angus knew how she\u2019d feel about having more children. Their sons had all been slain in battle, and although Sibyl was safe, she wasn\u2019t normal. And Maura . . .</p><p>A knot of guilt and grief closed off Angus\u2019s throat, making his voice come out as barely more than a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilda is still fertile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I mean, I\u2019m not even sure she would agree to have more children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly she sees the need to repopulate our ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a child. You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to lose one. Or more.\u201d Even after all these years, Angus still carried around the gaping wound in his soul the deaths of his children had left behind. He could think about them now and remember the good times they\u2019d shared, but it had taken decades to get to that point.</p><p>And after having nearly lost Sibyl less than a week ago, the fear that it could happen again was fresh and raw.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Angus. At least consider it. I\u2019ll go to Drake or Paul if I must, but we\u2019re not even sure where their women came from yet. My cure may not work for their unions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not start on one for them? Seems like it makes more sense, considering how there are twice as many of them as there are of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve put decades of work into this cure. Changing it now would cost us precious time we may not have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t all that bleak,\u201d said Angus.</p><p>Tynan swayed and gripped the wall. Angus reached out to steady him, but Tynan shook his head. \u201cMy people have hidden how bad things are. There\u2019s not enough blood left. We\u2019re all dying. If we don\u2019t find the cure soon, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we\u2019re all gone and there\u2019s no one left to heal your wounds. Your people will die, too.\u201d</p><p>Angus felt the burden of so many lives pressing down on him. \u201cEven if Gilda did agree to have another child, she certainly wouldn\u2019t agree to letting you bleed the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for years, but eventually, that child will grow up and allow us the blood we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all children grow up,\u201d said Angus before he could stop himself.</p><p>Sibyl, his daughter, hadn\u2019t grown since she was eight. Not since the night her last brother\u2014his last son\u2014had died.</p><p>Angus pushed the memory aside before it could consume him. He needed to think with his brain, not his heart.</p><p>\u201cI know this is a big decision for you, but there\u2019s little time left for you to make up your mind. I\u2019m running out of time. I must sleep.\u201d</p><p>He meant sleep, as in going to sleep for years as was the way of his people. It was how they preserved blood when there wasn\u2019t enough to sustain everyone.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays. Weeks at most.\u201d</p><p>Angus ran his hand over his face, feeling the deep lines the centuries had carved there. Worry and danger and laughter had weathered his skin and left their indelible mark. Seemed he was about due for another few wrinkles.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me talk to Gilda. I\u2019ll come find you tomorrow with my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake the right one, Angus. Please.\u201d Then Tynan turned and walked away, using the wall to keep him on his feet.</p><p>However much pain and sadness Angus had had in his life, at least he wasn\u2019t alone like Tynan. He had Gilda. He had love. He had hope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tynan had nothing to look forward to but the oblivion of sleep\u2014a means to escape his hunger. Somewhere along the way, Angus had forgotten what it felt like to be as desperate as Tynan was. Or maybe he\u2019d never been that desperate. His life had been hard, but it had also been filled with blessings.</p><p>It was time to step up and give back some of the good life had offered him.</p><p>One way or another, he needed to convince Gilda to give up her grief and move on. Maybe in doing so, she\u2019d be able to heal and forgive herself for the things which she couldn\u2019t change.</p><p>Maybe Gilda would even remember how to smile again.</p> <p>Zach woke up just before dawn. His body ached, but he was no longer plagued by the blazing heat of the poison.</p><p>He was going to live.</p><p>A surge of joy rolled through him, and he felt the need to run and find Lexi so he could celebrate with her. Only, he didn\u2019t have far to go. She was lying on the bed, asleep with her head pillowed on an open book and her pale hand splayed over his dark chest.</p><p>Zach grinned down at her, letting the sight of her beauty fill him up with a deep sense of satisfaction.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t left him. She\u2019d stayed right by his side even though he\u2019d taken the bracelet off her wrist, allowing her to leave.</p> <p>He had no idea how much sleep she\u2019d gotten last night, so he didn\u2019t want to wake her, but she didn\u2019t look comfortable, so he eased the book out from under her cheek and tucked a pillow in its place.</p><p>Lexi made cute, sleepy sounds, but didn\u2019t wake. He covered her up and went to find some coffee to help clear the rest of the sluggishness from his head that the poison had left behind.</p><p>They had a big day ahead of them. With any luck at all, today was the day Lexi would agree to wear his luceria. After all, she hadn\u2019t left him. That had to mean she cared about him, right? And if she cared, she wouldn\u2019t leave him alone to suffer. He knew she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Zach set the book down on the kitchen counter, marking her place by setting the napkin holder on the open pages. He rummaged around in the cabinets until he had a pot of coffee gurgling on the counter, then went to the bathroom, took a quick shower, dressed and came back just as the last few drops were making ripples over the dark surface of the coffee.</p><p>He poured a cup, added a ton of sugar and sat down to enjoy his jolt.</p><p>The book was still open to the page Lexi had been reading when she fell asleep. It was handwritten, in tight, almost minuscule handwriting, so small he\u2019d thought it was type when he\u2019d first glanced at it. When he looked closer, he saw certain words were underlined, or boxed in. Frantic scribbles filled the margins, with arrows pointing to different passages.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t generally one to snoop, but if this was Lexi\u2019s diary, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to resist. He\u2019d be able to peek into her mind as soon as they bonded, so it wasn\u2019t really snooping, anyway. It was just getting a jump on what he was going to see soon.</p><p>Zach started reading the entry, which was near the beginning of the book. It was dated twenty-three years ago.</p><p>They almost found us today. I hid us in a trash bin and the stink of rotting garbage masked our scent. Your scent, Alexandra. That sweet baby smell of your head that seems to draw the monsters to us.</p><p>You were such a good baby, too. You didn\u2019t cry. You just held on to my finger in your chubby fist like you knew the monsters were scaring me. How can you know that? You\u2019re not even a year old yet.</p><p>You\u2019re special, Alexandra. Your daddy told me you would be the night we made you. He said I had to protect you. Hide you.</p><p>If anything happens to me, you need to know that the Sentinels are going to want you for your blood. You can\u2019t ever stop running. They\u2019ll find you and they\u2019ll trick you and then, when they\u2019ve convinced you they\u2019re not the bad guys, they\u2019ll suck out all your blood for their magic.</p><p>You can\u2019t ever let that happen. You have to keep running.</p><p>Zach\u2019s body went numb. Lexi would have been too young to write twenty-three years ago. She would have just been a baby. This wasn\u2019t Lexi\u2019s diary.</p> <p>This was her mother\u2019s diary. Alexandra was Lexi.</p><p>It was no wonder that Lexi didn\u2019t trust him, that she\u2019d stabbed him and run away when he\u2019d first met her. She had been taught that the Sentinels wanted to kill her\u2014that they wanted her blood.</p><p>Which, he had to admit, was partially true. The Sanguinar would want her blood, not that he\u2019d let them have any of it. And even if they did get it, they wouldn\u2019t want to kill her. She couldn\u2019t feed them if she was dead.</p><p>Zach flipped the page and kept reading. It was more of the same. Page after page described how evil the Sentinels were and how many times they\u2019d tried to kill Lexi and her mother. The book went into detail about what the monsters looked like and how to avoid them. Zach recognized the descriptions as Synestryn, not Sentinels. Of course, Lexi didn\u2019t necessarily know the difference.</p><p>She thought the Synestryn that had attacked them last night had been his pets. She didn\u2019t know any better, which begged the question, what else had she been taught that was totally wrong?</p><p>Zach shut the book and rose from his chair. Anger pulsed through him that her mother would taint her with lies like these, but he held it in check. He had no way of knowing why her mother had done it, and more important, the woman had kept Lexi alive all these years, protecting her when he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t need his anger. She needed him to straighten her out. As long as she had all these messed-up ideas in her head, she was going to be in danger, running from the only people who could keep her safe.</p><p>He turned, and she was standing in the kitchen doorway. Her eyes were puffy from sleep and her clothes were wrinkled beyond repair. The hair around her face was damp, like she\u2019d just finished washing. She looked from him, to the book and back again and in that time, all the color drained from her face. Her dark eyes widened in fear and she sprinted toward the door leading outside.</p><p>Zach chased after her, unwilling to let her go. Whatever was going through that head of hers was wrong. It wasn\u2019t her fault, but he couldn\u2019t let her keep thinking those lies were true.</p><p>He caught her around the waist right as she jumped up into his truck. Her arms and legs flailed around, but Zach managed to keep her from hurting herself on the hard metal edges of the door. He got her away from the truck and sat them both down on the wet grass, holding her while she wore herself out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he told her loud enough she could hear it over her enraged shouting.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>Lexi clawed at his arms, but he held on. The sun had just broken free of the horizon and he had hours to patch up the cuts before the blood could draw any nasties.</p><p>Slowly, her fighting grew weaker and she sat in the circle of his arms, panting. Zach didn\u2019t dare let go. He didn\u2019t trust her not to try to run again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he said, keeping his voice low and steady. He didn\u2019t want her to think he was angry at her, or give her any reason to believe he meant to harm her. \u201cThat was your mom\u2019s journal, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew all about you, but it didn\u2019t save her life.\u201d Lexi\u2019s body jerked with a silent sob and it broke Zach\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t take her own advice. She slowed down. Didn\u2019t run fast enough. Your pets caught her one night when I went to the store for groceries. I came back to the motel and all that was left was . . . pieces.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against the memory, and Zach\u2019s arms tightened around her and he stroked her hair with his cheek. The comfort he offered was meager, but he didn\u2019t know what else to do. He knew better than to think he could fix this for her. Her mother was dead. No one could fix that.</p><p>\u201cI grabbed her journal and my suitcase, and left. Thank God I had just gotten my driver\u2019s license and was old enough to drive.\u201d</p><p>How frightened she must have been. So young, all alone, on the run. If only she\u2019d known the truth then, she could have come to live at Dabyr. He could have taken care of her and helped her move past her mother\u2019s murder. He could have taught her the truth slowly, while he still had time to be patient with her.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t known the truth and she hadn\u2019t come to Dabyr. All she\u2019d had to guide her was that journal full of lies.</p><p>Zach wanted to be angry at her mother for misleading Lexi, but he just couldn\u2019t. She might have been wrong, but at least she cared enough to do what she thought she had to to protect Lexi. And in a way, it had worked. Lexi was here in his arms, safe and sound, and she was damn well going to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to talk about the journal,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cI read some of it, and there are a lot of things in there that are simply not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d say that,\u201d spat Lexi.</p><p>He ignored her venom. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the part about how the Synestryn are our pets. That\u2019s flat-out wrong. They are our enemies. Monsters.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her listening. Her body went still and her head turned so she could hear him better. \u201cWhatever it was that killed your mother, it wasn\u2019t one of the Sentinels, nor was it done by our orders. We don\u2019t hurt humans. We protect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not always easy to do, I know. We fail sometimes, like we did with your mother. I can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am about that, but I swear to you that if I\u2019d known either of you existed, I would have done whatever it took to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have kidnapped us, like you did Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d How could she be so wrong? Who had fed her mother these lies? Certainly not the Synestryn. Only a few of their kind could even speak, and those that could were so monstrous that no sane person would have gotten close enough to have a conversation of any length.</p><p>So where had the lies come from?</p><p>\u201cHelen is safe back at home. You\u2019ll see once we get there that she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you drug her, like you try to do me when you touch me. Your skin is some kind of weapon.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile pulled at Zach\u2019s mouth. \u201cDo you feel drugged when I touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, but he could hear the lie in the way her voice quivered.</p><p>He liked knowing he could make her feel good with his touch. He liked it a lot. In fact, he had to stop himself from sliding his palms over her bare arms. As much as he wanted to, he had more important things to think about\u2014like clearing up the lies between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a drug, Lexi. I\u2019ve been trying to tell you that since I met you. We\u2019re meant to be together. All you have to do is put my luceria on and you\u2019ll see the truth. I won\u2019t hide anything from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you collar me.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s back teeth ground in frustration. He knew that if she just looked inside his mind, she\u2019d see the truth, but he couldn\u2019t get her to trust him enough to do it. He had more than twenty years of lies to erase\u2014lies that were tied to Lexi by bands of loyalty to her mother. That wasn\u2019t going to be something easy for her to give up. He was going to have to be patient, but he didn\u2019t know how much longer he was going to be able to hold out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since he\u2019d been near her, since she\u2019d been absorbing small streams of his power when they touched, he hadn\u2019t been hurting nearly so much. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was going to slow down the rate at which his leaf was dying or not, but he knew that once it was gone, he could easily turn into the monster she thought he was.</p><p>And then what would he do? Or, more important, what wouldn\u2019t he do?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it going to take to prove to you that I\u2019m not lying?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s head fell back on his shoulder in defeat. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Zach. I want to believe you, but isn\u2019t that the way the devil works? Tells you pretty lies you want to believe? I can\u2019t do that to Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to try to run away again?\u201d He still had the bracelet in his pocket. He could use it to keep her nearby if he wanted.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He wanted her to stay near him of her own free will.</p><p>Her head moved on his shoulder as she shook it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m done running. This is going to end now, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Zach hated the sound of defeat in her voice, but he believed she meant it. She wasn\u2019t running anymore. \u201cGood. Because if you stick with me, there\u2019s only one way things will go. You\u2019ll see the truth, and you and I will make each other happy for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty lies,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo lies, Lexi. I\u2019m going to take you home and prove it. Come on. The Gerai brought us a new car, and we\u2019re only about four hours away from the truth.\u201d</p><p>He hated taking her to Dabyr before he\u2019d claimed her for his own lady. There might well be other Theronai at home who were also compatible with her, and he didn\u2019t want to let her slip away again. But what he wanted wasn\u2019t as important as it had been only twenty minutes ago. He had to protect Lexi from herself as well as the Synestryn, and if that meant she ended up with another man, he\u2019d just have to suck it up. At least she\u2019d be safe. That was what really mattered.</p><p>If she did choose another man, it wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d have long to suffer, anyway.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Lexi made mental notes of the location of the Sentinels\u2019 stronghold, just in case she needed to give the Defenders directions via phone. It was set way back in a thickly wooded, isolated area in Missouri, well off the main highways. A few houses and farms dotted the surrounding area, but the fortress itself was shielded from view by heavy bands of forest.</p> <p>The compound had a high stone wall running all the way round it. Or at least she thought it probably did. She couldn\u2019t see the whole wall for all the trees that obscured it, as well as a monumental building and a few smaller structures. The main building was made of a pinkishgrayish stone that sparkled under the late-summer sunshine. Huge wings, like welcoming arms, spread out from either side of the structure.</p><p>Even though it was a refuge for demons and killers, it was still a beautiful place.</p><p>They went through an iron gate that opened for Zach only after he swiped his ID and talked to someone on the other end of a camera. The paved driveway was easily half a mile long, and led to a gigantic garage filled with numbered parking slots.</p><p>Zach pulled into one, and for a second, Lexi thought her faithful old Honda was beside them. Of course, her faithful Honda was still in the shop back in Texas, but she gave a wistful sigh of longing for her beloved set of wheels. Her home.</p><p>\u201cLooks like they beat us here,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance and Slade. Your car must not have needed too much work.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked at the Honda again. Primer gray, lots of rust, even more dirt. Yep, that was her car, all right.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine!\u201d she shouted, jumping down from the truck.</p><p>Lexi picked up the keys from the front seat and got behind the wheel. She cranked the engine, and it started with a smooth purr that hadn\u2019t been there for years. In fact, it had probably never run this well since she\u2019d owned it.</p><p>\u201cFrom the sound of it, Nicholas has been getting his hands dirty,\u201d said Zach. \u201cThat man has a way with moving parts.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d fixed her car. These people who were supposed to be her enemy had repaired her home and brought it to her. It wasn\u2019t worth much\u2014in fact, they\u2019d probably put more money into repairing it than she could have sold it for\u2014but it was the one constant in her life and she loved it.</p><p>Her vision went watery and she had to blink back hot tears before they could fall. \u201cThank you,\u201d she told Zach without looking at him. She didn\u2019t want him to see how much this gift had affected her. How vulnerable she\u2019d felt without a means to run as she\u2019d been doing all her life.</p><p>Those days were over\u2014she\u2019d meant that when she\u2019d told Zach she was done running\u2014but knowing she could if things turned ugly made her feel so much safer. Like life was back to normal.</p><p>And then she remembered the explosives in the trunk and all those feelings of safety and normalcy vanished.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fix it,\u201d said Zach. \u201cHow about we go inside and find Nicholas. You can thank him yourself.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. She couldn\u2019t speak right now, not with the lump of dread lodged in her throat. All she had to do was connect a couple of wires and push a button to detonate the C-4. The Defenders had made her practice how to do it over and over until it took her less than thirty seconds for the whole process.</p><p>And that included opening the broken lock on her trunk, which was a chore on the best of days.</p><p>Zach\u2019s fingers settled on her shoulder. They felt warm and strong and comforting, which was ridiculous. He should not be comforting her when she had the means of destroying his home and family. It was just wrong.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lexi gave a tight nod. \u201cSure. Just let me grab my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Zach beat her to it. He slung his heavy duffel bag over his shoulder, grabbed the handle of her suitcase, and offered her his free arm. The whole time, he wore a proud smile, like he wanted to show her off.</p><p>A sick sense of guilt clung to Lexi\u2019s insides. It was stupid. He was her enemy, so planning to blow this place up wasn\u2019t a betrayal. The real betrayal was the way her resolve to do the job she\u2019d promised to do wavered.</p><p>The Defenders had taken care of her and her mom since she was a kid. Whenever things got bad, Mom would go running to them. Neither one of them liked sticking around. Hector Morrow, the leader of the Defenders, was a raging asshole, but he was better than the monsters that hunted them. They\u2019d stay long enough to get back on their feet and Mom would take off running again.</p><p>Lexi hadn\u2019t had much to do with them since she\u2019d grown up. It was only after Zach had begun hunting her that she\u2019d gotten desperate enough to seek them out. They\u2019d taken her in and welcomed her back as if she\u2019d never been gone, like she was one of their own. They\u2019d gotten her the job with Gus and made sure she had a paycheck and a place to sleep every night. It was more than she\u2019d had in a long time, and the fact that she was even thinking about not doing as she\u2019d promised them was the worst kind of treachery.</p><p>They\u2019d warned her about how easy she could be swayed. Her mother had warned her of the Sentinels\u2019 powers of brainwashing. She knew these risks, and yet she still questioned her objective.</p><p>Lexi took Zach\u2019s offered arm, reveling in the comforting warmth that flowed between them. Two days ago, she would have just as soon stabbed him as touch him, and now she couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of him.</p><p>It was all too confusing. She hated this uncertainty, the weakness inside her that made her question what was right and wrong. Even knowing this confusion was part of the Sentinels\u2019 strategy, she still couldn\u2019t shake it off.</p><p>She was weak. That was the real problem here. She\u2019d never thought of herself that way until now. She\u2019d always believed she\u2019d be immune to their charms, but now she knew the truth. This wasn\u2019t something she could shrug off. No wonder Helen had been tricked so easily. She hadn\u2019t even had the benefit of a mother who knew the score.</p><p>Lexi had, and yet she was falling right into their trap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put this stuff in my suite. Then I\u2019ll take you to see Helen while I go check in and find Nicholas,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>Lexi nodded, wishing she was a stronger person. How was she going to save Helen when she was being sucked down herself?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>She looked up at him, plastering a smile on her face. His eyes glowed with concern, his dark brow wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust a little overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place will do that to you. I guess I\u2019m just used to it.\u201d</p><p>They passed through a hallway that led into a ginormous open area. The ceilings here were glass and so high up you could fly a kite inside. There were green plants and small trees growing everywhere, making the room feel almost like it was part of the outdoors.</p><p>Dozens of people sat at tables, eating lunch, chatting like they were spending the day at the mall. There were women and children here, too. Lexi hadn\u2019t expected to see kids.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks and took everything in.</p><p>\u201cWho are all these people?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHumans, mostly. People we\u2019ve saved from the Synestryn but who can\u2019t go back home.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have the look of prisoners. They seemed . . . happy. Kids lounged on couches at the far side of the room, watching TV or playing video games. A group of women was playing cards at one of the larger tables. Through the glass doorway on her left, she could see a bunch of people outside, working out on all kinds of exercise equipment.</p><p>No one wore chains or prison uniforms. No one looked sick or like they were starving. In fact, the smells coming from the dining area were making her stomach growl in anticipation.</p><p>Which left only one conclusion.</p><p>\u201cYou keep humans as pets?\u201d she asked, appalled at the idea.</p><p>Zach let out a bark of laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? What is it with you and this obsession with pets? If we want pets, we get cats and dogs like everyone else, though most of us are gone too much to have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why are there people here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we couldn\u2019t clean away enough of their memories for them to go back out in the world safely. Several of them have little pieces of the Synestryn in their heads, and it draws the demons like a beacon. If we didn\u2019t give them a safe place to live, they\u2019d be hunted down for food.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s mind whirled, trying to add this new piece of information into those she already knew. Try as she might, it simply didn\u2019t fit, which meant that either he was lying, or something else she thought was true was a lie.</p><p>She had to figure it out soon. She couldn\u2019t stay frozen in indecision like this forever. She had to either go through with her plan, or get back out there and make sure the Defenders knew how wrong they were about all of this.</p><p>\u201cI need to see Helen,\u201d said Lexi. Maybe talking to her would help straighten things out.</p><p>Zach gave her a funny look, half curious, half suspicious. \u201cSure, honey. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>He set down the bags, and dialed a number on his cell. \u201cHelen, Lexi\u2019s here and wants to see you. Where are you? Okay, we\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He hung up and said, \u201cShe\u2019s in her suite. I\u2019ll take you there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They wandered through several long hallways until they came to a door that looked like all the others. Lexi memorized the room number, hoping she would remember how to get here.</p><p>Helen opened the door before Zach had finished knocking. She wasn\u2019t caged or starved or hurt. She looked . . . fine. Lexi stood there confused, trying to add this new piece of information to the puzzle.</p><p>Helen didn\u2019t wait for Lexi to catch up. Instead, she rushed out of the door, past Zach and grabbed Lexi for a hard hug.</p><p>Lexi hugged her back. After a month of worry, she\u2019d finally found Helen\u2014the best friend she\u2019d ever had. It was a sad comment on her life that a woman she had served dinner to a couple nights a week back at Gertie\u2019s Diner for a total of three months was closer to her than anyone else since her mother, but there it was. Plain and simple. She\u2019d missed Helen so much, and now they were together again.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Lexi felt the cool streaks on her face that she realized she\u2019d been crying. She pulled away and swiped at the tears with the back of her hands. Helen did the same, though she gave Lexi a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d said Helen. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me? You\u2019re the one who got whisked off by a group of scary men.\u201d</p><p>Zach cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you two alone to catch up. Helen knows my number if you need me. Otherwise, I\u2019ll find you later.\u201d</p><p>Helen grabbed Zach around the neck and pulled him down for a hug of his own. She smooched his dark cheek and said, \u201cThank you for bringing her home safely. I owe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen stop kissing me before Drake sees and cuts off something of mine I like.\u201d</p><p>Helen laughed, patted Zach\u2019s chest and took Lexi\u2019s arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you for at least two hours\u2014got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d said Zach, his voice warmed by his grin. He touched the side of Lexi\u2019s face, barely grazing her skin. Happy tingles slid down her throat and settled low in her stomach. \u201cAfter you\u2019re done talking to Helen, after you\u2019ve figured things out, then you and I are going to have some things of our own to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t sure if it was a promise or a threat, but she found herself looking forward to being alone with Zach again. Which made her crazy.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten, so I\u2019ll have some lunch sent up for you both,\u201d he told them,</p><p>\u201cBreakfast for me, please,\u201d said Helen. \u201cIt was a late night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe wall?\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded. \u201cYeah. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Zach. \u201cBreakfast it is.\u201d Then he picked up the bags and walked back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>Lexi watched him go, enjoying the sight of his long, easy stride, the way his muscles flexed under his snug jeans. He was so finely built that she still could hardly believe he was real, much less that he wanted anything to do with her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mighty fine sight,\u201d whispered Helen.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>Zach disappeared around the corner, and Lexi was finally free of his pull. She gave herself a good mental shake and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get you inside and see if we can undo whatever brainwashing these Sentinels have done to you.\u201d</p><p>Brainwashing?</p> <p>Helen gave Lexi a long look as they went inside her suite. Clearly, Lexi had some issues that needed to be ironed out. At least she was here, safe and sound, and Helen was able to do the ironing.</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cIs anyone else here?\u201d</p><p>Helen looked around at the suite. It was actually pretty plain, but neat and tidy. She\u2019d been living here for a few weeks, and kept meaning to decorate the place, maybe repaint a couple of rooms, but she just hadn\u2019t had the time. Whatever excess energy she had, she\u2019d been pouring it into that freaking wall, imbuing the stones with the power to hold them together against whatever the Synestryn might throw at them next.</p><p>Who knew that magic could be so exhausting?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just us. Drake is in a meeting with some of the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. The boys\u2019 club.\u201d</p><p>Helen rolled her eyes. \u201cThey can have it. I sat in once and my eyes glazed over in about thirty seconds. They can drone on for hours about maps and strategy and whatnot. All I need to know is where are the monsters they want me to set on fire.\u201d</p><p>Lexi gave a low whistle. \u201cYou? Set things on fire?\u201d</p><p>Of course Lexi wouldn\u2019t believe it. When they\u2019d first met, Helen had been terrified of cigarette lighters. Heaven forbid someone put a birthday candle on her cake. She\u2019d freaked out more than once over the sight of a flame, but now things were different.</p><p>Now, fire was her weapon of choice.</p><p>She opened her palm and called a small flame to her, using the invisible river of power flowing into her from Drake. The orange puff of fire flickered in her hand, barely warm against her skin. \u201cThings have changed,\u201d she told Lexi. \u201cFor the better.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s knees buckled and she sank to the couch in shock, her eyes wide. \u201cWow. Okay. Not at all what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine there\u2019s going to be a lot of that for you for a while. I\u2019m still getting used to all this stuff. Some of it is really far out there. You should see this lady, Gilda, in a fight. It\u2019s like watching a freaking anime cartoon or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many women like you are there here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Me, Gilda, Andra and her sister, Nika, though she\u2019s not well. We\u2019re all hoping she pulls through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Miss Mabel is here, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d said Helen, letting the flame in her hand dissipate in a puff of smoke as she joined Lexi on the couch. \u201cWe can go visit her in a little while, but first, tell me what\u2019s happened to you. Why are you worried about me being brainwashed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t think you have been, but that\u2019s okay. We can still fix you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean me. I can fix you up.\u201d</p><p>Helen wasn\u2019t buying it. Lexi was hiding something. \u201cWe who, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Really. Just know that you and I aren\u2019t alone. We\u2019ll be able to get everyone out safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who? Out of where? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my home. I have no intention of leaving.\u201d Lexi pulled in a long breath as if trying to gather her patience. \u201cOkay. Fine. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Helen walked to the fridge, grabbed two cans of soda and handed one to her friend. \u201cListen, you need to understand a few things. First, I\u2019m happy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were kidnapped. It\u2019s Stockholm syndrome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m happy. I love Drake. He loves me.\u201d</p><p>Helen could see Lexi wasn\u2019t believing a word she said, but eventually, she would. She just needed some time. \u201cSecond, you\u2019re safe here. No one is going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Zach keeps saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth. You should listen.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s mouth flattened to a stubborn line.</p><p>Helen ignored it. \u201cAnd three, Zach needs you. He may have been too full of pride to tell you, but he\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>A look of guilt crossed Lexi\u2019s face, but she covered it by taking a long drink from the can. \u201cHe mentioned something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s more up front than Drake was then. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for him.\u201d She said it like she\u2019d already decided to let Zach die.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re at least thinking about saving him.\u201d Helen had to get Lexi to save Zach. She\u2019d grown fond of him since she\u2019d moved here, and now that she was a part of this war, she knew just how important Lexi could be in aiding their fight to save the world from Synestryn invasion. She didn\u2019t think that starting out by telling Lexi she\u2019d be fighting a war was a great strategy to get her cooperation, but hooking up with Zach . . . that was its own kind of enticement. Helen loved her husband, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t see what a fine-looking man Zach was.</p><p>Lexi turned her head and stared out the windows. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cI know you\u2019d never intentionally lie to me. What I\u2019m worried about is that you may not even know what the truth is anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m brainwashed. That\u2019s what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the thought had crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that? Whatever gave you that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s journal. A group called the Defenders of Humanity.\u201d</p><p>Helen had heard a single mention of that group somewhere recently. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the guys who tote shotguns and think the Sentinels are out to ruin their farmland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. They\u2019re tired of having a war waged right in their backyards. They\u2019re tired of having their land destroyed and their families afraid. They\u2019ve been around for a long time. They know the Sentinels are up to no good. They also know how to stop them.\u201d</p><p>A cold shiver of dread ran through Helen. \u201cWhat do you mean? How are they going to stop us?\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s mouth tightened and she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThose guys are a bunch of farmers, Lexi. They have no idea what\u2019s really going on. They\u2019re going to end up getting themselves hurt. Or killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told me you\u2019d say that. And that if you did, there would be nothing I could do to save you.\u201d</p><p>This was getting out of hand fast. Helen leaned forward and took Lexi\u2019s hand. \u201cI need you to listen to me, okay? Whatever they told you isn\u2019t true. They\u2019re not bad guys\u2014they just don\u2019t know the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if they do?\u201d asked Lexi, thrusting out her pointed chin. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re the ones who are right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tied to Drake in such a way that I can see his mind. I would know if he was lying to me about something this big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>Helen pushed out a frustrated breath. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to explain the concept of color to someone who was born blind. You\u2019re just going to have to take my word for it. Or go to Zach and put on his luceria yourself. Then you\u2019ll understand. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that\u2019s how they get you? That could be the way they brainwash you permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brainwashed!\u201d Helen had shouted it and she had to rein herself back in and control her temper. She was just too tired from all the extra work. She wasn\u2019t getting enough rest, and it was making her short tempered and cranky. Lexi deserved better\u2014she deserved her patience. This stuff was a lot to absorb for anyone.</p><p>In a calmer voice, she said, \u201cThere are a lot of people here who aren\u2019t wearing a luceria. Talk to them if you don\u2019t believe me. Talk to the teens. If anyone is going to fight back against some mass brainwashing, it will be one of them. And of course, there\u2019s Miss Mabel, and you know how pigheaded she can be. Talk to any of them. No one will stop you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t. You\u2019re free to do as you like here as long as you\u2019re not planning to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shifted in her seat and her eyes darted away from Helen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not planning to hurt anyone, are you, Lexi?\u201d</p> <p>In a small voice, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? If you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to. No one can make you do anything you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>Lexi pressed her thumbs against her temples like her head was hurting. \u201cI just need some time to think. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Helen didn\u2019t believe that was all. Not for one second. Lexi had something up her sleeve, and as much as Helen loved her, she couldn\u2019t let her friend hurt anyone here. These people were her family, and she was sworn to protect them, just like Drake was.</p><p>But, instead of pushing the issue, Helen let it go. She\u2019d let the men know Lexi might be a danger, and everyone would keep tabs on her. Once she was here for a couple of days and had a chance to see for herself that it wasn\u2019t what she suspected, she\u2019d be more reasonable.</p> <p>Helen only hoped that Zach had that long to wait for Lexi to believe the truth.</p><p>Lexi tested Helen\u2019s theory that she\u2019d be free to roam around by doing so. After a tense lunch that she barely managed to choke down, Lexi left Helen\u2019s suite and ambled through the hallways until she found herself back in the big glass-ceilinged room.</p><p>By now, the lunch crowd had thinned out and the TV area was empty of kids. A few people sat at the tables, drinking coffee or finishing their lunches. Miss Mabel sat at the edge of the dining area, reading a giant, antique book. Every few seconds, she\u2019d look up at the kids nearby, as if she had the need to keep tabs on them. After teaching public school for so long, Lexi guessed it was more a habit than anything.</p><p>She pulled out a chair and sat down across from the woman. Miss Mabel looked up and beamed at her. \u201cLexi! As I live and breathe. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She looked younger, as if some of the lines had been erased from her face. She still wore the same garish lipstick and the white bun on the top of her head was still held in place with a single yellow, number two pencil, but everything else about her seemed . . . different.</p><p>\u201cYou remember those rude men from the diner?\u201d asked Lexi.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Zach. That poor fellow has been pining for you since the day you ran off. I\u2019m glad he finally caught up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad? They abducted you and Helen and dragged you here against your will. How can you take their side?\u201d</p><p>Miss Mabel\u2019s eyes narrowed and she pointed a gnarled finger at Lexi. \u201cDon\u2019t you get uppity with me. I may not condone their methods, but if it weren\u2019t for them, I\u2019d be dead right now. So would Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say. You can\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. I\u2019ve talked with enough of the children here to know what happens to those the Theronai don\u2019t manage to find in time. So many of them have lost their parents, their families. The Synestryn do horrible things that don\u2019t even come close to the sin of forcing someone into safety against their will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know the kids aren\u2019t lying?\u201d asked Lexi.</p> <p>Miss Mabel lifted a white brow. \u201cThirty years of experience. That\u2019s how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know they\u2019re not brainwashed? How do you know their parents aren\u2019t out there, looking for their lost kids?\u201d</p><p>The older woman shook her head, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn child and will probably only believe when you see with your own eyes, but when you\u2019re here long enough, you\u2019ll know what I know. You\u2019ll see some big, strapping man carry a bloody child through those doors\u2014one that\u2019s crying and clinging to him like a lifeline. You\u2019ll read the paper and see photos of the parents brutally slain\u2014torn to pieces by monsters. Only then will you know the truth, deep down, the way I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s not those same big, strapping men killing the parents? They do carry swords, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really that blind?\u201d asked Miss Mabel. \u201cCan you really look around this place of refuge and see such evil? Because if you can, then I have to wonder what might be wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>And that was the crux of the problem. Since she\u2019d been here, she hadn\u2019t seen a single sign of torture or mistreatment. Everyone seemed content, safe.</p><p>Miss Mabel stood, without the help of her walker, without even leaning on the table for support. Even though she was still not quite five feet tall, she was no longer stooped with age. She turned around in a circle, her movements smooth and fluid. \u201cThere\u2019s no brainwashing here, child. The Sentinels didn\u2019t have to take my pain away or free me from that blasted walker, but they did. And at great cost, too. I\u2019ve never had a thing for vampires the way some of these youngsters do, but the one that healed me nearly made himself sick doing it. It took three Theronai willing to open up their veins and bleed for me to make it happen, too. These men may be big, rude brutes, but they\u2019re good, big, rude brutes. Without them, I\u2019d hate to think of where the world would be. Maybe you should spend some time thinking about that for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been. Believe me. Nothing seems clear anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d say you need to go have a look around. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Helen said.\u201d</p><p>Miss Mabel sat back down and waved Lexi away. \u201cScoot. I\u2019ve got work to do. There\u2019s an entire library of books here I haven\u2019t read and that just can\u2019t stand.\u201d She went back to her reading, dismissing Lexi.</p><p>With a sigh of weariness and confusion, Lexi left. All she could think of was that if the Sentinels wanted to keep Miss Mabel prisoner, the last thing they would have done was given her the ability to run away easier.</p><p>Like so many other things she\u2019d witnessed, it made no sense.</p><p>The sunshine outside called to her. Maybe some fresh air would help her sort things out. And if not, at least she\u2019d walk off some of the excess energy clawing around inside of her, making her anxious.</p><p>The outdoor exercise area was stuffed full of muscular men, all shirtless and glistening like they knew she was coming by and wanted to give her a fantastic show.</p><p>Most of them were Theronai\u2014she could tell by their tree tattoos. A few humans mingled with them, sweating and pumping iron, though just not as much. Apparently, the Theronai were superstrong. Or maybe they\u2019d just been lifting longer.</p><p>Lexi enjoyed the sight as she pushed through the doors and walked right down the middle of the area as if she owned the place.</p><p>She was pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t let her pass, but other than a few interested stares\u2014something she was used to\u2014no one moved to intercept her.</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>She followed a sidewalk to the right, and saw water shining in the distance, either a lake or a really big pond. The grass was thick and lush, and flowers were planted in pretty little clumps lining the walkway. As she cleared the corner of one wing, she saw a fenced-in area and heard the joyful squeal of small kids. Behind that iron fence and the low hedges along one side, she found about a dozen preschoolers playing. Some of them climbed on the sturdy plastic slide, or ran into the matching playhouse. Two boys were rolling a ball between them, their aim so bad they had to run after the ball, which was apparently part of the game, based on the way they laughed while doing it. Three girls were in a giant sandbox building a crooked sandcastle.</p><p>Lexi propped her arms up on the top railing and just watched them, ignoring the stares of the adults keeping track of the tykes. She hadn\u2019t expected to see kids here, and certainly not so many of them.</p><p>They seemed happy. Healthy. How could that be when they were being raised alongside monsters?</p><p>Unless, of course, Helen and Zach had been telling the truth all along, and it was Lexi\u2019s mother and the Defenders who had been wrong.</p><p>This was their home. There was no way she could destroy that, and certainly no way to get them all out to safety.</p><p>Which meant that not only could she not blow this place up, she couldn\u2019t let the Defenders do it, either. That much was crystal clear. She had to find a way to contact them and let them know there were kids here.</p><p>She turned away from the playground and went back the way she came. Only this time, when she tried to pass through the exercise area, four large Theronai stepped in her path.</p><p>\u201cLet me by,\u201d she told them, craning her head back to look them all in the eye.</p><p>The one with a scarred face said, \u201cNot until we touch you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi backed up and bumped into another man. He grabbed her upper arms and panic sliced through her for a split second before her body settled, and all the preparation she\u2019d done kicked in.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d been expecting all along and she knew just how to handle it.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Nika was draped over Madoc like a blanket when he awoke. For a moment, he thought he was dreaming again, but in his dreams he didn\u2019t hurt, so he had to be awake.</p><p>The bedside clock said it was nearly two in the afternoon. He\u2019d slept longer than usual, even considering how exhausted he\u2019d been last night.</p><p>Nika\u2019s head was tucked under his chin and he could feel her breath sliding out of her lungs, tickling him as it swept through his chest hair. One of his hands was locked around her waist and the other cupped her ass. Her skinny legs had settled between his thighs, and his hard cock was throbbing against her stomach.</p><p>He had no idea how she\u2019d gotten in his room, or what in the hell had possessed her to come, but all of that was inconsequential now. Nika was here, in his bed, and everything inside him screamed out that because of that, she was his for the taking.</p><p>Sweat beaded up on his skin and he started to shake against the need to flip her under him and fuck her\u2014drive into her body until some of the pain bled off and he could think straight.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked her to come to him. She had to be here because that was what she wanted him to do, right?</p><p>Something about that line of logic was flawed, and Madoc held still, fighting himself until he could figure out what was wrong. He tried to remember what he would have done before his soul started dying\u2014before he\u2019d turned from a noble man into this bloodthirsty killer he now was.</p><p>Nika was sick. Fragile. Completely crazy. The girl didn\u2019t know what she wanted. Maybe that was why he needed to keep himself in check.</p><p>Her fingers curled against his bare chest and she let out a sigh. Madoc\u2019s blood pounded through him fierce and hard.</p><p>Why the hell was she here?</p><p>To get fucked? Or had she needed him? Maybe she\u2019d come here for help and been too tired to get back to her own room. It made more sense than anything else.</p><p>Slowly, so he wouldn\u2019t wake her, Madoc rolled her body over onto the mattress. He cradled her head in his hand, keeping it steady as her slight weight shifted. The girl was already too mixed up in the brain for him to do any more harm by jostling her noggin, but the part of him that used to be good remembered he was supposed to be careful with her. She might be able to save one of his brothers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her white hair spilled out over the sheets, blending in until only her dark lashes and pink lips were visible in the dim light of his bedroom. The pale nightgown she wore fell nearly to her ankles and hid the bony contours of her wasted body.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t like scrawny chicks. Nika shouldn\u2019t have done anything for him, but his dick thought otherwise. Not that he could listen to it for advice\u2014the thing had a mind of its own.</p><p>Before he could stop himself, he looked at the ring on his finger, hoping for a sign that she could save him. As always, he saw nothing in the pale depths of the band\u2014no pulse of color or glimmer of hope.</p><p>Madoc couldn\u2019t even find the strength to mourn what could have been. He was empty. Hollow. Void of everything but pain and anger.</p> <p>But those faithful companions had served him well last night as he\u2019d hunted. Sixteen more sgath had fallen by his blade. He didn\u2019t know if any of them had stolen pieces of Nika\u2019s mind, but if they had, she would be that much more restored when she woke today.</p><p>Killing was all he had to offer her, no matter how much he wished it were otherwise.</p><p>With a final glance at her, Madoc eased himself from his bed to dress for a few hours of pumping iron in the training yard. After that, he\u2019d go find a whore or three to fuck, then head out to kill some more sgath at nightfall. Same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019. At least now that they\u2019d found out what was plaguing Nika, he had a reason to get out of bed each day.</p><p>\u201cMadoc.\u201d Nika\u2019s faint voice drifted up from the bed.</p><p>He froze, knowing that if he turned around right now, he might change his mind about those whores and use her instead. She was here, and he hurt like hell. He could find some ease inside her body\u2014scrawny or not\u2014even if it was only for a while.</p> <p>\u201cI saw you last night,\u201d she said. \u201cHunting.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d seen him, then a sliver of her mind had been in the beasts he\u2019d killed. At least he was finding the right sgath. That was something.</p><p>\u201cHow was my technique?\u201d he asked without turning around.</p><p>He heard a shift of fabric, the slight creak of the bed as it moved under her meager weight. She was getting closer to him. He could feel it in the tightening of his muscles, the awareness of the heat of her skin.</p><p>The soulless part of him dared her to touch him. Reach for him. It was all the excuse he needed to throw her down and use her. If she touched him, then she must want him to take her. He\u2019d have no more reason to hold back. He could give into that baser part of him that wanted the release that only came from coming inside a woman. All she had to do was lay a single finger on his body and she\u2019d be his.</p><p>Madoc stepped away, out of reach of the bed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant it to be a taunt, but Madoc\u2019s blood was running hot, and he heard it as one, anyway. He spun around, not even bothering to hide his thick erection from her sight like he might have before he\u2019d lost his soul. His honor.</p><p>She looked almost ethereal, all pale and glowing in the darkness. She was kneeling on the bed, and her white gown pooled around her knees, hiding her body from his sight.</p><p>Madoc wanted to strip it from her and see her naked. Keep her that way. He didn\u2019t even care anymore if she was bony and weak. He\u2019d find a way to fix her and make her healthy enough for the kind of treatment he had to offer.</p><p>When he spoke, his voice was rough with arousal. \u201cNo, but you should be afraid of me. What the hell were you thinking coming into my room? Into my bed?\u201d</p><p>Nika frowned in confusion. \u201cI\u2019ve slept here every day and you haven\u2019t complained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you have,\u201d spat Madoc. \u201cI think I would have remembered having a woman in my bed.\u201d Although, he\u2019d slept like the dead for a few days now, so maybe he was wrong. Wouldn\u2019t that be just great to learn that he\u2019d slipped so far he couldn\u2019t even keep himself safe anymore from whoever wanted to walk in?</p><p>She looked down, making her white hair slide out from behind her shoulder. \u201cOh. Right. I\u2019m wearing my body today. That\u2019s what\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc didn\u2019t have a fucking clue what that meant. \u201cAnd you weren\u2019t before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was too weak to come with me. It must be better now.\u201d She closed her eyes and ran her hands over her body. She was obviously checking herself for something, and hadn\u2019t meant to give Madoc a sexy show by feeling herself up, but she had anyway.</p><p>The sight made him shake with need. He wanted those to be his hands, or at least for her to do that while she was naked. She was teasing him and he didn\u2019t like it one bit. He was going to show her what happened to women who teased.</p><p>His cock twitched against the confines of his boxers, and he barely caught himself in time to keep from reaching for her. It took every bit of his strength to lock his feet in place. If he touched her now, he knew how it would end. She would be naked, under him, and he wouldn\u2019t give a shit about whether or not she wanted it. Whether she liked it or not.</p><p>He closed his eyes, and it helped him regain enough willpower to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t come here again,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut I need you, Madoc.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit him like a fist in his gut. They drove the air from his lungs and left him floundering for control. He\u2019d spent centuries hoping to hear those words from a female Theronai, but it was too late. She couldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>Confusion fogged her blue eyes. She wasn\u2019t sane. She didn\u2019t understand what Madoc wanted to do to her\u2014what she did to him\u2014and he had to stop expecting her to be able to.</p><p>He gathered what little patience he could find and forced his voice to be gentle even though the pain raging inside him was anything but. \u201cNika, you need me to kill the sgath that hold your mind captive. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She moved across the bed, swifter than would have been possible for her in her weakened state. He didn\u2019t expect it, and wasn\u2019t fast enough to evade her grasp. She pressed her hand over his lifemark. Her palm on his bare skin was warm, but that was all. Madoc found himself hoping in vain to feel something\u2014anything\u2014even the slightest shift of the branches of his tree.</p><p>The single leaf frozen midway down his torso felt dead under her hand. And, of course, the other fake leaves he\u2019d had tattooed on his chest remained still and lifeless.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t his. He knew it. He\u2019d known it since that first night when they\u2019d rescued her from the mental hospital. It was time to move on and stop letting her torture him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she told him. \u201cI need you. Please don\u2019t send me away.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to agree. He wanted to give her everything she\u2019d ever wanted, but he knew better. He wasn\u2019t capable of giving her anything but pain and regret. \u201cI can\u2019t trust myself not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>He felt his lip curl in self-disgust. \u201cThen you\u2019re a foolish little girl who deserves whatever she gets.\u201d He lifted her hand from his skin and let it drop, then turned away from her. \u201cDon\u2019t come back again. If you do, I\u2019ll make sure you regret it.\u201d</p><p>Zach saw the commotion in the training yard and went to see what was up. He thought about ignoring it so he could get back to Lexi faster, but his sense of duty refused to let him walk away from his brothers. With the wall still vulnerable, he wasn\u2019t taking any chances that whatever was going on out there was more than a testosterone-driven skirmish.</p><p>When he cleared the glass doors, he saw Nicholas, Neal and Morgan backing away from someone. Their big bodies shifted enough and he got a glimpse of who that someone was.</p><p>Lexi.</p><p>She had a barbell in her hands, wielding it like a staff, wearing that same feral expression she\u2019d had on when he\u2019d first met her\u2014the night she\u2019d stabbed him. Lexi the Avenger.</p><p>Samuel Larsten was on the ground, holding his scarred hand against his head to slow the bleeding. Nicholas held his hands up, as did Neal and Morgan, but Morgan was grinning like a fool. \u201cShe\u2019s feisty,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>A primitive club of jealousy bashed Zach over the head, and he was striding forward before he had a chance to think twice about what he planned to do. With a powerful shove of his palms against the men\u2019s shoulders, Morgan and Neal went flying in opposite directions.</p><p>Nicholas dodged his airborne buddies and stepped in front of Lexi as if to protect her. From Zach.</p><p>\u201cOut of the way,\u201d growled Zach.</p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019ve cooled off, man,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>Possessive rage pounded against Zach, heating his blood and making him see red. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. All I\u2019m saying is that you\u2019re not getting near her until you calm the fuck down.\u201d</p><p>The clang of metal hitting concrete rang out from behind Nicholas as the barbell fell from Lexi\u2019s hands. A split second later, she sprinted away, her tennis shoes slapping against the ground.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t about to let her get away. Not this time.</p><p>He bashed into Nicholas with the full force of his weight, rocking the man back on his heels. It was all the room Zach needed to get past, and he broke into a dead run, following Lexi over the rich green grass.</p><p>The thrill of the hunt coursed through him, making his blood sing in his veins. Power flooded his limbs and a feral smile stretched his lips. He could run like this for hours and never get tired. Not when he was chasing prey with an ass as pretty as Lexi\u2019s.</p><p>He heard footsteps behind him, likely his brothers coming to save her from the big, bad wolf, but he didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>She headed for the line of trees shielding several cabins. Not all of the Sentinels liked communal living, and preferred having four walls all their own with no one on the other side. Currently, only two of the cabins were occupied.</p><p>He followed her through the trees, keeping the distance between them wide enough she could think she was actually getting away.</p><p>Nicholas ran up beside him, having finally caught up. \u201cI can\u2019t let you hurt her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s time to end this. I\u2019m out of time, and I\u2019m claiming her while I still have enough of myself left to be gentle about it,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure gentle is where your head is right now?\u201d</p><p>Zach had been keeping a careful eye on Lexi, but he spared Nicholas a quick glance. The man\u2019s scarred face was puckered with concern. Zach felt a swell of gratitude, knowing his buddy would never let him do anything stupid that might hurt her. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded, keeping pace. \u201cNone of us there was compatible. Guess she\u2019s all yours. You\u2019ll understand if I can\u2019t stick around and watch, right?\u201d</p><p>Watch Zach get what every man gathered there wanted more than anything\u2014a woman who could save them and allow them to keep fighting the Synestryn. It had been hard watching Drake find Helen, seeing them happy together, holding hands and smiling. He loved Drake like a brother, but the jealousy raging through him had not been fun to suffer. He didn\u2019t wish to inflict that on anyone. \u201cYeah. Go back and tell the men she\u2019s safe. And to give us some time alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholas disappeared back through the trees, and Zach picked up speed, closing the distance to Lexi. When she came into sight and veered to the left of Iain\u2019s cabin, Zach followed. His long legs ate up the ground as his body worked to get her back where she belonged\u2014by his side, forever.</p><p>The next time she looked over her shoulder at him, he was within arm\u2019s reach. Her chocolate brown eyes widened, and she tripped over the root of a tree.</p><p>Zach grabbed the back of her shirt to stop her fall, then gathered her in his arms. He didn\u2019t stop moving. He swept her up and continued on to the nearest unoccupied cabin. It wasn\u2019t as posh as the suites in the main building were, but there would be a mattress on the bed to cushion Lexi\u2019s back and that was all that really mattered.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were done running,\u201d he told her. His voice was rough and harder than he\u2019d intended.</p> <p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She was panting. Her cheeks were pink, and her chest rose and fell, pressing deliciously against his.</p><p>Zach booted the cabin door open and slammed it shut again once they\u2019d cleared it. The doors bolted from the inside with thick, sturdy beams of wood over iron brackets. He bumped it with his elbow and the beam fell into the bracket, locking them in.</p><p>The place smelled a little musty, but the scent of pine made it tolerable. It was dark in here, compared to outside, with only a dim ray of tree- filtered light sliding in through the dusty windows. The cabin was small, maybe two hundred square feet. A bed hugged one wall, and along the opposite wall was a fireplace and a table with two chairs. In the far corner, there was a bathroom with all the necessary equipment, though none of it fancy. Other than food, they had everything they needed right here.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, Zach.\u201d Lexi\u2019s voice shook and she no longer sounded like a woman confident enough to go up against a group of large men armed only with a metal pole.</p><p>Zach did as he was told and laid her on the bare mattress. Before she could try anything, he crawled on top of her and caged her in with his body. He kept his weight on his hands and knees, keeping as much distance between their bodies as he could. He didn\u2019t trust himself enough to press his body fully to hers and keep control. As it was, his dick was hard and his blood was demanding he stake a physical claim on her body, and to hell with the luceria. He wanted her naked and wet and spread out for his pleasure. Just the thought of running his hands over her bare skin was enough to make him shake.</p> <p>But he had to do this right. One step at a time, and that meant keeping his hands to himself and his dick in his jeans, much to his dismay.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI just want to leave, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. I don\u2019t have the time to find you again.\u201d He could feel his last leaf barely clinging to the branch. It was dry and withered, and he was sure he wouldn\u2019t last until morning. Not without Lexi giving him what he needed.</p><p>Zach traced a finger over her throat. He could feel her pulse skittering under his fingertip. Her skin was warm and so silky soft he had to close his eyes and soak up the feeling, completely losing himself in that single touch for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Zach didn\u2019t want that. He wanted to make her happy. To make her feel good.</p><p>She\u2019d told him that it felt good when he touched her, so Zach spread his hand over her throat, reveling in the striking contrast of his darker skin against hers, the roughness of his hands against the perfect silkiness of her neck. He willed a ribbon of energy through his arm, letting it spark between them, expanding into a million tiny fragments of sensation.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s eyes fluttered closed and she let out a soft sound of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cStill scared?\u201d he asked, forcing his tone to remain gentle even though the need to claim her raging through him was anything but gentle.</p><p>She grabbed his wrist, wrapping both hands around it. She didn\u2019t push him away, just held on, trembling in indecision.</p><p>Her bottom lip quivered, and he wanted to kiss it and drive away the worry he heard in her voice. \u201cHelen says I\u2019m wrong. Miss Mabel says I\u2019m wrong. You say I\u2019m wrong. You all say the Sentinels are the good guys. How can my whole life be a lie?\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t want to talk. He wanted to demand she give him what he needed, both her body and her vow to stay by his side for eternity. He knew it was meant to be, that they\u2019d both be happy together if she\u2019d shed the lies of her human upbringing and let him show her the truth of their kind. Her kind, too.</p><p>She pinned him with a look of desperation\u2014one so strong he knew he had to slow down. She needed him to talk to her and soothe her, and in the end, he could deny her nothing.</p> <p>Zach fought back his pounding lust and willed himself to speak. \u201cNo one can force you to believe. All I can do is offer you a means to learn the truth for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to his throat. To his luceria. \u201cI . . . can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d That question cost him another precious sliver of control, but he offered it nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cIf Mom was right, then once I put that on it will be too late. I\u2019ll be imprisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works. I can\u2019t force you to wear it, believe me. If I could, you\u2019d already be my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother lie?\u201d she asked with a hint of defiance lifting her chin.</p><p>Zach smiled. He loved that about her. Here she was, trapped beneath him, locked in a cabin inside a compound she couldn\u2019t easily escape, and yet still, she didn\u2019t give up. His Lexi was a fighter to the core, and he was a lucky man to have found her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one way to find out,\u201d he taunted. \u201cUnless you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>Sparks of rebellion lit her eyes. \u201cGet over yourself. You\u2019re not scary enough to make me afraid. I\u2019ve spent my life running from monsters scarier than you. Grow some claws or teeth or something and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s stopping you?\u201d He tilted his chin, baring his throat. \u201cTake it. It\u2019s up to you how long you decide to wear it.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and Zach\u2019s body clenched in anticipation. Despite what she said, she was afraid. He could feel it in the way her arm trembled, the way her pupils had shrunk down to tiny dots of black. But even with that fear, she didn\u2019t back down. She ran her finger along the band and Zach felt that single touch slide through him like lightning, sizzling him to his toes. His dick strained for release and a hot hum of desire wrapped around his veins.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take it.\u201d Zach was panting, sucking in enough air to hold himself in control.</p><p>She wrapped her slender fingers around the luceria and gave a slight tug. It split open and she gasped, dropping it, like it was a live snake, but the luceria didn\u2019t mind. It fell around her neck, locking into place as if it had been waiting its entire existence for this single moment in time.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s eyes went wide and she shoved hard against Zach. He moved back enough to let her sit up, but still straddled her legs, making sure she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Not until this was done. Permanent.</p><p>Zach smiled at her. He couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything prettier in my life than you are right now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled on the luceria. \u201cIt won\u2019t come off.\u201d</p><p>Zach captured her hands before she could hurt herself. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given me your vow yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Zach wanted her forever. But to get what he wanted, he had to be smart, tread carefully. If she continued to see him as her enemy, she\u2019d never learn to trust him, and if that happened, their bond would never work right. Trust was vital to the flow of power between them.</p><p>Even though he hated the idea, he knew what he had to do. If he wanted her trust, he had to offer his own. \u201cPromise to wear it until you change your mind. That way, if you see something that isn\u2019t right and you no longer want to be with me, you\u2019ll be free to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived a long time. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether or not I trust you, I don\u2019t want to be the one to kill you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Even if you decide to leave, my death won\u2019t be your fault. I\u2019m headed that way fast anyway.</p><p>Any extra time you give me is a gift, extending my natural life.\u201d He just wasn\u2019t ready for it to end yet. Not if Lexi could be part of it.</p><p>With plenty of luck and patience, she\u2019d see the truth and never take off his luceria. He would find a way to make that happen.</p><p>Zach rose from the bed and knelt beside it. He stripped his shirt off over his head, unsheathed his sword and made a small cut over his heart. \u201cMy life for yours, Lexi. Forever.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t like that one. Give me a different vow.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth cocked up in a grin. \u201cSorry, honey. That\u2019s the one you\u2019re getting. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a drop of blood to the luceria, making it come to life. It shrank to fit her slender throat. She swallowed and the movement caused the luceria to glisten in a riot of green ribbons of color.</p><p>After taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cI promise to wear this thing as long as I want. As soon as I don\u2019t want to wear it, then it comes off.\u201d</p><p>Her vow worked. He felt the subtle power of it weighing down on him. Light in the room expanded until it pressed against him like a blanket, sealing her vow inside of him.</p><p>She was his now. He was going to make sure it stayed that way.</p><p>His world tilted and fell away as the luceria revealed to him some treasured part of Lexi it wanted him to see. Zach held his breath and let the vision flow over him. Lights and colors sped past him and he came to a rocking stop outside the door of a mom-and-pop restaurant along a stretch of highway. Lexi was standing there, her hair in pigtails. She was five or six years old, but he recognized her dainty pointed chin and the defiant set of her shoulders even then. She was so cute, so tiny and vulnerable, it made his chest grow tight with the need to protect her.</p><p>Her mother, whom he recognized from the photos in Lexi\u2019s Honda, bent low so she could be heard over the intermittent roar of truckers as they sped by. \u201cDo you remember your name?\u201d she asked Lexi.</p><p>\u201cLucy James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And where did we come from?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lip a moment, then said, \u201cMini apples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinneapolis. It\u2019s in Minnesota. It\u2019s cold there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the cold,\u201d complained Lexi.</p><p>\u201cI know. You make sure to tell people that. It\u2019s a good reason for us to have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the monsters? I thought we left \u2019cause of the monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone about the monsters. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded her head. Her hair had been lighter then, but just as baby fine as it was now and it swayed around her sweet face. \u201cIf I tell someone, the monsters will eat them just like they want to eat us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s our secret, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi nodded again and colors around Zach started to blur once more as the vision changed. This time, Lexi was a few years older. She was in the car with her mother, looking out the window as they passed by a middle school. A pile of kids her age poured out of the doors, laughing and eager to get out of there. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go to school?\u201d she asked her mom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe. I teach you everything you need to know, Ali.\u201d</p><p>Lexi crossed her arms over her chest, slid down lower in the seat and pouted. \u201cI don\u2019t like that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You can pick your name for the next town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlexandra Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t use your real name. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m tired of moving, Mom. I just want to be normal.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed as if preparing herself to repeat something for the thousandth time. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be normal, Ali. The Sentinels want your blood. If we stay in one place too long, they\u2019ll find you and kill you. I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never even seen one of the Sentinels, only their pets,\u201d complained Lexi.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them. They look like men with trees growing on their chests, but inside, they\u2019re rotted meat and maggots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You\u2019re just trying to scare me.\u201d</p><p>The car rocked to a skidding stop and people behind them honked their horns. Lexi\u2019s mom ignored them and turned in her seat, her blue eyes blazing with fury. \u201cYou should be scared. Only stupid people aren\u2019t scared. I want you to stop this nonsense or we\u2019re going to have to go see the Defenders again.\u201d</p><p>Fear bleached Lexi\u2019s face of color. \u201cNo, Mom. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you do remember the lessons they taught you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what did they teach you?\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in Lexi\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cNaughty girls die screaming.\u201d</p><p>Zach reached out to take her into his arms and comfort her, but before he could, the vision shifted again, melting the image of Lexi\u2019s tearful face into a wash of color.</p><p>This time, when the vision stopped, Lexi was driving. It was winter and snow was falling hard enough that there were only slight tracks on the road ahead of her. The Honda\u2019s windshield wipers were slapping back and forth on high speed, leaving filmy streaks of ice behind.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s body slumped with fatigue and her eyes were red as if she hadn\u2019t slept in days. Or maybe she\u2019d been crying. Every few seconds, she\u2019d check her rearview mirror and grip the steering wheel tighter in her gloved hands.</p><p>A snow-topped sign indicated a rest stop ahead and Lexi took the ramp. She parked her car as close to the bathroom as she could, but didn\u2019t get out. Instead, she climbed into the backseat, unrolled a sleeping bag and slid inside, shoes and all. She zipped it up to the top and pulled a stocking cap down over her ears. Already, snow had covered the car\u2019s windows, nearly blocking out the security light over her car.</p><p>She touched a photograph of her mother with the tip of a gloved finger. \u201cGood night, Mom. Miss you.\u201d Her breath came out in a silver plume of frost. Even inside the car it was freezing.</p><p>Lexi snuggled down inside the sleeping bag as far as she could and covered her head. Even in the dim light, he could see the shiny fabric of the sleeping bag quake with her shivering.</p> <p>Zach ached to go to her, warm her. But he couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t really there\u2014this was all in her past\u2014and there was nothing he could do but observe and squirm in frustration.</p><p>How many nights had she slept in her car? How many nights had it been colder than this one? Even without the threat of Synestryn, she was still putting herself in danger sleeping at a rest stop. Any lunatic could have broken through the window and stolen her away, or killed her outright.</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d survived despite the odds only made her that much more of a miracle. His miracle.</p><p>Finally, the vision faded, and even though only a brief few seconds had gone by, those seconds had changed Zach. They\u2019d given him a small part of Lexi and that somehow made him feel more whole.</p><p>As reality returned, placing him back inside the dusty cabin, Zach was finally able to touch her. He reached for her, realized he still held his sword and let it drop. He wiped the blood from his cut\u2014which was already closing\u2014on his shirt and moved onto the bed next to her.</p><p>Lexi stared out with unseeing eyes, witnessing whatever it was the luceria wanted her to see. He hoped that whatever she saw was something good\u2014some brave, noble deed he\u2019d done along the way. He didn\u2019t want her to see how much he\u2019d suffered through his life. She deserved to only see the good parts, and not to be burdened by sympathy for him.</p><p>Lexi made a pained noise and swayed. Zach pulled her against him to steady her, reveling in the feeling of her so solid and warm in his arms. So alive and safe. She leaned her cheek against his shoulder and he could feel the rush of air from her lungs sweeping across his skin.</p><p>She was his. Even as his pulse steadied, the pain that had been with him for so long started to fade. In its place he felt a sense of contentment and purpose. Utter rightness.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She gave a shaky nod. \u201cI hope so. That was. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle. You and Drake and a hundred other men fighting back monsters. Century after century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynestryn,\u201d he said, giving her the name for their enemy.</p><p>Her breathing had evened out, but her color was still not right. She was pale and trembling, but even so, she was strong enough to push him down so she could straddle his stomach and look into his eyes.</p><p>Lexi cupped his face in her hands and the feel of her slender fingers on his skin rekindled some of that lust he thought the vision had quenched. Her expression was serious and her dark eyes slid over his features, studying them.</p><p>Was she already thinking about leaving? Storing up memories of him like she had photos of her mother?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep fighting? Keep living when all there is left is more battle and bloodshed?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand why she had all these questions, but he gave her the answers she needed\u2014the truth. \u201cBecause we promised we would. Because there\u2019s no one else who can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not who I thought you were,\u201d she told him in a quiet voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not the villain my mother thought, either.\u201d</p><p>Relief swept through him like a cool breeze. \u201cSo you believe me now?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and he knew his relief had come too soon. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if this is a trick? Part of the brainwashing process?\u201d</p><p>Zach was torn between being insulted by her lack of trust and wanting to comfort her and drive away all the doubt that caused her fear. It had to be difficult for her to be so close to him when she was unsure of whether or not he was trying to turn her into some kind of mind-controlled zombie, or whatever other ridiculous ideas she had in that head of hers.</p><p>\u201cHow do I prove to you it\u2019s not? I mean, nothing I can say will convince you because you\u2019ll think it\u2019s all part of my diabolical plan to turn you into my brainwashed slave, right?\u201d</p><p>She had the courtesy to blush, hearing her ideas laid out in such ridiculous terms.</p><p>\u201cAll I know to do is show you how to use my power. Maybe once you realize what it is you can do now, you\u2019ll realize that no sane person would ever allow a slave the kind of magic you now possess.\u201d</p><p>Lexi got off the bed and took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for anything else right now. This is already too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just too bad. I\u2019m not going to let you leave here believing I mean to harm you in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me do anything.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the bed and then grabbed her by the waist. She felt good under his hands, soft and slender. Her waist cradled his hands and he had to stop himself from holding her too tight. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Her pointed chin shot up as she glared at him. \u201cSo this was all just a way to get me to do what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a way for me to get you to do what you want. It\u2019s a way for me to teach you how to protect yourself just in case you decide to run away from me again. Not that I\u2019d let you get far, but you\u2019re too precious to risk, even for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if what I want is to get away from you?\u201d</p><p>Zach felt a smile of victory curve his mouth and tightened his hold on her body. \u201cTry it. Go ahead. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was pretty sure she was being served a heaping helping of bullshit. She wanted to believe he\u2019d given her some kind of magical power, but that was the problem. She wanted to believe. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I know you won\u2019t believe anything I say until you see it for yourself. That\u2019s why I want you to do this\u2014so you\u2019ll have proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you feel the luceria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm. Humming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he urged. \u201cYou can feel it better if you close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>After a stubborn moment, Lexi did.</p><p>\u201cThe luceria connects you to me, to my power. You remember all those little sparks that kept jumping from me when we touched?\u201d</p><p>Boy, did she. Lexi grudgingly nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that, only more. Stronger.\u201d</p><p>Lexi could sense something there, but she couldn\u2019t quite reach it. There was some ethereal warmth pressing at her mind, but there was nothing to grab onto, nothing solid or real.</p><p>Whatever it was, she ached to possess it, like it belonged to her somehow\u2014a favorite toy taken away before she\u2019d really had the chance to play with it.</p><p>She tried harder, reaching out until her hands shook. In fact, all of her was shaking pretty bad.</p><p>Lexi pulled back before she no longer could, before this thing\u2014whatever it was\u2014pulled her in and never let go. Instantly, all that glowing warmth vanished, disappearing out of reach, leaving her reeling.</p><p>Her entire world had been turned upside down in the space of a few brief minutes and she was still spinning, looking for something to grasp onto to steady herself.</p><p>Apparently, that thing was Zach. She couldn\u2019t stop touching him. The solid mass of his body seemed to be the only real thing she could find right now and she held on to him like a lifeline.</p><p>His skin was smooth and firm under her fingers. The mass of power she had nearly touched gave her a rush that was only now beginning to fade. It left behind a vibrating core of energy that warmed her from the inside out. The luceria around her neck pulsed with more of that heady power, but Lexi didn\u2019t dare reach for it. She didn\u2019t want to find out that something so beautiful was a lie.</p><p>Her fingers slid up Zach\u2019s spine to the nape of his neck. He let out a deep purr of enjoyment and that sound shook her all the way to her Nikes.</p><p>She could make him feel good, which was another type of power rush entirely. Lexi\u2019d had a few lovers in the past, but they never lasted long because she was never in one place for more than a few brief weeks. And not one of those men had ever wanted to pack up their lives and hit the road just to be with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that she blamed them. Life on the road was no fun, and Lexi wasn\u2019t going to dump that kind of hassle on anyone.</p><p>But with Zach, she didn\u2019t have to. Either he was telling the truth and she\u2019d finally found a way to fight back against the things that wanted to hurt her so she no longer had to keep running, or he was lying and she was already trapped\u2014too late for running.</p><p>Lexi knew which of those options she hoped was true, but she also knew better than to get those hopes up too high.</p><p>Her throat tightened around a lump of longing. She so wanted to believe Zach was the kind of man she\u2019d seen in the visions the luceria gave her. That man was kind and selfless and dedicated. That man played with children and taught them how to fight so they could defend themselves. That man took those children in, providing for them, and making sure they\u2019d never have to use the deadly skills he taught them.</p> <p>And the women in his life had been the luckiest people on the face of this planet. Lexi had watched as he\u2019d made love to them. She saw the way he had taken care to give them pleasure, rather than merely taking his own. She\u2019d seen how he\u2019d been gentle and sweet with each of them, ensuring their safety even after he\u2019d left their beds.</p><p>Lexi had spent a lot of her life wishing she had the things others took for granted\u2014a home, a family, a normal life, a sense of security\u2014but never before had she felt the same kind of feral jealousy she\u2019d experienced while watching Zach love the countless women that had drifted in and out of his life over the centuries.</p><p>She tried to tell herself that she didn\u2019t really want him, that it was just part of the whole brainwashing scheme, but she knew it was a lie. There was something deep inside her that rose up and shouted that he belonged to her, not those other women.</p><p>As her hands roamed over his beautiful back, drawing more sexy sounds from his thick chest, Lexi knew the truth. Enemy or not, she was going to find a way to have what all of those other women had had. For once, she was going to be reckless and take what she wanted from life, despite the danger.</p><p>Zach was hers and she was going to have him.</p> <p>Lexi leaned down and pressed a soft kiss against his shoulder. His body clenched and his muscles stood out in hard ridges.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he warned her. \u201cKissing me is a good way to get more than you\u2019re asking for.\u201d</p><p>Lexi ignored the warning, shoved him down onto the bed, straddled him, and kissed him again. This time, she moved to the side of his neck and slid the tip of her tongue over his salty skin.</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d meant it to be a question, but she knew the answer. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her. His green eyes gave off a primal glow of desire as they glided over her body, hovering over her throat and breasts long enough to make her squirm. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes tight as if to block her out and said, \u201cBe really clear, honey. I\u2019ve got all kinds of delusions of grandeur going on here.\u201d</p><p>Lexi had never been shy about sex, and she wasn\u2019t about to start now. Not when she had so much to lose.</p><p>She stretched out beside him on the bed so her face was level with his. She grabbed the back of his neck and held him still while she closed the distance between them. The need to kiss him made her shake, but she held herself in check for just a moment longer, giving him the words he wanted. \u201cI want you naked. I want you hard. I want you inside me. Clear enough?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and gave her a look so hot and full of potent male lust she broke out into a sweat. \u201cOh yeah. Crystal clear,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt his muscles bunch and harden around her body, and the next thing she knew, she was beneath him, staring up at his full, tempting mouth. She still had a firm hold on his neck, and she tugged him down to her. His lips were gentle against hers and so eager she knew she wasn\u2019t alone in the craziness of her want for him. He wanted her, too. She could feel that want hard and thick against her mound, rocking in a slow, steady motion that made her body go liquid and pliant.</p><p>His tongue feathered against her upper lip, seeking entrance and Lexi let him in. The taste of him in her mouth drove her crazy. The slick glide of his tongue across the delicate skin just inside her lips made her want more. She could smell the spice of his skin and a subtler, earthier scent of aroused male swirling in the air around them. Her body was empty, aching and on fire. Her skin seemed to stretch, but was too small to contain all the need writhing inside her. She wasn\u2019t even sure what it was she needed, only that Zach was the one person who could give it to her.</p><p>A fine sweat covered her body, but did nothing to cool her down. Zach\u2019s mouth ate at hers, drinking in all the frantic noises she couldn\u2019t stop herself from making. Her hands clutched at his hard back, trying to pull him closer when there was no room left between them.</p> <p>Zach slid his hand down her side and back up, easing his way beneath her shirt so his warm hands caressed bare skin. Lexi squirmed, trying to tell him she wanted more. She wanted to feel his hand cup her breast, his palm graze her nipple. Maybe that would ease the gnawing ache inside her.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t give her what she wanted. He just petted her as if soaking up the feel of her skin, in no hurry at all to move things faster.</p><p>Lexi was going to have to do it herself.</p><p>Her hands moved down his back, stroking hot, taut skin as she went. His jeans were snug, but not so tight she couldn\u2019t slide one hand down below the waistband, under the stretchy cotton of his boxers. The feel of his smooth, firm ass under her palm made her blood heat and pool hot and low in her belly.</p><p>Zach sucked in a startled breath and his hips ground against her in a single smooth circle. The pressure of the movement rubbed the seam of her jeans against her clitoris and sent a zing of sensation sizzling through her. Lexi let out a soft, desperate cry for more, but instead of giving her what she wanted, his body went still above hers.</p><p>She opened her legs, making room for his big body between her thighs. He fit against her perfectly, hovering over her, holding the rest of the world at bay. Nothing existed but the feel of his weight on top of her, the warmth of his breath as she sucked it into her own lungs, the stroke of his hand across her ribs and the taste of him on her tongue.</p><p>He surrounded her, and still it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Lexi pressed hot kisses over his jaw and down the side of his corded neck. He growled, giving off a harsh, animal sound of pleasure and his weight shifted. A moment later, his long fingers slid up between her breasts and over her collarbone, his arm tugging at her shirt as he went. He stroked the luceria around her throat and sharp, hot spikes of energy raced through her.</p><p>\u201cOpen up for me,\u201d he murmured against her hair.</p><p>She had no idea what he wanted. Her legs were already spread as wide as they could go. In fact she was rubbing herself up against him, trying in vain to find that one sweet spot he\u2019d hit earlier.</p><p>Another jolt of power spiked through her, making her gasp. The heat of it rolled along her skin, searing her until she was sure she would combust. It was almost painful, but not quite, and way too intense to be called pleasure.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey,\u201d he whispered in a coaxing voice. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta get my pants off,\u201d she told him. She was breathless, almost incoherent.</p><p>\u201cWe will. Definitely. But that\u2019s not what I mean. Let me in here.\u201d He traced his finger over one temple, across her forehead to the other temple.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t understand, but she was done trying to figure it out. Once they were both naked, it would all be fine. She was sure of it, so she went for the button on his jeans, trying to get him on the same page.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d he told her. \u201cNot yet. We\u2019re going to do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Right now. What\u2019s the difference? You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>An arrogant grin tilted his mouth. How could he smile when she was about to go up in flames? That gnawing need inside her was growing, like a hungry, living thing. If she didn\u2019t feed it soon, she was sure it would consume her.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt anything like this before. The more she got, the more she needed.</p><p>Lexi tried to pop open that button again, but Zach gathered her hands and pressed them against his hot chest. His muscles were rigid and vibrating with tension.</p><p>He closed his eyes and another jolt of energy shot through her, arcing from where his ring touched the back of her hand, up her arm, to the luceria around her throat. She heard the energy pop and sizzle in the quiet cabin; then it ripped down her spine and all she heard was her own shocked cry.</p><p>The hungry thing inside her lunged for that power, consuming it and growing as it did. It pounded at her mind, demanding entrance, but Lexi resisted, keeping the doors on herself closed and locked like Mom had taught her.</p><p>Pressure built inside her head until it became painful. She couldn\u2019t breathe right.</p><p>Something was terribly wrong.</p><p>Zach pulled away from her, and Lexi let out a frantic scream, trying to pull him back. She needed him to fix this hunger inside her. To fill her up. But he didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, honey. Easy. Slow down.\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t. Slow wasn\u2019t going to fix this need clawing inside her, the pressure that threatened to split her skin open.</p><p>A concerned frown wrinkled Zach\u2019s dark face. \u201cLexi? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she needed, just that he had it. \u201cSomething.\u201d</p><p>His wide hand smoothed her hair back from her sweaty forehead. \u201cShh. Relax. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fighting it. Don\u2019t fight it.\u201d</p><p>She was fighting not to fly apart. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the luceria trying to bond us together. Don\u2019t fight it. Just let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew how, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you. Let me slide inside your mind, just a little, okay?\u201d</p><p>Inside her mind? Like hell. She had too many secrets. She couldn\u2019t let him see them.</p><p>It took her a second to realize that was what he\u2019d been talking about all along, telling her to let him in. He had been the one trying to breach her mental defenses, not some imaginary beast.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. His voice was flat with disappointment and resentment. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over and covered his eyes with his forearm. Now that he wasn\u2019t touching her, some of that desperation pounding at her started to ease.</p><p>She pulled in a full breath. Another. Slowly, the tightness in her skin abated.</p><p>Lexi risked a glance at him. His beautiful chest was rising and falling with his rapid breathing. A sheen of sweat shone over his hard muscles, and the bare branches of the tree quivered and bowed as if straining to get closer to her. His whole body was tight, resonating in time with her own feral sexual need, and his erection strained against the front of his jeans.</p><p>She stared at that thick bulge a moment too long and her mouth began to water. She wanted to take back up where they left off, without all the mind games. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy would you try to poke around in my head when I was more than happy to let you inside my body?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. At least between people who trust each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to lead you on,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep and rough with unsated lust. \u201cNot as sorry as I am.\u201d</p><p>She needed to put some space between them and think. Lying here, staring at his body, was doing nothing to clear her head. His presence left no room for rational thought. He was too big. He took up too much of her attention when she was near him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a walk,\u201d said Lexi. She sat up on the edge of the bed, letting her dizzy head settle.</p><p>He moved to sit beside her and though his jaw was tight, his tone was gentle. \u201cI wish you\u2019d stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can frustrate us more?\u201d So he could see that she\u2019d been planning to kill him? \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were moving too fast, that\u2019s all. You just need some time to learn you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to ease the tightness in her throat. \u201cZach, I need to be completely honest here. There is no way I\u2019ll ever trust anyone enough to let them rummage around inside my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just not used to the idea. Give it time to grow on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean it. We could be together for a dozen centuries and I\u2019m still not going to give you that kind of power over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? You don\u2019t think that being able to see inside my brain is like the ultimate power trip? Who knows what you could do once you\u2019re up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. If you trust someone enough to let them in, you trust them not to fuck you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of trust isn\u2019t in me,\u201d said Lexi.</p> <p>Zach straightened his shoulders. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll go first. Go ahead. Take a peek inside and see whatever you like. I don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was tempted. The brief flash of images she\u2019d gotten when she donned his luceria had intrigued her. She itched to see more, but it wasn\u2019t fair. She couldn\u2019t violate him like that.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>His hand covered hers and a flood of comforting warmth streamed up her arm. \u201cYou just need more time. I have to find the patience to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think time was the solution to all this, but she kept her mouth shut. Maybe after she had some space to be alone and think, she\u2019d figure out how to handle Zach\u2019s bizarre expectations. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to all of this . . . stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to Helen about it. She\u2019s been through all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen is a lot more trusting than I am.\u201d</p><p>Zach sighed. \u201cMaybe. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure this out, honey. We\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi gritted her teeth against the tears that stung her eyes. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Total confidence radiated out from him. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen any other way.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could believe him, but she knew better. Even if her fantasy was true, and Zach was everything he claimed to be, she\u2019d already betrayed him. She\u2019d planned to kill him and his people, and after seeing how he\u2019d slaughtered the creatures who had tried to do that very thing, she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to forgive her. Sure, maybe he\u2019d overlook it so he could keep on living, but that wasn\u2019t the kind of life Lexi wanted. She wanted a home. A place where she belonged. Not a place that tolerated her existence because Zach needed her to live.</p><p>Of course, what she wanted had never really mattered in the greater scheme of her life.</p><p>Lexi went to the door and lifted the heavy bar. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later,\u201d she told him. She didn\u2019t dare turn around for fear of seeing the look of disappointment on his face. That wasn\u2019t something she could handle right now. Not on top of everything else.</p><p>Lexi shut the door behind her and felt a wave of desperate longing rush through her. She was ten yards away before she realized that what she felt hadn\u2019t come from her. It had come from Zach. She\u2019d felt what he was feeling.</p><p>She pulled to a stop and slid her thumb under the slippery weight of the luceria. It was warm from her body\u2014maybe even warmer than that. Frenetic vibrations of energy pulsed around it, as if begging to be used.</p><p>Lexi was convinced she\u2019d made a terrible mistake putting the thing on, but it was too late now. She held Zach\u2019s life squarely in her hands, and she wasn\u2019t going to let him down.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t the trusting sort, and maybe she\u2019d never let him wade through her thoughts and invade her privacy, but she wasn\u2019t completely useless.</p><p>There was power inside the band around her neck, and she was damn well going to learn how to use it.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Zach kept an eye on Lexi, holding back far enough that he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d see him. He wanted to give her some space, but not so much she was in danger.</p><p>The sun hadn\u2019t yet set, so she was safe, but Zach wasn\u2019t taking any chances. He wasn\u2019t going to risk her leaving him again.</p><p>Now that she wore his luceria, his soul had stopped dying. He could sense that the decay of his lifemark had ceased, and although the pressure of the power housed inside him was still great, it was no longer painful. Lexi had saved him.</p><p>Zach wished like hell it was enough\u2014that he didn\u2019t have to ask her for more. But he did. He needed all of her, not just the part she wanted to give. Not just her body, but her trust.</p><p>Maybe it would take years, but Zach vowed he would find a way to show her he was worthy of such a precious gift.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing skulking around in the trees?\u201d asked Drake from behind him.</p><p>Zach pretended he hadn\u2019t been startled, and turned around to look at his friend. \u201cI\u2019m not skulking. I\u2019m keeping an eye on Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s eyes slid down to Zach\u2019s throat, then grew wide. A grin split his face and his eyes closed for a moment in relief. \u201cShe did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zach simply.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, man. That\u2019s fantastic news. Helen is going to be beside herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to hold off on telling her. I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019s going to last.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cHow long did she give you?\u201d</p><p>Zach shrugged, feeling stiff and edgy. He looked back toward Lexi, watching her as she trailed her hand along the stone wall surrounding Dabyr. \u201cUntil she gets sick of me. Until I drive her away.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s voice had an edge of steel in it when he spoke. \u201cWe won\u2019t let her leave. She\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Zach moved through the trees, keeping pace with Lexi\u2019s progress. Drake was a shadow at his side.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to forge any kind of mental connection with me,\u201d said Zach. He wasn\u2019t sure why he shared that information, but it was too late now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean she\u2019s blocking me. Keeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Gilda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019d really rather not go spreading our problems around. Especially if it turns out some of the other men are compatible with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Big secret. Got it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked their way and both men went still, hiding their position. After a few seconds, she went back to her walk, ignoring them.</p><p>Drake picked up a discarded soda can that had found its way into the woods. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cher resistance might have something to do with what Helen told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that Lexi came here planning to help Helen escape.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s heart squeezed hard and the bitter taste of betrayal filled his mouth. \u201cNo wonder Lexi let me find her. She wanted me to bring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, man.\u201d</p><p>Zach watched her slow to a halt, then press her hand against her chest. She leaned forward, and suddenly he realized she was feeling him right now\u2014feeling what he was suffering.</p><p>Part of him wanted to go to her and comfort her, but another part of him wanted to shout at her that she was getting exactly what she deserved. How dare she trick him like this? How dare she plot behind his back to steal his brother\u2019s wife away?</p><p>Zach clamped down hard on the scrawny connection that flowed between them. It was all one-sided anyway. What was the point in keeping it open?</p><p>\u201cShe was using me.\u201d Saying the words aloud made his fists harden into lethal balls. He wanted to strike out and pound on something until he drove away the pain and humiliation her treachery had caused.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but look where it\u2019s gotten you. She\u2019s wearing your luceria. You have a chance to make this thing work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without her cooperation,\u201d said Zach. His words came out like hard, cold chips of ice.</p><p>\u201cThen get her to cooperate. Find a way inside her defenses. Trick her if you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure as hell didn\u2019t have any problems tricking me.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s hand closed around Zach\u2019s arm. He hadn\u2019t realized until then, that he had started toward her in anger. \u201cEasy, Zach. You need to stop and think before you act. Put yourself in her shoes, and if you can\u2019t do that, then go spend some quality time with the heavy bag before you go to her.\u201d</p><p>Zach swallowed down some of his rage and gave a tight nod. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi\u2019s worse, because not only doesn\u2019t she understand it\u2014she has all these wrong ideas her mom put in her head. She actually believed the Synestryn were our pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get her to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly won\u2019t if you go after her with that lethal look on your face. You need a plan.\u201d</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t sure anything as rational as planning was going to work for him right now. All he wanted to do was vent his anger, throw his weight around, and force Lexi to be what he needed her to be.</p><p>\u201cAre there any cracks in her defenses?\u201d asked Drake. \u201cAnything you could show her or give her that would help gain her trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do that since I found her. Nothing has worked.\u201d Zach strained his memory, trying to figure out where Lexi\u2019s buttons were. There was the sexual chemistry between them, of course, but Zach wasn\u2019t completely sure that was the way to go. What if they slept together and she regretted it? It could be a huge step backward.</p><p>The only time he\u2019d seen any real emotion coming from her was over her car.</p><p>Her home.</p><p>That was it. Zach knew what he needed to do. \u201cDo you have a couple of hours you can give me to work on something?\u201d</p><p>Drake gave him a puzzled frown. \u201cSure. Helen\u2019s taking a nap, getting rested for some more work on the wall tonight. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour more men, some heavy lifting, and a lot of luck.\u201d</p><p>Connal covered his body from the remaining rays of sunset with a heavy cloak and carried Zillah\u2019s box into the woods behind Dabyr. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Through the trees, he could see the new woman walking along the wall, trailing her fingers over the stone. He hadn\u2019t yet met her, which was a small blessing. It was easier unleashing Zillah\u2019s beast upon a woman he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Whatever was in there had been pawing and hissing, scratching at the wooden box nonstop. It never slept, never rested. That alone was enough to alarm Connal, but even worse was the fact that a few moments ago, one of the creature\u2019s black claws had finally made it through the wooden cage.</p><p>Connal could feel it watching him. He could feel the compulsion Zillah had somehow infused the woman\u2019s blood with, forcing him to obey. He couldn\u2019t fight it any longer. He had to let the creature out.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Connal wished any of the Theronai harm\u2014he simply could no longer take the torture of constant hunger. Zillah fed him. The Theronai refused. To Connal, that aligned his loyalties more clearly than honor ever could.</p> <p>And now the Theronai were going to pay the price for their stinginess. Whatever was in the box would hunt the few women here down and incapacitate them. All he had to do was follow behind and drink his fill before taking their bodies to Zillah.</p><p>Lexi made her way all the way around the giant wall until she was back to the place where she\u2019d started. The gaping hole in the stone was ten feet wide and she could see the subtle difference in the construction\u2014the variation in the gaps between the rocks\u2014where another ten feet of rock wall had been repaired.</p><p>Whatever had broken through here had packed one hell of a wallop.</p><p>And yet this place still stood.</p><p>A ridiculous smile tugged at her mouth. If the kind of power that could do this much damage didn\u2019t bring this place down, the few bricks of C-4 in her trunk weren\u2019t going to even make a dent.</p> <p>Not that she\u2019d ever use them. Not now that she\u2019d seen all the human men, women and children here. There was no way she could blow this place up, even if she did think it was the right thing to do. Which she didn\u2019t. Not anymore. Dabyr was a place of safety and refuge. It was a home to hundreds of people. No way could she screw that up. A home was a sacred place. She could no more destroy that than she would spray paint over the Mona Lisa.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand ran over the rough stones where the repair had been done. She could sense a low vibration seeping out of the rock. It felt warm and clean, like sunlight in the middle of winter, and there was something else there\u2014something powerful and elusive she could almost touch.</p><p>She closed her eyes and pressed both hands against the repaired section of wall. Fatigue. Weariness. The wall was tired.</p><p>Lexi pulled away, feeling her heart pounding against her ribs. How the hell could she feel that? And how the hell could a wall be tired? It made no sense.</p><p>Then again, not much of anything had made a lot of sense in this place. Especially Zach. He didn\u2019t want to have sex, but he wanted to read her mind? What kind of fucked-up logic was that?</p><p>She\u2019d been asking herself that for hours and still had no answers. All she had was the beginnings of a headache and a rumbling tummy. She needed dinner.</p> <p>Lexi turned to go back inside where she\u2019d seen the dining room, and for the first time noticed she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Several large men stood guard around the opening in the wall. They hadn\u2019t been there before, but the sun was starting to set, and she\u2019d bet money they were here to keep the monsters out.</p><p>One of them turned toward her, and she saw his shimmering luceria glisten around his thick neck. He had dark blue eyes and a tall, lean build. His face was narrow, but handsome, and he had a way of moving that was almost hypnotic.</p><p>When he saw her, he stepped toward her, making Lexi\u2019s body go tense. She didn\u2019t want another repeat of what had happened in the exercise area when all those men had closed in on her, making her choke on her panic. She was weaponless, and Zach was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The man must have seen her anxiety, because he stopped in his tracks and held up his long hands. His voice was as soft as the fading daylight. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to frighten you, my lady. I only wanted to give you my vow.\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know what he meant, but it was one of those things that she was probably better off not knowing. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cYou prefer to wait for the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not really into ceremonies much, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a good time without me.\u201d</p> <p>A half smile lifted one side of his mouth. \u201cThe ceremony is for you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Why did he keep calling her \u201clady\u201d? He must have been old like Zach, and not quite up on the way modern people talked. \u201cNo need to make a fuss.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer without looking like he\u2019d moved. His body just kind of slid over the ground.</p><p>The other men were watching now, and they, too, came closer, their intense expressions and looming body language showing way too much interest in her for her peace of mind.</p><p>A ripple of unease fluttered down her spine. \u201cI need to get going. Catch you all later.\u201d</p><p>She backed away until she was well out of reach, then walked as fast as she could without looking like she was running away. She ducked into the trees and peeked over her shoulder to make sure none of them were following her.</p><p>She walked about thirty yards into the woods, back where the cabins stood nestled in the trees, isolated from the rest of the grounds.</p><p>The wind shifted, and suddenly Lexi felt like she was being watched. The past several weeks of outrunning Zach had taught her that feeling well. But this was different. It was more . . . malevolent, as if whatever watched her hated her.</p><p>She\u2019d never experienced anything quite like it before, and it left her feeling edgy and nervous. Especially now that the sun had set and darkness came swiftly within the thick growth of trees.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder, peering through the trees, searching the deepening shadows for whoever might be there. She saw no one. Not even movement beyond the occasional swaying of leaves in the breeze.</p><p>As much as she wanted to tell herself she was being foolish, Lexi had learned to listen to those instincts. Someone or something was out there, and it was watching her. It was time to go back inside.</p><p>Lexi turned to go back to the main building when something streaked from the trees and lunged at her.</p><p>Instincts honed by years of dodging spilled food and avoiding near collisions with other waitresses allowed her to dodge the black streak.</p><p>She hit the ground hard, but a deep sense of panic exploded inside her, numbing her body and making her fast. She scrambled to her knees just as it scurried into the undergrowth.</p><p>A low growl vibrated the leaves, way too deep to have come from something about the size of a house cat. That feeling of being watched intensified until she was shaking with its malevolence.</p><p>That thing\u2014whatever it was\u2014wanted to kill her.</p><p>Lexi pushed herself up to her feet and backed away as fast as she could without stumbling. She didn\u2019t want to turn her back on it for a second. It was way too fast for her to outrun.</p><p>Right now, she would have given anything for Zach to be here with that lethal sword in hand, standing between her and the monster.</p><p>From somewhere far off, she heard a bellow of outrage. It resonated in her mind, strong and defiant.</p><p>A black streak of movement shot out from the thing\u2019s hiding place, right toward her face. Lexi flattened herself to the ground, but felt a tug on her sleeve. She looked down and saw the scalpel-precise cut in her shirt.</p><p>If it had hit her skin . . .</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t going to wait to see what would happen then. She grabbed a stick lying on the ground and pushed to her feet.</p><p>This time, she didn\u2019t waste time watching her back. She just ran.</p><p>A whistling hiss of air warned her a millisecond before the next attack came. She dove to the left, landing hard on her shoulder. The stick jerked back and hit her head, shocking her for a split second.</p><p>An angry growl sounded nearby. Too close. Her poor landing had jarred her, making it hard for her to tell where the thing had gone.</p><p>Before she could make it all the way to her feet, the streak flew at her again. Instincts lifted the stick into its path and the wood cracked in half, sending the top part of her weapon flying.</p><p>Now all she had was a stubby foot of wood, and if that thing got close enough for her to hit it, she was in serious trouble.</p><p>Lexi hadn\u2019t even gotten to her hands and knees before the monster rushed her again, whistling toward her. She held up her feeble weapon, cringing against the blow she knew she couldn\u2019t evade.</p><p>The singing sound of metal on metal filled her ears, and before she could open her eyes to see what it was, Zach had jumped between her and the monster.</p><p>His sword was bare; his stance was violent in its intent.</p><p>Lexi hurried to stand, staying close to Zach. She didn\u2019t even bother to brush the dirt and grass from her clothes.</p><p>\u201cDid you see where it went?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That single word was full of rage. His body vibrated with tension.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead. As soon as I see it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi scanned the surrounding area, trying to see through the building darkness enough to locate the thing.</p><p>That eerie growling hiss rose up from behind her. Lexi whirled around. Zach shoved her back behind his body with one hand.</p><p>A flurry of movement exploded from the underbrush, shooting bits of leaves out with the thing as it shot toward them.</p><p>Zach\u2019s blade sliced through the air and a scream of pain split her ears, too high and metallic to be human. A wet thump hit the ground to her right.</p><p>The creature had been sliced in two, and each half had already begun to dissolve into a pile of writhing black maggots. They wriggled, burrowing into the earth.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s stomach heaved.</p><p>The heavy pounding of boots echoed nearby, growing louder. Lexi couldn\u2019t look away from the ugly sight. Whatever it was, it had wanted to kill her. If Zach hadn\u2019t shown up . . .</p><p>\u201cFinish it off, Andra,\u201d ordered Zach in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cCover your ears,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Lexi was still too shocked to move, but strong, warm hands cupped over her ears, protecting them from the boom of Andra\u2019s magic.</p><p>Dirt and squishy black bits flew up, splashing against the inside of an invisible bubble. That bubble full of ick rose up, leaving a perfect semicircular crater in the ground.</p><p>Lexi watched as Andra somehow moved all that weight over the wall several hundred yards before letting it fall.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, dusting off her hands. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stick around, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Andra,\u201d said Zach, a little too loudly, as if the boom had messed up his hearing.</p><p>Lexi turned toward him, letting relief flood her. She clutched his shirt, burying her nose against his chest. He smelled of spice and warmth and safety. She breathed him in, letting his comforting scent calm her scattered nerves.</p><p>His wide hands slid around her body, moving up and down her back in a comforting rhythm.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. His mouth moved against her hair. His warm breath soaked into her scalp, easing away the last remnants of fear left skittering inside her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she responded. Because he\u2019d saved her. \u201cAre you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was tense, rigid. \u201cI should never have left you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ruin all this goodwill I\u2019m feeling toward you by turning caveman on me.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tighter. Voices faded as the men left to scour the grounds for more monsters.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t want to have any part of that hunt. She was still shaking and needed to relax. \u201cCan we go inside now? I\u2019m feeling a little vulnerable out here in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything you want, honey.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away enough that he could look down at her. His pale green eyes were lit with concern, giving her a much needed distraction. He was such a beautiful man with such a beautiful mouth. The muscles under her palms called out to her, making her want to touch his body until she knew it better than her own. She wanted to soak him up, absorbing all that strength and confidence.</p><p>He said something, but she didn\u2019t hear the words. She was too busy fighting the urge to kiss him and take back up where they left off in that cabin. Everything about him called to her on a deeply feminine level. If she ever did get those jeans of his off, she knew they would be good together, totally explosive.</p><p>A warm grin curved his mouth and Lexi reached up to run her finger over his bottom lip. He took her hand and pressed a soft, hot kiss into her palm. \u201cWhen you look at me like that, I don\u2019t care whether or not you\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to what?\u201d she asked, hearing the dazed drone in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cI said I have a surprise for you. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>Against her will, her eyes slid down his body to his crotch.</p><p>Zach let out a bark of laughter, and lifted her chin with his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, woman. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through hers and led her on a winding path through the trees. They came out into a clearing, and from here, she could see the back wall of the main building and a bustle of activity in the exercise area.</p><p>She tensed up and Zach squeezed her hand. \u201cNo one here is going to hurt you. They\u2019re just all anxious to meet the new girl, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and forced it out. She wasn\u2019t used to being around so many people, especially not ones as massive and powerful as the shirtless men pumping iron only a few yards away.</p> <p>Zach led her through the group without mishap, but she could feel the intense stares of too many eyes on her. She felt like prey when they watched her like that, and she couldn\u2019t help but suffer through a little spurt of fear that urged her to run and hide. She\u2019d been doing that all her life, and standing her ground now was harder than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>Strong, comforting fingers slid up and down her forearm. Zach\u2019s low, soothing voice slid into her ear. \u201cJust a little farther.\u201d</p><p>Even once they were through the glass doors, she was sure they were still watching her. She didn\u2019t need to look back to check.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She had been before the attack, but not as much now. Her stomach had tightened up, making hunger flee. \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and let them watch me eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking something a little more private. Dinner for two.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. Anything to get away from all those eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s part of your surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Zach led her into a hallway, and the noise of the people in the dining area faded behind them. Lexi pulled in a breath, then another. Finally, she was able to fill her lungs and exhale some of the tension inside her.</p><p>She focused on the doors sliding by them, counting them as she went. She probably should have been paying more attention to the twists and turns along the way, but her nerves were too raw for anything so complicated.</p><p>Zach pulled her to a stop outside of a doorway and pointed to his right. \u201cHelen and Drake\u2019s suite is two doors down. I thought you might want to be near her.\u201d He took her hand and put a plastic card key in her palm. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked at the key. There were no markings on it, just white plastic with a wide magnetic strip running along one side.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he told her, grinning. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi slid the key in, and the light switched from red to green. She pushed the door open and stepped inside.</p><p>The first thing that hit her was the smell of freshly baked bread. She sucked the scent into her lungs, groaning as her hunger came back in full force.</p><p>Zach was right behind her, so close she could feel the heat of his body. She handed him his key and went to find that bread. Before she could move away, he grabbed her wrist and put the key back into her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s yours, Lexi. This whole suite is yours.\u201d</p><p>Lexi blinked up at him, waiting for the too-good-to-be-true daydream to fade. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your new home.\u201d Zach curled her limp fingers around the card and gave her a smile so sweet she found herself tearing up.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d She repeated the word, trying to wrap her mind around the concept. She\u2019d never had a home without wheels before.</p><p>His arm swept out, motioning to what lay behind her. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Numb from shock, and with a layer of thick suspicion to protect her, Lexi turned around. She took three steps down the short entry hall until she could see the whole place. The living area was huge, with high ceilings and towering windows overlooking a swath of trees lining the lake\u2019s glistening edge. The walls were painted a soothing green that blended perfectly with the comfortable-looking leather furniture. A giant TV hung on the wall and empty shelves stood by, waiting to be filled with books and trinkets.</p><p>None of which Lexi owned.</p><p>A miniature kitchen was tucked into one corner, already stocked with a coffeepot and a table for two. Candles burned between two covered plates of food, and a deep, red wine glowed inside delicate crystal glasses.</p><p>On weak legs, she moved forward to where the bedrooms were. Two of them. Each with a private bathroom and closets big enough for her to park her car inside.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIn case you want to invite a guest to stay,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cOr you could use it for an office or computer room or something. Whatever you like. It\u2019s yours to do with as you please.\u201d</p><p>Hers. She still couldn\u2019t grasp the concept.</p><p>The bedrooms were both completely furnished with king-sized beds, piled high with thick down comforters and mounds of superfluous pillows, glowing in silken fabrics she had no names for. One was decorated in a rich, deep blue and the other was done in pale, buttery yellow.</p><p>They were both more beautiful and luxurious than anything she\u2019d ever seen in real life.</p><p>\u201cYou can pick whichever one you like, or you can sleep in them both. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi rushed inside, scoping out the bathrooms. One of them had a giant tub big enough for two, and the other boasted a large walk-in shower with body jets and enough nozzles to make her feel like she was in a car wash.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She couldn\u2019t form words. She couldn\u2019t even think straight.</p><p>She stood there, in the yellow bedroom, shaking. Zach came to her, a warm smile on his face. He took her shoulders into his hands and asked, \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Lexi opened her mouth, realized she was beyond speech, and shut it again.</p><p>His thick thumb wiped tears from under her eyes. She hadn\u2019t realized she was crying until now, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop the flow.</p><p>She swallowed and pulled in air. She knew how to speak; she just had to gather the strength to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . amazing.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s grin widened.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><p>His smile faltered and he pulled her a little closer to his warmth. Her thighs brushed his and his hands were gentle against her face. \u201cWhy not, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much, Zach. Way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a suite,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>No. It was so much more than that. It was a home\u2014a place of refuge, of hopes and dreams. It was a mythical concept that, until now, Lexi had never even dared hope to obtain. And Zach was just handing it to her.</p><p>The urge to accept his gift was nearly overwhelming. This was the one thing she wanted more than anything else. Walking away from it was going to rip her apart. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? Everyone here is given their own home. Why shouldn\u2019t you have one, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need money. We need you. I need you. Believe me, you\u2019ll earn your keep and then some once I teach you how to use your magic. Just ask Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen doesn\u2019t have her own place. She lives with Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wants to, not because she has to. Besides, we have all these vacant suites just sitting around. You don\u2019t want them to go to waste, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting around? Fully furnished and decorated?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>Zach gave her a sheepish look. \u201cWell, no. We took the best stuff from several different suites and put it here for you, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is that, as much as I wish I could accept your generous gift, I can\u2019t. We don\u2019t even know if this thing between us is going to work out.\u201d</p><p>His jaw bunched with a pulse of anger, but then disappeared as if he\u2019d forced it away. \u201cI have to believe it will, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>He needed her to survive. Deep down, Lexi knew she\u2019d never let him die. Regardless of whether or not she stayed with him, she\u2019d wear the luceria and keep him alive until it was her turn to go, or until he found another woman to take her place.</p><p>Another woman. A deep, ferocious surge of jealousy rose up inside her, striking her blind for a brief moment. She didn\u2019t want him to find another woman. As selfish as that was, she wanted to be the only one in his life\u2014the only one who could save him.</p><p>It linked them together, made him almost like family. She wouldn\u2019t give that up without a fight. But neither could she mislead him into thinking she could ever be the kind of woman he wanted. That level of trust he asked of her just wasn\u2019t part of her makeup. Lexi didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even trusted her mother enough to let her roam around in her mind.</p><p>She took Zach\u2019s rough hand in both of hers, reveling in the strength and power radiating out of his body. \u201cI want things to work out, too, but still, this is too big a gift for me to accept.\u201d</p><p>She could see a shadow cross his features and tighten his dark brow. She\u2019d hurt his feelings, but that couldn\u2019t be helped. She\u2019d lied to him for so long, she owed him as much honesty as she was capable of giving.</p><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t accept it yet, but don\u2019t turn it down, either. Just stay here for now. If you want to keep it, it\u2019s yours. If not, no pressure. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked around at the luxury and comfort this place had to offer. Living here was going to be easy. Not falling in love with this place was going to be hard.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stay, but just for now. We still have a lot of things we need to work out between us.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her face, his fingers achingly gentle as they glided over her skin, like she was made of paper-thin blown glass. \u201cI know. But we\u2019ve got time. For now, let\u2019s just share a quiet meal. You need some time to adjust, and I\u2019m starved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi needed more than just time. She needed courage. She knew she had to tell him about the Defenders and her conspiring with them to blow this place up. Eventually, he would find out, and it was going to be easier on both of them if she did the grown-up thing and spilled her guts.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d react, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. She trusted him at least that much, even if it was only because he needed her to survive.</p><p>The other men here\u2014the ones who stared at her with hungry eyes\u2014she was pretty sure they weren\u2019t going to be quite so understanding.</p><p>Zach stuffed Lexi full of food, hoping that would help relax her. She\u2019d been right about them having a lot of things to work through, and most of those were better handled on a full stomach.</p> <p>He lit some candles he\u2019d found earlier, and they cast a warm glow over Lexi\u2019s living room. Zach was no interior designer, but he thought she liked the soft, comfortable things they\u2019d put in her home. The way her eyes lit up every time she glanced past him and looked around had convinced him of that.</p><p>He\u2019d given her a home. He\u2019d made her cry, but in a good way. Now all he had to do was get her to stay here. Maybe let him move in with her. After two nights with her in his arms, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to handle an empty bed.</p><p>He\u2019d made sure that both beds in her suite were big enough to hold the two of them, just in case. He promised himself he wouldn\u2019t push, but the idea of getting her naked and making her feel good was swiftly becoming an obsession.</p><p>She slid the last bite of chocolate cake off her fork and sat back with a contented sigh.</p><p>\u201cThat was fabulous, Zach. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a cook, but I did order it from the kitchen myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed with the smile he\u2019d put there, making his chest grow warm with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI left all the important numbers on the fridge for you in case you need someone, or don\u2019t feel like eating in the dining hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not so sure about that yet. All those men staring at me is a little freaky.\u201d</p><p>Zach stood and held out his hand to her. \u201cThey\u2019ll get used to you, just like they\u2019re used to Helen now. Just give them a few days.\u201d</p><p>Lexi put her small hand in his, and it looked so perfect there, surrounded by him, protected.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the dishes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the trays in the hall later. No rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she looked from the dishes to her sink and back again\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave a mess.\u201d</p><p>In her new home. She hadn\u2019t said that part, but he could feel it in the air, hovering on her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou want to wash them?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and nodded, like a child asked if they wanted to go into the toy store.</p><p>Zach shrugged. \u201cWhatever makes you happy, honey.\u201d He had to have someone bring them some soap and dishcloths\u2014he\u2019d forgotten to stock those things for her\u2014but a little while later, they\u2019d finished the domestic chore and Lexi was beaming.</p><p>Who would have thought that something as simple as washing a sink full of dishes could make her happy? He found himself looking around, seeking out something else that might make her smile.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s dark. Do you go monster hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually. Joseph has given me a few days off to help you settle in. I\u2019ll have to check the schedule, but I think I\u2019m supposed to be on guard duty next week. We\u2019ve got extra men on the job here since the repairs on the wall still aren\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>Zach led her to the comfy leather sofa, and they sank into its pillowy depths. Lexi bounced up and down a couple times, grinning, then settled down beside him. She hadn\u2019t pulled her hand away from his. In fact, she\u2019d threaded her fingers through his, locking them together.</p><p>\u201cWill I have a job, too? If I stay, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting her leave, but he decided it was best to keep things light and not go all caveman on her. If she tried to go, then he\u2019d make things clear.</p><p>\u201cYou and I will be a team,\u201d he said. \u201cJoseph Rayd\u2014our leader\u2014will assign us our duties as soon as you\u2019re able to channel my power consistently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about that, and I want to practice some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll go out in the training yard and try some things, see what works for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire is good. Kills lots of snarlies. Helen kicks ass throwing fire around.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shook her head, making her fine hair sway. \u201cI never would have believed it if I hadn\u2019t seen it for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a lot of seeing- is-believing for you at first. I promise you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tough. I\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning to protect yourself is vital. That\u2019s my job, but I\u2019m only one man, and I want you to be extra safe, just in case. Andra\u2019s pretty good at creating shields, so she may be able to give you some pointers. She\u2019s also really good at blowing things up.\u201d</p><p>The color slid from Lexi\u2019s face and her hand started to sweat. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take a pass on that one. Just for now.\u201d</p><p>Zach made a mental note that the idea had freaked her out. It might be a sign what her specialty would be, if Helen\u2019s initial fear of fire was any indication. He\u2019d convince her to try something later, but now wasn\u2019t the time. He wanted her relaxed and comfortable so she wouldn\u2019t notice when he sneaked inside those mental walls of hers. Once he was there, once she knew he posed no threat, then they\u2019d deal with the rest.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s up to you. We won\u2019t go into the field until you\u2019re comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a playful grin. \u201cCan I fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Everyone is different. Gilda\u2014another woman here like you\u2014she can jump so far it\u2019s almost like flying, but she\u2019s been doing this for centuries, so she\u2019s had some time to work up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll save that one, too. I don\u2019t want to learn the hard way I can\u2019t fly.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers had relaxed again, and her shoulders were no longer up by her ears. Zach tugged on her hand, urging her to come closer.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes, curled her legs under her and fit her body against his. Her shoulder was under his arm and her head rested against his chest.</p><p>A sense of complete rightness filled him up, making him glow inside. He draped his arm around her, his hand resting on her luscious hip. The ring on his finger hummed happily. In fact, all of him was happy and content.</p><p>All his plans to gain her trust and crack her defenses turned to dust and blew away. They were inconsequential compared to the monumental satisfaction he felt right now.</p><p>Zach may have offered her some walls and a roof over her head, but she was the one who\u2019d given him a home. Lexi was his home. He just hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been missing it all his life.</p><p>Her slender fingers slid up his chest until they reached the bare skin of his throat. The band that had been there so long, covering his skin, was gone, making his flesh ultrasensitive to the touch. Lexi stroked him, as if knowing that was the case, and Zach\u2019s body started to heat up with a predictable dose of lust. The woman went straight to his head.</p><p>\u201cYour skin\u2019s so much lighter here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cStarved of sunlight since I was born.\u201d Zach shivered and his muscles clenched. Hot blood raced to his groin, making him so hard so fast it was painful.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my neck,\u201d he told her between clenched teeth.</p><p>She shifted so she could see his face. Her bittersweet chocolate eyes glided over him, searching for the source of his discomfort. Inevitably, she saw his erection and her lashes lowered, covering a flare of feminine greed. A sultry smile warmed her mouth, making it almost irresistible. \u201cWant me to kiss it and make it better?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A punch of raw desire hit him in the gut, making him grunt against the force of it. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to kill me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shook her head. \u201cNo. I want you, Zach. But I want you without the mind games. Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure, but he knew he\u2019d try like hell. He\u2019d do damn near anything to give her what she wanted, wanting only her in return.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust sex,\u201d she told him, licking her lips.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, it wasn\u2019t the way things were meant to be between them, but he knew he\u2019d take what he could get. Especially if it involved getting Lexi naked just for him.</p><p>Zach tried to agree, but his vocal cords were clamped tight inside his throat. He settled for action instead of words, taking her mouth in a soft kiss.</p><p>Lexi let out a groan of satisfaction and deepened the kiss, sliding her sweet tongue against his. She grabbed his head and speared her fingers through his hair, holding him while she drank her fill.</p><p>Zach tried to let her set the pace, but he couldn\u2019t keep his hands to himself. He wasn\u2019t that strong. He clasped her hips in his palms and pressed her down against his straining erection. The contact, even through all those layers of clothes, shot sparks along his spine and ripped an animal sound of lust from his throat.</p><p>All his good intentions to woo her, make her trust him, slipped through his fingers, lost and forgotten. They paled in comparison to the glowing fire of need burning up his insides.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s fingers slid down his body and tugged the hem of his T-shirt over his head, baring his chest. Breaking their kiss pissed him off, and he flung her down on the couch where he could keep her right were he wanted her.</p><p>Her lips were red and wet and puffy and her eyes glowed with anticipation. She splayed her hands over his chest and Zach felt his lifemark swaying, the bare branches arcing toward her touch.</p><p>Before he forgot himself and wound up hurting one of them, Zach unbuckled his sword belt and laid it within arm\u2019s reach. It flickered to visibility, the silver leaf pattern that adorned the hilt and scabbard glowing in the yellow light of the candles still burning in the kitchen.</p><p>He wanted to see Lexi\u2019s skin by that warm light. All of it.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt,\u201d he told her, unwilling to trust himself to do the job without ripping it from her body. His voice came out heavy and dark, almost sinister, but there was nothing he could do about that. Not now, while his need for her pounded at him.</p><p>Lexi hadn\u2019t heard him. Her eyes were closed as her hands slid over his chest. Sweat tried valiantly to cool his overheated skin but couldn\u2019t keep up with the task, not while Lexi was touching him.</p><p>The look of total absorption, total enjoyment, on her face was humbling. The idea he could please her with something as simple as his bare chest made him feel powerful, gave him more hope for their future than he\u2019d thought possible.</p><p>If he could please her, she\u2019d stay, and Zach was more than willing to put his enormous force of will to the task of giving her pleasure.</p><p>The luceria shimmered around her throat, glowing in pale, luminous plumes of jade and emerald greens. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A burst of possessiveness exploded inside of him. He wasn\u2019t going to let her go. He wasn\u2019t going to let her hide from him. He wanted every part of her. Her body, her mind, her soul. All of it. Forever.</p><p>Lexi sucked in a gasping breath and her eyes flew wide. She trembled beneath him and her fingers dug into his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked in a desperate voice.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know what she meant, and he wasn\u2019t going to waste what little rational thought he had left figuring it out. He needed that to remember how to get them both naked. Now.</p> <p>He slid his hands under her shirt, rubbing his knuckles across the satin skin of her belly. Sparks of power poured out of him, sinking into her wherever he touched. Her muscles quivered under his fingers and he felt her breathing speed, saw her nipples tighten under her clothes.</p><p>The urge to feel those stiff points against his tongue took over, and he shoved her shirt up onto her arms. He couldn\u2019t remember how to get her bra off, but he pulled the lacy bit of fabric down and what he wanted was right there, tight and eager and begging for him.</p><p>Zach cupped her soft breast in his hand and covered her with his mouth. She rose up off the couch in a powerful arc. The movement ground her thigh against his dick, and he nearly came right then. It took several sucking breaths through his nose to calm down, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to move his mouth. Her nipple was hard against his tongue and the woman taste of her skin filled him up and made him hungry for more all at the same time.</p><p>Lexi took his hair in her fists and held him tight, making sexy noises of encouragement. Her hips rocked beneath him, rubbing him just right. Too right. He didn\u2019t want to come yet and end the pleasurable torment. Hanging on the edge of insanity felt too good and he wanted her right there with him when he fell.</p><p>Somehow, he managed to open her jeans and his fingers slid down beneath her panties until he felt her slick heat. She was wet and ready for him so fast he wanted to fall to his knees in thanks. He wasn\u2019t sure he was thinking clearly enough to do this right, and he really wanted it to be right for her.</p> <p>She pulled his head up and covered his mouth in a scorching kiss. Eager, needy sounds filled his lungs and he drank them down, dying to hear more.</p><p>\u201cNeed you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Words weren\u2019t possible for him anymore.</p><p>She pulled away from him, shedding her shirt and stripping out of her bra in record time. Somehow, she got out from under him and knelt in front of him on the couch, working to shimmy out of her jeans.</p><p>Zach\u2019s world ground to a halt. The flickering of the candles\u2019 flames over her naked, flushed skin slowed to a lazy caress of heat and light. Her nipples were shiny and distended from the suckling wetness of his mouth. Her pale breasts cast loving shadows over her ribs. The gentle curve of her stomach glistened with perspiration. Slowly, so slowly he thought he\u2019d go mad, Lexi pushed her jeans and panties down, baring herself to him until she knelt there, naked and glorious, offering herself to him.</p><p>A gift he could not refuse.</p> <p>She leaned forward until her mouth was level with his chest and pressed a kiss against his lifemark. Buzzing filled his head and his tree quivered under her mouth.</p><p>Her breath swept out over his chest and she looked up at him from beneath long lashes. It was the kind of look a man dreams of seeing just once in his life\u2014full of desire and lust and enough heat to scorch his soul. Even without being able to see inside her mind, he knew without a doubt that what was happening between them was exactly what she wanted.</p><p>Her fingers went to his jeans and this time, he didn\u2019t stop her from popping the button. She wanted just sex, so that was what he\u2019d give her. Enough to make her scream with pleasure. Enough to leave her aching for more, because he was sure he was never going to get enough. If this was the only part of her she\u2019d let him have, he was going to use it to his full advantage.</p><p>He helped her rid him of his clothes and shoes, then fisted his hands at his sides while her dark eyes roamed his naked body in stark appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou are one fine-looking man, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay down.\u201d The words came out short and sharp, but at least they came out. It was more than he expected.</p><p>Lexi shook her head and scrambled away in a flurry of supple arms and legs. She said something as she left, but Zach didn\u2019t hear it. His blood was pounding in his ears, his pulse a roaring drumbeat of need.</p><p>She\u2019d left him. Again.</p> <p>Zach watched her beautiful ass sway as she walked. The leopard tattoo on her shoulder stared back at him, taunting him with its green stare. She had two of the sexiest dimples he\u2019d ever seen at the base of her spine. Somehow, that didn\u2019t make the sight of her leaving him any easier to bear. All of those nights of hopeless desperation\u2014the nights he\u2019d spent hunting for her while he suffered through horrible, painful spasms\u2014came back to him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to leave him. Not now. Not ever again.</p><p>Animal instincts\u2014the need to claim his mate\u2014took over and he pounced. He wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d gotten across the room, but he had, and Lexi was pinned under him on the carpet, her eyes wide with apprehension.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d tried to leave him again, like he was so much garbage tossed into the street. He wasn\u2019t going to let her do that to him. Not this time.</p><p>He pushed her thighs open, shoving his knee between them. His dick slid along her slick folds, throbbing and thick and hot. Her breathing sped and her fingers clenched against his chest. He had her arms pinned so she couldn\u2019t move, but that was fucking tough. She\u2019d tried to run away. She needed to know he wasn\u2019t going to let it happen.</p><p>\u201cZach.\u201d His name was a ragged plea for something he couldn\u2019t decipher.</p><p>She was so wet, so ready for him. He pushed forward, sliding into her body easily, nudging the head of his erection just inside her. She was snug and hot and the urge to shove his dick into her until he came was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>He held back, though he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut and a dark pink flush spread out over her cheeks. Hot ribbons of power flowed out of him, easing some of the pressure inside him, helping clear his head.</p><p>Her mouth was open, her warm breath filling the space between them. Her breasts were soft against his damp chest, her hard nipples stabbing up at him.</p><p>He pushed his hips forward, needing to be inside her all the way, filling her up, claiming her.</p><p>Lexi went tense and he felt her body clamp down hard on his dick.</p><p>\u201cLet me in,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She didn\u2019t relax. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her, but he couldn\u2019t stop, either. Not now that he was so close to being part of her.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know what else to do, so he covered her throat with his hand, locking the two parts of the luceria together. Power rose up in him, churning and bubbling.</p><p>He channeled that power through their link and forced it to slide right inside her.</p><p>She gasped and arched off the floor, lodging him deeper inside her tight body. Bright blue sparks of energy spilled from her skin, sinking into the soft carpet. She shook, her muscles clenched and her eyes squeezed tight.</p><p>He was hurting her.</p><p>Zach panicked and lay there frozen, pinning her body in place. He\u2019d hurt her, but he couldn\u2019t pull back, couldn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>He found enough strength to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He was sorry for hurting her. Sorry that he wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Lexi\u2019s body was not her own. It was an alien thing, needy and desperate, filled with so much sparkling energy she could hardly find the space to breathe. Zach\u2019s weight held her down, giving her nowhere to run. His thick erection was poised inside her entrance, stretching her so tight it almost hurt. She hadn\u2019t been ready for that. She hadn\u2019t been ready for the heat of those tingling ribbons of energy sinking into her from the inside, too.</p><p>Bare skin on bare skin.</p><p>And he was most definitely bare. Smooth and hard and slick inside her. The thought nagged her, gave her a flicker of worry, but she couldn\u2019t focus on it enough to figure out why. All she could do was shudder under the force of his presence, the intensity of those pale green eyes staring into her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you leave,\u201d he growled at her, his voice vibrating his heavy chest and the tips of her nipples pressed against it.</p><p>Everything had been fine right up to the point where she walked away to go into a bedroom. That was when he\u2019d flipped out and come after her like some kind of wild animal. That feral look was still there. His jaw was bunched. Sweat lined his brow. She could feel the tight cords of muscles as he strained to control himself, the strong beat of his racing heart. She wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d hold out.</p><p>The need to soothe him rose up inside her. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because she was afraid of what he\u2019d do to her, or if she was afraid of what she might let him do.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t leaving you. I just wanted to break in one of the beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeds?\u201d He said it like he didn\u2019t recognize the word.</p><p>Lexi wriggled her arms free and Zach pressed more of his weight down on top of her, giving her a warning rumble from his throat. She\u2019d never heard a man make a sound like that, and she had to fight back the sliver of fear that threatened to worm its way inside her.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t room for fear. She was already bursting at the seams with more sensation than she could handle.</p><p>She made her muscles go lax under him, telling him with her body she wasn\u2019t trying to run.</p><p>Some of the tension in his jaw eased and she realized in that moment he was acting out of fear, not anger. He was afraid she was going to run away again. And why wouldn\u2019t he be? She\u2019d done it before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she told him. She stroked his face with gentle sweeps of her fingertips over his forehead, his cheeks, his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m right where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>And it was true. There was nowhere else she wanted to be more than with this man, reveling in the pleasure he gave her with his mere presence.</p><p>She pulled his head down so she could kiss him, telling him with her lips and tongue that she surrendered. She was his.</p><p>Her body softened, relaxing around his erection, easing the way for him to push deeper inside her. He was big, and it had been a long time since she\u2019d had a man\u2014none of whom could have prepared her for this, anyway.</p><p>Zach stretched her to the limit, making nerve endings she didn\u2019t know she had zing to life. She was trembling, vibrating under the pressure of so much sensation. With slow, aching progress, he merged their bodies until there was no more room left for him to fill.</p><p>He pressed his forehead to hers, his body going still. His breath came out in hot bursts, mingling with her own. His erection moved inside her, throbbing with heat.</p><p>Lexi whimpered, shocking herself with the sound of her need ringing so clearly in her voice.</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d He uttered the single word in a gritty voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A flare of satisfaction lit his eyes; then he slid his arms around her, gathered her body against his own and started to move. The slick, gliding sensation of him leaving her body hollowed her out, making her ache. She clutched at his shoulders and arched her hips toward him as he slid back into her in one smooth stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Potent heat raced along her spine and filled her head. A noise of raw pleasure filled the space between them, but she couldn\u2019t tell who\u2019d made it. Maybe both of them. His thick arms cradled her, holding her steady as he set a slow, deep rhythm. Sparkling globes of light danced in her eyes, and when they cleared, all she saw was shimmering ribbons of power flowing into her. They connected them, joining them securely with no means of escape.</p><p>Not that she wanted any. Everything she wanted was right here, within arm\u2019s reach, and all of it was a gift from Zach.</p><p>His mouth covered her nipple, sucking it into moist heat. Arcs of pleasure leapt to her womb, making her clench around his thrusting erection.</p><p>Zach growled against her flesh, the vibration causing a new riot of pleasure to swirl deep inside her.</p> <p>The power of his body amazed her. The fluid clench and release of his muscles pushed her higher with every beat of her heart. Heat poured off of them, causing the air around them to pop and sizzle. Zach folded her knee up against her body, making room for his hand to snake between them.</p><p>The shift in position had him hitting a new, more sensitive spot. He slid his fingers through curls covering her mound until she felt his work- roughened fingertips glide along her slippery folds. With unerring accuracy, he cradled her clitoris between two thick fingers. The rocking of his body moved his hand just enough to make her insides tighten like a coiled spring. The exquisite pressure of his hand was perfectly calculated to force her to go where he wanted.</p><p>Lexi had no choice but to give in. She was so tired of fighting, so tired of nothing in her life being easy. Until this very moment.</p><p>Zach covered her mouth with his just as her climax crashed over her. All the tension inside her exploded out in a burst of light and sensation. It drained away only for a split second before slamming out of her again.</p><p>It was too much all at once. He overwhelmed her, destroyed her, made her whole.</p> <p>Her muffled cries of release filled her ears and she felt Zach\u2019s arm tighten around her. Another trembling wave of pleasure shimmered from her just as his erection swelled and pulsed inside her. The last gentle echo of her orgasm rippled out of her, making her tighten around Zach as he growled from the depths of his own completion.</p><p>Their breathing slowed as sweat cooled their bodies. Zach\u2019s mouth was at her throat, giving her nibbling, sucking kisses she was sure would leave marks.</p><p>A satisfied smile stretched her mouth. Let him mark her. She didn\u2019t care. She felt too good to care about anything other than the comforting weight of his body on hers and the protective circle of his arm, still clutching her hips, keeping them joined.</p><p>Zach shifted, giving her room to breathe, but not much. He held himself up on his elbows and stroked her hair away from her sweaty forehead. An odd, almost vulnerable look lined his dark face.</p><p>She wanted to comfort him, to give him whatever words he needed. But deep down, she knew that what he needed from her wasn\u2019t words. It was actions. He wanted her to open herself up and let him in. Not just her body, but her mind.</p><p>How could she do that? How could she put that kind of trust in the hands of a man she had believed to be her enemy for so long?</p> <p>Then again, after what they\u2019d shared, how could she not?</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been just sex. That was what she\u2019d wanted it to be, but it was more than that. She\u2019d seen how much he needed her\u2014how vulnerable he really was to her whims. She had the power to crush him, to destroy his world with little more than a thought\u2014will the luceria to fall from her neck and it would kill him\u2014and yet, somehow, he trusted her enough not to.</p><p>That kind of trust was humbling. Life changing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d he told her. \u201cI must not have done a good enough job if you\u2019re still able to think straight.\u201d</p><p>Lexi gave him a smile and kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cIf you\u2019d done any better, it would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>An arrogant grin stretched his mouth, making his white teeth gleam in the dim light. \u201cCare to give that theory a try?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take any more intensity right now. She felt too brittle. Too fragile. \u201cRain check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs many as you want, honey. Just say the word.\u201d</p> <p>His generosity made her shields crack more with every kind act. She wasn\u2019t sure how he knew just which weapons to wield against her to make her crumble at his feet, but he seemed to have an instinct for it.</p><p>He pulled from her body, still as thick and hard as if he hadn\u2019t come. But she knew he had. She could feel his semen seeping from her body, see it shining on the dark head of his penis.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t used a condom. That was what she\u2019d forgotten earlier.</p><p>The ramifications of that slip slammed into her, one on top of another until she could do nothing more than look at him.</p><p>Lexi had never even considered having a child. She\u2019d never drag a kid across the country, living out of the back of her Honda, putting it in constant risk of being attacked and killed by monsters. Or, worse, taken like so many of the stories she\u2019d heard over the years.</p><p>But things were different now. She had a home, and although she hadn\u2019t yet fully accepted it in her head, in her heart, this place was hers. It was safe. She could raise a child here without worry, knowing there would be others here just like him or her. Her child would feel normal. Her child would go to school and play with other kids and have a real life.</p><p>A family.</p><p>She started to shake as the foundations for her entire life, her plans for her future shifted beneath her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Zach, panic tightening his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on birth control.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid over her hair in a comforting caress. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to worry. I can\u2019t make you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d Shimmering dreams withered and went dim before they\u2019d even finished forming.</p><p>\u201cNo. Our men are sterile. Something the Synestryn did to us.\u201d Despite the gentleness of his hand, his words were short and curt. Bitter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she was, but not only for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too, but it\u2019s ancient history.\u201d He stood and reached a hand down to her. \u201cHow about we check out that new shower of yours?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. A shower sounded good. Distracting. She had too many things moving through her head right now. Too many questions. Too much confusion. Washing some of them away sounded like a great idea.</p><p>Angus found Gilda in the Hall of the Fallen. A low fire burned in the hearth, warming the room, making the polished swords of the dead warriors glow.</p><p>Gilda sat in a leather chair with a sword in her lap. The gray silk of her gown shimmered in the firelight, hugging her body and making him ache to slide his hands over her lush curves. It had been too long since he\u2019d last held her in his arms and made love to her\u2014nearly a week. She\u2019d been distant lately, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t seem to bring a smile back to her lips.</p><p>His failure grated over his nerves, stealing from him his usual steady patience and iron control. If she wouldn\u2019t tell him what he could do to ease her, he was going to find his own way to help her\u2014one he was fairly sure she wouldn\u2019t approve of.</p><p>The large leather chair seemed to swallow her small body, making her look weak and vulnerable. Protective instincts honed over hundreds of years rose easily to the surface, quickening Angus\u2019s step.</p><p>Her slender fingers ran lovingly over the blade. Their son\u2019s sword\u2014Angus recognized it now that he was closer. He knew every knick and scratch on the blade, every smooth spot worn down by his son\u2019s strong grip.</p><p>Gilda\u2019s dark eyes fluttered shut as she pulled a memory from the mirrored depths of the steel, reliving a moment of their son\u2019s brave past. A single tear slipped down her cheek and she pulled in a sobbing breath.</p><p>\u201cGilda,\u201d he said quietly so he wouldn\u2019t startle her.</p><p>She lifted her head and the force of her beauty drove through him like a hammer\u2019s blow. Every line of her face was perfectly formed, every curve exquisite. Even the fathomless depths of her black eyes drew him in and made him tremble against the need to touch her, comfort her.</p><p>Time had not altered her appearance much over the centuries. There was a maturity about her, though she had no wrinkles. Wisdom shone in her every move, though not one of her hairs had gone gray as his had. She was timeless beauty and unfailing loyalty.</p><p>Angus loved her so much, sometimes he was sure his heart would burst open under the strain.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for you to wallow in these memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all I have left of him. A record of my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>He took the sword from her hands and hung it back in its rightful place of honor. \u201cNot all the mistakes made by our people are yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur children have died, and there is no one to blame but myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSibyl still lives. And Maura.\u201d</p><p>Gilda\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cNo. Maura is dead. Only her body lives on.\u201d</p><p>Angus disagreed, but now wasn\u2019t the time for that old argument. They both knew it too well. \u201cWhat of Sibyl? She is back home with us. Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d asked Gilda, staring into the fire.</p><p>\u201cThe wall is going back up as fast as we can manage.\u201d</p><p>Anger tightened her full mouth, and Angus couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d seen her smile. \u201cThe wall did not protect her before. It will not now, any more than you or I can. Her abduction proved that beyond doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope is not lost. Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>She stood and spun around, her gray skirts swirling in an angry arc. \u201cYou think just because a few female Theronai have come through our gates that all is well? Are you really that foolish?\u201d</p><p>The barb stung, but he accepted the pain without complaint, forgiving her for it even as it left her mouth. He knew how much strain she was under. She was not herself\u2014not the same woman he\u2019d grown to love over the years, though he could love her no less, even if he tried.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cthat things are changing for the better. I prefer to live in hope than dwell in despair.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath, steeling himself for the reaction he knew she would have at his next words. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going to agree to allow Tynan to try to restore my fertility. He thinks he has a cure.\u201d</p><p>Her body stilled and only her eyes moved. They narrowed to dangerous slits, seething with emotion too strong to name. Angus reached out for the connection of the luceria that bound them together, seeking to feel what was going on behind those eyes, but he met a hard wall.</p><p>She was locking him out. Refusing him.</p><p>Angus reeled in shock. She\u2019d never once denied him like that. Not even when she was angry. Sure, he\u2019d felt her pull back on her emotions and filter out the things she didn\u2019t want him to feel, but never had she refused him so completely\u2014never once slammed the door in his face like that.</p><p>Anger and loneliness choked him, but he refused to back down. \u201cI knew my decision would bother you, but I had no idea how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBother me?\u201d she asked in a deceptively quiet voice. \u201cYou make a decision like this without even asking my opinion, and you think I\u2019m merely bothered?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngry, then. If you\u2019d let me in your thoughts, I\u2019d be able to tell, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his taunt and her fists clenched in her skirt, ruining the smooth silk. \u201cI will not bear another child. Not even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor have I asked you to. I know your feelings on the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you would allow Tynan to repair you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, so that he may learn how to repair the other men. You may not want children, but what about the other women who have come to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume none of them would like to see their babies slaughtered as I have mine. You\u2019d be doing them a favor refusing Tynan,\u201d said Gilda.</p><p>Angus sucked in a deep breath, reaching for patience. The depth of Gilda\u2019s grief for their dead children knew no bounds. She hadn\u2019t healed as was natural, as he had healed. Her grief had not lightened over the decades. Somehow, all the fear and anger and loss had festered inside Gilda, growing bigger and darker with the passage of time.</p><p>He should have seen it before. He should have sought to help her sooner, but he hadn\u2019t, and now he was afraid that the affliction she suffered was too large and deep to be healed.</p><p>Except, possibly, by the birth of another child. One they would protect and keep from harm. One who would save its mother from her grief.</p> <p>Angus\u2019s soul ached to hold a babe in his arms, to hear the sound of its laughter and feel the pride of watching it grow up strong and brave and kind. He cherished all of his children, even those who had made poor choices. He missed them, and there would always be a hollow place in his heart that he couldn\u2019t still hold them and speak to them, but that hollowness had not destroyed him. It had not ripped away his will to live or his ability to see the joy surrounding them. It had not tarnished the pride he had in working to keep so many humans safe.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t turn my back on my responsibilities,\u201d said Angus, meaning more than just his responsibilities to his men. Gilda also needed him, though he doubted she would agree.</p><p>\u201cNo, instead you\u2019ll turn your back on me.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, but she flinched, and he let his hand fall away. \u201cNever that, love. You are now and have always been the center of my world. I would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything except deny Tynan?\u201d Her hands unclenched and her face smoothed to impassivity. \u201cDo as you will. I won\u2019t try to stop you, but know this: as long as there is even the slightest chance you are fertile, I will not allow you to bed me.\u201d</p><p>Angus almost laughed at her ludicrous statement until he saw the glint of lethal hostility shining in her eyes. The laugh bubbling inside him died, and he clamped his lips shut over the rotten sound.</p> <p>\u201cYou meant it. We\u2019ve made love more days than not for centuries, allowing nothing to come between us. How can you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not bring another child into this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if it\u2019s what I want?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a level stare. \u201cI love you. I\u2019ve tried to give you whatever you wanted, but in this I cannot bend. I don\u2019t love you enough to watch another child of mine die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to resist each other,\u201d said Angus with complete confidence.</p><p>\u201cTo prevent another child\u2019s death, I will. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Angus did not doubt her sincerity, but neither could he back down. He had to help find a way to heal all of them, to bring children back into their lives. \u201cI have to do this, Gilda. The men need me. But if you insist, we can use human forms of contraception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was flat, final and ugly. \u201cIf you do this, you will not touch me.\u201d</p> <p>A heavy sense of defeat fell on Angus, making him feel old and weary. He and Gilda had been through so much and always come out the other side stronger and closer than before. This time, for the first time, Angus questioned that possibility.</p><p>She\u2019d shut him out of her thoughts. She\u2019d never done that before. She\u2019d never turned her back on him.</p><p>Angus couldn\u2019t stand here and face her like this, unable to find a way to help her, and unwilling to give her what she thought she wanted. He had to act with his conscience, and pray that eventually, Gilda would see it was the right thing to do. The only thing to do.</p><p>He turned away, leaving the Hall of the Fallen and Gilda behind.</p><p>As the thud of his boots echoed in the long hallway, Angus suffered in silent frustration. He had to do this. He had to give his people hope for some kind of future. If Tynan\u2019s calculations were off and this possible cure did harm instead of good, Angus would be the only one to suffer.</p><p>And if it succeeded, these walls would once again ring with the sound of happy children. Theronai children.</p><p>Angus was filled up with a renewed sense of purpose. He was going to help his men. Whether or not he ever had another child, he vowed that he would do whatever was necessary to see that his men did. They would rebuild their ranks and hope would be restored. Angus would not allow any lesser outcome.</p><p>Gilda was hurting right now. Weak from her efforts to restore the wall. Of course she would react badly to such a sensitive subject. It was hardly her fault that she suffered so, and he would forgive her. Hell, he already had. But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to let her continue to destroy herself.</p><p>They weren\u2019t done yet. Not by a long shot. She\u2019d shut him out, but Angus refused to let it stand. She was hurting too much for him to do so. Whether or not she realized it, she needed him, and if that meant he had to trick her, then that was what he\u2019d do. His woman was a stubborn one, and sometimes, the only way to get through her thick skull was by sheer force of will\u2014the kind of force a man like Angus was more than equipped to exert.</p><p>He\u2019d seduce her. She wouldn\u2019t be able to resist him. She never had.</p><p>And once his child was growing inside of her, she\u2019d find joy again. She\u2019d soften and see he only wanted what was best for her\u2014what was best for all of them.</p><p>Gilda watched Angus leave, keeping her knees locked until he was safely out of sight. As the carved wooden door clicked shut, she crumpled to the floor. Her body was weak and useless, but she made sure the barrier she\u2019d put between them was still safely in place.</p><p>Tears wet her cheeks, but she ignored them. She was too weak to hold them in, too tired to care whether or not anyone saw.</p><p>Physically, the strain of using so much magic day after day was taking its toll. Her body trembled, barely able to stand up to the effort of moving around as if nothing was wrong. Mentally, she was in tatters. Blocking Angus out had taken the last of her reserves, and she could only hope that the barrier stayed safely in place until the wall was restored and she had a chance to rest.</p><p>But she\u2019d had no choice. That barrier had been necessary.</p><p>Gilda couldn\u2019t let Angus find out the truth. It wasn\u2019t the Synestryn who had robbed Angus of his ability to have children. It had been Gilda. She\u2019d sterilized all the Theronai men in a fit of anger and grief the night their youngest son died.</p><p>Standing over the bloody patch of grass that had been the only thing left of her son, she knew she could never again watch another child die. And the only way to ensure that was to never have another child.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant for her magic to go beyond Angus. She hadn\u2019t meant to put so much power into her spell, causing it to seek out and sterilize all the men, ensuring she could not conceive by any of them. She hadn\u2019t meant to allow her grief to bind with that power, giving it enough strength to make it irreversible. At least to her.</p><p>Maybe Tynan had found a way where she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>But she\u2019d robbed the men of something so fundamental that what she had or hadn\u2019t meant to do mattered little.</p><p>If Angus ever found out what she\u2019d done\u2014if any of the men did\u2014she was sure they would hate her, shun her. Or worse, banish her. Send her to the Slayers like a man whose lifemark had died, letting those beasts do with her as they would.</p><p>Death would come, but not swiftly. Gilda had heard the stories of what the Slayers did to female prisoners.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen to her. More important, she couldn\u2019t let that happen to Angus.</p><p>Their fates were bound together. If she died, he would die with her, and Gilda loved him too much to let him witness her rape and murder. She\u2019d be kinder to end her own life, or even kill him first, rather than have him live through that, helpless to stop it.</p><p>Gilda tried to push herself up, but her arms were too weak. Normally, Angus would have sensed her weakness and been by her side, lifting her into his thick arms and caring for her until the weakness abated.</p><p>But this was not normal. Angus couldn\u2019t feel her weakness. He couldn\u2019t feel anything. Not even the shame that burned so bright inside her she was sure it would set her skin aflame.</p><p>Gilda covered her face with her hands, wishing she\u2019d done things differently.</p><p>Wishing changed nothing. Of course, neither had decades of pouring all of her strength into finding a way to reverse the magic she\u2019d wrought. Nothing she\u2019d done had helped. The longer the men remained sterile, the stronger the magic seemed to grow. She\u2019d tried everything she knew, short of telling anyone what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Maybe it was time to confess, or at least tell Tynan what she\u2019d done. As much as she protected her secret, she was constantly worried that one of the Sanguinar would find out. She refused to let anyone but Logan feed from her, and then only when it was vital. Angus was more likely to give of his own blood than allow hers to be shed, and Gilda had accepted his protection, knowing that he inadvertently hid her secret with his kindness.</p><p>Angus was too good a man for her. Gilda knew it, but it changed nothing. She wasn\u2019t going to let him go, even if there were a hundred compatible women waiting in line.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t going to let him lie with her. The chance that Tynan could find a way to reverse her magic was too much of a risk.</p><p>Losing Maura had nearly killed her. Sibyl\u2019s refusal to speak to her was like dying over again each day. Time did nothing to ease the pain her last living child\u2019s rejection caused her.</p><p>But Gilda deserved what she got. All of it. It was her fault none of the men could have children, just as it was her fault her baby girl would never grow into a woman.</p><p>Gilda stared into the fire while she waited for the tears to stop falling, while she waited for the shaking in her limbs to ease enough to allow her to stand.</p><p>She was alone now. Her mistakes had killed those she loved and driven the rest away. All that was left for her was grief and regret, and neither of them were going to help her stand. She was on her own. It was time to get tough.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Lexi left the giant shower before Zach could distract her with his luscious body. One look at his erection bobbing against his muscled abs and all she wanted to do was go to her knees and suck him into her mouth, feel him explode against her tongue.</p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t going to get her any closer to \u2019fessing up about the bomb in her trunk, so she kept her eyes on his chin, got clean and got out as fast as she could.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished dressing when he came into the room, wearing only a damp towel around his lean hips. His erection had abated and she found herself wondering if he\u2019d gotten himself off in the shower without her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The odd feeling of resentment straightened her spine and left her feeling robbed. If he was going to come, she wanted to be the one making it happen.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop staring, I\u2019m never going to fit into my jeans,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Lexi clamped her eyes shut and hurried back into the bathroom to brush her hair. When she came out, Zach was dressed, sitting on the edge of the bed, pulling his heavy boots onto his feet.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could go out and try a few things, see how you handle my power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you first.\u201d Her voice shook with apprehension and Zach\u2019s eyes shot to her face, narrowing in concern.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything you want, honey. No need to be afraid.\u201d He patted the bed next to him, but Lexi knew if she got that close, she\u2019d lose her nerve.</p><p>She started to pace, keeping out of arm\u2019s reach. \u201cYou already know I was raised not to trust you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that I truly believed you were the bad guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is why you kept running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI understand, honey. I\u2019m not holding it against you. You can relax.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t holding her upbringing against her, but how was he going to feel about her plan to blow him up? \u201cI\u2019m not alone, Zach. A lot of people out there think you all are the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the Defenders.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy mom was in pretty tight with them.\u201d</p> <p>Zach shrugged, drawing her eyes to the impressive width of his shoulders. The urge to run her fingers over his smooth skin and the muscles lying beneath made her mouth water, but that was just tough. She had to get through this.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly say I was tight with them, too. I thought they were mean and kind of corny, but near the end, right before you found me . . .\u201d</p><p>Zach stood and took a step toward her. Lexi held up her hands, telling him to stay back.</p><p>His green eyes narrowed. \u201cToward the end, what, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>Lexi, not honey. That didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cI was desperate. I had no money. I couldn\u2019t find work. Getting fake social security numbers has gotten so much harder recently, and I didn\u2019t have the kind of cash to fork over for a new identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me,\u201d said Zach. \u201cI hate the idea you suffered like that.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sheepish grin. \u201cYeah, well, you were kinda the reason I felt the need for that new identity in the first place. I was pretty sure you\u2019d be able to track me down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI tried. You weren\u2019t easy to find.\u201d</p><p>They were getting off track. \u201cAnyway, I was desperate, so I went looking for these guys that my mom used to stay with when things got bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Defenders,\u201d guessed Zach.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They took me in like I was one of their own. Their leader, Hector Morrow, even remembered me from when I was a kid.\u201d And she remembered him, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had a place to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be glad when you hear the rest.\u201d</p><p>Zach took another step toward her, this time ignoring her desire for him to keep his distance. He covered her shoulders with his palms, and ran his hands down her arms. The touch of his skin on hers made her head spin, and wrapped her in a cocoon of comfort.</p><p>Man, she was going to miss that. No way was he going to be touching her like that when he heard the truth.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re safe, I\u2019ll be fine. Finish your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story. It\u2019s an explanation. I want you to understand why I did what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Let me finish.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded and Lexi pulled in a fortifying breath. \u201cThe Defenders gave me a job at that bar. They gave me a place to sleep. They fed me. They promised me they wouldn\u2019t let you find me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw bunched then, and an angry glow brightened his eyes. \u201cNone of them would have stopped me. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed a sudden burst of nervousness. \u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t come down to that, to be honest. These men aren\u2019t bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they were saints if they\u2019d tried to stop me from finding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t get the chance. Instead, we . . . came up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s fingers tightened around her arms slightly and his voice hardened. \u201cWhat kind of plan?\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t look him in the eye. She was too ashamed of what she\u2019d done. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust. Tell. Me.\u201d</p><p>Time to suck it up.</p><p>Lexi thrust her chin out, straightened her shoulders and looked him right in the eye. \u201cThe Defenders have been trying to find your home for a long time. When they knew you were looking for me, they said I\u2019d make great bait. I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did want me to find you. I knew it,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I called Helen. I was sure she was brainwashed. I knew she\u2019d tell you where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that night you called and sounded so scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a trick. I knew you\u2019d come if you thought I was in trouble, though, at the time, I thought it was because you wanted the pleasure of killing me yourself.\u201d</p><p>His jaw bulged with anger; his throat worked as if he was trying to choke down her words. A vein in his temple throbbed.</p><p>Lexi was running out of time to finish her confession. She had to get it all out so he could be good and angry all at once. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have the guts to face him like this again. \u201cSo, I called. You came, just like we planned. I was supposed to get you in my car and lead them here, but then my car stalled out.\u201d</p><p>A look of deadly suspicion crossed his face. She was sure this was the look the Synestryn saw right before he cut them down. \u201cWhy your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where the explosives are. I have a trunkful of C- 4 and the Defenders taught me how to use it.\u201d She refused to flinch. \u201cI was sent here to blow this place up, along with everyone in it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi had been planning on killing him.</p><p>Shock didn\u2019t even begin to cover what he was feeling right now. Betrayal came closer, but not nearly close enough. His body shook with anger and a hurt so deep he didn\u2019t know he had any nerve endings there until now. Years of suffering had not prepared him for a blow like this.</p><p>Lexi, the woman he was meant to spend his life with, to love and defend, had planned to kill him.</p><p>And everyone else here\u2014all those innocent souls he was sworn to protect.</p><p>Zach couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it. Maybe he never would be able to, but there\u2019d be time to try later; right now, he had to deal with this crisis and make sure no one got hurt. Including Lexi.</p><p>The Theronai were not going to take her treachery lightly.</p><p>\u201cIs there any risk of that shit going off?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s safe. I have to hook everything up to the C- 4 before there\u2019s a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be standing around here if I wasn\u2019t. There are kids around. I\u2019d never risk harming them. You believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He had no choice but to believe her for now\u2014until he had time to check for himself.</p><p>\u201cYou used me,\u201d he choked out, barely able to form the words. The pain of her betrayal ran deep\u2014deeper than he would have thought possible considering their short time together.</p><p>\u201cI did use you. I don\u2019t expect you to forgive me, but I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now that you do? Now that you know how fucked up this plan of yours was?\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes held steady, begging him to believe her. To trust her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Really, Zach, I would never hurt the people here. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to believe her, but the lives of too many people were at stake. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way I can know for sure, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I want to fix this. I really do. That\u2019s why I\u2019m spilling my guts here.\u201d She looked sincere. She held his gaze and didn\u2019t squirm when he glared back at her. It looked like she wasn\u2019t trying to lie.</p><p>Anymore.</p><p>Still, the fact that she had lied made her suspect. Zach knew only one way to prove her innocence. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let me in your head. You\u2019re going to let me see your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zach. That\u2019s too creepy. Too intrusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo fucking bad. You\u2019ve made this mess by lying, and that\u2019s the only way to clear it up. I\u2019m going to have to tell Joseph what you\u2019ve done. I can\u2019t possibly vouch for you if you aren\u2019t willing to let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lexi backed away, hitting the wall behind her. \u201cI\u2019m a private person.\u201d</p><p>Zach followed her, watching her for any signs she might try to flee. \u201cNot anymore. We\u2019re doing this, Lexi. One way or another. I have a vow to these people to uphold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your vow to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give my life to protect you, even as angry as I am, but what I\u2019m going to do to you in no way violates that.\u201d And he was going to do it. Even if he had to force her. It wouldn\u2019t be pleasant, but it would be a hell of a lot gentler than what Joseph might be forced into doing to get the truth out of her. He might call in one of the Sanguinar, and Zach wasn\u2019t going to let one of them tromp through her mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. This is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d she said, lifting her chin.</p><p>Fuck. He knew damn well that if she fought him on this, he might end up hurting her. Still, it had to be done. He had to be sure, without a doubt, that there was nothing else she was hiding from him. Too many lives were at stake if he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cThis is the only way I can protect you, Lexi. If we don\u2019t do this, someone else will, and they won\u2019t be as careful with you as I will.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment. Her pupils had tightened down to frightened dots of black. All the color had faded from her cheeks, leaving behind the gray pallor of fear.</p><p>Zach couldn\u2019t stand to see her like this. He had a job to do, and he\u2019d do it, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t make this as easy on her as possible. No one else knew yet. He still had the time to take it slow. Go easy.</p><p>He smoothed her baby- fine hair away from her forehead. It was still damp from their shower and clung to his fingers, tying them together. \u201cI need you to let me do this. If you make me use force, it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back against the wall and he saw her throat work nervously. \u201cYeah. Okay. I got myself into this. I\u2019ll take my punishment like a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a punishment.\u201d Though that might well still be headed her way.</p><p>\u201cSure feels like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust close your eyes and relax. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>Lexi did as Zach told her and tried not to get sick on his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t believe she was going to let someone muck about inside her head. If she\u2019d known that would be the cost of dealing with the Defenders, she would have decided to starve first.</p><p>Zach\u2019s hand splayed over her throat, and she felt her necklace lift until it came in contact with his ring. The two bands locked together like magnets, and a slow trickle of warm energy sank into her skin, radiating out from the necklace.</p><p>The hair on her body lifted, and a potent shiver raced through her, lighting up nerve endings as it went.</p><p>Lexi let out a low groan of pleasure. She couldn\u2019t help it. Whatever he was doing felt too good, almost like a narcotic streaking through her system.</p> <p>Her bones softened, and her body slid down the wall. Zach\u2019s strong arm eased her down slowly, keeping her from falling hard. She ended up in a loose heap on the floor with her shirt dragged up her back, leaving it bare against the cool, hard wall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust relax.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t really have an option, not that she was complaining. If she\u2019d known being mind- fucked was going to feel this nice, she might have let him do it before.</p><p>Her eyes were barely open, just cracked enough that she could see Zach\u2019s dark face hovering above her. He was so beautiful, so manly. That mouth of his was full and soft, unlike the rest of his hard, lean body, and he knew how to use it to make her feel so good. Just kissing him was better than full-blown sex with other men. She wasn\u2019t sure how that worked, but she was pretty sure that if she spent some time studying it, she\u2019d figure it out.</p><p>Lexi reached for him, her arms going around his neck in a sloppy stack of limp fingers. She couldn\u2019t find the strength to hold on, and her hands slipped back into her lap. She tried again, but Zach gathered her wrists in his free hand and held them in place.</p> <p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d he told her.</p><p>If she got any more relaxed, she was going to sink into the carpet, making a wet puddle. Maybe that was what he wanted. She thought she could do it if it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, honey.\u201d</p><p>Honey. He wouldn\u2019t call her that if he hated her, right?</p><p>Lexi latched onto that idea and held it close. She didn\u2019t want him to hate her. She wanted him to love her.</p><p>Love. The thought shocked her to stillness. Why would she want him to love her? That would only complicate things. She hadn\u2019t even decided if the life he led was going to work out for her or not. Sure, he\u2019d gone a long way toward convincing her to stay. He\u2019d given her a home, made her feel like a queen. Made her feel important. Needed.</p> <p>What girl wouldn\u2019t want to get used to something like that? It just showed she was sane.</p><p>But love was a big deal. It changed things. Made them harder. Messier.</p><p>Better.</p><p>A blunt pressure behind her eyes made her wince, distracting her from her train of thought.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight it,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t fighting anything, but her mouth wasn\u2019t working well enough to tell him that.</p><p>The pressure increased until it was pain. A whimper fell from her lips and the pain eased off somewhat, but didn\u2019t disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fighting me, honey. You\u2019ve got to let down those guards of yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how,\u201d she heard herself whisper.</p><p>He was silent for a moment, and she felt a subtle tension running through his hand. A single pulse of fear slid into her and she could tell instantly that it wasn\u2019t her own. It had a different feel to it. A different shape, more jagged and rough than her own.</p><p>It was Zach\u2019s fear. He was afraid. For her.</p><p>Something was wrong, but Lexi couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll try it again. This time, I want you to picture a thick brick wall in your head. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>She gave a small nod as the wall popped into existence inside her mind.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now take that wall down, brick by brick. You don\u2019t need it anymore. You\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>Safe. That was nice.</p><p>Lexi did what he said, tearing down the wall, only she never reached the bottom. There were always more bricks, like they were growing up from whatever passed as earth inside the fluid constructs of her head.</p><p>Refusing to give up, she kept doing what he\u2019d said while the pressure behind her eyes once again started to build. Heat grew inside her head, making her shake. The wall kept growing, keeping up with every attempt she made at shrinking it.</p><p>Pain radiated out, filling her skull to bursting. A noise sounded somewhere distant: a shrill cry of pain and the dry rattle of panting breaths. Hard bands tightened on her wrists and a brittle heat bit into her neck.</p><p>This was wrong. Even without any sort of experience at these kinds of things, she knew in her soul this was all terribly wrong.</p><p>The brick wall shot up, thickening as it grew. Taller than Jack\u2019s beanstalk and wider than she could see, the thing kept growing and swelling, fighting against the pressure that filled her head.</p><p>A buzzing sound clogged her ears. Her blood burned as it sped through her veins, searing them from the inside out. There was nowhere to run to make it stop. Nothing she could do.</p><p>Dimly, she felt a popping inside her head, like little bursts of static electricity igniting oxygen. As each spark burst, she felt less of the world around her. Hearing faded. The cool press of the wall against her lower back became a memory. The feel of Zach\u2019s hands around her wrists disappeared, along with feeling in the wrists themselves. Awareness of her body dissipated like fog under the sun until there was nothing left but the brick wall and an incessant pounding against it.</p><p>Then suddenly the pounding stopped. Or maybe it hadn\u2019t stopped, but she could no longer sense it in any way. Everything but the wall slipped away and Lexi let it all go. She didn\u2019t need any of it. All she needed was to let go.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Lexi was limp in Zach\u2019s arms. Sweat trickled down his temple, mocking his pounding headache. He was shaking like he\u2019d just finished a three-day battle with no water, and it took all his strength to keep himself sitting upright. Which was sad, considering the wall did most of the work for him.</p><p>He\u2019d failed. Nothing he\u2019d tried seemed to work. Lexi was too strong, her defenses impenetrable.</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust him. Deep down inside, where it mattered most, she didn\u2019t trust him. He knew that was why he\u2019d failed.</p><p>Zach waited for the weakness to fade enough he could move; then he shifted Lexi so her head was resting at a more comfortable- looking angle on his shoulder. The luceria shimmered under the bright bedroom lights, showing off an angry swirl of greens and maybe some blue.</p><p>The blue hadn\u2019t been there earlier, and with a sick sense of dread, Zach realized that whatever had just happened had actually reversed the process of bonding them closer together.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Rabid frustration gnawed at his insides. He wanted to lash out and vent some of his anger, but there was no one around who deserved that kind of treatment. The source of Lexi\u2019s mistrust was her mother\u2019s teachings, and he was sure the woman had only done what she thought she had to do to protect her child.</p><p>Zach refused to hold that against her. She\u2019d kept Lexi safe all those years when he couldn\u2019t and he owed her respect, not resentment.</p><p>He gave Lexi a little shake. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Her breathing had evened out and her pulse was steady and strong, but she wasn\u2019t awake.</p><p>What if he\u2019d damaged her?</p><p>A sick sense of panic trickled through him and he pulled out his cell phone. He wasn\u2019t sure if Logan was at Dabyr or not, but he was the only one of the Sanguinar Zach trusted enough to let him touch her.</p><p>\u201cAre you at home?\u201d he asked as soon as Logan answered.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to leave. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you. It\u2019s Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Now for the hard part. Zach dialed Joseph Rayd, the leader of the Theronai. As much as he hated it, Zach had to tell Joseph about the explosives.</p><p>Joseph answered on the sixth ring; his voice sounded strained. Tired. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to come to Lexi\u2019s room,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it can wait. Kinda busy.\u201d He sounded more than just busy. His voice was strained, like his throat was so tight he was having trouble shoving the words out. A hint of anger and something else shaded his words, chilling them. \u201cNow\u2019s not a good time.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked down at Lexi\u2019s limp form. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to be. We have a . . . situation.\u201d</p><p>A muffled curse came over the line, and he knew Joseph was on his way. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more, right?\u201d</p><p>Zach had no idea what he meant, but he could guess. Something was going down, and it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cGive me a sec,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Zach shoved away his weakness and got Lexi settled comfortably in bed. He left her just long enough to open her door for Joseph, then went back to her side. By the time he was back, she was starting to wake, pushing herself up on the bed.</p><p>Her arms trembled, so he helped lift her up and shoved a couple of fluffy pillows behind her back.</p><p>Lexi rubbed her temples and blinked her eyes. She saw him, and although he had no idea what the look on his face was, it must have been bad, based on the way her eyes widened and she reached for him like he was about to fall over a cliff.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes strayed to the luceria around her throat. There was definitely a lot of blue in there now. He\u2019d lost ground with her.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The word came out hard and clipped.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to puke. Did something happen while I was passed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were only out for a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d said Joseph from the bedroom doorway. His hulking body filled the space and his face was set in rigid angles. \u201cThis had better be damn important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d said Zach. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just what this place needs. Another problem.\u201d Joseph let out a weary sigh and crossed his arms over his thick chest. \u201cGet on with it. I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d</p><p>Zach felt Lexi grow tense more than he saw it happen. The air around her seemed to get colder and was scented with the tang of panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Zach told her. \u201cJoseph won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>A disgusted sneer crossed Joseph\u2019s face. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to hurt her. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Zach found Lexi\u2019s hand and gave it a comforting squeeze. He opened his mouth to speak, but she beat him to the punch. \u201cIt\u2019s my mess. I\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she said.</p><p>Zach nodded, and a sense of pride curled around him. She might be afraid, but she wasn\u2019t going to let it stop her from doing the right thing.</p><p>He loved that about her.</p><p>Lexi pushed herself upright and swung her legs over the side of the bed. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t beat around the bush,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d agreed Joseph. \u201cI\u2019m a busy man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI originally came here to blow this place up. The C- 4 is in my trunk.\u201d</p><p>Joseph was still for a moment; then he slowly pushed himself away from the doorframe, his face getting darker and darker with every passing second.</p><p>Zach moved his body so he was between Joseph and Lexi, and he put his hand on his sword. \u201cStay where you are,\u201d he warned Joseph.</p><p>That furious stare swiveled around until it was squarely on Zach. \u201cYou brought her here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Lexi. She was at his side, trying to get past Zach, but he didn\u2019t budge. \u201cNone of this is Zach\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s words came out like slabs of ice\u2014cold and heavy. \u201cYou\u2019ve committed an act of war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she planned one. She didn\u2019t actually commit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d growled Joseph. \u201cShe brought explosives onto our property\u2014into our homes. There are humans here. Children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t follow through. I\u2019d never hurt kids. I thought you were all monsters. I see now I was wrong. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t mean shit, little girl. Your action is punishable by death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my fucking corpse,\u201d said Zach. He pulled his sword and held the naked blade with the tip pointing at Joseph\u2019s heart.</p><p>A movement from the doorway caught Zach\u2019s eye, but he didn\u2019t turn. \u201cApparently, I\u2019ve come just in time,\u201d drawled Logan from the doorway. \u201cSomeone care to fill me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach was just sealing his fate by siding with the enemy,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>Lexi slipped out from behind him and wrapped her hand around the razor-sharp steel. If Zach so much as breathed hard, it would slice right through her delicate skin.</p> <p>\u201cStop it with the macho shit,\u201d she ordered him. \u201cYou\u2019re making it worse.\u201d</p><p>Anger and a sickening sense of dread rolled around inside him, making him queasy. He couldn\u2019t let Joseph hurt her, no matter how much she\u2019d messed up.</p><p>Lexi turned to Logan, keeping her hand on the sword\u2019s sharp edge. \u201cI made a mistake. A big one. Joseph flipped, which is totally understandable, and now these two are leaking testosterone all over my new place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should start by putting the weapon away,\u201d suggested Logan.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s jaw bulged, but he lifted his hands, palms out, and took a long step back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt her. Yet. She deserves a chance to speak.\u201d</p><p>Zach gathered every strand of control he could find and pulled hard. Lexi looked up at him, her eyes pleading with him, though for what, he wasn\u2019t sure. Put the weapon away? Get her out of this mess? Go back in time so they\u2019d never met?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he spat. \u201cGet your hand off my sword, and I\u2019ll back down.\u201d</p><p>Lexi did and Zach sheathed the sword.</p> <p>His protective instincts were still running hot, pounding through him like a jackhammer. He wasn\u2019t sure he was going to be able to control himself enough to think rationally, but he had to try. For Lexi.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Logan. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start. Now, my lady, if you please, can you give me a little more detail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought a trunkful of explosives here to blow you all to hell. Needless to say, I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019m not really a big fan of killing, so it works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to kill us?\u201d asked Logan with only the faintest interest coloring his cultured voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought you were the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cGiven the way these two were acting just now, I can hardly blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s committed an act of war,\u201d grated out Joseph. \u201cShe was going to kill the children.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s voice poured out like cool water over scorched earth. \u201cI understand how upset that must make you, Joseph, but I think we can make an exception, considering the circumstances. We need her, and she did confess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it okay. Not by a long shot. We don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s lying,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>\u201cZach will know. They\u2019re connected. He\u2019d be able to see if she\u2019s lying.\u201d Logan turned to Zach. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Zach, feeling like a traitor to the one woman who could save his sorry ass. \u201cI tried to get into her head, but it didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s gaze narrowed with suspicion and he swiveled his head around toward Lexi. \u201cIs this true?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Lexi shoved her pointed chin up and looked Logan right in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m too thick-skulled, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to have been blocking him. Keeping him out,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to let me in, but it didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Zach. \u201cShe\u2019s built up too many mental defenses or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever defenses she has, they won\u2019t work on me,\u201d said Logan as he glided closer. His lips lifted just a fraction of an inch\u2014enough for Zach to see the pearly gleam of his fangs.</p><p>Instincts swarmed up inside Zach, filling him with a potent, feral rage. Lexi was his. He\u2019d vowed to protect her and he meant to do just that. No matter who he had to slice down to do it.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d growled Zach as he shoved Logan back. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to be sure,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re just going to have to keep wondering, \u2019cause no one is making her bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he talking about, Zach?\u201d asked Lexi, her voice thinned by a hint of fear. She was at his side and took a half step closer.</p><p>\u201cLogan here wants to suck your blood and take a walk inside your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him,\u201d ordered Joseph. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get out of this alive.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand wrapped around his biceps. Her fingers were cold and trembling. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way.\u201d</p><p>Joseph came forward, looming over her, making him look bigger and meaner than Zach had ever seen. He was typically a reasonable, gentle man, but all that had fled as he faced down Lexi. \u201cThere isn\u2019t, and I won\u2019t take a chance you\u2019re going to hurt my people. You do this or I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me, too,\u201d said Zach. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out of the field so long, it\u2019ll probably be the last thing you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d shouted Logan. \u201cNo one is dying here tonight. There is a simple way to settle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that involves you sucking her blood, leech?\u201d said Zach.</p><p>Logan\u2019s pale eyes flared brighter for a second, giving off an eerie glow. \u201cI believed us to be friends, Zach. I\u2019d hoped that you\u2019d trust me not to injure your woman.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t trust anyone enough to let Lexi bleed.</p><p>Zach\u2019s body tightened and his hand strayed once again to his sword. He was going to have to cut his way out of here.</p><p>He was going to have to kill his friends.</p><p>As he moved to do just that, Lexi put a staying hand on his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, and you can\u2019t. I\u2019ll let him have my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stepped in front of him. Her eyes roamed over his face and she offered him a brave smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I was the one who made the decision to come here under false pretenses. I was the one who agreed to kill people before I had all the facts. I\u2019ll be the one to deal with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be perfectly safe,\u201d said Logan. He put his hand on her shoulder and she flinched slightly before allowing the touch.</p><p>Zach hated this, but what choice did he have? She\u2019d agreed. She\u2019d sealed her fate.</p><p>Zach gave Logan a hard stare, full of the promise of vengeance. \u201cShe\u2019d better be.\u201d</p><p>Logan decided that his smartest course of action was going to be to make this as quick as possible.</p><p>Zach was seething with barely controlled rage. Joseph had maneuvered so that he could restrain Zach if necessary, and Lexi\u2014brave child that she was\u2014had squared her shoulders and was staring Logan right in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t hurt,\u201d he assured her as he lifted her wrist to his mouth. No sense in tempting fate by putting his lips to her throat. Logan wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Joseph was strong enough to hold Zach back if things turned difficult.</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d she growled at him.</p><p>Such a cute little thing. Her dainty chin was high, and her dark eyes were set on kill. It was entirely possible that she was still planning to destroy them, but given that she\u2019d agreed to this treatment, Logan doubted it.</p><p>He took a firm hold on her wrist and stepped so close she had no choice but to keep looking into his eyes. Logan gathered what meager power he had left and let it bloom in his eyes, sucking her in. Capturing her.</p><p>Her glare faded and a sleepy weight lowered her lids. It took only a brief second to ensnare her, but he could feel her starting to fight against him as she realized what had happened.</p><p>Before she could react, he bit into the delicate skin of her wrist, piercing her vein. Sweet, hot blood poured over his tongue like the purest rain. She\u2019d never been bled before. Logan was her first, and the power filling him was a heady mixture of innocence and strength.</p><p>The starving monster within him roared to life, taking over his body. He drew from her wrist, sucking down her power in huge gulps. He didn\u2019t waste time breathing. Every second counted, and somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that Zach wasn\u2019t going to stand by and allow him to feed for long.</p><p>Her heartbeat thrummed across his tongue as she became part of him. Wherever she went, for as long as she lived, he\u2019d be able to find her again so he could feed on her.</p><p>He felt her weaken, and his arm wrapped around her waist, holding her upright. She struggled, but he didn\u2019t relent. He needed more. So much more.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he heard in the distance, but ignored the command in that voice.</p><p>All that mattered was the warmth of her blood pouring into him, filling up all the empty holes in his belly.</p><p>Logan\u2019s head spun as his power returned. His body warmed and his skin prickled as he was restored to his true self, not this frail, gaunt body starvation had wrought.</p><p>Muscles swelled and his bones hardened. The constant, nagging hunger that plagued him dissipated more with each gulp.</p><p>The weight of the woman in his arms increased as she weakened, but it didn\u2019t matter. Logan was strong now, easily able to support her meager weight.</p><p>Her heartbeat fluttered and Logan\u2019s head started to spin.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t started breathing and his lungs were burning for oxygen.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d The imperious shout shocked him back to himself. He was supposed to be doing something\u2014something important.</p><p>Treachery. He was supposed to be searching inside the woman for signs of treachery.</p><p>Before he lost his chance, Logan shoved himself into her mind, slamming through the formidable shields she\u2019d built up. They were thick and strong, but Logan was much stronger now, thanks to her blood. He had no trouble breaking down what had taken years to erect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was terrified. Weak.</p><p>Logan was killing her and he hadn\u2019t even realized what he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>Immediately, he sealed the wound on her arm, licking away the remnant of blood left behind. He scoured her mind, searching through it swiftly, before it was too late.</p><p>He saw flickers of her life\u2014brief flashes of people and places she\u2019d seen. He felt moments of triumph and panic, sorrow and joy. Her life was like many others, full of a bright mix of feelings and memories and hopes.</p> <p>Logan found the ones he wanted and rifled through them. She was fading fast, sinking into unconsciousness.</p><p>He took some of the soaring power she\u2019d given him and let it seep back into her through his hold on her arm. If she collapsed, he was sure Zach would cut him down.</p><p>A faint memory nagged him. He\u2019d tasted blood like hers before; he just couldn\u2019t remember where or when.</p><p>Focus. He needed to concentrate on the part of her holding her plans to destroy his home.</p><p>Logan honed in on those thoughts, saw a collage of male faces he didn\u2019t recognize, then singled out what he needed.</p> <p>Lexi was telling the truth. She had no intention of killing them. Not since learning they were not the monsters she\u2019d believed.</p><p>Logan struggled to find his voice, and when he did, it came out rough and scratchy. \u201cIt is as she says,\u201d he told Joseph.</p><p>Both men deflated visibly in relief, and Zach rushed forward to take Lexi\u2019s limp body from Logan\u2019s arms. He settled her on the bed with exquisite care, as if her body were made of blown glass.</p><p>\u201cShe needs fluids,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Zach gave Logan a feral stare. \u201cYou took too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer defenses are formidable. It was necessary.\u201d It was a lie, but one he sensed Zach would accept. The last thing he needed was to anger Zach enough that he cut Logan down and wasted all the precious power flowing in his veins.</p> <p>That power was needed elsewhere. Project Lullaby was reaching a critical stage, and all his kin sleeping below the earth needed to be fed.</p><p>\u201cGive her a couple of hours and she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better pray that\u2019s the case, leech.\u201d</p><p>Joseph gave Logan a small formal bow. \u201cThank you for your services.\u201d It was a dismissal and Logan knew it.</p><p>Fine. He had better things to do, anyway, and the rich blood filling him up was going to make them all possible.</p><p>Alexander was one of the few people who truly loved hospitals. He saw hope where others saw only sickness and despair. It was within the walls of hospitals like this that he found the opportunity to save his race from extinction.</p><p>The sterile smell, combined with that of weak human bodies, filled his nose as he glided along the tiled hallways. It was late, well past visiting hours, but no one questioned his presence. In fact, few even noticed him passing by. He was no more than a blur of movement, a whoosh of cool air sliding over their skin.</p><p>His senses on high alert, Alexander moved with unerring accuracy toward his target. He pushed the wooden door open and slipped inside, unnoticed by the nursing staff at the desk nearby.</p> <p>The room was dark. Quiet. No TV filled the silence, only the faint sigh of breath moving in and out of a woman\u2019s body, the dry rattle of a man\u2019s labored breathing much faster than her own. She reeked of grief and despair, but Alexander would shortly fix that. He\u2019d long ago learned that the hope for his race\u2014the Sanguinar\u2014was tied closely to the fragile hopes of certain, special humans\u2014those with strong blood surging in their veins, the blood of the Solarc himself.</p><p>Alexander drew in a long breath through his nose, detecting the spicy richness of that blood. Hunger rolled in his belly, but he\u2019d lived with it long enough to set the urge to feed aside for as long as he needed. His task was more important than his hunger, for if it went well, one day his people would no longer feel the gnawing emptiness of starvation again.</p><p>He moved slowly so he wouldn\u2019t startle her, clearing the fabric curtain that blocked the sight of the bed from the doorway. A man lay there, still and gaunt. He looked to be in his sixties, though Alexander guessed him a decade younger. His skin was tinted yellow with sickness and hung loose on his frame. A thin clear tube at his nose fed him oxygen and a thick drainage tube snaking from his side gave away a recent surgery.</p><p>Alexander checked the chart. Cancer. It was almost always cancer.</p><p>That suited him fine. He\u2019d honed his skills well, and battling those voracious cells was almost second nature to him now.</p><p>The woman was seated in a rigid chair, slumped over the bed in sleep. Her short blond hair was a mess, as if she hadn\u2019t combed it in days, and a bright flush reddened her cheeks.</p><p>Alexander pressed his hand against her forehead, feeling the heat of her fever streak up his arm. She\u2019d spent enough time at the man\u2019s side to catch some illness, likely because she hadn\u2019t been taking care of herself.</p><p>Briefly, Alexander questioned whether she was a good candidate, but dismissed the notion in moments. Anyone who dedicated herself to one she loved to the point of self- sacrifice was going to be a valuable asset to their plans.</p><p>The woman stirred at his touch, jerking awake. She looked up at him with wide brown eyes and eased away from his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She blinked a couple of times and ran her hands through her hair as if to straighten it.</p><p>Alexander suppressed a knowing smile. His kind were beautiful and always seemed to have that effect on humans. Too bad it had been decades since Alexander had felt the urge to have sex. He was too hungry to think of much else, and too weak to act on it even if the thought had crossed his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so this was her father. And she thought he was a doctor.</p><p>Alexander supported that false assumption and looked at her father\u2019s chart. He knew enough about human medicine to see the pattern of death hanging all over this man. \u201cHe\u2019s weak. Dying.\u201d</p><p>The scent of grief rose up stronger, nearly choking Alexander. It had a cloying smell, like old flower petals on the verge of decay.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you can do?\u201d</p><p>This was his opening, given so easily he nearly balked at taking it. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMeghan Clark.\u201d Tears made the words tremble with despair.</p><p>\u201cMeghan,\u201d he repeated, using the power of her name to gather her attention to him. \u201cThere is one thing I know that might help, but you won\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><p>They never did. At first.</p><p>\u201cSomething experimental? If he\u2019s dying, how dangerous could it be for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dangerous for him,\u201d said Alexander, lacing his words with a hint of what he was\u2014dark, desperate. Hungry.</p><p>Meghan leaned back in her chair, putting more space between them. Her eyes flicked to the nurse\u2019s call button, but it was on the far side of the bed, well out of reach. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you need to know is what I can offer: hope.\u201d</p><p>Her throat moved as she swallowed nervously, and Alexander\u2019s eyes clung to the slender column of flesh and bone and blood. He could see her pulse pounding, hear the swoosh of blood pumping through her veins.</p><p>His stomach clenched painfully, and he had to grit his teeth to stay his ground and not lunge for her. Feed from her until only a husk of the pretty female remained.</p><p>That would get him nowhere in the long run. Down that road lay starvation.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offer you an exchange. I can save your father, and in return, I want something from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a doctor, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as you think, no.\u201d</p><p>She stood slowly, straightening her spine and shifting so that he could no longer see her father\u2019s face.</p><p>Little Meghan Clark\u2014who stood only to his shoulder, who he could kill with a mere thought\u2014was protecting her father.</p><p>The humor of the situation made him smile, though he tried not to uncover his fangs. He didn\u2019t want her raising a ruckus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you touch him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow am I to cure him if I can\u2019t touch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can. I don\u2019t know what sick joke you\u2019re playing, but I want you to leave.\u201d She swayed a little on her feet. Maybe the fever and her weariness were taking more of a toll on her than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said, imbuing the word with the dwindling remnants of his power.</p><p>Meghan Clark sagged and Alexander grabbed her before she could fall. The heat of her skin sank into him, making him shiver. He was cold all the time now, even when he fed. He\u2019d gotten so used to it he\u2019d forgotten what it was like to be warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you or your father. I merely seek to offer you a trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will save his life in return for another.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she struggled against his hold. Alexander tightened his grip, being careful not to injure her.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI would never kill someone, not even to save my father.\u201d Fury made her words hard, and as she flung them at him, he felt every single one.</p><p>He was so tired of being mistrusted. So tired of fighting for every little scrap of strength he needed to survive.</p><p>He was tired, period. Maybe it was time to go to sleep in the chambers beneath Dabyr, let another take his place, just for a few years. Not that there were any of his kind left who had the same level of ability he did.</p><p>If he went to sleep, he was sure he\u2019d never wake again. The fact that he had to decide whether or not that was his best option frightened him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to kill anyone. All I want is for you to take a trip. Go to Minnesota.\u201d</p><p>Her struggles ceased and she looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cMinnesota? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man there. If I cure your father, then I want you to go there. Meet him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because he was the man whose blood would best meld with hers. He was the man who Alexander wanted to father her children. Of course, telling her that would only scare her away. He\u2019d learned that the hard way.</p><p>Tynan preferred a more direct approach, but Alexander preferred subtlety. He liked letting the humans think they weren\u2019t being manipulated. He believed it made the bonds between them stronger, more pure\u2014the blood of their children richer.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter why?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll I want from you is this one small boon. Is it too much to request in exchange for your father\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>Meghan shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know about all this. It\u2019s probably some kind of fever dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the harm of agreeing? If your father doesn\u2019t recover, you owe me nothing.\u201d</p><p>She pulled from his grip and he let her go, keeping a hand at her elbow in case she started to go down again. She turned her head and stared at her father\u2019s gaunt form. \u201cThat\u2019s all? I just take a trip if . . . when he gets better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Meghan looked up at Alexander again and gave him a single nod. \u201cFine. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The power of her promise wound around him, giving him hope that almost felt like warmth, but not quite. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Alexander gathered her in his arms and turned on his magic, seeing the faint glow of blue light wash across her face\u2014a glow that came from his eyes. Ensnaring her was easy enough; it barely took any energy at all, which was good, considering he had so little to spare. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d she asked in a faint whisper. She was beyond fear now, floating in a light trance where normal inhibitions meant nothing.</p> <p>\u201cJust a little,\u201d he said, lowering his mouth to her fragile neck. \u201cJust enough to drive away your illness. I need you to be nice and healthy for your trip.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Nika roamed the halls of Dabyr, following the faint trail of power left in Madoc\u2019s wake.</p><p>He was avoiding her, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed him. He was the only thing that kept the sgath from taking her away, out of her body. Surely he wouldn\u2019t leave without at least saying good-bye.</p><p>Then again, maybe she hadn\u2019t told him with her voice how much she needed him. Sometimes she mixed up the things she said with those she thought, so she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p> <p>Where was he? She needed to find him before it was too late and he left her alone.</p><p>Nika didn\u2019t want to be with the sgath tonight; she didn\u2019t want them to rip her from her body and fling her out into the darkness. Every time she was with them it made her sick, and she didn\u2019t want to throw up the food she\u2019d managed to choke down earlier. She wanted to be stronger, healthy, like her sister Andra was.</p><p>It was the only way she was ever going to find her sister, Tori. The real Tori, not those stranger\u2019s bones Andra had buried.</p><p>But healthy and strong were a long way off. Her body was fragile, her bones brittle. It was going to take time to rebuild her strength, and the only time it was even possible was when Madoc was there to drive the dark things away long enough for her to eat.</p><p>A wave of weakness hit her and she sagged against the wall. The sgath out hunting pulled on her mind, clawing at it, threatening to tear it apart into little bloody chunks. They wanted her to come hunt with them, to feed on the flesh and blood of the humans they found.</p><p>They used her to communicate with each other. She was sure of it.</p> <p>There were fewer of them now, thanks to Madoc and the other Theronai who had made hunting them their top priority. But the sgath that remained were stronger. Smarter. Louder. She had trouble resisting their call.</p><p>Nika couldn\u2019t stand the thought of going with them tonight. She needed Madoc, so she pushed herself up and followed the humming stream of power he had left behind as she drifted through the silent halls of Dabyr.</p><p>The trail ended at a door like all the rest of the doors in this hall. Nika turned the knob, found it unlocked, and pushed it open.</p><p>The suite was dark, but a flickering rectangle of light glowed on the carpet, falling from the open doorway of one of the bedrooms.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s trail led there, so she followed it into the light.</p><p>A large bed filled the room, and on it was a giant of a man. He was handsome in a rough sort of way, and several days of stubble shadowed his jaw. A bandage covered his left temple and several bruises marked his face with sickly greens and yellows. His hands were huge, lying at his sides, and next to the bed sat Sibyl with her tiny child-sized hand wrapped around two of the man\u2019s thick fingers.</p><p>In her other arm, she cradled a porcelain doll that looked just like her, wearing a pretty blue ribbon in her hair.</p><p>The doll\u2019s glassy black eyes opened and looked at Nika. Malevolence flowed out of the thing, making Nika take a hesitant step back.</p> <p>A second later, Sibyl looked up slowly. Her blond ringlets drooped limply over her shoulders and a haunted shadow darkened her bright blue eyes. She was afraid.</p><p>The girl showed no surprise at Nika\u2019s arrival, as if she\u2019d been expecting her all along.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit with me,\u201d said Sibyl.</p><p>Nika hesitated. Madoc wasn\u2019t here. She could feel the emptiness of this place without him, and the need to seek him out grew stronger with every breath she took.</p><p>Still, he had come here. Maybe this man was important to him. Maybe they were friends. \u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Nika.</p><p>Sibyl\u2019s voice cracked as if she hadn\u2019t used it in days. \u201cCain. My bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he sick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was wounded the night I was taken. The Sanguinar have done all they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra told me you can see the future. Don\u2019t you know what will happen?\u201d</p><p>Grief hung on her words, making them fade as they went on. \u201cNot to Cain. That\u2019s why I allowed him in my life. He was . . . quiet.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s weak legs began to shake with weakness now that she was no longer walking. She stepped forward and eased herself down on the bed, being careful not to touch the man lying there. She couldn\u2019t bear the touch of any man but Madoc.</p><p>\u201cHe was here earlier, checking on Cain,\u201d said Sibyl as if reading her mind. \u201cHe just left to go hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say when he\u2019d be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Briefly, Nika considered asking the seer when he\u2019d come home, but she pushed the notion away. Sibyl was clearly suffering, aching for the man lying on the bed.</p><p>Nika was going to have to answer the call of the sgath and go find Madoc for herself.</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d she asked the child.</p><p>\u201cNearly two weeks. He grows weaker every day. I cannot stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you should be able to stop it?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl shrugged, shifting the doll in her arms. The thing was still staring at Nika, and her stomach gave a twist. \u201cIf he were anyone else, I\u2019d know what to do, even if that was knowing it was time to let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s what he\u2019d want? For you to let go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCain was a fighter at heart. He couldn\u2019t bear to see me suffer. He\u2019s a good man.\u201d Tears wavered in Sibyl\u2019s eyes for a brief second before they disappeared.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to ask him?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl\u2019s head snapped up and for a second, Nika thought she saw the doll\u2019s eyes narrow. Another trick of her mind, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cHow would you do that?\u201d asked Sibyl.</p><p>Nika looked down at the prone man, seeing the power he had once wielded in his thick limbs and barrel chest. Even unconscious, he had an air of strength about him that dwarfed Nika\u2019s waking energy.</p><p>There were so many scary things out there, and they needed every warrior they could find to fight them. If there was a chance Nika could help, she had to try. \u201cI\u2019d just shed my body and go into his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>Nika nodded. \u201cI think so. Would you like me to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>For Cain, yes. For Nika . . . there was no way to be sure. Every time she left her body there was a chance she wouldn\u2019t make it back, but it was one she was willing to take. If her husk died, she\u2019d seek out Madoc and become part of him. She\u2019d never have to be away from him again, even if he didn\u2019t know she was there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>Sibyl\u2019s grip on the doll tightened and she gave a single nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>The little girl bit her lip as if she were going over a huge list, sorting out what was most important. \u201cTell him I need him.\u201d She swallowed and met Nika\u2019s gaze. Fear loomed in her bright eyes, making them shimmer with it. \u201cTell him I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, Nika realized that she had more in common with this child than she had with anyone else here, including her sister. It was a sad commentary on Nika\u2019s twisted life, perhaps, but all the same, she was going to do whatever she could to ease Sibyl\u2019s fears.</p><p>Nika lay down beside Cain, lining her body along his. She felt insubstantial next to him, like she could sink into the covers and no one would notice the loss.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Nika threaded her fingers through Cain\u2019s. Her stomach rebelled at the touch, but she swallowed until she was sure her food would stay where it belonged. If she was to get better, she had to learn to control herself. This was as good a place to start as any.</p><p>Nika closed her eyes and willed herself to slide through her arm and into Cain. It was frighteningly easy how readily her spirit left its shell, as if it ached for the chance to be rid of the weak sack of skin that imprisoned it.</p><p>She streaked through powerful muscle and solid bone until she could slide her spirit inside Cain\u2019s mind.</p><p>He was trapped inside a nightmare. Nika forgot why she was here in the face of so much blood and pain. She saw Cain fall under the blows of three different kinds of demons. His huge body flew across a room as if he was a rag doll. Blood coated the walls, dripping like gallons of paint. There was no way he could have lived through that, but apparently, he had. Or maybe that wasn\u2019t what had happened to him, but something his mind had made up to replay over and over inside his dreams.</p><p>The screams of a child echoed in his head, growing fainter with each passing second.</p><p>Sibyl!</p><p>The word resonated, shaking Nika\u2019s spirit with its ferocity.</p><p>He imagined what was happening to her. He saw her being torn to shreds by oily black claws. He saw the bloody muzzles of sgath as they fed on her entrails. He saw their powerful jaws rip her limbs from her body as they trotted off to clean the meat from her bones like dogs.</p><p>None of that had happened to Sibyl, but Cain didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d said Nika, hoping to calm the churning mass of images flashing through his head.</p><p>A powerful awareness sped toward her and she could hear his thoughts pounding against her fragile essence, threatening to shatter her. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNika. Sibyl sent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSibyl is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s with you now. Holding your hand. Can\u2019t you feel her?\u201d</p><p>Images of Sibyl\u2019s broken body and lifeless blue eyes welled up, pummeling Nika until they nearly drove her from his mind.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she ordered him, throwing as much force of will as she could into the command.</p><p>The images stopped, and Cain\u2019s mind quieted. A flicker of hope bloomed inside him, the color of spring leaves. The scent of rich, freshly tilled soil wafted around her, though she had no idea how she could see with no eyes or smell with no nose.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to give you a message. She needs you. She doesn\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d The word shimmered with emotion. Guilt, most of all. \u201cI\u2019ve left her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to her,\u201d said Nika. \u201cDon\u2019t leave her to suffer.\u201d</p><p>The landscape changed, and suddenly Cain was standing before her. Nika hadn\u2019t realized until then that she\u2019d constructed a physical shape for her consciousness. She looked like herself, or at least like she thought she should look. Her hair was dark here, and her body was strong and lithe, not thin and wasted.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNika.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stepped forward and the ground beneath her feet filled with soft grass, blooming with flowers. The air warmed and swayed around her ankles.</p><p>He\u2019d done that for her\u2014changed the setting so that she\u2019d be more comfortable. Nika could feel his inborn need to see to her comfort, though she had no idea why he would care.</p><p>\u201cNika,\u201d he repeated. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp you do what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet back to Sibyl. I don\u2019t know how to find her.\u201d</p><p>Nika nodded. \u201cTake my hand.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself for the touch, steeling herself against the grating sensation on her skin. But it didn\u2019t come. He took hold of her hand and it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d she told him. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure what she was doing, but her instincts were strong, so she listened to them. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Cain did, and Nika leapt up, pulling him with her. She led him out of the deeper parts of his mind, toward the surface. The farther they went, the harder it got, but Nika kept pulling.</p> <p>In the distance, she could see the shimmering surface of his consciousness, like she was looking up out of a swimming pool. She saw Sibyl seated beside Cain, and her own skeletal form lying next to him. Sibyl\u2019s doll was still watching her, as if it could see her spirit gliding through Cain\u2019s body.</p><p>Maybe it could.</p><p>Weariness dragged at her, like claws around her ankles, pulling her down. Nika gave a swift kick, and finally, Cain\u2019s head broke the surface.</p><p>She heard his gasp of breath, felt his powerful body shudder as he sucked in air. But there was none for her. Nika still had to find her way back into her own body, and it was a long trip.</p><p>As tired as she was, as fast as her strength was fading, she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to be able to make the whole journey.</p><p>At least she\u2019d wakened Cain and given him back to Sibyl.</p> <p>Madoc couldn\u2019t rid himself of the nagging need to go back to Cain. He\u2019d been there only a few minutes ago, but everything inside him was screaming for him to go back.</p><p>Maybe his buddy had taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>Grief grabbed Madoc by the throat and he fought to breathe as his heavy boot steps pounded through the halls. He remembered his love for his brother, even if he could no longer feel it coursing through him, strengthening him. All he felt now was fear that they\u2019d lose a great warrior.</p><p>He pushed open the door to Cain\u2019s new suite and went back through the dark living room to the bedroom. He wasn\u2019t a big fan of Sibyl\u2019s, but he\u2019d suffer through the creepy girl\u2019s cold stare long enough to check on his friend.</p><p>The first thing he saw was that Cain was awake. He was sitting up in bed and Sibyl\u2019s tiny arms were wrapped around his neck in a tight hug. The man hugged her back for only a second, before he gently pried her hands away.</p><p>The second thing he saw was the sick look of fear coating Cain\u2019s rough features. Since Madoc couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d seen Cain afraid, it freaked him out.</p><p>For good reason.</p><p>Nika was in his bed. Lying next to the fucker. She was icy white and unnaturally still, her left hand red and blistered.</p> <p>Rage crashed around inside Madoc, slamming into his ribs until he was sure they\u2019d crack. He couldn\u2019t lose her. He\u2019d fought so hard to free her from every sgath he could lay his hands on, and he sure as hell hadn\u2019t done it so she could die on him now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d His voice came out sharp and cold.</p><p>Cain\u2019s green eyes met Madoc\u2019s and went wide. He tried to speak, but nothing came out. The man had been unconscious for days and his throat was likely a tube of sandpaper.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cNika offered to help.\u201d She scrambled from the bed and fetched him a cup of water.</p><p>\u201cHelp? How? She\u2019s barely strong enough to stand up on her own.\u201d</p><p>Madoc went to Nika\u2019s side and pressed his fingers against her slender neck. A faint pulse beat below the paper-thin surface of her skin.</p><p>She was alive.</p><p>He wanted to feel relief, but all he felt was the need to pound his fists into Cain until she woke up.</p><p>Like that would help.</p><p>Madoc was afraid to touch her more than necessary. She was so frail. Breakable. But the urge to feel the warmth of her skin under his fingers was too much to resist. He smoothed her white hair away from her face, displaying the thin blue lines of the veins running along her temples.</p><p>\u201cShe brought me back,\u201d whispered Cain. His voice was shredded tatters of sound, but he got his point across. \u201cI felt her getting weaker. She pushed me up to the surface and sank back down. I tried to grab her, but she was already gone.\u201d</p><p>Gone.</p><p>The word echoed in Madoc\u2019s head like a gunshot blast.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Cain gave him an odd look, but slid from the bed, putting his body between Madoc and Sibyl as he led her from the room. He was weaving on his feet, barely able to stay standing but that was just too fucking bad. He deserved whatever he got for doing this to Nika.</p><p>The door shut behind them with a click, leaving him alone in the room with Nika.</p><p>Madoc wanted to gather her up in his arms, but he didn\u2019t dare. He was shaking so hard he\u2019d break her for sure.</p><p>\u201cNika. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a breath, but that was it.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Nika.\u201d His voice was too loud in the quiet room. Too hard. Still, he couldn\u2019t control it. He was too desperate to fix this. Make her better. Pack her away and keep her safe for eternity. \u201cWake the fuck up!\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and Madoc held his breath. Slowly, her eyes opened, revealing the blue of clear winter skies. So fucking pretty it broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou came back,\u201d she said on a weak puff of air.</p><p>\u201cNever left.\u201d Though he\u2019d been on his way out. The less he was around her, the better. He wanted her too much to keep resisting her, especially when he woke up with her draped over him, his own living, warm blanket.</p><p>\u201cIs Cain okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucker\u2019s fine. What the hell were you thinking, pulling a stunt like that? Getting in another man\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSibyl needed him.\u201d</p><p>Such a simple statement, but it said way too much about her for Madoc\u2019s peace of mind. Nika hadn\u2019t stopped to think what it would cost her to do whatever the fuck she\u2019d done. Sibyl needed Cain, so Nika woke him up.</p><p>Who else was going to need something that might get her killed?</p><p>Her bony fingers wrapped around his wrist and she pulled his arm to her chest. Her breasts were small, almost nonexistent, but he felt them all the same\u2014soft and warm against his forearm.</p><p>Blood pooled in his cock, making it swell and throb. He should not have been turned on by this stick figure of a girl, but he was. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t get her out of his head.</p><p>Maybe if he just took what she unknowingly offered and gave her one nice, hard ride, he\u2019d get her out of his system.</p><p>Yeah, and maybe he\u2019d kill her in the process, too. He wasn\u2019t a gentle man. If he fucked her, she\u2019d feel it. And then some.</p><p>She was so damn fragile. He had no business getting so close\u2014letting her touch him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever do that again, understand?\u201d</p><p>Nika didn\u2019t answer. She\u2019d fallen asleep, her breathing deep and even. It was a natural sleep. Poor girl had exhausted herself saving Cain.</p><p>Madoc owed her one for that. All the Theronai did. They needed every warrior they had, and Cain was one of the best.</p><p>And because Madoc owed her for her sacrifice, he worked his wrist out of her grip, turned and walked out of the room without looking back.</p><p>The farther away from her he stayed, the safer she\u2019d be. All she needed from him was the blood of a sgath on his blade, as much and as often as possible.</p><p>It was time to go hunting.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d asked Lexi. She was propped up in bed with a glass of juice. Both Zach and Joseph were staring at her as if they expected her to perform some kind of circus trick.</p><p>\u201cNow you tell us everything you know about these Defenders,\u201d said Joseph. She could tell by the rigid set of his shoulders and the cold glint in his hazel eyes that he still didn\u2019t trust her, no matter how much Logan vouched for her.</p><p>Fine. She didn\u2019t need his trust. As long as Zach believed her, that would have to be good enough.</p><p>Lexi let out a gusty sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot other than the fact that they want to get rid of all the Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dorjan,\u201d stated Joseph with a twisted sneer of loathing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are dorjan?\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s mouth was tight as he said, \u201cThey\u2019re humans who work for the Synestryn in exchange for something they want. Money, power, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shook her head. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like these guys. They know about the Synestryn, but they sure as hell don\u2019t work for them.\u201d</p><p>Joseph let out a snort of disbelief. \u201cWhy would they want to kill us unless they were working for the Synestryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you screw up their land with your battles. Nothing will ever grow again on land that has been bloodied by your war. They know they\u2019re not strong enough to fight your pets, so they figure that if you Sentinels go away, then the Synestryn will go, too and their land will be safe.\u201d</p><p>Both men looked at her like she needed to be fit for a straitjacket.</p><p>Zach recovered first. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that these Defenders actually believe the Synestryn will just leave if none of us are here to keep them in check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked from one man to the other, getting more and more uncomfortable by their silence. \u201cWhy? Are they wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead wrong,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cThey\u2019re not our pets. We can\u2019t control them. If we die off, there\u2019ll be nothing to stop the Synestryn from taking over this planet. They\u2019ll turn the whole thing into one giant set of cattle pens and bleed out every human for food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cWe really need to let the Defenders know how wrong they are.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cMen like that won\u2019t listen. We\u2019ve tried in the past with other groups. Usually, over time, they fall apart until someone comes across the ravings of a lunatic in his journal.\u201d</p><p>A journal like her mother\u2019s. Lexi winced as the stinging truth hit her. Her mother had been one of those lunatics and had raised Lexi to follow in her footsteps. Had she not seen it with her own eyes, she\u2019d still be sure these men were walking evil.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you know about them?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re led by a man named Hector Morrow. He lives north of Dallas. His daughter was killed years ago and he blames it on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cMy mom stayed with him sometimes when I was growing up. When we ran low on cash or she thought the monsters were on our trail. He\u2019d put us up and give Mom a job, and we\u2019d stick around for a couple of weeks\u2014just long enough to get back on the road.\u201d She omitted the part about the lessons Hector taught the kids in his sphere of influence. That man had caused her more nightmares with stories of his daughter\u2019s death than any real monster ever had. The one thing she\u2019d learned from him was that if she wasn\u2019t good, the monsters would find her and eat her. If she was bad, she\u2019d die screaming in pain, just like his daughter had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas he asked you to do anything else?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides blowing your compound to hell? No. Not that I remember.\u201d She looked from one man to the other. Joseph was across the room, lounging with one massive shoulder propped on the wall. Zach was sitting on the bed with her, his body between them. Lexi was pretty sure that wasn\u2019t an accident.</p><p>Zach clearly still didn\u2019t trust Joseph around her.</p><p>An odd sense of peace unfurled inside her. Zach was protecting her. No one had cared enough about her to protect her since her mother had died. It was nice to feel that again. Comforting.</p> <p>Lexi wasn\u2019t going to make him sorry for giving her that gift. She was going to step up and do whatever needed to be done to fix this. \u201cI need to go take care of the C-4, get it out of here so nothing bad can happen by accident.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting anywhere near those explosives, girl. I\u2019ve got a man taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who knows how to handle explosives?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a dark, mocking brow. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived centuries. I think we\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s relatively safe stuff so long as the detonators aren\u2019t connected. Which they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow were you going to trigger the device?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cTimer. I had ten minutes to get clear,\u201d said Lexi, feeling more and more guilty as she laid out their plans.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>Lexi shrugged, but her joints felt rusty and stiff. Whatever Logan had done to her wasn\u2019t wearing off fast. \u201cI guess I would have gone down with the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>Zach cursed, spitting out a violent word. Joseph merely stared at her. \u201cYou would have died? Willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my first choice, no, but I was tired of running. Tired of being afraid all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Zach took her hand and wrapped his around it, warming her chilled fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run anymore.\u201d</p><p>Lexi eyed Joseph. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, Zach. Looks like your fearless leader here would prefer if I hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d ordered Joseph. \u201cI want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now I\u2019m a prisoner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach\u2019s dark face hardened to a stony scowl as he turned to Joseph. \u201cShe\u2019s not, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her leaving the compound. I don\u2019t want her making any calls. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to call the Defenders and let them know you guys are the good guys.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph pushed away from the wall with a deceptively lazy shove. \u201cNot going to happen. Let them think we found you out and killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll only try again. Someone needs to convince them you guys aren\u2019t the monsters they think you are.\u201d</p><p>Joseph shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no reasoning with men like them. Let them try again. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s shoulders seemed to bow slightly as if a weight had settled atop them. \u201cThe only thing I can. Erase the threat.\u201d</p><p>Zach leapt from the bed so fast it looked like he\u2019d been launched from a catapult. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to kill them, do you?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhen they were merely a nuisance, getting in our way? No. But now?\u201d He shook his head in sorrow, but his eyes were rock hard. \u201cThey meant to kill us all. They meant to kill the children. And they\u2019ll try it again. I can\u2019t let that crime go unanswered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t retaliate, Joseph. They\u2019re human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let that matter. Not anymore. This was an act of war. I\u2019m going to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes went to Lexi and she felt a chill glide over her spine. There was no mercy inside that man. No compassion. \u201cI want a list of names. Every person you ever met who was connected to the Defenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give it to you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI won\u2019t help you kill them. They\u2019re wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t straighten this out. Bring them here, let them see what I have, and they\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. You will give me that list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll order Logan to take it from you,\u201d said Joseph as he turned to leave the room. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as comfortable for you, but it will be just as effective.\u201d</p><p>Lexi heard the door to her suite slam shut, making her jump.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like that,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cDoes he mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery single word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. This isn\u2019t like him. Give me a few minutes to check something and I\u2019ll be back, okay?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. \u201cSure. Whatever you need to do.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the side of her face in his big hand and Lexi leaned into the touch. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here when I get back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d She felt the weight of that promise slam down on her, pinning her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll be quick. Call my cell if you need me.\u201d</p><p>With that, he left. Lexi wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to go do, but she was fairly sure she didn\u2019t want any part of it.</p><p>When Zach found Drake, he was outside, helping Helen repair the broken section of wall. Helen knelt on the ground, both her slender hands on a stone the size of her head. Drake\u2019s fingers wrapped around her nape, clearly visible beneath the twin braids restraining her dark hair\u2014hair the same soft brown color as Lexi\u2019s now that it was no longer dyed.</p><p>Zach ached to go back to Lexi\u2019s side and comfort her, make sure she knew that her mistake was not an unforgivable one, but he couldn\u2019t do that yet. Not until he knew for certain that their leader was in his right mind.</p><p>A subtle hum of power vibrated in the air around Drake and Helen as she poured a stream of protective magic inside the stone, strengthening it against attack. Sweat beaded on her skin, and the back of her red shirt was dark and clinging to her spine.</p><p>Zach stopped in his tracks a few feet away and stared. He had his lady, his Lexi, but he didn\u2019t have what Drake did\u2014their unity, their connection.</p><p>Lexi said she trusted him, but she had yet to trust him enough to allow them to become close enough to fulfill their purpose. She hadn\u2019t even trusted him enough to let him see her thoughts or know her feelings. Even after Logan had broken through, when Zach reached out for Lexi, all he felt was a cold, hard wall. There was no living warmth, no welcome.</p><p>Maybe her upbringing had scarred her, and they\u2019d never have what Drake and Helen did.</p><p>As a spike of grief rose up in him, Zach shoved it away. He refused to let it stand like that. They would have a full life. They both deserved it, especially Lexi, after all she\u2019d suffered. She deserved a home, a family and Zach wanted to be that for her. Always.</p><p>He loved her too much not to fight for what he knew they could have together. She was everything he\u2019d ever wanted, and he was going to do whatever it took to make her happy.</p><p>All he had to do was give her the time to come to trust him, to show her each day that he was worthy of that gift. Eventually, he\u2019d break through that stubborn skull of hers and see what he saw. They belonged together.</p><p>But before he could go back to her and get to work on those plans, he had a job to do. He kicked his ass in gear and went to Drake. \u201cGot a sec?\u201d</p><p>Drake must have seen something in Zach\u2019s expression because the look of pride and adoration he wore when watching Helen dropped, and all that was left was his serious game face. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he told Helen. \u201cJust stay here and rest a minute.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and curled up on her side in the grass, heedless of dirt and bugs. Apparently, rebuilding this wall was taking its toll. Even Gilda was nowhere to be seen, and she was the strongest Theronai in the compound.</p><p>Angus worked alone on the far side of the construction zone, hauling rock with brute strength. The only thing that would have kept Gilda from his side was sheer exhaustion.</p><p>Good. That meant Angus could lend a hand, too. They were going to need all the help they could get.</p><p>Zach led Drake in that direction. When Angus saw them approach, he set the rock down, brushed off his hands and came to meet the pair.</p><p>\u201cIs something amiss?\u201d Angus asked in a rough voice.</p><p>Zach did a quick scan to make sure no one else was nearby and said, \u201cYeah. I think we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>He did a quick recap of what went down with Lexi and Joseph, making sure they both knew about her treachery. The story would get out soon enough, and it was better if it came from him than the rumor mill.</p><p>\u201cHe actually said he was going to kill the Defenders?\u201d asked Drake in stark disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zach. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Joseph may have run out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lifemark,\u201d guessed Angus, rubbing a hand over his craggy face. \u201cYou think it\u2019s bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would explain the way he was acting with Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Drake sighed, his eyes dark with grief. \u201cWe have to find out. And I need to tell Helen what\u2019s going on with Lexi. Give me two minutes to explain things to her and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Drake walked away calmly, like he had all the time in the world. Anyone watching would never guess what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWe could ask Nicholas to check with his electronic eyes,\u201d Zach told Angus, \u201cor we could do the job ourselves. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Angus suddenly looked older, more worn down. The passage of centuries had been good to him, leaving behind a few lines and even more gray hair, but from one second to the next, Angus began to look like an old man. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it now. Keep it quiet. If we have to send him to the Slayers, then I want it done tonight, before anyone knows.\u201d</p><p>Send him to the Slayers. The old laws demanded that they put down any Theronai who had lost his soul. They could be evil, dangerous. Since the Slayers were the oldest Sentinel race, they were the ones who carried out the law they\u2019d created. With brutal expediency.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that their races were enmeshed in a stagnant war. It didn\u2019t matter that the Slayers had bred with humans to the point that they were no longer the fearsome creatures they had once been. All that mattered was that they\u2019d carry out the law.</p><p>If Joseph\u2019s tree was leafless, the Slayers would execute him.</p><p>Helen\u2019s legs shook as she raced down the halls toward Lexi\u2019s new suite, and not just because she was physically exhausted.</p><p>Lexi had been planning to kill them. Her family. Her husband.</p><p>Helen still had trouble believing it. How could she have been so wrong about the woman she\u2019d thought of as her friend?</p><p>She knocked on Lexi\u2019s door and when it opened, Lexi stood there with her nose red and her eyes bright. She\u2019d been crying, and not sweet little girly tears, either. From the size of the wad of soggy tissue in her hand, they\u2019d been big fat sloppy tears of remorse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All Helen\u2019s thoughts that she\u2019d been wrong about Lexi dissipated. Whatever choices Lexi had made since they parted ways, she was regretting them now. There wasn\u2019t a single question in Helen\u2019s mind.</p><p>The need to comfort her rose up inside Helen and she wrapped her arms around the smaller woman, holding her tight.</p><p>Lexi sniffed, her voice muffled against Helen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey told you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded against Lexi\u2019s head. Her hair was darker now, softer. No more blinding blond spikes, but it was a good look for her, even if it did make her appear more vulnerable, more human.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is going to be fine,\u201d said Helen.</p><p>Lexi pulled out of the hug and Helen grudgingly let her go. She shut the front door. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. The way Zach left here in such a rush, I\u2019m sure everything is not fine. Something\u2019s going on, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down. Have some tea. We shouldn\u2019t have to face all of this without a few basic comforts, right?\u201d It was a stall tactic and Helen knew it; she just wasn\u2019t ready to get to the hard stuff yet. As sad as it was, even though they\u2019d only known each other a few months, Lexi was Helen\u2019s closest friend, not counting Drake. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was such a poor judge of character that she\u2019d befriend someone who was willing to kill innocents.</p><p>Lexi moved quietly in her kitchen, fumbling around to locate things in the new space. Her movements were jerky, and her fingers trembled as she pitched the tissues and washed her hands.</p><p>\u201cI was going to rescue you,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cI was sure you\u2019d been brainwashed into believing these were the good guys. Guess I was the one with the sudsy brain all along, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame you for acting in line with what you thought was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d Regret made Lexi\u2019s words come out faint and hard to hear.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about Drake, too, at first. This whole world is pretty surreal, and it takes some getting used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d Lexi asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>Lexi put two mugs of water in the microwave, giving Helen a somber glance over her shoulder. \u201cI was going to kill Drake. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>Helen nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She couldn\u2019t even think about losing Drake. He was part of her. If anything happened to him, she was sure it would end her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still don\u2019t hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You never would have gone through with it,\u201d said Helen.</p><p>\u201cI would have. If it hadn\u2019t been for Zach and the way he treated me, I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing his luceria. That\u2019s a long step away from hating someone enough to kill them.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to die. If wearing this thing keeps him alive, then I\u2019ll wear it. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the magic part is pretty cool, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi had kept her back to Helen this whole time, so Helen took her arm and urged her to turn around. A bright flush of embarrassment made Lexi\u2019s face as red as her nose.</p><p>In a gentle voice, Helen asked, \u201cWhat do you mean it doesn\u2019t work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m broken.\u201d She tugged at the luceria, which pulsated in vivid greens and blues. \u201cThis thing doesn\u2019t work on me the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time. It took me a while to get the hang of using fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Zach told me you\u2019re a regular Firestarter. Hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, too. I guess I never thought I\u2019d love someone more than I feared fire, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you love him?\u201d asked Lexi. Her dark eyes dropped to the floor like she couldn\u2019t stand to look at Helen.</p><p>\u201cI do. So much.\u201d</p><p>After a brief silence, Lexi said, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Helen. I really am.\u201d</p><p>The microwave pinged, giving Lexi an excuse to turn her attention elsewhere.</p><p>Helen wasn\u2019t letting her off the hook quite so easily.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that if my fear of fire prevented me from using it, maybe you\u2019ve got some fears of your own to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Lexi snorted and dropped tea bags into the mugs. \u201cToo many to count. Guess that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you sound so calm? So confident? We don\u2019t even know each other. Not really. And you just found out I was trying to kill the man you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t your idea. You\u2019re not the violent type.\u201d</p><p>Lexi carried the steaming mugs into the living room. \u201cHave you forgotten that whole episode at Gertie\u2019s Diner? I stabbed Zach. That\u2019s pretty violent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was being too forceful. He deserved a reminder that he can\u2019t manhandle women that way.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shook her head, giving Helen a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hold a grudge, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The man is relentless. I have no idea why he keeps forgiving me for every shitty thing I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs you, Lexi. We all do. If we have to overlook a few mistakes, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call what I\u2019ve done a mistake. It\u2019s bigger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling guilty. Good. You should, but we have to move on. We\u2019re . . . desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow desperate?\u201d</p><p>Helen wasn\u2019t sure how much she should tell Lexi. It was obvious she was still getting used to this new life, and Helen knew from experience how difficult and enjoyable the transition could be. But if Lexi wasn\u2019t ready to commit herself to the fight yet, she didn\u2019t want to scare her away. They needed her too much.</p><p>Helen settled for, \u201cDesperate enough that Zach and the rest of the Theronai will be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. You aren\u2019t the only one here who had the wrong impression about the Sentinels and what they do. Besides, we need all the help we can get.\u201d That last part came out in an almost breathless string of exhaustion, despite Helen\u2019s best efforts to stay strong.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s expression hardened and angry sparks lit her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working you too hard, haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working me too hard. It\u2019s my choice. We\u2019ve got to get that wall up. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImportant enough that you\u2019re killing yourself to make it happen?\u201d</p><p>Helen waved a dismissive hand, but her arm was too heavy to pull off the kind of nonchalance she\u2019d been going for. \u201cStop being melodramatic. I\u2019m not killing myself.\u201d But it was a close thing. She couldn\u2019t get enough sleep to drive away the weariness that pulled at her. Every day, she woke up more tired than the one before. If something didn\u2019t happen soon, she was going to make herself sick, maybe burn out.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you take a break?\u201d asked Lexi.</p><p>\u201cNot really. The days are getting shorter, the nights longer, which means there\u2019s a better chance of attack every day. The wall is the only thing keeping the Synestryn out. We\u2019ve already had to fight back two attempts to break through just in the last week. It\u2019s just going to get worse as winter approaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. We need all we can get right now. There are a lot of people here that depend on us, a lot of kids that have nowhere else to go. If this place falls . . .\u201d</p><p>Lexi held up her hands to ward off anything else Helen had to say. \u201cI get it. This place can\u2019t fall.\u201d She sucked in a long breath and let it out slowly. \u201cOkay, just tell me what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we need to get rid of whatever\u2019s in the way\u2014whatever\u2019s keeping you from using Zach\u2019s power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the problem is on my end?\u201d</p><p>Having been where Lexi was, she was certain of it, but instead, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. It\u2019s as good a place to start as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m game. I\u2019ve got a lot to make up for. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Helen was no expert, but she had a few ideas of what might be wrong and even more ideas how they could fix it. Lexi was going to enjoy at least a handful of them, and Zach was going to enjoy even more.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Zach approached Joseph\u2019s office with a heavy heart. He prayed he was wrong, that Joseph\u2019s soul was still healthy, but he couldn\u2019t think of any other reason why his brother would turn away from his chosen path so far he\u2019d be willing to kill the Defenders.</p><p>With Angus on one side, and Drake on the other, they made a formidable trio as they went into Joseph\u2019s office without knocking. If this confrontation got ugly, they were going to need at least this much manpower to subdue the man they\u2019d chosen to lead them.</p><p>Joseph looked up from his desk with bleary eyes. His hair was messy and the growing number of grays at his temples sparkled under the bright lamp. Papers cluttered the place and maps were pinned up on three walls. Centered in front of him was a stack of photos. Zach couldn\u2019t make them out because of the glare across their glossy surfaces, but he had more important things to worry about.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asked Joseph. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re here for a social call.\u201d</p><p>Best to just get on with it. \u201cShow us your chest,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>Joseph stiffened and stood to his full, towering height. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d he asked in a low, cold voice.</p><p>\u201cI think your lifemark is bare. I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve turned your back on the humans.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s jaw bunched three times before he was able to get the words out. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on anyone. Who the fuck do you think I\u2019m trying to protect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were willing to kill the Defenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. But only because I know it will save lives in the long run.\u201d Joseph looked at Drake, then Angus. \u201cDid he tell you everything? Did he tell you that Lexi was planning to massacre us? That she was working for these Defenders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi is not the point,\u201d said Zach.</p><p>\u201cHe told us,\u201d said Angus, his voice as calm and even as a still pond. \u201cThe girl was mixed up. My bet is these Defenders are, too. We can\u2019t go out and slaughter every group who has it in for us. Not that much time in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I suggested that? No. I haven\u2019t. And before you go asking for a strip search, take a look at these.\u201d He picked up the photos and tossed them across the desk.</p><p>Rubble. Tons of it. Broken walls, shattered floors, splintered roofing. Concrete was crushed like someone had dropped an asteroid on whatever building this had once been.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cOur African stronghold. Or at least what\u2019s left of it,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>Zach flipped through the photos until he saw the rows of bloody, broken bodies laid out. Dozens of them. Dozens of children, their dark eyes frozen in death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angus looked up, but Zach couldn\u2019t pull his eyes away from the photos. \u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefenders\u2014or their African equivalent\u2014managed to sneak a man inside. He used explosives like Lexi had planned to do. He tore the place apart in the middle of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there Sanguinar there?\u201d asked Zach, feeling a sick sense of dread roll through his gut. The Sanguinar were cursed by the Solarc to always dwell in darkness. If any of them dared let the sun touch their skin, it would have summoned the Solarc\u2019s warriors into this world, and if that happened, those warriors\u2014the Wardens\u2014would kill anyone in their path.</p><p>Joseph nodded, confirming Zach\u2019s fears. \u201cThe Wardens came and killed anyone who hadn\u2019t died in the explosion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d asked Drake.</p><p>\u201cForty-three Sentinels. Three hundred seventeen humans, most of them children. Twelve people survived. Twelve fucking people. And they made it only because they weren\u2019t there. They were on their way here to see if Nika is compatible with them.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable. Even seeing the photos, Zach had a hard time accepting it as truth.</p><p>\u201cSo, when I say I\u2019m willing to take out these Defenders\u2014men who are planning to do that to the people under my roof, under my protection\u2014I\u2019m not doing it because I have no soul. I\u2019m doing it because I have no choice.\u201d And to prove it, Joseph ripped his shirt open, sending buttons flying off to hit the walls. He stood there, baring his muscular chest, displaying a small, but healthy set of leaves still clinging to his lifemark. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d he asked, but it came out as more of a challenge.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t. Not by a long shot. Things had taken a turn for the worse, and nothing about it satisfied him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d asked Angus, still as calm as if they were talking about the best way to clean their swords.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to use Lexi to lure them out of hiding, and I\u2019m going to make sure they never have a chance to do something like this to one of my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t help you kill them.\u201d Zach knew in his heart it was true. She\u2019d grown up with these people, and no matter how wrong they were, Lexi wasn\u2019t going to help Joseph take them down.</p><p>\u201cYes. She will.\u201d His voice rang with absolute authority.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d asked Drake, voicing the question Zach couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to give her a choice. I suggest you start trying to convince her now. It will save Logan the trouble of sucking the information out of her later.\u201d</p> <p>A dangerous, lethal anger rose up inside Zach. He was already launching himself at Joseph when Drake and Angus grabbed his arms to restrain him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her,\u201d growled Zach, barely recognizing his own voice.</p><p>\u201cLogan won\u2019t hurt her. He\u2019ll make her feel good.\u201d</p><p>And he would, too. Logan could make her come just staring into her eyes if he wanted.</p><p>A red haze flowed over Zach\u2019s vision and his muscles tensed, aching to slam his fists into Joseph\u2019s jaw. Joseph couldn\u2019t order Logan to so much as touch her if he couldn\u2019t talk.</p><p>He lunged at Joseph again, but the men at his side held him back.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d said Drake.</p><p>Angus gave a grunt of acknowledgment, and they lifted him and carried Zach back out of the room. Zach fought against their hold, but they were fast and strong as hell, and they got him out the door in two seconds.</p><p>He landed a solid blow to Drake\u2019s ribs and found himself slammed up against the hallway wall, pinned there by four hard hands. His feet barely touched the ground, giving him no leverage.</p> <p>Zach\u2019s breath sawed in and out of his lungs, making them burn with fury. He should have come here on his own. He would have taken Joseph down and no one could have stopped him.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d barked Drake, getting right into Zach\u2019s face. His buddy\u2019s tone cut through the fog and helped him regain enough sanity to stop trying to bash his ribs in.</p><p>Zach shoved hard at his anger, trying to push it away, but all he could think about was Logan\u2019s mouth on his woman\u2019s neck, taking her lifeblood from her, draining her, making her come. \u201cI\u2019m not letting Logan near her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d soothed Angus. \u201cYou\u2019re going to march your ass back to her suite and you\u2019re going to convince her to play nice so Logan won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief shocked the air from Zach\u2019s chest. \u201cYou agree with Joseph? You think we should kill these men?\u201d</p><p>Angus was quiet for a moment as if collecting his words. \u201cI won\u2019t let Gilda or Sibyl end up like one of the bodies in those pictures, lying in the mud. As soon as those Defenders started making plans to kill my family, they gave up their right to keep breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Lexi?\u201d demanded Zach. \u201cShe helped them make plans, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is she\u2019s no longer a threat,\u201d said Angus. \u201cThose men out there are. I won\u2019t let that stand. One way or another.\u201d</p><p>None of this sat right with Zach. He preferred the black and white world where he knew exactly what to do. All these shades of gray pissed him off. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that if they\u2019re no longer a threat, you\u2019ll let them live?\u201d</p><p>Angus\u2019s blue eyes pinned Zach in place. They burned with a kind of wisdom only centuries of pain and heartache could ignite. Zach had nothing but respect for this man who had trained him to be the warrior he had become. All that training kicked in, waking up the reflex where Angus talked and Zach listened.</p><p>In a tone so full of calm reason Zach had no choice but to agree, Angus said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that the only person who can save their sorry asses is Lexi. Get her to cooperate. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and find a way to keep the rednecks breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot,\u201d agreed Drake.</p><p>Of course he was right. Angus always was.</p><p>All that anger Zach had built up deflated, making him feel tired. \u201cGreat. Now all I have to do is figure out how to get her to spill her guts when she thinks we\u2019re going to use that information to kill the people that sheltered her and her mother when they hit hard times. No sweat.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t entirely convinced that Helen knew what she was talking about\u2014how to break down the barrier between her and Zach\u2014but her suggestions were more than a little intriguing. They all involved a lot of touching and bare skin, and just the thought was enough to make Lexi\u2019s heart beat a little harder in anticipation.</p><p>Helen had left a few minutes ago, and now that the place was quiet, Lexi was left alone with her thoughts. Her fears.</p><p>What if she couldn\u2019t do what these people needed her to do? What if she couldn\u2019t be like Helen?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a question of whether or not it was what she wanted. Not anymore. She owed these people for her treachery, and she would find a way to make it up to them. But more important, she owed the Defenders for all the times they\u2019d sheltered her and her mother. She couldn\u2019t just walk away from them without at least trying to fix this mess.</p><p>There had to be a way to get those good ol\u2019 boys to see things the way she did now. And maybe, if she could access all that power inside of Zach, she could find it. All she had to do was let them see what she\u2019d seen, like some kind of mental slide show. She was convinced that if she did that, they\u2019d come around and everyone could live happily ever after.</p><p>Yeah, right. Even she was smart enough to know the chances of that were slim. Still, that didn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t try.</p><p>But first, she had to get through her own damn stubbornness and tap into all of Zach\u2019s strength so she had a fighting chance. From what Helen had said, it was like swimming in sunlight, all warm and happy.</p><p>Lexi needed a good dose of happy right now.</p><p>She curled up on the couch, tucking her legs under her, and watched the door. It wasn\u2019t locked. She wasn\u2019t sure if Zach had a key, and wanted him to be able to get in if she fell asleep. Which was a real possibility.</p><p>Logan had taken enough blood to leave her feeling light-headed if she stood too fast. She hoped that chugging down liquids would help her recover faster, but what she needed was about twelve hours of hard sleep. Maybe later, after the lives of so many people weren\u2019t resting on her shoulders, she\u2019d get it.</p><p>While she waited, Lexi tried to reach out to Zach through the luceria like Helen had taught her. There was supposed to be a connection between them that held them together even when they weren\u2019t near each other.</p><p>She closed her eyes and focused on the ring of skin where the band touched her, searching for that connection.</p><p>It was warm, as if it had its own living heat, and she could feel the slightest humming coming from the thing every once in a while. She imagined a silvery wire joining her and Zach. All she had to do now was get a signal to travel through it.</p><p>Lexi tried pushing a thought through the connection, telling Zach to hurry back to her. Nothing happened. It was like trying to push a rope uphill.</p><p>So, maybe she should try pulling.</p><p>With her eyes shut, and the silver wire firmly in her mind, Lexi pulled. At first, she didn\u2019t think it had worked, but then she felt an odd tingle encircle her neck and slide down her spine. She sucked in a breath and held it.</p><p>She pulled harder, and in her mind, she made the wire grow thicker.</p><p>Rage slammed into her, driving a bellow from her lungs.</p><p>Zach was pissed. She could feel it as clearly as if it had been her own fury pounding through her. In fact, it took her a few seconds to separate the two feelings so she didn\u2019t start trashing her new place to vent out some of the feral emotion.</p><p>Even though she\u2019d separated it in her mind, she was still shaking with the force of it, aching to go to him and beat the hell out of whatever had pissed him off.</p><p>She found herself pacing, stalking across the carpet in an effort to burn off some of the rage. Sure, she could have pulled back so she didn\u2019t feel it anymore, but she wanted to feel it. It meant she\u2019d succeeded. Like an infant that craved new sensations, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from pulling harder, seeking out more.</p><p>Slowly, the anger faded and in its place was bleak acceptance. Resignation.</p><p>Whatever was going on, it was over now. The tingle of his bloodmark on her back told her he was getting closer. Coming back to her.</p><p>The need to comfort him was strong, growing stronger with every step he took. There was a deep sadness weeping inside him, shedding tears he\u2019d never let fall. And surrounding all that vulnerability was a fierce need to keep her safe.</p><p>From what, she had no idea, but she was glad she\u2019d managed to make this small connection to him, glad she knew without a doubt that he would do everything in his power to see to her safety.</p><p>It was humbling to feel the force of his need to protect her. Humbling and empowering. She felt like she could walk off a cliff and not worry. Zach would catch her.</p><p>He opened the door and locked it behind him. His body was tense, the muscles of his arms and shoulders bunched up with tightly held control.</p><p>Lexi stared at him, soaking him up. He was such a potent man, filling up the entryway with his power. His feet were braced apart, and he had the oddest look on his face. His smooth brown skin was stretched in a grimace, as if he was really dreading what he had to do now. But his pale eyes glowed with confidence, reassuring her that all would be well. He wouldn\u2019t let her fall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi went to him, needing to soothe him, wanting to touch him. Dying to try some of the things Helen had told her about.</p><p>She ran her hands over his muscled chest and locked her fingers around the back of his neck.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes fell shut and he pulled in a deep breath. It pressed the two of them closer, flattening her breasts against his ribs. Lexi felt her nipples bead up under the thin lace of her bra.</p><p>So did Zach.</p> <p>He let out a nearly inaudible growl of need and grasped her hips in his big hands. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWe will. After.\u201d</p><p>Helen said that making the connection with Zach would be easier during sex. Intimacy and trust helped loosen up the flow of power or something. Lexi didn\u2019t really understand it, but she was ready to put Helen\u2019s lesson to good use.</p><p>She went up on tiptoe, and pulled Zach down so she could kiss him. The first brush of his lips against hers pulled a moan of pleasure from her body, but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough. She needed to taste him, to feel the slide of his tongue against hers.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t make her wait. He bent his head lower and deepened the kiss, parting her lips so she could taste his heat, his need for her. Like a starving man, he fed from her mouth, holding her tight so she could feel the restrained strength vibrating in his arms.</p> <p>When she was breathless, he pulled back just enough to look down at her. Desire lit his eyes, making them a luminous green. She hadn\u2019t let go of that silver wire and through it, a single pulse of physical need throbbed between them. She hadn\u2019t even needed to concentrate. It just happened.</p><p>It was working.</p><p>She licked her lips and gave him a victorious smile.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes zeroed in on her mouth and she saw his pupils widen, felt his grip on her body tighten. \u201cBed,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore I forget to use one.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded and Zach lifted her up until she was straddling his hips. She felt the thick heat of his erection against her, rubbing her through her jeans. As he carried her back to the bedroom, every step sent a jolt of sensation streaking through her, making her body tighten.</p><p>Zach laid her down and unbuckled his sword belt. The sword flickered into visibility, glowing in the light from the hall. He hadn\u2019t bothered to switch on the light in the bedroom, and she briefly considered turning the lamp on, until he stripped his shirt off over his head.</p> <p>Then Lexi wasn\u2019t thinking about anything at all other than the beauty of his chest, the breadth of his shoulders, the shadowed ridges of his stomach. The tree on his chest swayed slightly and Lexi climbed to her knees on the bed. She pressed her hands against his hot flesh, loving the smooth, hard contours of his body. She couldn\u2019t get enough. She could spend a year touching him and it still wouldn\u2019t quench her need to feel his skin under her palms.</p><p>Zach stood there, rigid and still, while she touched him, running her finger over the intricate branches, down the thick trunk until his jeans barred her path.</p><p>She looked up at him while her fingers made quick work of the button and zipper. His ribs expanded and contracted as if he\u2019d just finished a long run. A gleam of perspiration shone along his forehead, and his jaw was clenched tight.</p><p>Lexi pressed a kiss over his navel, swirling her tongue against his skin. His stomach muscles bunched and a dark smile of feminine satisfaction stretched her mouth.</p><p>He was all man, and he was all hers.</p><p>Working the snug jeans down over his lean hips was harder than it would have been without his heavy erection taking up so much room, but she didn\u2019t mind the extra effort. It was more than worth the trouble. She didn\u2019t stop to help him out of his boots. She couldn\u2019t wait that long to get what she wanted.</p><p>Lexi wrapped her fingers around his penis, reveling in the smooth hardness of his body, the contrast of her paler skin against the light brown of his. Even in the dimness, it was easy to see her hand sliding over him. And even if she\u2019d been blind, as soon as she heard his low groan of enjoyment, she would have known she\u2019d done it just right.</p><p>Concentration was difficult, but Lexi was determined to make this work. She found that silver wire that lay there, forgotten in her mind, and gave it a hard tug.</p> <p>A wave of raw lust filled her up, making her suck in a harsh breath. His lust, pure and potent, so ferocious she had no idea how he could stand it. Lexi\u2019s head fell to his abdomen and she shut her eyes, trying to find enough sanity to remember what she\u2019d been doing. It was important. She\u2019d had some kind of plan; she just wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</p><p>She smelled the male heat of his skin, the muskiness of his need for her. Inside her tight grip, Zach\u2019s erection throbbed, making her go liquid. The silver wire between them shimmered.</p><p>Power. She was trying to reach Zach\u2019s power. Sex helped. Intimacy helped even more.</p><p>Right. Lexi remembered now. She could do this. In fact, she\u2019d never wanted to do anything more in her life as much as she wanted this.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Not part of her plan. Lexi shook her head, letting her hair brush over his hip. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She felt his aggression swell and knew she was about to lose control over her carefully choreographed plan. Before he could take over, Lexi took his erection into her mouth, letting him sink deep.</p><p>Zach hissed in pleasure, and his whole body clenched tight. His palms cradled her head, his fingers sliding convulsively over her scalp.</p><p>She eased back, letting him slide almost free. Her mouth watered as she swirled her tongue over him, drawing a gasp from his powerful body. He tasted good. Hot, male\u2014an intoxicating combination of need and hunger only she could fulfill.</p><p>Her own body ached, but what she wanted was more important than pleasure. She wanted hope, the promise of being what Zach needed most. A partner.</p><p>The luceria vibrated around her throat, heating more with every stroke of her lips and tongue over his hard flesh. She could feel something beautiful hovering just beyond reach, only a hairbreadth away. That something shimmered and pulsed, flooding her vision with color and light. Beautiful jade green, like Zach\u2019s eyes, so full of promise she could almost taste it.</p><p>Lexi reached for it, struggling to stay focused.</p><p>Her head spun, and the rich taste of Zach\u2019s body disappeared. She heard a tearing sound. Cool air assaulted her skin and when she opened her eyes to figure out what had gone wrong, she found herself on her back, her shirt ripped open down the front, Zach\u2019s frantic fingers undoing her jeans.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t at all what she had planned.</p><p>\u201cZach, wait,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stilled and looked at her, his face tight with unsated lust. She saw his mouth work as if he were trying to find words, but none came out. Instead, she felt the luceria tremble; then she was filled with a rush of desire so jagged and hard it ripped through her, making her cry out against the force of it.</p><p>Her body shuddered, and her eyes rolled back in her head. Pure, raw pleasure streaked through her body, pooling in her womb, pushing her to the edge of orgasm. She wasn\u2019t big enough to hold so much sensation. It didn\u2019t give her any room to breathe.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Before she had time to adjust to so much feeling, Zach gave her more. She felt it stretch their connection, making the luceria heat under the strain. And then all thoughts of plans and connections were driven from her mind as a bubble of pleasure burst inside her, making her come.</p><p>She rode the waves of sensation, letting them drag her along, taking them where they pleased. She thought the power might tear her apart, but instead, it cradled her and eased her back down to reality when it was through buffeting her about.</p><p>Her eyelids were heavy, but she forced them open. Zach was poised above her, supporting his weight so that his arms bulged with muscles. She felt the head of his erection press against her core and she was so slick and soft he slid in easily. Her body stretched to accept him without complaint. In fact, every inch of ground he gained made her loose limbs coil with a new stirring of desire.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s breath still hadn\u2019t evened out from her orgasm, and already, he was driving her toward another. If she didn\u2019t act fast, she was going to lose her opportunity to strengthen their bond.</p><p>Zach moved inside her, seating himself deep. She could feel his heartbeat throbbing in his erection, see it pounding in the vein along his neck. His eyes were open, a sexy, slumberous green, watching her. She saw his throat work as if he were trying to speak; then in the midst of all his churning lust, she felt a subtle flutter of concern slide into her.</p><p>He was worried about her.</p><p>She offered him what she hoped was an encouraging smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Better than fine.\u201d</p><p>He gave a satisfied nod and closed his eyes in relief. Without further hesitation, his powerful muscles bunched and flexed as he set a steady rhythm.</p><p>Lexi ground her teeth, trying to stay focused on her task, but it was nearly impossible. His need for her was flowing into her like water, his body filling her up, driving her higher. She couldn\u2019t concentrate or remember what Helen had told her to do. Not anymore. There was too much feeling inside her to leave her any room to think.</p><p>Defeated, but in the sweetest way imaginable, Lexi gave in and let go. She drove her fingers through Zach\u2019s silky hair and pulled his head to her. She kissed his mouth, his jaw, down his neck. Every touch of her lips to his skin was rewarded with a deep sound of pleasure. Every flick of her tongue filled her up with his intoxicating taste.</p><p>Her man. All hers.</p><p>Zach cupped her breast, pinching her nipple between two fingers. Erotic currents streaked through her body, making her arch her hips into his thrusts.</p><p>Her body trembled, weak from stress and blood loss, but Lexi ignored the tremors. Zach\u2019s body tightened and he sped the pace, shifting so every stroke hit just the right spots. Her world spiraled down to the minute space between their straining bodies and the sizzling jolts of electricity that arced between them.</p><p>A deep rumble shook Zach\u2019s chest, resonating inside Lexi. He wrapped his arm around her hips, held her still and thrust deep and hard inside her. She felt his erection swell and pulse, felt the heat of his release fill her as tiny sparks danced along her limbs.</p><p>It was too much. She couldn\u2019t take any more sensation. All that coiled tension sprung free and ricocheted inside her body as the climax tore through her.</p><p>Light danced in her vision and she felt the warmth of sunlight engulf her, sweeping her away.</p><p>Minutes later, though she had no idea how many, she found enough strength to open her eyes. Zach was draped over her, his breathing slowing. Sweat cooled her body where currents of air touched her. Everywhere else she was warm and utterly content.</p><p>Zach seemed to be in no hurry to move, and she liked him there. He was careful with his weight so he didn\u2019t crush her, but solid enough she felt protected beneath him. Her hip joints had been pushed to their limits, making room for his big body between her thighs, but even that ache was a pleasant one.</p><p>Her head still spun, but it had cleared enough for her to remember the goal of her seduction, such as it was. Zach hadn\u2019t exactly made it a challenge.</p><p>The notion that he was so easy, that he wanted her so much, made her smile.</p><p>In the dim quiet of the room, their bodies sated and happy, Lexi reached out, struggling to access Zach\u2019s power. So far, she\u2019d figured out how to pull feelings from him, but she hadn\u2019t been able to send them back, nor had she been able to find that ribbon of energy Helen described. It was as if the connection between them was broken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or maybe it was just different.</p><p>A thin film, like the skin of a bubble, hovered between them. Lexi poked at it, expecting it to pop, but it held firm. She pushed harder and still nothing happened.</p><p>Zach levered his body up on one elbow. His face was bright with excitement. \u201cI felt that . . . pressure. Try it again.\u201d</p><p>Lexi did. She shoved at the barrier until it made her dizzy, but didn\u2019t break through.</p> <p>Exhausted, she let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Zach smoothed her hair back from her damp forehead and gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019ll come. You just need some rest. And maybe some more practice.\u201d</p><p>He was still semihard inside her, the \u201csemi\u201d part quickly becoming a memory. But, rather than take advantage, Zach pulled out of her and stretched out along her flank. He pulled the sheet up over her damp body and ran his finger along the luceria. His eyes darkened as he watched the play of his finger as if the sight turned him on. Maybe it did.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d His voice rang with complete confidence. \u201cBut for now, you need to rebuild your strength. Make some new blood. Fucking bloodsucking bastard.\u201d A scowl wrinkled his dark brow.</p> <p>Lexi soothed it away with her thumb. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll over and let me pet you.\u201d His voice was gruff, but Lexi didn\u2019t mind. She sensed that he simply didn\u2019t want her watching emotions play over his face. Whether he felt vulnerable, or whether he just didn\u2019t want her to worry, she wasn\u2019t sure, but she humored him and rolled onto her stomach.</p><p>Zach\u2019s wide, warm hand slid along her spine, pushing the sheet away as he went. The chill of cool air didn\u2019t touch her, though. Not with Zach at her back, throwing off heat like a furnace.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of him stroking her. Tiny sparks jumped into her skin, but she was getting used to that now, and they were almost like a mini massage.</p><p>He traced his finger over her leopard tattoo, following the sinuous curves of vines surrounding the animal.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cTo keep you from finding me. Mom was convinced my birthmark would draw the monsters to me, so she used to cover it with makeup. When I was older, I got inked.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved down to the base of her spine where the filigree swirls she\u2019d fallen in love with at fifteen lay embedded in her skin. She felt him shift, moving his body down, felt his warm breath sweep out over her bottom as he moved in for a close inspection.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, touching a spot just to the right of her spine. \u201cI see it. The ring that marks you as a Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019s it. Mom said it was dangerous, so we got it covered. When I saw that mark you left on me at Gertie\u2019s Diner, I knew it was bad news. I figured if I covered it up, it might keep you from tracking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did. Funny how none of us knew it would work like that. How on earth did your mom know?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged her tattooed shoulder, drawing Zach back up her body to the image of his eyes in a leopard\u2019s body. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. The guy who fathered me gave her all kinds of instructions on how to keep me safe, and a bunch of dire warnings about how important it was for her to keep me hidden until I was grown. Guess Mom took them to heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could thank her for taking care of you so well.\u201d</p><p>A deep, old heartache, worn down to smooth edges by time, bloomed up inside Lexi. She missed Mom every day, wished she could share her life with her now that things were better. Safer.</p> <p>Mom would have liked Zach. After she\u2019d finished trying to kill him, of course.</p><p>\u201cWhy a leopard?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cIt was the way you moved. Like a predator. The way you looked at me like you were hungry, made me feel hunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hunting you. And as for the idea of eating you all up . . . that has promise.\u201d</p><p>A languid heat curled inside her belly. \u201cAnytime you want.\u201d</p><p>Zach growled low in his throat, but moved away. \u201cYou need your rest. If I get started now, you won\u2019t sleep for hours.\u201d</p><p>Fatigue weighed down on her, tugging her toward dreamland. As much as she wanted Zach, she knew she\u2019d give in to his effortless seduction if he stuck around. The man was irresistible, even when he wasn\u2019t trying. \u201cNot sure I can last that long.\u201d</p><p>He gave her shoulder a quick kiss and levered himself out of bed. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going out for a while. Naked Lexi is too tempting to resist, and I\u2019m determined to be a good boy and let you sleep. If you think you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to try. There\u2019s a lot going on in my head right now.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cYeah. A lot of that going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. Tomorrow is soon enough. Get some rest. I\u2019m going to go out and see if I can lend a hand at the wall. Unless you\u2019d rather I stay.\u201d</p><p>Lexi needed some time to think, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to sleep if his manly body was right there, distracting her with its yumminess. \u201cNo, you go on. They need your help. Helen said it\u2019s not going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, but we\u2019ll get through. We always do.\u201d</p><p>Lexi watched as he covered his firm butt with his discarded jeans, blocking her from the lovely sight. \u201cSpoil-sport,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Zach let out a laugh, shaking his head. \u201cStop trying to make me blush, woman. I might have to retaliate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>He buckled his sword belt around his hips and the thing shimmered before it faded from sight. \u201cYou\u2019re in no shape for more fun.\u201d He bent down and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cSleep. Then we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t find something to amuse you.\u201d</p><p>He was just closing the bedroom door when Lexi stopped him. \u201cZach? What if I can\u2019t do it? What if I can\u2019t ever tap into your power?\u201d</p><p>He stilled with his hand on the knob and gave her a smile so full of confidence it almost made her believe in miracles. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He looked her right in the eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ll love you anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Zach was regretting his confession of love by the time he hit the training yard. He kept feeling around, trying to connect to Lexi, seeking out some kind of reaction to his declaration. But all he felt was a yawning void of nothing stretching out between them.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He knew she was trying. He couldn\u2019t fault her for that, but it still bothered him that things weren\u2019t working between them like they should.</p><p>Because she still didn\u2019t trust him. That had to be the problem.</p><p>Frustration rode him hard as he neared the crumbled ruins of the wall. He checked his cell phone to make sure it was working and Lexi could reach him; then he threw himself into some good, hard labor. Lifting rocks was that, and then some.</p><p>An hour after Zach left, Lexi had convinced herself that he didn\u2019t really mean that he loved her. It was just a manner of speech. A saying his people used or something.</p><p>I\u2019ll love you anyway.</p><p>She wanted it to be true so much it made her heart ache. No one had loved her since her mom, and she found herself dying for more, craving it like she did oxygen.</p><p>Which was completely unfair of her. Here she was wanting his love when she wasn\u2019t yet able to give it back in return. It wasn\u2019t that Zach wasn\u2019t lovable. Hell, she\u2019d never met a man who sang to her soul the way he did. She was sure she could love him.</p><p>If she allowed herself to truly believe all of this was real, and that he was what he seemed.</p><p>There was still a sliver of doubt lodged deep inside of her that maybe everything she\u2019d seen and felt since the night Zach had found her in Gus\u2019s bar had all been some kind of trick. A hallucination brought about by the monumental powers the Sentinels wielded.</p><p>And no matter how many times she told herself that this had to be real, that sliver of doubt still stung and nagged her, drawing her mind back to it over and over. She wanted all of this to be true so badly that she was sure it would be swept away from her. Someone would lift a curtain and show her reality, and all her hopes and dreams would dissolve like a sugar cube tossed into hot water.</p><p>Deep down, Lexi sensed that it was this last bit of doubt that was holding her back, but she didn\u2019t know how to shake it. It was the only thing protecting her, and no matter how safe she felt in Zach\u2019s arms, she knew that, too, could be part of the illusion. Her only true safety lay in holding on to that doubt, keeping it close to her heart so at least that part of her was invulnerable.</p><p>If this was all a lie, and that curtain was opened, then at least Lexi would know that she\u2019d held back the most important part of herself. She might be stripped of her pride and humiliated, they might laugh at the foolish woman who fell under their spell so easily, they might even kill her, but at least she wouldn\u2019t die heartbroken.</p><p>It was cold comfort.</p><p>Lexi threw back the covers, found some new clothes that weren\u2019t ripped in half, showered, and got dressed.</p><p>Her first instinct was to seek out Helen and talk to her, but she was busy on the wall, or if she wasn\u2019t, she was probably sleeping. Since Lexi was useless when it came to lending a magical hand, the least she could do was stay out of the way and not slow everyone else down.</p><p>There was only one thing Lexi could do to help: get the Defenders to see reality and side with the Sentinels. There were hundreds of them\u2014maybe even a few thousand\u2014scattered across the country. If they joined forces with the Sentinels and helped fight the Synestryn, maybe it would help even the playing field.</p><p>Sure, they were just humans without any magical powers, but they were heavily armed and completely dedicated humans. Even if they only agreed to provide eyes and ears, it might help tip the scales in the Sentinels\u2019 favor.</p><p>It was worth a shot.</p><p>Plus, if she managed to convince the Defenders that everything she hoped was true, then that would go a long way toward pulling out that last splinter of doubt.</p><p>And if she couldn\u2019t convince them? Well, she wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do then, but she had to try.</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t stupid enough to meet with them face- to-face, but a phone call couldn\u2019t hurt. They already knew where she was, and since the bomb hadn\u2019t gone off, they also probably knew she\u2019d been compromised.</p><p>She figured out how to get an outside line, and dialed Jake Morrow, Hector\u2019s son. It was breaking the chain of command, but Jake was a much more reasonable man than his father. If anyone was going to listen to her side of the story, it would be him.</p><p>Zach stared out over the broken wall, realizing for the first time just how vulnerable they really were. And how long it was going to stay that way.</p><p>They\u2019d worked all night and had only added two feet to the structure. All the rocks were piled up, ready to be used, but they could only be put in place after one of the women had woven defensive magic through the molecules of the stone. Otherwise, the only thing it was going to keep out was humans and animals.</p><p>Dawn was drawing near, and all but a few Theronai had gone inside to seek their rest. There was nothing more they could do now that Helen and Gilda had gone inside to sleep, neither one strong enough to stand without help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake had had to carry Helen, and though Gilda had accepted Angus\u2019s support, she hadn\u2019t allowed him to do the same. There was an odd kind of distance between them that Zach didn\u2019t understand, but he hoped like hell it went away soon. This place needed them strong, functioning as a team.</p><p>It needed him and Lexi to do the same.</p><p>Zach\u2019s back ached, but he ignored it, preferring the mindless monotony of labor over the worries eating away at him.</p><p>What if Lexi\u2019s fears were right and she never managed to access his power? He was sure the failure would crush her, not to mention the fact that he had no clue what that would mean for him. His lifemark was no longer dying, but it wasn\u2019t renewing itself, either. There were no new leaves forming, no buds.</p> <p>Patience. He needed to stop worrying and have some faith. It had only been a couple of days. He needed to give Lexi some time to figure things out. Heaven knew she was trying.</p><p>A warm smile pulled at his mouth. He could hardly wait for her to try again.</p><p>A small whimper of sound rose up to his ears, barely audible. Zach stilled and held his breath, listening. It came again, a little louder this time, from the thick brush on the far side of the wall. It sounded like a wounded animal.</p><p>Or a child.</p><p>Fear kicked hard, making Zach\u2019s body move into action. Had one of the human children wandered out through the opening and gotten hurt? There was so much chaos around the wall\u2019s break, it could have happened.</p> <p>The sound came again, a little sobbing noise of pain and terror. Definitely not an animal.</p><p>Zach shouted to the closest man, \u201cNeal, come here. Back me up.\u201d</p><p>The sky had lightened enough that the floodlights shining on the work area had been turned off. The humans who had needed the illumination had all gone inside for food, anyway.</p><p>Deep shadows left dark pockets over the landscape, but Zach had served perimeter duty enough times that he knew the area well and had no trouble negotiating the dips and ruts in the dim light.</p><p>Neal was bare-chested. He pulled a T-shirt from his waistband and wiped the dust and sweat from his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d asked Neal. His voice was deceptively lazy as he came up beside Zach, moving so smoothly, it was hard not to watch.</p><p>\u201cThought I heard something. Like a kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoubt it,\u201d drawled Neal as he dropped the shirt and drew his sword.</p><p>Zach had been teamed up with Neal often enough to know that despite his casual manner, the man could go from zero to killer in about three seconds.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. Guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d Zach checked the sky. \u201cWhatever it is, can\u2019t be that bad for long. Sun\u2019s almost up.\u201d</p><p>The pitiful sound came from the bottom of a shallow ravine about fifty feet away.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell sounds human,\u201d said Neal, but he didn\u2019t put away his sword.</p><p>They reached the edge, and Zach saw a movement in the brush below. Something wearing pale blue. \u201cHelp me,\u201d said the kid, and it was definitely a kid. \u201cI\u2019m stuck.\u201d</p><p>Both men slid down the side of the ravine, which was maybe seven feet deep and twenty feet wide. During the rainy season, the crevice would be running with water, but right now, it was filled with scrub brush, mud and weeds.</p><p>Neal sheathed his sword as Zach pushed through the brush toward the kid. It was a little boy, maybe ten. He was wearing faded blue jeans and near him was a fishing pole and tackle box. His feet were sunk into the mud up to his calves and he\u2019d fallen back, lodging his arms and his butt in the thick mud as well.</p> <p>Zach didn\u2019t recognize the boy, but there were a lot of kids at Dabyr, more all the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, son?\u201d Zach asked as he looked for a way to reach the boy without getting stuck himself.</p><p>\u201cClay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt, Clay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI twisted my ankle.\u201d He sniffed and looked like he wished he could wipe the tears from his face before Zach got close enough to see them. His night vision was good enough that he had no trouble making out the shiny streaks over the kid\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>His voice wavered with genuine fear. \u201cAre you gonna tell my mom?\u201d</p><p>Absolutely, but no sense in freaking the kid out. He had to learn how dangerous it was to go outside the walls\u2014learn it well enough that he never did it again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that right now. Let\u2019s just focus on getting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>From behind him, Zach heard the metallic click of a gun being cocked. He turned to see what was going on, already knowing it was bad.</p><p>A burly man in denim overalls stood on the sloping land behind and above Neal with a matte black gun pointed at the Theronai\u2019s head. \u201cMove and I\u2019ll blow his brains out,\u201d said the stranger.</p><p>Zach stepped in front of the kid to protect him from stray bullets.</p><p>Neal\u2019s hand moved to his sword.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said another man behind Zach.</p><p>Zach whirled around and saw a skinny human with a scraggly beard on the far side of the ravine. In his hands was a shotgun, and it was pointed at the boy.</p><p>Outrage surged through Zach. This whole thing had been a trap with the kid serving as bait.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kill him,\u201d said Zach. \u201cThat child is one of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my kid,\u201d said Skinny, his voice chilly with indifference. \u201cGo ahead. See if I\u2019m bluffing.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes overflowed with tears and his nose started running. \u201cYou said we were going fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d barked Skinny.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cYou and your buddy here are coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d drawled Neal. And then he went into a blur of motion that severed the man\u2019s weapon hand at the wrist, sending it spinning through the air.</p><p>The man screamed, holding his bleeding wrist against his body.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t wait to see what Neal did next. Instead, he lunged for the kid and ripped him from the mud. He spun, putting his back to the shotgun, holding his breath in anticipation of the blast.</p><p>None came. Zach tossed the child into some nearby brush to cushion his fall and drew his sword.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he ordered the boy.</p><p>A second later, white-hot pain bloomed across his back as power poured into him, stretching his insides until he thought he\u2019d explode.</p><p>He roared in anger and spun around in a clumsy arc, slamming his fist into the man behind him. The man stumbled back, revealing two more men crouched in the brush.</p><p>Zach drew his sword and charged.</p><p>One man lifted some kind of gun and fired. A staticky crackling sound split the air, and an instant later, another sledgehammer of pain slammed into Zach\u2019s chest.</p><p>The second man aimed and fired.</p><p>Zach\u2019s muscles clenched down, completely out of his control. The branches of his lifemark shivered in pain, and a thin, high squeal trickled from his throat against his will.</p><p>He crumpled to the ground, landing on his side, gasping for air, trying to blink the spots from his vision. When it cleared, he was staring at a pair of worn work boots. He tried to move, but couldn\u2019t. One of those boots pulled back and slammed into his head, flipping him onto his back. He looked up and saw an old man whose face was shadowed by a cowboy hat holding some kind of stun gun in his hand.</p><p>Wires trailed out of the thing, leading straight to Zach.</p><p>That was what had taken him down? Stun guns?</p><p>\u201cWorked like a charm,\u201d said the man. \u201cJust like that creepy fella promised.\u201d</p><p>Zach had trouble making sense of what the man had said, but he didn\u2019t waste time figuring it out. In the distance he saw Neal slumped on the ground, his head bleeding heavily, a pair of wires streaming from his bare chest. As Zach watched, several leaves on his lifemark fell as he lay there, twitching.</p><p>The addition of so much energy into Neal\u2019s body so fast with no way for him to release it was going to kill him. Zach had the benefit of being connected to Lexi, but Neal wasn\u2019t so lucky.</p><p>Skinny lifted another stun gun from his belt and aimed it at Neal. Zach didn\u2019t think his friend would survive another shot.</p><p>Zach tried to reach for his sword to cut that bastard down before he could kill Neal, but he couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t even seem to find enough air to call for help.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t do something, they were both dead. Maybe the boy along with them.</p><p>That was the thought that burned through the paralysis and got his body moving again. He found the hilt of his sword and pulled it free of the sheath.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t,\u201d said a gruff voice.</p><p>Shock made Zach\u2019s body go numb, and a second later, he realized he\u2019d been kicked in the head again. Funny how it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>He tried to react, but nothing seemed to be working right. He lost the grip on his sword as his limp fingers fell away uselessly. Even his neck didn\u2019t work. He couldn\u2019t turn his head to look at his attackers and defend himself.</p><p>Another blow rocked his body. He was blacking out. He reached for Lexi\u2019s mind, trying to call out a warning: Dabyr was under attack. He wasn\u2019t sure if he got through or not, but as his vision faded, he knew it was too late for him and Neal. There was nothing she could do in time to save them.</p><p>Jake Morrow answered Lexi\u2019s call on the first ring, even though it wasn\u2019t quite six a.m. yet. He didn\u2019t sound sleepy, either, which made her wonder if he had spent a sleepless night, too.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he breathed out in relief. \u201cWe\u2019d thought they\u2019d killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, better than fine. We were wrong about the Sentinels, Jake. And that\u2019s not some kind of brainwashing talking, either.\u201d</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Silence flowed over the line for a moment. \u201cAre you alone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you could talk freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. I am, Jake. I\u2019m not sure where my mom got all the ideas she drilled into my head, but they\u2019re all wrong. These men are good. They\u2019re giving up their lives to protect humans from the Synestryn.\u201d</p><p>Another long pause made her nervous. \u201cI want to know what you\u2019ve learned. Can you meet me so we can talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Meet him. Only one reason he\u2019d want to do that rather than talk on the phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me. You think I\u2019m brainwashed, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be sure, Alex. The only way to do that is to get you out of there. Away from any hold they might have on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi, not Alex. I\u2019m not in hiding anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be. Just meet me for a few minutes, and let me judge for myself that it\u2019s really you talking.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t smart. She knew how they operated. If they thought she was brainwashed, they\u2019d no longer trust her, or worse, they\u2019d see her as the enemy. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Jake, but I don\u2019t trust you not to do something rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know about the C-4, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes in frustration. She wanted so badly to help Jake see what she had, but didn\u2019t know how to make him open his eyes. \u201cYeah. I told them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard a hiss of sound that could have been Jake uttering a curse, but she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a good idea.

Let them show you around here, see all the kids they\u2019ve saved, and you\u2019ll know they\u2019re not the monsters my mother and your father thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are kids there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly fuck. No wonder you didn\u2019t trigger the detonator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, even if they\u2019d been the bad guys, I couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Another long stretch of silence had Lexi gripping the phone hard. \u201cJake? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>Jake lowered his voice as if he was trying to hide their conversation. \u201cListen, Lexi. I only have a few seconds. You\u2019ve got to get out of there. Get all the kids out of there. Right now.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of doom weighed down on her, sliding down her throat until it sat heavy in her stomach. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really need to ask? Just do it.\u201d</p> <p>The Defenders were attacking. Lexi hadn\u2019t done what she\u2019d come here to do, so they were taking matters into their own hands.</p><p>There was a loud thud and a grunt of pain. She had no idea what that noise was, but panic welled up inside Lexi, making her stomach heave.</p><p>Desperate, she said, \u201cCall it off, Jake. Make your dad call it off.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Jake\u2019s voice that came back over the line. It was Hector\u2019s. The deep grating sound of his anger was unmistakable. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that now, little girl. We\u2019ve got your man.\u201d</p><p>Just as he said the words, Lexi\u2019s head was filled with the sound of Zach\u2019s frantic cry. Lexi! We\u2019re under attack!</p><p>Oh, God. It was too late. They had Zach.</p> <p>She made a choking sound and nearly dropped the phone. Her whole body was numb with disbelief as she reached out for Zach, needing to be near him. As always, the only thing that greeted her was silence. She couldn\u2019t feel him.</p><p>Hector went on as if her world hadn\u2019t just spun out of control. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a couple of choices. You can raise the alarm, and we\u2019ll kill him and his buddy right now, or you can walk calmly out through that break in the wall, and we\u2019ll let him live. It\u2019s up to you. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d she told him to stall for precious seconds to think. Her mind flew through her options as she spoke. A sketchy plan formed in her head, giving her an idea of how she could protect the people of Dabyr. \u201cLet me talk to Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do. The man\u2019s out like a light, bleeding all over the goddamn place.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Zach.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes and swallowed hard, trying to clear her head of the image of his broken body lying helpless at Hector\u2019s whim.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let Zach die. His people needed him too much.</p><p>She needed him too much.</p> <p>Lexi couldn\u2019t let them kill Zach and whoever was with him, but she knew if she just walked out without warning anyone that there was a good chance even more people would die.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me to come out? Why not just kill me along with everyone else?\u201d she asked, proud of the fact that she could actually form words in the midst of the chaotic jumble of panic and fear rolling around inside her.</p><p>\u201cI promised your mother I\u2019d look out for you. I\u2019m a man of my word.\u201d</p><p>There was more to it than that\u2014she could hear it in his voice\u2014but Lexi didn\u2019t waste any time trying to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, girl? You coming out, or do I gut him now and let you hear him gurgle out his last breath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. I figured you\u2019d see things our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried we\u2019ll hurt you? You\u2019re one of us. What they did to you isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Understanding sounded odd coming from Hector\u2019s lips. He was not the understanding type. \u201cWe\u2019ll clear up your confusion, and then you can tell us everything you\u2019ve learned about that place. You\u2019re going to be a valuable asset.\u201d</p><p>That was it? They wanted information?</p><p>Something about that didn\u2019t seem right, but she was running out of time and not coming up with any new options. \u201cAnd you promise you won\u2019t hurt Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll let you have the honors of killing him and his buddy yourself once you\u2019re in your right mind again. I have to admit I\u2019ll enjoy the show. I\u2019ve seen how ferocious you can be when you\u2019re angry. And once he no longer controls your thoughts, you\u2019re definitely going to be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I find you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find you. Just walk out, and we\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>Lexi would never hurt Zach. Never. But Hector didn\u2019t need to know that. She\u2019d play along and make sure that she did everything she could to keep the people here safe, and then she\u2019d save Zach.</p><p>Sure, she had no idea how she was going to do all that, but she was good at thinking on her feet. She\u2019d come up with something in the ten or fifteen minutes it would take her to get out through the broken wall.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Before she lost her nerve, Lexi dialed Helen\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>Drake answered, sounding surly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi. Can I talk to Helen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now she had to deal with a man she barely knew, one she didn\u2019t trust, at least not like she trusted Zach. \u201cWe have a problem. The Defenders are planning to attack Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked, the word a sharp chip of ice in her ear.</p><p>\u201cNow. I need you to evacuate everyone, but do it quietly. They may have a way of watching us. If they know what you\u2019re up to, they may move in sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about this all along, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. I swear.\u201d There wasn\u2019t time to convince him, so she didn\u2019t bother to try. \u201cIs there any secret exit out of this place? A safe room where people can hide or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you that. You think I\u2019m some kind of fool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it, Drake. Get everyone to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there another bomb?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got something up their sleeve. And I think they\u2019re close.\u201d Lexi pulled in a deep breath and let it out in a confession. \u201cThey have Zach and someone else. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d</p><p>A feral rumble of anger vibrated over the line. \u201cWhere are they, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to find out. They\u2019re coming for me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone comes with me, Zach is a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he spat, and in the background, Lexi heard the faint sound of Helen\u2019s questioning voice. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to figure it out on the fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. There\u2019s too much risk.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart was pounding hard. She\u2019d already started to shake thanks to a nice big dose of adrenaline. Standing here talking with Drake was getting her nowhere. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more time to argue with you. Get the kids out, damn it!\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone, grabbed a sharp knife from the kitchen\u2014the only weapon she could find\u2014and headed out the door.</p><p>Though she heard no sirens, lights in the building started to switch on as she raced over the dew-soaked grass. Drake had raised the alarm.</p><p>She just prayed he\u2019d done it in time.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Grace raced through the halls to Torr\u2019s suite, her heart pounding hard with fear. Less than a minute ago, her phone had rung, waking her from a dead sleep. Joseph\u2019s recorded message said there was danger of an impending attack and to go immediately to safety, down into the halls below the humans\u2019 wing of Dabyr.</p><p>She\u2019d sent her stepbrother down with another family, but she couldn\u2019t yet go herself. She had to find Torr and get him to safety. The Theronai were too busy taking care of the children, and she couldn\u2019t risk that he\u2019d be forgotten in the chaos.</p><p>She hugged the wall, avoiding the crush of people flowing past her. After a few turns, she was past the crowd. She sprinted down Torr\u2019s hall and came to a skidding stop outside his door. It was unlocked as usual, and when she went inside, Torr was in his bed, which was raised so he could look out across the grounds as he liked to do.</p><p>The sun was just beginning to lighten the landscape in a pretty pink glow. Everything looked normal, though she knew that wasn\u2019t the case. The only other time the alarm had been raised like this was the night the wall came down.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d she told him, her voice breathless as she hurried to his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of attack. I don\u2019t know any details.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and a look of fury crossed his features. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come for me. You need to get below with the other humans.\u201d</p><p>She attached the straps to the hoist she used to lift him. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is foolish. There\u2019s nothing they can do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already dead, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, you\u2019re not, and I\u2019m not going to let it happen tonight, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worth the risk, Grace. Please, go below so I know you\u2019re safe. Now.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his order and continued laying the bed flat so she could lift him into his chair. His body was limp as the machine hoisted it from the bed into his wheelchair. His eyes were blazing with anger, and she could practically hear his teeth grinding.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it would do to me if you died trying to save me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what the threat is. Synestryn could be marching through the halls as we speak.\u201d</p><p>The thought made her shudder, but she didn\u2019t stop moving. She would not leave him. \u201cAll the more reason for me to take you with me. We\u2019ll have time to get to safety. Both of us.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated only a moment before she took the time to fasten the straps that held his body in place. Time was short, but if he slid from his chair, she\u2019d never be able to lift him back into it without help.</p><p>She clicked the last buckle shut, and she looked in his eyes. She was close enough she could feel his breath sweep past her cheek. She wanted to kiss him so badly her body trembled in the effort to hold back.</p><p>Besides, there wasn\u2019t time for that now. Later, there would be time. She promised herself she\u2019d be brave enough to kiss him. Soon.</p><p>His voice was thick with longing. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lost you . . .\u201d He trailed off, his throat bobbing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She touched his cheek, feeling the warmth of his skin under her chilled fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel. I can\u2019t lose you, either.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drifted shut. \u201cPlease. We can\u2019t do this. You can\u2019t do this to yourself.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was talking about their relationship, but she chose to purposefully misunderstand him. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything I don\u2019t want to do. I need you to be safe.\u201d</p><p>Before she wasted any more time, she wheeled him out the door, toward the tunnel entrance.</p> <p>If anything happened to Torr, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d survive. She\u2019d already lost so much in the Synestryn attack on her family. She couldn\u2019t lose him, too.</p><p>When Zach came to, he was lying on his side, trussed up tight with ropes digging into his skin hard enough to cut off his circulation. He looked around, trying to figure out where he was, but the cramped confines of the dark space gave him no clue. All the windows were covered, and his prison was on the move. He could feel the vibrations beneath him, hear the hum of tires on the road.</p><p>Beside him, Neal was bound, his bloody head leaving a dark wet spot beneath him. His chest moved as he breathed, but not much. Not nearly enough for a man his size.</p><p>Little light filtered into the small space, but it was enough to tell Zach that it was daylight outside. At least all the blood they\u2019d spilled wouldn\u2019t be drawing Synestryn out to play.</p><p>His head pounded and his muscles were stiff from all the convulsing, but other than that, he could hardly feel a thing. His arms and legs were asleep from loss of circulation. As he shifted, he realized he was on a soft surface, like a mattress. He pushed himself up and looked around enough to figure out he was in the back of a motor home, lying on a bed. The door to the main cabin was cracked open about a foot, and through it, he could see several blurry forms moving about.</p> <p>Blurry? Great. He must have been hit harder than he thought.</p><p>The motor home slowed to a stop. He heard steps, felt the thing shift as new weight was added. Several people got in, closed the door behind them. They started moving again, heading down the road.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zach?\u201d It was Lexi\u2019s voice, clear and demanding.</p><p>Zach\u2019s heart leapt, reveling in the sweet sound of her voice. Then his foggy brain realized what her being here meant.</p><p>Lexi had been taken by these assholes, too.</p><p>The air in Zach\u2019s lungs froze solid, keeping him from breathing. He reached for his sword, but not only did his hand not move; he was sure they\u2019d stripped the weapon from him before bringing him here.</p> <p>Still every protective instinct he possessed rose up on its hind legs and howled. Zach tried to scream a warning, but all that came out was a muffled sound of defeat. They\u2019d taped his mouth shut, gagging him and his groggy noggin hadn\u2019t even realized it until now. Not a good sign all was well upstairs.</p><p>Zach struggled to move, forcing his numb body to comply. He needed to get to her. Protect her. Save her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the back,\u201d said a man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see him.\u201d Her voice was firm, but wavered with fear.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d said the man. \u201cBut be quick. We\u2019ve got a show to put on. Folks are waiting.\u201d</p><p>A second later, Lexi\u2019s face came into sight, close enough that she was no longer a blur. Her chocolate brown eyes glowed with tears of concern she didn\u2019t let fall. Her fingers trembled as they feathered over his face. When she drew them back, they were smeared with his blood.</p><p>\u201cYou could have killed him,\u201d accused Lexi, turning to the man standing behind her. He was tall, thick with both fat and muscle. He had an air of authority about him so heavy that the other men in the motor home stood several feet back so they didn\u2019t have to stand under that weight.</p><p>Maybe they were afraid of him.</p> <p>\u201cThem boys are tough,\u201d said the man. \u201cGotta hit \u2019em good and hard to take \u2019em down. Those stun guns worked like a charm. We\u2019ll definitely be adding those to our arsenal.\u201d</p><p>Lexi peeled the edge of the tape away from Zach\u2019s mouth. It stung, but he welcomed the pain. It meant he was still alive. There was still a fighting chance.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked him in a strained voice, like she was barely holding herself together.</p><p>As soon as his mouth was free, he said, \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sad, watery smile. \u201cNot without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of a reunion,\u201d said the big man behind her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Lexi turned, exasperation vibrating along her slender back. \u201cI\u2019m not brainwashed, Hector. You\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let her go,\u201d said Zach. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me and Neal. You don\u2019t need her, too.\u201d</p><p>Hector pushed Lexi aside and leaned down over Zach. Hatred glowed in his eyes, making them bulge. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, boy. Lexi\u2019s part of the bigger plan. And you . . . Well, the girl\u2019s taken a liking to you, which makes you downright useful.\u201d</p><p>Useful. Oh shit. He was leverage.</p><p>He had to get out of these ropes, but he couldn\u2019t feel his fingers to work the knots loose. \u201cJust go, Lexi,\u201d pleaded Zach.</p><p>Hector gave him a cold smile. \u201cShe will. Don\u2019t worry. We just need to get her rigged up first.\u201d</p><p>A sick sense of dread pooled in Zach\u2019s stomach. Rigged up. That didn\u2019t sound good at all.</p><p>When Hector reached across the small space into the minuscule closet and pulled out a vest covered in wires and blocks of military-grade explosives, Zach knew just how bad it was.</p><p>That vest was way too small for any of the men present to wear. It was Lexi\u2019s size.</p><p>Lexi stared at the vest, and fear fell down on her like an avalanche, leaving her freezing and suffocating. She locked her knees to stay standing, but the edges of her vision faded out to gray.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked Hector.</p><p>\u201cCustom-made by my own hands,\u201d he said. \u201cBoys.\u201d</p><p>Two men behind her grabbed her arms. She\u2019d been too shocked to even think about fighting until now. But now that they had her locked in their hard grips, her survival instincts kicked in and she fought back, lashing out with her feet and fists. She landed several blows, but the men holding her were strong, corn- fed men who were used to a few hard knocks.</p><p>They worked for Hector, after all.</p><p>\u201cStop your fussin\u2019 and strap in,\u201d said Hector as he started sliding her arms through the holes with quite a bit of help from the men holding her. \u201cWe got a schedule to keep.\u201d</p><p>Zach let out a bellow of pure rage and thrashed around until he hit the floor. His body was trussed up tight, coiled with thin, strong rope. There was no way he was getting out of that without help.</p><p>Lexi was frantic, dying to do anything to stop this from happening. She knew the power to do so was there, right at her throat, hovering in the luceria, and she reached for it, straining against the barrier that separated them.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes fell shut and his body stilled, like he\u2019d felt her trying. His eyes locked onto hers, and he gave her a single nod.</p><p>Had it worked? Lexi didn\u2019t feel any power, no flow of energy like Helen had described. She pushed again, but the barrier was still in place, locking her out.</p><p>Defeat deadened her body, making her go slack inside the two men\u2019s grips. She still couldn\u2019t reach him. He was there, willing and ready to share with her everything she needed to save him, Neal and herself, but she couldn\u2019t touch it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said Hector. \u201cBefore the Sentinels figure out you\u2019re all missing.\u201d He grabbed a Windbreaker and put it on her as if she were two years old. And like a two-year-old, she wanted to fight him every step of the way. Only the fact that she was wearing a weapon kept her from doing so.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it,\u201d whispered Lexi. \u201cWhatever it is you want, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will. You\u2019re going to march your ass right back into that compound and stand in the middle like a good girl until I trigger the detonator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I will,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>\u201cYou will, or we\u2019re going to start removing pieces of lover boy here, one at a time. It\u2019s your life or his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Lexi,\u201d said Zach. \u201cYou can take that fucking thing off once you\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>Hector grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I already thought of that?\u201d He pointed a pudgy finger at a series of metal disks running down the front of the vest attached to wires that wrapped all the way around. \u201cMagnetic connectors. Break the circuit and the thing goes boom. The only way our girl is coming out of this vest is in little pieces.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Her stomach heaved and she had to swallow to keep from puking all over the wires. Who knew if that would set the thing off?</p><p>Hector must have seen her skin go green, because he zipped up the Windbreaker, protecting the device from sight and gastrointestinal mishap.</p><p>Zach growled in defeat and wriggled toward Hector. Hector kicked him in the ribs hard with the tip of his boot, making Zach suck in a pained breath.</p><p>Lexi flinched and a cry of anguish escaped her lips, betraying her feelings for Zach to Hector.</p><p>Your life or his.</p><p>No. They were both going to die, and Lexi knew it. They were tied together. If she died, so did he. And even if that weren\u2019t true, there was no way Hector would spare Zach once Lexi had done what he wanted. His hatred was too strong. His need to avenge a daughter dead more than twenty years had burned all mercy from him.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t bring Mindy back,\u201d said Lexi. \u201cThere are human girls in there just like her. You want me to kill them, too?\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s face darkened to a deep, livid purple. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about her,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough to even speak her name. You\u2019re one of them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no us and them. We\u2019re all the same. We all want the same thing\u2014to destroy the Synestryn so they can never hurt anyone again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the same. We\u2019re better than you are. This is our planet. Ours!\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s men started to back away, their faces going white with fear. Lexi knew as well as they did what would happen next. Hector would start lashing out at whoever and whatever was nearby.</p><p>Lexi stood her ground, keeping her chin high.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Lexi.\u201d Zach\u2019s voice was strained, and she could feel his fear for her beating at that barrier between them. He was screaming at her to run, but if she did, Hector would be left behind to try again.</p><p>Her only chance to stop him was to take him down right here, right now. He\u2019d given her the weapon\u2014strapped it to her body\u2014all she had to do now was find the courage to use it.</p><p>Lexi looked at Zach. His hair was matted with blood. More blood had leaked into his eyes\u2014those beautiful leopard green eyes that had always intrigued her so much, even when they frightened her. Eyes that pleaded with her now to run. Save herself.</p><p>In that moment, she knew the truth. There was no more question of brainwashing, no more slivers of doubt to get in her way. He hadn\u2019t tricked her or coerced her as Hector was doing now.</p><p>Zach had been nothing but honest with her from the start. He\u2019d hidden nothing, not even his need for her, not even the power she held over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One single thought and the luceria would fall from her neck. She\u2019d be free, but he would die. He\u2019d placed his life in her hands. His trust.</p><p>There was only one way she could repay him, and it was going to kill them both.</p><p>Lexi wished she\u2019d figured out the truth sooner. She wished she\u2019d known him years ago, that they\u2019d had more time together before now.</p><p>She wished she could have loved him longer.</p> <p>\u201cAre you willing to die for your people?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes widened slightly in understanding, then closed in grief. Final. Absolute. He gave her a nearly imperceptible nod\u2014permission to follow through with her plan.</p><p>Someone new came into the motor home, but Lexi didn\u2019t turn away from Zach to see who it was.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready,\u201d she heard Jake say behind her.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this,\u201d roared Hector. \u201cGet your ass outside. People are waiting.\u201d</p><p>Lexi ripped her gaze away from Zach and stared up at Hector. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me time to say good-bye,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can it hurt, Pa?\u201d said Jake. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing she can do to stop this. Give her a minute with the man she\u2019s dying to save.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked at him then, startled by the unexpected support. Jake\u2019s left eye was swelling shut, and a dark bruise was forming on his cheek. So that was the sound she\u2019d heard over the phone. Hector had hit him when he\u2019d found Jake telling her to evacuate the buildings.</p> <p>Hector crossed his arms over his heavy chest. \u201cOne minute. And I\u2019m not leaving. Say what you\u2019ve got to say with an audience or not at all.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded and rushed forward, kneeling on the ground next to Zach. While she was down there, she pulled the kitchen knife from her shoe, her movement hidden by the voluminous folds of the Windbreaker.</p><p>She reached around him, hugging him hard, and slid the knife between the ropes. She didn\u2019t have time to be careful, and she worried that she might have cut him, but that was all she could do. It wasn\u2019t much of a chance, but it was something.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes glowed with emotion as he looked at her. Warmth flowed into her through their link, comforting her. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cDeath isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d</p><p>The tears she\u2019d been holding back since the men had grabbed her outside the walls of Dabyr broke free and slid down her cheek, hitting the navy Windbreaker with a soft patter. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she told him, meaning it more than she was able to express in the few brief seconds they had left together.</p><p>More than anything, Lexi wished that barrier between them wasn\u2019t there, so he could feel her love for him the way she could his. She wanted to bathe him in it, make sure he knew her words were genuine.</p><p>\u201cI can take off the luceria. If it will be easier on you that way.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d live after she\u2019d taken it off, but it might give him a few more days, hours even. She didn\u2019t want to rob him of any of them.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you to be alone. I\u2019ll be there with you to the very end.\u201d</p> <p>When she died. He hadn\u2019t said it, but they both knew that was what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>Even though he couldn\u2019t feel her through the thing, she could feel him. She could feel his love, his comfort. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meant to be together,\u201d he whispered, his tone fervent. \u201cI still believe that. I\u2019ll find you. Somehow, I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi believed him. He was too powerful a man to let something as paltry as death stand in his way. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d she said; then she kissed him.</p><p>His mouth was warm and soft, so gentle against hers that she wondered how she could have ever thought he\u2019d meant her harm. She squeezed every bit of her love for him into that kiss, telling him what words couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d said Hector. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Hector led Lexi to the center of a caravan, mostly of pickup trucks with Texas plates. The size of the gathering of Defenders left her stunned. She\u2019d never seen so many of them together in one place.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all here for the show,\u201d said Hector as he led her by the arm to the group of waiting people. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to see the fireworks from that hilltop over there. Gonna be quite a spectacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about these people, Hector. They mean you no harm.\u201d Though Lexi sure did. She was going to blow his ass to hell. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be sorry you were too thick-skulled to listen to reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the brainwashing talking. Don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t have to suffer much longer.\u201d</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t. Still, she had a few more moments to help him see the truth. Unless a bunch of white knights rode in, that was the only thing that had even a chance of saving her. \u201cThere are human children in there. Did Jake tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re all under the Sentinels\u2019 spell. Nothing I can do for them but put them out of their misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you tried to help people escape their pull. That\u2019s what you were going to do with Helen.\u201d</p><p>Hector shrugged. \u201cI told you what you wanted to hear to get you to do the right thing. Do you think that if I\u2019d told you your friend was a lost cause you would have cooperated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you were using me from the start.\u201d</p><p>He let out an ugly bark of laughter. \u201cHell, girl. I started using you before you were born. Your mom was the suggestible sort. She believed everything I told her. Even wrote it down.\u201d</p><p>So that was where all Mom\u2019s journal entries had come from. No wonder they sounded so crazy. Hector was crazy. Whatever noble goal he\u2019d had, assuming there had ever been one, it had been lost along the way.</p><p>\u201cMom trusted you,\u201d said Lexi. Anger and resentment burned bright inside her, but she kept it hidden.</p><p>\u201cThey always do. Too bad Jake doesn\u2019t have the knack for making people trust him the way I do. Isn\u2019t that right, Jake?\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Jake said nothing. He kept his battered face down, staring at the ground. His body was tense and she could feel his anger seething just below the surface.</p><p>\u201cAt least Jake listens,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just easily swayed, like his mama. My boy is a pure disappointment,\u201d Hector told Lexi as if his son wasn\u2019t standing right there.</p><p>Jake flinched; then he stopped walking altogether and fell back.</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t even spare him a glance. What kind of father hurt his son like that and didn\u2019t care?</p><p>Lexi realized then she was wasting her breath trying to make him see the truth. Even if she lived to be a hundred, there wasn\u2019t enough time left to make Hector Morrow change his mind.</p><p>He was going to die ignorant, and there was nothing Lexi could do to change that.</p><p>So, rather than waste the last seconds of her life trying, Lexi shut her mouth and focused on Zach. She could feel his presence, hovering inside her, holding her close even though he was yards away. She could also feel his determination to free himself. She wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d found the knife she\u2019d left behind, or even if he\u2019d been able to use it, but he hadn\u2019t given up yet.</p><p>Maybe if he got free in time. . . . No. There were too many of them, all armed. Even Zach wasn\u2019t capable of taking down over a hundred armed Texans.</p><p>The weight of the explosives strapped to her chest seemed to close in on her. Reality had left her numb, accepting. She wasn\u2019t fighting her fate the way Zach was. The only way to stop Hector and his men from trying to hurt the people of Dabyr was to kill them.</p><p>Lexi snaked one arm inside the huge Windbreaker. All she had to do was flip open one of those magnets and it would all be over. No more threat. No more Defenders.</p><p>At least Helen would be safe. Dabyr would be safe.</p><p>Lexi figured it was the least she could do after her willingness to blow the place up.</p><p>Hector pulled her to a halt inside a ring of vehicles parked in a clearing. He raised his voice so it carried out over the crowd. Lexi didn\u2019t listen to his words. She was too busy counting, tallying up the number of lives she was going to end today. One hundred twelve.</p><p>She wondered if these men were as ruthless as Hector. If they lived, would they take up where he\u2019d left off? Would they be scared away and go back to their families to live nice, quiet lives? And what about the Defenders who weren\u2019t present today? How would they react to what she was going to do? Would their zeal to defeat the Sentinels increase because they\u2019d suffered so many losses? Or would there even be enough of them left to pick up the pieces and carry on in Hector\u2019s stead?</p><p>Suddenly Lexi felt the burden of her decision weigh down on her. It was one thing to think about blowing these men up. It was another to look into their eyes and then do it. These men had wives, children. People loved them. How could she end their lives without knowing anything about them other than that they fell under Hector\u2019s spell the same way her mom had?</p><p>I\u2019m here. It was Zach, comforting her. Had he felt her indecision? Her guilt?</p><p>Lexi reached out for him, wanting to hold him in her mind the way he did her. Comfort him. The barrier rippled against her touch, but didn\u2019t break. She pushed harder, but the thing seemed to strengthen more the harder she pushed.</p><p>I won\u2019t leave you, honey. There was love in his words. So much it made her eyes sting with tears.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes and let his love swell up inside her, filling her up with warmth and light. Zach was with her and she was no longer afraid. She knew exactly what she had to do.</p><p>I love you, she told him, and this time, she felt her message go through. She\u2019d done it! She felt Zach\u2019s surprise, his elation that she\u2019d been able to reach him.</p><p>The men surrounding her cheered as if they knew what had happened. Hector lifted his fist in victory. \u201cToday, our enemy falls!\u201d he shouted. More cheers erupted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Hector told Lexi. \u201cOne of the men will drive you back to the wall and get you hooked up with a camera so I know when to push the button. And so I know you\u2019re not trying any funny stuff. Go on in like a good girl and I\u2019ll let your man live.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie, but Lexi let it go. She had bigger concerns than Hector Morrow\u2019s last few lies.</p><p>I\u2019m coming, honey. Hang on.</p><p>No! she tried to tell him, but she wasn\u2019t sure her message had gone through. It was too dangerous. These men would shoot him down.</p><p>Hector pulled a device out of his pocket. A remote trigger to detonate the bomb. The black plastic gleamed under the bright morning sun. A green LED blinked cheerfully, indicating everything was working fine.</p><p>For a moment, she was trapped by that flashing light, wishing her job was already done. Her whole body trembled with anxiety, especially her fingers, firmly grasping a pair of magnetic disks.</p><p>\u201cMay I speak?\u201d she asked him. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m allowed some last words, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hector narrowed his eyes; then a calculating grin curled his fleshy lips. \u201cGo ahead. Say what you like. These men all know that you\u2019re the Sentinels\u2019 pawn. You\u2019re only going to prove my case.\u201d</p><p>He held up his fist and the men surrounding her quieted. \u201cThe girl here has something to say.\u201d</p><p>The men laughed as if he\u2019d just told a joke. Then again, maybe her speaking out at this point was funny. Ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI know you all think I\u2019m brainwashed, but I\u2019m not.\u201d They laughed louder, but Lexi ignored them. \u201cI\u2019ve been inside those walls and I know what kind of people the Sentinels are. They\u2019re the kind of people who shelter orphaned children. The kind of people who lay their lives on the line every night so that you can all sleep safer in your beds.\u201d The men\u2019s laughter died. \u201cAnd even though every one of you here would rather kill them than speak to them and learn the truth, if it was one of your kids at risk, one of your kids who had been orphaned, they\u2019d take them in and keep them safe. No hard feelings. No grudges.\u201d</p> <p>The men started looking at one another uncomfortably, shifting from one foot to the other. She lowered her voice and watched as these men moved toward her, straining to hear what she had to say in her last moments. \u201cWe do have enemies. We do need to fight, but you\u2019re fighting the wrong war. The Synestryn are our real enemy. They\u2019re the ones who want our blood. Our children\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>They were close enough now.</p><p>Her fingers gripped the cold metal disks lining the front of the vest. She shoved her fingernail between two of them, feeling the magnetic tug that held them locked together tight. All she had to do was twist her fingernail and pull and it would all be over. She\u2019d take all these men down with her, freeing the Sentinels and those they protected from the threat the Defenders posed.</p><p>I love you, Zach. She had to tell him once more. Make sure he knew.</p><p>Her words pushed through the barrier easily this time, melting it away. Power roared into her body like a tidal wave, making her rock on her feet. Her body seemed ready for it, craving it. Her cells soaked it up, making her feel stronger with every passing heartbeat.</p> <p>There was no more room inside her for fear or indecision. She knew exactly what she needed to do, and thanks to her love for Zach, she had the power to do it.</p><p>She felt Zach\u2019s love wrap around her, warming her, sliding over her skin like a caress. The tingling heat soaked into her and she was sure, if she looked, she\u2019d be glowing.</p><p>Her voice rose up, loud and strong, resonating with the energy that pulsed inside her. She pulled in a deep breath, praying she could channel that power and control it. \u201cEvery one of the Sentinels would sacrifice his or her life to save one of you.\u201d She scanned the crowd, looking each man in the eyes. \u201cAnd I am one of them. Remember that when you tell your kids what you\u2019ve seen here today. Remember that a Sentinel once held the power of life and death over you. And let you live.\u201d</p><p>With that, she used her newfound power to create a wall strong enough to hold in the force of the explosion, to channel it up into the sky. Then she ripped apart the magnets, triggering the bomb strapped to her chest.</p><p>Giant hammers slammed into her from every side, crushing her body, but there was no pain. An instant later, a searing wave of heat swept over her, burning everything away. In her last brief, flashing moment of life, all she felt was Zach\u2019s love holding her close, surrounding her, cradling her, staying with her to the very end. Just as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>Zach had finally managed to free himself from the ropes, grab his sword from the main cabin of the motor home, and go racing after Lexi when he felt the barrier between them melt away.</p> <p>Power surged out of him, driving him to his knees in shock. Rocks cut into his flesh, dug into his joints, but he hardly felt it. His body was still numb and tingling from being bound for so long, and although he\u2019d nearly scraped the skin from his forearms escaping the ropes, there was no pain.</p><p>Instead, he was surrounded by a soothing warmth as if Lexi held him in her arms.</p><p>I love you, Zach, she whispered to his mind. The words were tinted with acceptance of her decision. Courageous resignation.</p><p>Zach felt her emotions trickle through and knew what they meant. She was going to detonate the device early. Take as many of the Defenders down with her as she could. He\u2019d seen her plan glowing in her eyes\u2014heard it in her voice as she asked Hector if he\u2019d be willing to die for his people.</p><p>So would I.</p><p>Zach tried to shout a warning that he\u2019d escaped and was coming for her, but it was too late. Light flashed, brightening the morning sky and thunder rolled out over the land.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Zach as he raced toward her\u2014toward the last place he\u2019d felt all that love flowing from.</p><p>A column of smoke and fire spewed up as if all the energy of the explosion had been shoved into an invisible tunnel.</p> <p>He reached out with his mind as his feet flew over the dew-soaked ground. The echo of her love flowing through the luceria had not yet died off, but that was all that was left: a hollow echo dying to morbid silence as he ran.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Zach scrambled up the ridge until he could see the gathering of men below.</p><p>Anger and grief warred within him, leaving no room to breathe. She was gone. His sweet Lexi was gone.</p><p>His limbs were heavy and clumsy as he climbed, his frantic rage pounding hard in his veins until it vibrated his bones. Blood seeped from his torn skin, making the rocks slippery.</p><p>The only consolation he had was that he\u2019d be joining her soon. Whatever life held for them after they left this world, they were going to go through it together.</p><p>But first, Zach was going to kill every one of those fuckers for taking Lexi from him. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d have before his time was up, but he was pretty sure it would be long enough to get the job done.</p><p>With his sword in his bloody hand, Zach stalked down the ridge, the metallic taste of vengeance on his tongue. The Defenders were packed around her, staring at the starburst of scorched earth and the crater that cradled her body.</p><p>Her body? Surely after an explosion like that there wouldn\u2019t be one.</p><p>The urge to gather what was left of her in his arms burned strong inside him, but not nearly as strong as his need for blood. He wanted to feel the blood of these men splatter over his face, still hot with the life he was cutting from them. He wanted to feel it drench his arms until it dripped from him. He wanted to watch as it pooled on the ground, wetting the earth with his rage and grief.</p><p>The Defenders hadn\u2019t noticed his approach. A satisfied smile stretched his lips and bared his teeth.</p><p>\u201cZach, no!\u201d For a second, Zach thought it was Lexi calling him, and his steps faltered as he turned to find her.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Lexi. It was Helen. She was clinging to Drake\u2019s arm, weaving on her feet with fatigue.</p><p>She and Drake walked toward the Defenders, who were now looking from them to Zach with wide, frightened eyes.</p><p>Zach readied his blade and braced himself for the bullets that would no doubt be biting into his skin any moment. But rather than fire their weapons, the Defenders started to scatter like roaches cast into sunlight.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Zach. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to reach them all.</p><p>Helen lifted her hand and a ring of fire spewed from the earth, locking them inside a hot, crackling embrace. Even with the barrier preventing their flight, they all managed to stay well out of Zach\u2019s reach.</p><p>He stalked toward them, hungry for their blood, and ran into an invisible wall.</p><p>Rage surged inside him and he sliced at the obstacle, making it waver and shimmer like heated air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting through it,\u201d said Andra. Her feet were braced apart, her long, lean body housed in leather and denim.</p><p>Paul stood at her side, weapon bare, his eyes on Lexi\u2019s body. \u201cYou might as well not waste your strength.\u201d</p><p>Where had Andra come from? Zach hadn\u2019t seen her approach. Or Paul\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLet me through,\u201d he ordered between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Paul strode forward toward Lexi, and Zach felt a searing possessiveness scald his insides. He ran for her, unwilling to let another man touch her. Paul knelt at her side, reached out a hand.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Zach as he reached Paul\u2019s side, shoving the other man away from her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>Paul held up his hands. \u201cI was just checking for a pulse.\u201d</p><p>Pulse? Why would there be a pulse?</p><p>There was a grating metallic sound that Zach knew meant danger, but he ignored it. Lexi absorbed all of him. His attention, his emotion, his hopes and dreams.</p><p>She was everything to him, and she was gone.</p><p>He should have found a way to save her. His job was to keep her safe, protect her. He should have been the one lying there in a blackened crater. He should have been the one whose hair was singed and flesh scorched.</p><p>\u201cDrop the guns or lose a testicle,\u201d said Andra in a warning tone.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t care if they shot him or not. Even his need for vengeance was fading away, losing importance as Lexi\u2019s body grew cold.</p><p>The urge to keep her warm for as long as he could swept through him, taking over. He gathered her limp body in his arms and cradled her on his lap. Her head landed against his shoulder, smearing his clothes with soot and ash. Her eyebrows were mostly burned away, her eyelashes short stubs. Her pointed chin was no longer thrust up in defiance, but tucked against her chest.</p><p>Zach\u2019s fingers traced her face, memorizing the soft curves and gentle lines. Soot blackened his hand, making the swirling jade green of his ring stand out in contrast.</p><p>Movement? If she was gone, there would be no movement in the color. They\u2019d be fixed at the time of death. Immovable.</p><p>A faint breath of hope washed over his skin. Zach pressed his fingers to her neck. Her skin was warm, a bit too warm, even. And beneath the silky softness the faintest pulse of life thrummed through her veins.</p><p>Lexi was alive!</p><p>Joy tore through him in a vibrant surge of light and color. His head spun with shock and a jubilant cry rose from his soul, echoing the morning air. He kissed her lips, and although she didn\u2019t respond, her breath filled his lungs. He sucked it into himself, cherishing the proof of life that expanded inside him, warm and sweet and perfect.</p><p>There was some kind of commotion around him, but Zach ignored it. His total focus was on Lexi, on the minute vibration of her stubby eyelashes as she tried to lift her eyelids, on the subtle tightening of her mouth as if she\u2019d felt his kiss, on the pale streaks of skin where his tears had washed away the soot covering her beautiful face.</p><p>God, he loved her. So much, he thought the ferocity of it might tear him apart, and yet it didn\u2019t. Somehow, it made him whole.</p><p>\u201cWake up, honey,\u201d he coaxed her. His voice was tight with emotion, strangled by tears.</p><p>He smoothed her hair from her face, feeling the coarse bits of burned strands breaking off under his palm, leaving only softness behind.</p><p>Gilda knelt beside him, heedless of the ash blackening her gray gown. She reached toward Lexi, but Zach shifted away, shielding her with his body. No one else could touch her. Only him.</p><p>\u201cI mean her no harm,\u201d said the Gray Lady, her voice steady and calm. \u201cI simply wanted to offer my aid as the Sanguinar cannot help her here, under the sun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMine,\u201d was all Zach could manage to squeeze out past the tightness in his throat.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d soothed Gilda. \u201cMay I touch her?\u201d</p><p>A small pale hand reached toward Lexi. No threat. Just Gilda.</p><p>Zach relaxed his hold and gave Gilda a slight nod.</p> <p>Angus stepped up beside her, a sword in his hands. Zach\u2019s protective instincts rose up and a deep, warning growl filled his chest.</p><p>\u201cStay back, Angus,\u201d said Gilda.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak,\u201d he replied, his tone sharp.</p><p>\u201cI have no need of you now,\u201d she said.</p><p>Angus\u2019s body tensed as if he\u2019d taken a physical blow, but he moved away, allowing Zach to pull in a full breath.</p> <p>Gilda laid her hand on Lexi\u2019s head, and a pale, watery light spilled out from under her palm. Lexi\u2019s eyes snapped open and she reached up as if to brush Gilda\u2019s hand away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d said Zach. \u201cStop!\u201d His command was harsh and completely out of place. He heard the noises around him die down as if his outburst had drawn their attention.</p><p>Gilda moved her hand and shrank back into the dim hum of activity around Zach and Lexi. Zach didn\u2019t bother to see what they were doing. He didn\u2019t care. Nothing outside of the treasure he held in his arms had any meaning to him. The rest of the world could fall away and Zach wouldn\u2019t miss it.</p><p>He had Lexi and he needed nothing else.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>It took Lexi a couple of days to regain her strength. She floated in and out of awareness, fighting the gray morass that tugged at her, sucking her away from reality into a world of chaotic dreams and hallucinations. During that time, there was one constant, one thing she knew was real and solid.</p> <p>Zach.</p><p>He\u2019d never once left her. Not even when the searing heat of the explosion had crowded around her, sucking the oxygen from her lungs. He was there, solid and strong, holding her inside the safety of his vast power, protecting her body.</p><p>He was still beside her, his strong body stretched out beside her, his arm looped across her chest with his palm splayed over her heart as if he were tracking her pulse.</p><p>Lexi levered herself up on the bed, knocking his thick arm into her lap. He woke instantly, his bloodshot eyes scanning her body, taking her in as he had the other times she\u2019d resurfaced during the past few days. His chest was bare, and hundreds of pale, shiny leaves had sprung from the branches of his lifemark.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice a raw shred of sound.</p><p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak past the arid tightness in her throat.</p><p>Zach reached over to the bedside table and grabbed a cup of water. He held the straw to her lips and she drank, feeling the cold of the water go all the way down. It felt good, but not nearly as good as it did to see Zach whole and safe beside her.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked. \u201cNeed to use the bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>She scanned his face, so beautiful to her. Especially his eyes. They glowed with love. For her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>His big body shuddered in pleasure and he wrapped his arms around her, surrounding her with his heat.</p><p>Lexi sighed in contentment, remembering the feel of his protective embrace as it shielded her from that explosion. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFor saving me.\u201d</p><p>Zach pulled away, looking at her with an anguished expression of self-loathing. \u201cI didn\u2019t save you, honey, though I wished like hell I had. You did that all yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt you wrap your arms around me, shield me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek and she leaned into the touch. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019d just gotten free of the ropes, and I ran to you when that bomb went off.\u201d He swallowed hard, then in an anguished tone said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there. Or your power was. It slid over my skin and held off the crushing weight, the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can use my power.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that. I had no idea how to use it. And even if I did, you\u2019re the one who supplied the power, the one who showed me what to do. I saw you in my head, holding me close and I was safe. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that makes you my hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree, but you\u2019re too weak for a good argument right now.\u201d</p><p>He was right. She was weak, but she felt her strength returning more by the minute. \u201cWhat happened to the man who was with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeal is recovering, though the attack cost him dearly. He needs to find his lady fast or he\u2019ll be out of time. The energy in that stun gun added to the power growing inside him in a way we had never considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zach. I\u2019m sorry I brought all of this down on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t blame you any more than I do. Neither do the others. You can\u2019t control the actions of the Defenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d she asked, not sure she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of our men had a nice, long talk with them. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll bother us anymore. I know Hector won\u2019t. Joseph took him into custody to answer for the crimes of those he led.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Sanginar will put a peace binding on him. Then they\u2019ll let him go.\u201d Zach didn\u2019t sound happy about that last part.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a peace binding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way of keeping someone from choosing to harm us. Anytime he tries to hurt us, it will make him hurt instead. It\u2019s usually nonlethal, effective, and much better than he deserves. He should be executed for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cLet it go. He\u2019s not worth our time. Except, maybe just enough to see how he reacts to that peace binding thing. I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s grin was feral. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get to, honey.\u201d</p><p>She stifled a yawn. \u201cWith Hector out of the picture, the Defenders will need a new leader\u2014someone who\u2019s willing to help us fight the Synestryn. Maybe we can convince Jake to take the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like his father. He\u2019s reasonable and kind. I\u2019d like to talk to him, bring him here, let him see what I have.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might be able to make him and the rest of the Defenders an ally. They\u2019re already out there. They know about the monsters. We might as well use their eyes and ears. Besides, most of them are proud men. Allowing them to help us may be the only chance we have to protect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to Joseph about it when you\u2019re better to see if he\u2019ll allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on my own a long time. I\u2019m not going to start asking permission to talk to people. I\u2019ll damn well talk to who I want, when I want.\u201d</p><p>Zach gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cYour chin\u2019s back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tapped her chin with his forefinger. \u201cWhenever you get stubborn about something, really dig in your heels, your chin goes up.\u201d</p><p>She thrust it higher, making him laugh. The joyful sound floated over her, easing her body\u2019s aches, mending the bruises on her spirit caused by suffering through all that fear. It was going to take her a while to get over a scare like that, but she knew Zach would be with her, helping her through.</p><p>Lucien gritted his teeth against the pain of traveling to Earth. Steam rose from his skin and held his concentration until the shimmering gate closed behind him.</p><p>The Sentinel Stone was cool and solid under his fingers, its detailed carvings biting into his side as his weight slumped against it.</p><p>As the last light of the portal faded, Lucien let go and slid to the soft grass at his feet.</p><p>It was night here, of course. They could only come here at night. Sunlight bowed to the Solarc\u2019s command, and would give away the trespass of an errant son like him as surely as if they were standing in the same room. Only careful calculation and planning would ensure that none of the men who traveled here as Lucien did would fall under the Solarc\u2019s gaze.</p><p>As Lucien\u2019s senses began working again, he drew in the scent of dust and freshly trimmed grass. He heard voices in the distance, though whether they were human or Sentinel he couldn\u2019t say. The sky was dark, the stars hidden by the nearby glow of human lighting.</p><p>Lucien squinted to sharpen his focus and recognized the strong lines of Dabyr looming only a few yards away.</p><p>His calculations had been right. He\u2019d ported through the right Sentinel Stone. Now all he had to do was find out exactly when he\u2019d arrived.</p><p>Those voices rose higher, the guttural English words stabbing at his sore ears. Lucien pushed himself to his feet in time to see a throng of armed Theronai headed right for him.</p><p>Knowing this could end badly for all involved, Lucien held up his hands, showing them naked of weapons.</p><p>The men gathered around, their swords shining bright under the light of the single moon. \u201cWho are you?\u201d demanded the man in front. He had a weathered face and bright blue eyes shadowed with sorrow.</p><p>\u201cI am Prince Lucien, son of the Solarc,\u201d he said, his mouth clumsy around the sharp edges of their language.</p><p>An overabundance of suspicious eyes narrowed at him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d asked the man.</p><p>\u201cI ported in through the Sentinel Stone.\u201d</p><p>The bodies of the men parted, allowing a woman to pass. She had long black hair and wore a gray gown. Though she was small, her presence filled the open space as her black eyes fell upon him. The luceria around her throat shimmered, marking her as one of his father\u2019s creation.</p><p>Lucien bowed his head. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said, imbuing his tone with respect.</p><p>The man who had been speaking to Lucien took a protective step nearer the woman, obviously her mate.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Too many reasons to name, so Lucien focused on the one foremost in his mind. \u201cI sensed my daughters were here. I had hoped to set eyes on them.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips parted in shock. \u201cDaughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are they here?\u201d Lucien asked.</p><p>\u201cI am Gilda, the Gray Lady,\u201d said the woman. \u201cIf your daughters are here, you may see them. What are their names?\u201d</p><p>The strange, human names fell easily from his lips though he\u2019d never spoken them aloud in his own home for fear of his father hearing. \u201cJackie, Helen and Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>A feminine gasp rose up from the back of the group, and a woman stepped forward. Her hair lay in twin plaits over her shoulders and the gentle curve of her cheek, so much like her mother\u2019s, made his fingers itch to reach out and touch her to see if she was real. The luceria at her throat was a rich, fiery red.</p><p>Lucien had never set eyes on her before, but he knew in an instant that she was of his blood. His daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Helen,\u201d she said, her soft voice wavering with emotion.</p><p>Lucien lurched forward, his body clumsy from the physical toll his travel had taken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A dark man at Helen\u2019s side lifted his blade and shifted his body so that it shielded Helen\u2019s. \u201cStay back,\u201d he warned, his mouth tight with anger.</p><p>\u201cForgive my lack of grace,\u201d he begged. \u201cI have no intent to frighten any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me by, Drake,\u201d said Helen. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The crowd around them began to grow, and hushed voices repeated for the newcomers what had passed.</p> <p>Helen reached out her hand and Lucien saw that it trembled. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAthanasia.\u201d</p><p>Gilda hissed and pulled Helen\u2019s hand back. \u201cLiar. The gate is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me. Nor to a few of my brothers who also pass through to this world.\u201d</p><p>Gilda didn\u2019t believe him. He could see her mistrust shining on her face. \u201cWhy do you come now?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing the war against the Synestryn. My father\u2019s anger barred the gate shut, but a few of us know the folly in that. We know that if you Sentinels fall, there will be nothing left to stand between us and the Synestryn. We have grown weak in our decadence. They would destroy us.\u201d</p><p>Gilda\u2019s voice trembled with rage. \u201cSo, you came here to beg us for help? To build our morale so we\u2019d fight harder? Do you really think that we care whether or not your people are wiped from the universe? Do you think we\u2019re willing to sacrifice more for you who shun us?\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s heart ached hearing the bitterness spewing from this woman. Only the deepest loss created anger such as hers. A loss Lucien knew all too well. \u201cHow many of your children have died?\u201d he asked in a tender voice.</p><p>Gilda\u2019s jaw hardened, but he saw the sheen of tears brighten her black eyes for a mere second before anger burned them away. \u201cGo back to where you came from. We have no need of you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do,\u201d said Lucien, looking out to the desperate men gathered around him. \u201cYour men are dying, and my brothers and I have been working for a long time to save them.\u201d</p><p>The man bonded to Gilda caught on first. \u201cYou\u2019ve come here and bedded human women, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Lucien nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve sired daughters. It\u2019s hard to know how many since we can\u2019t travel here often, and time passes much more swiftly here on Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d whispered Helen. \u201cYou were her one-night stand?\u201d</p><p>Lucien frowned at the term, not understanding. \u201cI lay with your mother, if that\u2019s what you mean. And seeing you here, a grown woman. . . . I met her only months ago. Had you been born in my world, you\u2019d yet be a babe.\u201d</p><p>Helen looked at her husband, then back at Lucien. \u201cI thought you\u2019d abandoned us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. If I\u2019d been able, I would have been with you every day. But it is . . . impossible.\u201d</p><p>Helen stepped forward and took Lucien into her arms. He stood there, stiff in her embrace, unsure of what to do. He didn\u2019t know her, hadn\u2019t seen her grow, and yet he loved her still. How could that be? How could so much love pour out of him and he still remain intact?</p><p>Lucien didn\u2019t know, but now, in this moment, he didn\u2019t care. Helen was here and safe. She\u2019d found her place among these people.</p><p>She pulled away, sniffing back tears. \u201cYou said there were others. I have sisters?\u201d</p> <p>Lucien nodded. \u201cTwo. Jackie and Alexandra. Are they here?\u201d</p><p>Gilda shook her head. \u201cNo. But we must find them. Assuming they are still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d said Helen\u2019s husband. \u201cAlexandra might be Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes widened and she scrambled for something in her pocket. She toyed with it a moment. \u201cLexi. What\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s daughter smiled and it was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen in his long, long life.</p><p>\u201cYou should come outside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>C</p><p>hapter 27</p><p>Lexi and Zach rushed outside toward the commotion in the training yard. Lexi\u2019s body was still a little weak and Zach was right at her side, his strong arm at her elbow, supporting her.</p><p>A throng of people had gathered around the engraved boulder on the training field, and at the center of that commotion was a man Lexi had never seen before.</p><p>He had odd liquid gold eyes and rich, dark hair. He was beautiful in the same perfect way the Sanguinar were\u2014as if he\u2019d been sculpted to sit on a shelf and be admired\u2014but he didn\u2019t have their pale, gaunt features. He looked healthy. Robust, like the Theronai.</p><p>Helen stood at the edge of the crowd, anxiously shifting her weight from foot to foot as she waited for Lexi to come near. She looked younger, and was glowing with a childlike glee.</p><p>Just seeing her friend look so happy made Lexi\u2019s heart warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to believe it,\u201d said Helen. She clamped her lips shut like she was holding in a secret, then blurted out, \u201cOur father is here. He came from this other world where the Sentinels all came from. He wants to meet us.\u201d</p><p>Meet us? Us?</p><p>The import of Helen\u2019s words finally sank in and Lexi had to grab Zach\u2019s arm to keep from sinking to the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters?\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded, making her braids sway; then she hugged Lexi tight around the neck. \u201cNo wonder I spilled my guts to you when I barely knew you. I guess we had a connection even then.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was too stunned to speak. It was too much to believe. Her father was some kind of alien from another world. And he was here.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d whispered Zach. His grip on her arm tightened and he slid his arm around her body to steady her. She hadn\u2019t realized until then that she\u2019d nearly fallen on her ass.</p><p>\u201cI want to see him,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>Helen led her forward to the man with the odd swirling gold eyes. Lexi looked up at him, really looked. He stood there silently, letting her study him, not even blinking, but his eyes were liquid with emotion.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the guy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He frowned slightly for a second, then nodded. \u201cI wish I could have found you sooner,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He flinched and Lexi wanted to take the words back.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t be here, Lexi,\u201d said Helen. \u201cOn our planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-six. I think he could have found the time in there somewhere to make the trip. At least send a postcard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is different there. Plus, he has to be careful. If his father finds out he\u2019s here, he\u2019ll be executed.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s father reached out his hand. \u201cNo, she\u2019s right. I should have found a way. I\u2019m sorry, Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi,\u201d she said. \u201cI go by Lexi now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and she saw his mouth form the word silently as if memorizing it. \u201cI am Lucien.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s fingers slid over her arm, soothing her. Lexi wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about all this, but she knew one thing for sure: life was too short to hold grudges. Whatever his reasons for not being in her life, he was here now. She didn\u2019t want to lose whatever time she\u2019d have with him by being angry.</p><p>Lexi ignored his outstretched hand and hugged him. He wrapped his arms around her, and although he didn\u2019t look old enough to be her father, she knew in that instant that he was. She felt his love surging through her, filling in all the empty holes her past had left behind.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s gone,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a good woman.\u201d And Lexi knew then it was true. Sure, her mom had been wrong about a lot of things, but she\u2019d gotten the big things right. She\u2019d taught Lexi to be strong, to stand up for herself and to take care of the people around her. She\u2019d given her love and taught her the important things, like treasuring every day and never giving up. She\u2019d taught Lexi how to love unconditionally.</p><p>And now, standing in front of this man she didn\u2019t know, Lexi let that lesson live on. She was going to love this man, her father, regardless of his failings. He hadn\u2019t been there for her all her life, but he was here now. And he\u2019d given her Helen. He\u2019d given her a family.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot long. Just until sunrise.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hopes sank. \u201cThat\u2019s only a few hours.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s the way it must be. If the Solarc learns I\u2019ve come here, your life and the lives of your sisters will be in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters? As in plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackie is not here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must find her.\u201d He lifted his head and addressed the men. \u201cShe may be able to save one of you. And there are others. Daughters of my brothers and cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cMore than twoscore, though we know not if they all live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you having more children?\u201d asked one of the Sanguinar Lexi had not yet met.</p><p>Lucien\u2019s eyes dimmed with sadness. \u201cNot I. I cannot come back. Too many trips through the gate weakens us. It\u2019s hard to shield our passage, and we must prevent detection above all else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are others who are coming?\u201d the Sanguinar asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. More join our cause every day. We know you are all struggling. Suffering. We seek to help you in any way we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starving,\u201d said the Sanguinar. \u201cWe need more blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We do what we can, but we will not risk getting caught. Before I leave, you may have some of my blood. It will sustain you for a while.\u201d</p><p>The Sanguinar\u2019s eyes glowed an eerie silver, and Lexi felt a shiver of revulsion run through her father\u2019s body.</p><p>Lucien reached inside his shirt and pulled out a photo. \u201cHere are three more women you should find. Daughters of my brother, Eron.\u201d</p><p>Beside Lexi, Helen gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s Andra and Nika when they were young.\u201d</p><p>Andra moved forward and took the photo out of Lexi\u2019s hand. \u201cIt is. This was taken right before Tori was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTori?\u201d asked Lucien.</p><p>Andra\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cOur baby sister.\u201d</p><p>Lucien held his hand out for the photo. \u201cI would ask you let me take this token of remembrance back to your father. I would gladly issue him a message should you wish me to do so.\u201d</p><p>Andra gave a tight nod. \u201cTell him I am fine, as you can see. Nika is alive, and Tori is dead.\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s eyes shut and she heard a string of fluid, graceful words leave his lips. \u201cI am sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we had each other growing up,\u201d said Andra. \u201cYou can thank him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see Nika? Speak to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Andra. \u201cShe\u2019s too . . . weak for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a healer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend one,\u201d demanded Andra. \u201cIf there is one of you who can heal her mind, then you can send him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try,\u201d said Lucien. \u201cI vow it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra\u2019s knees buckled and Paul grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d said Angus in a booming voice. \u201cLet\u2019s give Helen and Lexi some time alone with their father.\u201d</p><p>The crowd cleared out, but didn\u2019t go far. Not that Lexi blamed them. It wasn\u2019t every day that an alien came to visit.</p><p>\u201cTell me of your lives,\u201d asked Lucien. \u201cI would like to have bits and pieces of you to take back with me to warm my thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was hard at first, Lexi found shining slivers of her life to share with the father she\u2019d never known. As Helen and she shared stories, they flowed out more easily, and Lexi realized that her life hadn\u2019t been nearly as grim as she\u2019d imagined. There were lots of good times, and this one, sitting around under the stars with her newfound family, was now going to be tucked among them.</p><p>Slowly, the sun crept toward the horizon, signaling their time was at an end. Helen and Lexi bid Lucien good-bye with sloppy, teary hugs all around. Zach found a digital camera and took pictures of them together, printing one out for their father to take with him.</p><p>Lucien held his to his heart and wept. Those tears were still falling as he raised his hand and summoned a ring of shimmering light.</p><p>Lexi held Helen\u2019s hand as he stepped into that light and vanished.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever see him again?\u201d asked Helen.</p> <p>\u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe things will change. Maybe this Solarc asshole will stop being a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have asked Lucien if that was possible,\u201d said Lexi.</p><p>Helen blushed. \u201cI\u2019d never talk that way in front of my dad. Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked at Helen and burst out in giggles.</p><p>They clung to each other, laughing and crying as the sun came up.</p> <p>Chapter 28</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t stand the idea of going back inside right now. The morning air felt good on her skin\u2014cool and clear and scented with dewy grass. And Zach. He was at her side, her silent shadow, allowing her the time she needed to absorb everything that had happened to her in a short few days.</p><p>She had a father. A sister. A home.</p><p>It was more than she\u2019d ever hoped for, and making it even sweeter was the fact that she had Zach to share in her joy.</p><p>\u201cYou should go back in and rest,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes. I just want to feel the sun on my face for a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and slipped his fingers through hers. His ring gave off a happy buzz, and she felt a current of energy slide up her arm, warming her.</p><p>Lexi ran her hand along the stone wall surrounding Dabyr, tracing it with her finger as she neared the broken section. There were a few Theronai posted to guard the opening, but most of the activity had dwindled. Without Helen and Gilda, there was little they could do. Apparently, each stone could only be put in place after the women had done their magic.</p> <p>Lexi could feel that magic running through the rock at her fingertips. It was old and had once been powerful, but that power had grown weary over time, allowing small cracks in the armor to form. Those cracks called out to her, begging to be filled. She could almost hear their creaking voices rasping at her.</p><p>A churning ribbon of power wove through her, and for the first time, Lexi knew what Helen meant. That power was there, flowing easily into Lexi\u2019s fingertips, obeying her will.</p><p>She wanted Dabyr to be a safe place for all who lived here. She wanted the children to go to sleep at night without wondering if this would be the one the monsters found them. She wanted them to play and laugh and know in their hearts that for as long as they stayed within these walls, nothing could harm them.</p><p>All that want\u2014all that need\u2014came sliding out of Lexi, traveling through her fingers into the chunks of stone beneath them.</p><p>Subtle cracks along the surface fused together and deeper ones, ones she could only see inside her mind, closed shut. A deep grating vibration spread down the wall, away from the opening. Lexi watched as it moved into the trees, casting resting birds into the air. She saw ripples form on the surface of the lake, heard the frightened cry of people near the main building.</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d said Zach in a low, questioning tone. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFixing the wall.\u201d</p><p>She kept pouring power into the task, feeling it flow through her like water, liquid and easy. Molecules of rock shifted, locking tighter together until the surface of the stone gleamed like a hard shell.</p><p>Armed men came running their way and the few guards posted here turned to gawk at her.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d she asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just . . . amazing. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re doing in seconds what others have been trying to do for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I stop? I don\u2019t want to hurt any feelings.\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at her, his green eyes glowing with love and pride. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. This is a good thing, Lexi. Very good.\u201d</p><p>After a brief explanation by Zach, men started hauling rock into the jagged opening. Lexi touched each stone as it was laid, lacing it with a living power that would survive long after she was dead and gone. It got harder as she went along, but she never once broke her stride or felt the need to stop.</p><p>She and Zach were covered in dust and sweat when Helen found them. \u201cWow, Lexi! You rock.\u201d</p><p>Lexi groaned at the bad pun.</p><p>Helen surveyed the work, which was nearly complete. \u201cHow did you do this?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her gift,\u201d said Zach. \u201cProtection is Lexi\u2019s gift the way fire is yours, Helen. It\u2019s how she survived that bomb. I just didn\u2019t figure it out until I saw this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d said Helen. \u201cI wonder what our other sister\u2019s gift will be.\u201d</p><p>Zach grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but if she\u2019s out there, our men will find her and bring her back. You won\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we can be a family,\u201d said Lexi as she grabbed Zach\u2019s arm to gain his undivided attention. \u201cAll of us.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s grin widened and he looped his arms around her waist. \u201cYou think I want to be a part of a crazy family like yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>Lexi let him have it. She opened up the floodgates that had stood between them for far too long, letting him experience everything she felt for him. She played it through her mind in fast motion, from her initial fear, through the mistrust, to hesitant hope, to the very end. A bright, shiny love she was sure would never fade or tarnish.</p><p>Zach\u2019s fingers clenched against her waist and his eyes fell shut. A deep groan of pleasure rose from his chest and became a soft sigh of joy.</p><p>When he opened his eyes they were shining with happiness. \u201cGod, I love you, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because my dad\u2019s a prince.\u201d</p><p>He let out a booming laugh and tipped her chin up with his finger. \u201cTell me you love me, too. Here. In front of witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, sensing how important this was to him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want them all to know how lucky I am.\u201d</p><p>Lexi went up on her tiptoes and kissed him, not caring that they had an audience who had now begun to cheer. Helen\u2019s shouts of joy were the loudest.</p><p>Sisters. Sheesh.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she told him, grinning. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better not make me regret it.\u201d</p><p>Zach grinned right back. \u201cNo promises.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
