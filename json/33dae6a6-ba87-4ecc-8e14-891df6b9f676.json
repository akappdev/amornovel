Am I showing enough cleavage?\u201d</p><p>Lorelei stares me up and down, and in an uncharacteristic move from my slightly uptight best friend, she reaches out and unbuttons the top button of the already-plunging neck of my halter vest. I was almost popping out of my top as it was. Now I\u2019m going to have to hold my breath to keep the girls contained.</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s better. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>As we walk side by side into Sean O\u2019Casey\u2019s Irish Pub, I put on my game face. Tonight, I\u2019m not Paige McCarty, world-renowned model; I am Paige McCarty\u2014man bait. My best friends Lorelei Warner and Kennedy O\u2019Brien and I own our own private investigative firm called Fool Me Once Investigations, which was started after we were all screwed over by the men in our lives.</p><p>My ex\u2014he threw away our entire life savings on his gambling habit. Do you want to know how I found out that Andy had a gambling problem? I had just found a pair of Christian Louboutins that were TO DIE for. Seriously. Black slingbacks with a peep toe, silver spike embellishments, and a black bow with spikes right by the toe. I almost cried. Actually, I did cry when all three of my credit cards were declined when I took the shoes up to the counter to pay for them. Maxed out. Over the limit. No more shoe purchases that day, or maybe ever. I figured it was just some sort of mistake until the snotty store clerk handed over the phone when she called the credit card company. Six hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of debt. I know I have a slight problem when it comes to buying shoes, but not a six-hundred-thousand-dollar problem!</p><p>I confronted Andy that night when he got home from work, and the weasel broke down sobbing in the middle of our living room. He racked up that much debt in just three short months. Three months of flying to Vegas and Atlantic City when he was supposed to be in Silicon Valley at software conferences.</p><p>Lying sack of shit.</p><p>But right now, I don\u2019t have time to think about how much I still want to strangle my ex, because I have a job to do. I have a cheating husband to catch in the act. A man by the name of Matt Russo.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, so according to his file, Matt is a graphic designer and his wife, Melanie, says he\u2019s been spending too much time away from the house and not enough time with her.\u201d Lorelei fills me in as we walk through O\u2019Casey\u2019s.</p><p>Lorelei has been doing some light surveillance of him the past few weeks: staking out his place, following him to work\u2014that sort of thing. Since his wife swears she\u2019s seen texts from another woman on his phone, and he\u2019s been extra secretive around her lately, it\u2019s time to up our game. Lorelei never saw him doing anything suspicious like sneaking out at lunch with his arm around a bimbo.</p><p>And this is where I come in: the bimbo.</p><p>\u201cI already hate the bastard and I haven\u2019t even met him. Why do men feel the need to lie? If you\u2019re not happy, just tell us. We\u2019ll help you pack,\u201d I complain.</p><p>My heels click on the floor of the pub as I make my way over to the bar. Tonight I\u2019m wearing one of my favorite bait outfits: a nice little ensemble I like to call \u201cmy eyes are up here, moron.\u201d My top is a gray pinstripe halter vest: completely backless and held together in the front with just four tiny buttons. Well, three buttons now, thanks to Lorelei. If I make sure not to take deep breaths, my all-natural 34Cs should stay put.</p><p>\u201cI see him\u2014over there at the end of the bar, nursing a beer,\u201d Lorelei says quietly next to me.</p> <p>My gaze zeroes in on our subject and I take a moment to watch him unnoticed. He looks exactly like his picture in the file. Black hair, short on the sides and messy on top; dark stubble around a jaw that I can\u2019t deny is a little delicious to look at; and a pair of black, trendy glasses perched on his nose. My ex wore a pair of those glasses. He didn\u2019t need glasses, but he thought they made him look cool.</p><p>They didn\u2019t.</p><p>Matt is wearing a blue-and-white-striped button-down with a navy blue V-necked sweater over it with a pair of khaki dress pants. Nerdy chic. Super. It\u2019s like someone packaged up Andy and stuck him in this bar just for me. Remind me again why I picked this job instead of the easy subpoena delivery that Lorelei got?</p><p>\u201cWow, he looks a lot like Andy,\u201d Lorelei says, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t remind me. I kind of want to slam his face into the bar right now.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei pulls a small Nikon camera out of her purse and checks the zoom lens.</p><p>\u201cPlease refrain from beating up the subject until I can get a good shot of him making out with you,\u201d she tells me in a bored voice before putting the camera back in her bag.</p><p>Right. The job. Fool Me Once Investigations was started because the three of us wanted to help other women avoid looking like fools when the men in their lives played them. We take other cases to help pay the bills, but coming to the rescue of our fellow woman scorned is what we prefer. I need to remember that this is just a job and not a way for me to channel my anger at Andy through someone else. All I have to do is make nice with the little cheater, chat him up, buy him a few drinks, and then get him to kiss me. Piece of cake and bam, the wife is vindicated and can happily take her photos to her lawyer. I\u2019ve done it a hundred times.</p> <p>Oh, don\u2019t look at me like that\u2014I\u2019m not a whore. Even though my mother seems to think I am whenever I tell her I\u2019m out on another job. They say you have to kiss a few frogs before you meet your Prince Charming. Well, I\u2019m kissing a thousand frogs to show other women that Prince Charming will screw you over the first chance he gets.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wish me luck,\u201d I tell Lorelei before fluffing my hair and strutting over to the bar. Just like always, Lorelei takes a seat at one of the booths across from the bar with a clear view of the subject. We\u2019ve done this so many times together that we\u2019ve got it down to a science. All I have to do is say my name and no matter who the guy is, his eyes will light up with recognition. I know, that makes me sound a little conceited, but I swear I\u2019m not. It\u2019s the truth.</p><p>I used to like the fact that whenever I told a guy my name you could see his mind racing as he remembered all of the pictures he\u2019d seen of me on magazine covers. It made me feel special and wanted and beautiful. Now it\u2019s just annoying. Just once it would be nice for a guy to have no idea who I am\u2014to like me for me. To be with a guy who has no expectation that you will look magazine-cover ready first thing in the morning.</p><p>Andy liked having arm candy for a wife. He liked taking me out and showing me off. It was sweet at first, and then it got old. He wasn\u2019t happy just sitting at home on a Friday night, wearing sweats and watching a movie. He always wanted to show me off to his friends.</p><p>Fucking Andy!</p><p>Sliding onto the bar stool next to Matt, I signal the waiter and he comes rushing over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a lemon-drop martini and one of whatever this handsome man next to me is having,\u201d I tell the bartender with a wink.</p><p>Matt looks up from his drink and blinks at me in surprise.</p><p>Wow, he has really blue eyes. Like, really blue. And he smells delicious. That cologne is making my girly bits tingle. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Burberry Touch. I have a nose for good cologne.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks, but I\u2019m good,\u201d he tells me with a distracted smile before looking back down at his half-empty glass of beer.</p><p>Um, okaaaay. Let\u2019s try this again.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Paige,\u201d I tell him brightly, sticking my hand out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. Matthew,\u201d he tells me distractedly.</p><p>His warm hand engulfs mine and he shakes it once before pulling it away and going right back to looking down in his glass.</p><p>Fine. On to Plan B.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paige McCarty, by the way,\u201d I tell him sweetly, enunciating my last name. I was on the cover of Maxim last month. He\u2019ll be asking for an autographed copy in three seconds.</p><p>\u201cDid you say McCarty?\u201d he asks, finally looking up and staring at my face.</p><p>Here we go . . .</p><p>\u201cI sure did, handsome,\u201d I tell him with a wink.</p><p>God, this is nauseating. I really am better than this. I need to talk to Kennedy about putting me on some different jobs. This is getting to be too degrading.</p><p>\u201cMy mother is Irish. Her maiden name was McCarty.\u201d</p><p>I do nothing but sit here staring at him with my mouth open. He could be lying, considering he\u2019s a cheater and that\u2019s what they\u2019re good at, but something tells me he seriously has no idea who I am. My spidey senses are not screaming \u201clying sack of shit\u201d right at this moment. Obviously, they\u2019re on the fritz. A woman doesn\u2019t just fork over a couple of grand to have her husband investigated for cheating. She has suspicions and it\u2019s my job to make sure they are validated, not question the authenticity of this guy\u2019s morals.</p><p>Matt slides off of his stool and throws a twenty down on top of the bar.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice meeting you, Paige McCarty. Be careful on your way home. This isn\u2019t the best neighborhood for a woman to be alone in at night.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Matt gives me a polite nod, turns, and walks out of the bar\u2014without even attempting to flirt with me or ask me to go home with him.</p><p>Shame on me for thinking this job was going to be a piece of cake.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>I\u2019m thinking of wearing jeans and a nice tank top to dinner with Griffin tonight. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I look up at Kennedy as she paces back and forth in front of my desk. Kennedy is going on her first official date with Griffin tonight. They\u2019ve been hot and heavy for a few weeks working on a bail-jumper case and due to some genius thinking on Griffin\u2019s part, he finally got Kennedy to go on a real date with him. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to be the highlight of her family\u2019s week, since they\u2019ve wanted the two of them together forever.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot dress like a hobo to go on a date with Griffin.\u201d I shake my head at her and she rolls her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cJeans and a tank are not hobo wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKennedy, comfort should not be your first order of business when planning your attire for the evening. It should be picking an outfit that makes him want to skip the date just to rip your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy sits down at her desk in a huff and crosses her arms in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThis is dumb. We already skipped to that part. Several times. I don\u2019t know why this date is such a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s romantic and sweet. Griffin wants to treat you well and prove to you that he\u2019s not with you just for sex. Wear something red and show off your legs,\u201d I tell her, powering up my laptop.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not suggesting I wear a dress,\u201d she grumbles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing a dress. You\u2019re also going to wear heels. Quit your bitching.\u201d</p><p>While Kennedy moans and groans about stupid men and something about seeing her in a dress at prom if he wouldn\u2019t have ditched her, I decide against asking her how to find more information on Matt Russo. She\u2019s got enough on her plate tonight. Going right to Google, I type in Matt\u2019s name and wait for the hits to load.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing I can\u2019t just stop at Walmart on my way home and find this red dress you speak of, can I?\u201d Kennedy asks as she grabs her keys from her desk and stands up.</p><p>\u201cIf you buy a dress from Walmart for this date, I will disown you.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from my computer, I dig into my purse, pull out a business card, and hand it to her. \u201cGo to Nordstrom and ask for Alicia. She used to be my personal shopper, you know, before Andy decided all my hard-earned money should be flushed down the toilet. She will find you something amazing.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy looks at the card for a few seconds and then shoves it into the back pocket of her jeans as her dad, Buddy, walks through the front door of the office. \u201cI feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Except I\u2019m not a hooker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please tell that to my friends at the VFW? They\u2019re still asking me about the escort service ad Griffin ran in the newspaper last week. They\u2019re concerned that you aren\u2019t returning their calls because you used the Google on them and saw that they\u2019re all old as dirt,\u201d Buddy states. \u201cI reassured them that you are a good person and would never discriminate based on age.\u201d</p><p>During Kennedy and Griffin\u2019s brief courtship, if that\u2019s what you want to call it, Griffin decided to get back at Kennedy for a joke we played on him by placing an ad in the local paper that said Fool Me Once Investigations was an escort service. Buddy is having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that it\u2019s not true.</p><p>\u201cDad, still not a hooker. How about you just tell them that?\u201d</p><p>Buddy looks at her like she\u2019s insane. \u201cI\u2019m the most popular guy at the VFW right now, Kennedy. People yell my name when I walk in and everyone buys me drinks. I\u2019m not about to kill my popularity. This is the only thing I have to live for. Don\u2019t deny me this.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy gives up the argument for today, kisses Buddy on the cheek, and heads out of the office, hopefully to buy a dress.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now that she\u2019s gone, here\u2019s the plan for tonight. The whole family is going to stop by so we can see Kennedy and Griffin off on their date,\u201d Buddy whispers to me, looking over his shoulder to make sure Kennedy didn\u2019t sneak back in.</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s going to kill you, right? She doesn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of this.\u201d</p><p>Buddy shrugs and backs toward the door. \u201cMy daughter is finally dating Griffin. I never thought I\u2019d see the day those two would finally get their heads out of their asses. I want a front-row seat so I can make sure it actually happens and she doesn\u2019t chicken out.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at Buddy and he gives me a small wave over his shoulder before walking out the door.</p><p>Once he\u2019s gone, I get back to my Google search. The file we have on Matt isn\u2019t very detailed, since all we really need to know about Matt for this case is where he\u2019ll be at certain times of the day so we can follow him. He\u2019s not a criminal\u2014that we know of\u2014so Lorelei didn\u2019t need to do an extensive court-record search on him. And he didn\u2019t break the law, so Kennedy doesn\u2019t need to hunt him down and kick his ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know my job is to just sit and look pretty, but I\u2019m tired of that nonsense. I\u2019m smart and resourceful; maybe if I go above and beyond my typical duties, Kennedy will trust me to handle some real cases. Cases where I need to learn to shoot a gun and put my newly learned self-defense moves to work.</p><p>Sure, looking deeper into Matt Russo\u2019s background isn\u2019t going to have me running through the streets chasing down bad guys, but at least it will show that I\u2019m taking initiative.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, twenty-five Matt Russo Facebook pages. Let\u2019s see, only one is from South Bend, so let\u2019s go with that,\u201d I say aloud, clicking on his name.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful. Profile is set to private. What the hell, Matt? No one sets their profile to private unless they have something to hide. Do you have something to hide, Mr. Russo?\u201d</p><p>Backing out of Facebook, I click on the next site that Google found on him: LinkedIn.</p><p>Let\u2019s see here. Matt Russo is a graphic designer currently employed by Bolder Design Studio. I already knew this information, so this isn\u2019t helping me at all. He\u2019s an art nerd just like my ex is a computer nerd. No matter how cute he was last night, he\u2019s probably just as much of a tool as Andy. I don\u2019t know why that thought makes me sad. I don\u2019t even know the guy. Just because he didn\u2019t recognize me in the bar last night doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a stand-up person without a secret girlfriend.</p><p>But man alive, those blue eyes . . . I wonder what they would look like without the glasses. I wonder if they would darken if he was in my bed and I was taking his pants off.</p><p>Shit! What the hell is wrong with me? Matt Russo will not be in my bed, ever.</p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m always attracted to nerdy assholes. I don\u2019t know what that reason is right now, but I\u2019m sure there is one. I am going to focus on finding out if Matt Russo is really a cheater and that\u2019s it. I am not going to think about whether or not he\u2019s got a six-pack hiding under that sweater vest.</p><p>Deciding to nip this thing in the bud, I pick up my phone and dial the receptionist at Bolder Design Studio. The sooner I can end this case, the sooner I can find a hot guy who looks and acts nothing like my ex and bang the memory of glasses-wearing, sweater-vest-donning, computer geeks out of my system.</p><p>While the phone rings, I clear my throat and put on my best dumb-blonde act.</p><p>\u201cBolder Design, how can I help you?\u201d the receptionist answers.</p><p>\u201cHi, this is Chloe-with-an-e Marin,\u201d I respond with a giggle, using the name of the woman Kennedy found her husband boning when she came home from a tour in Afghanistan. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I am such an idiot, but I was supposed to have a meeting with Mr. Russo this evening so he could help me design my new adult video website and I TOTALLY forgot the time and where we\u2019re supposed to meet.\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m laying it on thick. Whatever. I hate that Chloe bitch and I firmly believe she does porn on the side.</p> <p>\u201cHold on just one second. Let me pull up Mr. Russo\u2019s calendar.\u201d</p><p>I giggle again for added effect while I hear her clicking away at her computer through the line.</p><p>\u201cHere we go. Hmmm, I don\u2019t see anything on his calendar with you tonight, Miss Marin. He does have a dinner scheduled at Blake\u2019s Seafood at five, but he must have forgotten to add your name.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to thank the Academy . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Blake\u2019s at five. You are such a doll!\u201d</p><p>I quickly thank the clueless woman and disconnect the call. Glancing at the clock on the wall, I see that I have an hour and a half before I need to get to Blake\u2019s. Just enough time to run home and freshen up. I\u2019m assuming that Matt is smart enough not to put the name of his rendezvous location with his suspected mistress on his work calendar, but you never know. Running over to Lorelei\u2019s desk, I grab the Nikon out of the top drawer and shove it into my purse. Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and catch him canoodling with a waitress in a dark corner. I can snap a picture and be gone, never to think of naked Matt Russo again.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Walking through the door of Blake\u2019s Seafood Restaurant, I scan my reflection in the mirror next to the hostess station. I know it doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m wearing since I plan on hiding in a corner and spying on Matt, but it\u2019s impossible for me to go out in public without looking good. Every once in a while I\u2019m recognized by a fan, which is actually a plus in this line of work, because the guy I\u2019m trying to catch cheating would never suspect that I\u2019m an investigator.</p> <p>I kept it casual tonight with a royal blue cotton strapless dress that falls right above my knees with a matching pair of blue open-toed Gucci heels. Signaling to the hostess on the phone that I was just going to head to the bar, I make my way into the main part of the restaurant and to the corner of the bar closest to me. With my back to the wall and a drink menu up in front of my face, I peer over the top, scoping out the restaurant. I immediately spy Matt on the other side of the room in his own dark corner.</p><p>Mmm-hmmm, just what I thought. Hiding in a corner\u2014all the better to make out with your mistress. Ordering a glass of white wine, I crouch low on my stool and keep an eye on Mr. Cheater McCheatpants.</p><p>After an hour, two more glasses of wine, and seven shredded cocktail napkins, my ass is starting to fall asleep on the bar stool and I actually catch myself yawning. This is pathetic. What kind of a cheater is this guy? All he\u2019s done in the last sixty minutes is look at the screen on his cell phone and glance toward the door over and over again. Maybe his home-wrecker girlfriend stood him up. Serves the guy right.</p><p>Sliding off of the bar stool, I work out the kinks in my legs from sitting so long, staying close to the shadows in the corner. Turning back around quickly to make sure I don\u2019t miss anything from Matt\u2019s table, I slam right into a solid chest and my hands immediately press against it to steady myself. The smell of Burberry Touch cologne tingles my nose and butterflies flap rapidly in my stomach as I lift my head.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the woman from last night. Paige, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. I\u2019ve been made. Kennedy is going to kill me.</p><p>I stare into Matt\u2019s eyes as he smiles down at me, his hands still holding tightly to my arms. It could be the wine talking right now, but Jesus, he\u2019s really good-looking up close. He\u2019s removed his glasses and his sparkling blue eyes are staring right down at my face, taking in everything he sees.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds that we\u2019d run into each other again?\u201d Matt asks, the dimple in his left cheek forming when he cocks one side of his mouth up in a grin.</p><p>Oh, pretty good, considering I\u2019m following you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a nice coincidence,\u201d I tell him with a sultry smile. I don\u2019t care if he smells like heaven and I have a weakness for dimples, I\u2019m still here to do a job. Since I can no longer lurk in a dark corner and spy on him, maybe I can ply him with alcohol and get him to talk. It didn\u2019t work last night, but he doesn\u2019t seem as preoccupied as he did then. \u201cAre you here alone?\u201d</p><p>Matt nods his head and lets out a sigh. \u201cI am. Is it pathetic that I\u2019m sitting in the corner of a bar by myself on a Friday night?\u201d</p><p>He laughs easily at himself and runs a hand through his hair, making the spikes messy, and for some reason I want to reach up and smooth them back down.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like we\u2019re both pretty pathetic tonight, since I was doing the same thing,\u201d I tell him as I gesture over to my pile of shredded napkins on the bar next to my empty wineglasses.</p><p>\u201cSeveral glasses of wine AND mutilated napkins. You must be having a bad week,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cOne of my best friends fell madly in love and I have to go to a party later on tonight to toast to their happiness. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a good thing the bartender didn\u2019t put any knives in front of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckles and shakes his head. \u201cThose napkins never stood a chance. At least now I know to keep sharp objects far out of your reach.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbles up out of me before I can catch it. \u201cI\u2019m happy for them. Really, I am. I only think about stabbing my ex in the heart four times a day now instead of seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s progress right there. Pretty soon you\u2019ll only be thinking about lighting all of his things on fire,\u201d Matt replies with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, that ship has already sailed. You always burn their shit first, then you daydream about chopping off body parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like this conversation escalated very quickly,\u201d Matt says with another laugh and a raise of one eyebrow.</p><p>I have no idea why I even told him about Kennedy or Andy; it just spilled out of me. I\u2019ve never spoken to subjects about anything other than how good they look and how much money they make. In this line of work, it\u2019s always about them. Do whatever you can to make them feel special and important and they\u2019ll be eating out of your hands in no time. It\u2019s never taken me more than a few minutes to get a guy to show his true colors. A couple of seconds alone with Matt and I\u2019m laughing and forgetting why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I slide my hands off of his chest and take a few steps back. I need to get into character.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have a drink with me?\u201d I ask, gesturing to the bar stool next to mine.</p><p>Matt looks back at the door for a moment. My hackles immediately go up when I realize he\u2019s probably trying to decide if he should keep waiting for his \u201cdate\u201d or take a chance on scoring with a new girl. He\u2019s probably calculating the odds in his head and part of me hopes he\u2019ll turn me down. What kind of a man cheats on his wife and cheats on his mistress? That\u2019s just gross. When he turns back to face me with a smile and a shrug, I want to kick my own ass for being attracted to this douchebag.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take you up on that drink. I think I owe you one anyway. I was kind of a dick last night,\u201d he explains as he pulls out my stool for me and waits for me to sit down before taking his own seat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We all have bad nights,\u201d I tell him with a reassuring smile as I lean my elbows on the bar so I\u2019m closer to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again. Although right now, I think I\u2019m having more of a bad life instead of a bad week.\u201d</p><p>Geez, this guy is really that depressed that his mistress stood him up? His poor wife. Why the hell didn\u2019t I think of bringing a recorder with me? It would be a lot easier to just tape all this shit he\u2019s spewing than try to get him to make out with me. Shit! The camera is in my purse. Now that I\u2019m not going to be able to catch him with his mistress, I\u2019m back to Plan A and need to get him to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cWould you excuse me for a minute? I need to go to the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>I give him a wink, grab my purse from the bar, and quickly head toward the hostess station, glancing back over my shoulder to make sure he\u2019s not watching me.</p><p>Pulling the camera and a hundred-dollar bill out of my purse, I set the items down right in front of the hostess.</p><p>\u201cI need you to do me a huge favor. I\u2019ll give you another hundred dollars if you can get a few good pictures of me making out with that guy I\u2019m sitting next to at the bar,\u201d I tell her quickly, pointing to Matt, who still has his back to us and is chatting with the bartender.</p><p>\u201cAwww, how sweet! Why don\u2019t I just come over there now and take a picture? You don\u2019t have to pay me,\u201d the young girl replies happily.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. He can\u2019t know the picture is being taken. I\u2019m a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me in awe for a few minutes as I check over my shoulder again to make sure Matt is preoccupied.</p><p>\u201cWow. Are you, like, undercover? Do you work for the government? Am I being taped right now?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I back away from the hostess stand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. It\u2019s top-secret government work. I could tell you about it, but then I\u2019d have to kill you,\u201d I reply with seriousness.</p><p>Don\u2019t judge me. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes right now.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on me.\u201d She salutes me and clutches the camera close to her chest.</p><p>With a sigh, I turn around and rush back to Matt\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI ordered you another glass of white wine; I hope that\u2019s okay,\u201d he tells me with a smile as I take my seat next to him.</p><p>\u201cPerfect, thank you.\u201d I reach up and place my hand on his bicep, giving it a gentle squeeze, and act like it\u2019s perfectly natural for me to be touching him\u2014all part of the job. If you\u2019re touchy-feely with a subject, it will make them more inclined to be touchy-feely with you.</p><p>Rubbing my palm up and down his arm, I swallow thickly. Holy hell, he\u2019s got some muscles hidden under that button-down. I have to forcibly remove my hand from his arm, otherwise I might start looking for more muscle. Needing something to do with my hand other than molest him, I pick up my glass of wine and take a healthy swallow.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you do for a living, Paige McCarty?\u201d</p><p>The wine immediately goes down the wrong pipe and I begin coughing and sputtering. Matt reaches up and gently pats me on the back as I set my wineglass down. When I\u2019m finally able to catch my breath, I turn to look into his eyes to see if he\u2019s serious. I still find it hard to believe he has no idea who I am. There isn\u2019t a man alive under the age of fifty who doesn\u2019t know who I am. Maybe this is part of his shtick; his way of trying to charm me. Fine, Mr. Russo. We\u2019ll play it your way.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m a model,\u201d I reply with a smile.</p><p>He blinks in surprise and if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say it was genuine. \u201cWow, no kidding? Have you done a lot of work or are you just starting out?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to stare at him in shock. This guy is really good. I almost believe him. I\u2019m going to need to stay at the top of my game with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, just a few jobs here and there. Nothing you would have seen.\u201d</p><p>Why the hell am I lying to him? What difference does it make if he knows how famous I am?</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I hope someday I can see you in something, but the only magazines I read are ones about graphic design,\u201d he says with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cI wish my ex only read graphic design magazines. He subscribed to more magazines than any woman I\u2019ve ever met so he could pimp me out to every magazine editor he could find.\u201d</p><p>Shut up, Paige. He doesn\u2019t need to know your life story!</p><p>\u201cAll my ex cared about was my money, so it looks like we both made huge mistakes in our lives,\u201d Matt confides.</p><p>Wait, ex? Is he talking about Melanie or another ex? According to what Melanie told Kennedy, they\u2019re still married.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re divorced?\u201d</p> <p>Matt sighs deeply and takes a sip of his Jack and Coke. \u201cSeparated. Honestly, we probably should have never even gotten married. We met in college and all of my friends tried to warn me about her. She didn\u2019t show her true colors to me until we were married, though.\u201d</p><p>And now the investigator in me wants to know everything about her. Purely for business purposes, of course. It has nothing to do with the fact that he\u2019s easy on the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of true colors are we talking here? Crazy possessive female or was she really a man?\u201d I ask, trying to get him to smile again.</p><p>It does the trick. He barks out a laugh. \u201cNo, definitely not a man. I\u2019m pretty sure she only married me because she saw the dollar signs. She\u2019s going to try and take my father\u2019s company and there\u2019s no way I can let that happen.\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of my wine so I\u2019m not tempted to reach out and comfort him. \u201cWow, that\u2019s not good. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Matt shrugs. \u201cAnd to add more to my pathetic life story, I\u2019m positive she\u2019s been cheating on me. All I need is proof so I can end this bullshit charade of hers and make sure the company stays in the family.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth drops open at all he\u2019s admitted to me. He could be lying. This could be how he gets chicks\u2014by laying it on thick and playing the \u201cwoe is me\u201d card, but something tells me that\u2019s not the case. His voice immediately takes on a tone of sadness when he talks about his father\u2019s company, and my senses are screaming at me that he\u2019s telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou think your wife is cheating on you?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>This is too weird. Even for me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m telling you this. I barely know you and I feel like a jackass for unloading all of this on you right now. You\u2019re a really easy person to talk to.\u201d</p><p>He feels like a jackass? I feel like a jackass. I should just tell him right now that his wife hired me to find out if he is cheating, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do anything until I know for sure.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been happy for a really long time. Fuck. We were probably never really happy. A friend of mine told me she was going to be here and I guess I was just hoping to finally have a solid reason for not wanting to be married to her,\u201d he admits.</p><p>Jesus, the two of us could be a match made in heaven under different circumstances. Finding out Andy had a gambling problem had been just the catalyst I needed to kick his ass to the curb.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if you find out it\u2019s true and she\u2019s really cheating on you?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have proof that she\u2019s been unfaithful, I can threaten to out her to her family as a cheater. She\u2019ll leave the company alone so they never know her perfect character is tarnished.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit all to hell! I believe him. I believe him and now I want to help him. This is not good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p>Tell him the truth! Tell him his wife hired you and you feel awful and want to help him instead.</p><p>Before I can open my mouth and make a huge mistake, I watch as Matt\u2019s eyes widen as he stares across the bar.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. She\u2019s here,\u201d Matt says under his breath, ducking his head to hide behind me.</p><p>Turning my head, I see his wife, Melanie, coming through the doorway on the arm of a very large, very badass-looking man who\u2019s got to be twice her age.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s heading this way. Matt, she\u2019s totally going to see you. Shit! Hide under the bar!\u201d</p><p>Matt tries turning sideways to quickly dive under the bar, but his elbow slams into my glass, knocking it over and spilling wine down the front of my dress.</p><p>I let out a squeal as the cold liquid seeps through my dress and Matt quickly grabs a pile of napkins and starts blotting at my boobs. My breath gets caught in my throat as he presses his hands against my breasts and glances over his shoulder distractedly to see where Melanie is. He turns back and notices the shocked expression on my face and his eyes drop to his hand that is now just resting casually on my boob, practically cupping it.</p><p>I tear my eyes away from his hand and how good it feels against my chest and see that Melanie and her beefcake are a few feet away at this point and heading right toward us. If she looks away from her date, she\u2019s going to look right at Matt. There\u2019s not even any time for him to get up and run to the bathroom. He\u2019ll barrel right into her. Suddenly, the tables have turned and I\u2019m on Matt\u2019s side. I want him to catch her in the act. I want him to be vindicated so he can move on with his life.</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d</p><p>Before all of the words finish leaving my mouth, I feel Matt\u2019s arms wrap around my waist and I\u2019m hauled out of my stool and pulled between his legs. His mouth is on mine immediately and I don\u2019t even think about what I\u2019m doing. I wrap my arms around his neck and pull him closer.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>I hear the click of Melanie\u2019s heels as she walks past us and I know by now that we\u2019re in the clear and can pull away, but I stopped caring about anything as soon as I felt Matt\u2019s lips against mine. And when his tongue touches mine, I forget all about the fact that we\u2019re in a crowded restaurant making out. His lips are firm and his tongue is soft and this kiss is the best thing I\u2019ve experienced in my entire life.</p><p>As he softly explores my mouth, I pull him closer and mold my body against his. I\u2019m suddenly wishing we were anywhere but here. Somewhere I could straddle his hips and feel him between my legs. The kiss goes on and on as I tangle my fingers in his hair and hold him close, moaning softly into his mouth when he switches angles and deepens the kiss. I feel like I can\u2019t get enough of him and by the way his arms band tightly around me and hold me close, I know he feels the same.</p><p>The only thing that interrupts us is the soft sound of someone clearing her throat behind me.</p><p>\u201cSorry to bother you. Just checking to see if you guys need a refill or if there\u2019s anything I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>Regretfully ending the kiss, I turn my head without letting go of Matt and see the hostess standing next to us. She quite obviously winks at me and I realize that my fingers are still threaded through Matt\u2019s hair and his hands are dangerously close to my ass. And I\u2019m guessing by the sneaky look on this girl\u2019s face that she just got a bunch of awesome pictures of the two of us with my camera.</p><p>\u201cNope, we\u2019re good, thanks.\u201d I try to tell her with my eyes that she should go away but she doesn\u2019t get the hint.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m here to help. Would you like me to do anything else for you?\u201d she stresses. She attempts to wink at me again, her way of letting me know she got the photos. The way her face contorts makes it look like she\u2019s having a stroke.</p><p>\u201cMiss, are you okay?\u201d Matt asks her in concern, his arms still holding me close.</p><p>\u201cOh! Ha, ha, I\u2019m great! I just wanted to let you know that if I can be of service, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She stands there staring at us, not making any move to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWow, they\u2019re really accommodating to their customers,\u201d Matt whispers in my ear. His warm breath gives me goose bumps and I realize I have completely lost control of this situation. Sure, I was starting to believe him, and seeing his wife show up on the arm of another man solidified the story he told me, but being this distracted by a simple kiss is not like me at all. I have no idea what I\u2019m supposed to do now.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, I\u2019d be feeling pretty smug that I was able to get the money shot of a subject, but I just feel dirty. I feel awful that I didn\u2019t come clean with Matt when he poured his heart out to me. Now all I can think about is that kiss and when we can do it again.</p><p>I am so going to get fired.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, I\u2019ll just be over there, by the hostess stand, if you need anything,\u201d she states with another awkward wink in my direction. As she turns and walks away, I can see a bulge in her front pocket that I know is my camera. My camera filled with shots of me kissing Matt. Shots that I want to look at over and over again alone at home.</p><p>When the girl is finally gone, I turn my face back to Matt. He\u2019s staring at my lips and I can\u2019t stop my tongue from sliding out and running over them, savoring the taste of him still there. Matt suddenly lets go of me when he realizes his arms are still wrapped tightly around me long after the threat of being spotted by his ex is gone. I immediately miss the warmth of his body.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should apologize for using you like that,\u201d he tells me as I take a step back from him, his eyes still focused on my lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd I feel like I should tell you that there\u2019s no apology necessary, and you can feel free to use me like that anytime.\u201d</p><p>We both laugh a little uncomfortably. Matt cranes his neck, searching around the restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t see Melanie anywhere. They must have been seated in another room.\u201d</p><p>Heat flushes through me when I remember the whole reason for the kiss: to make sure his estranged wife didn\u2019t see him. I feel like I\u2019ve waited my entire life for a kiss like that. And now I have to get up from this bar stool and walk away from him and never see him again. It would be unethical for me to do anything else. He\u2019s not cheating on his wife, so this case is closed. I can\u2019t help him any more than I already have. I\u2019ve already compromised Fool Me Once Investigations enough for one night.</p><p>Kennedy\u2019s family, along with Lorelei, Griffin, and me, are all standing around our offices waiting for Kennedy to finally come out of the bathroom. Earlier, I was happy to come here tonight and toast my best friend and her newfound love. Now, I\u2019m preoccupied and freaked out that someone is going to ask me about the case.</p><p>It\u2019s been an hour since I left Matt at the bar. Actually, it\u2019s been one hour, eight minutes, and thirty-five seconds. But who\u2019s counting?</p><p>Me! I\u2019m counting!</p><p>I can still feel his lips on mine, and I can still hear the anguish in his voice when he told me about his wife cheating on him and trying to take away his father\u2019s company. He\u2019s a good man; I can feel it. I want to beat that bitch Melanie to the ground, but I can\u2019t. She signed a contract with us and we have clearly defined rules and regulations in that contract that state there will be no conflict of interest and that everything we do will be to protect our client. Matt isn\u2019t our client, Melanie is. Melanie: the gold-digging whore.</p><p>I listen distractedly as everyone talks around me, wondering if Kennedy would let me quit for a week so I don\u2019t violate the contract by helping Matt.</p><p>\u201cOh, speaking of whores, what\u2019s going on with that case of yours, Paige? Weren\u2019t you working on catching some slutty guy whose wife suspected him of cheating?\u201d</p><p>The swallow I take of champagne goes down the wrong pipe immediately when Kennedy\u2019s brother, Ted, questions me. I cough and try to take a breath as he comes over and pats me on the back, adding more champagne to my glass.</p><p>I feel my cheeks redden, and I look away from Ted quickly, chugging the entire glass of champagne in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cGuy? What guy? There\u2019s no guy. I don\u2019t know a guy. Who wants more champagne?\u201d I ask, grabbing the bottle from Ted\u2019s hand and walking away.</p><p>Thank God Kennedy walks in the room at that moment and I don\u2019t have to acknowledge the questioning look he\u2019s shooting at me.</p><p>Standing by the wall on the opposite side of the room, I forgo my champagne glass and drink directly out of the bottle while everyone fawns over Kennedy in her short red dress and awesome Jimmy Choo shoes that I let her borrow. No one cares that I\u2019m drowning my sorrows in cheap champagne.</p><p>\u201cDid you just drink directly out of that bottle? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and rest my head against the wall as Lorelei folds her arms and raises her eyebrows at me, waiting for me to talk.</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong. This champagne is just delicious. I didn\u2019t feel like waiting to pour it into my glass. It\u2019s such a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try. Give me the bottle,\u201d Lorelei demands, holding her hand out to me.</p><p>I reluctantly hand it to her and glance over her shoulder at Kennedy and Griffin, wrapped up in each other\u2019s arms, staring into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I want that for myself. I didn\u2019t think I did, but I really do. I miss having someone look at me like that. Like I\u2019m his whole world. I don\u2019t really know Matt. I certainly don\u2019t trust him; I doubt I\u2019ll ever really trust another man again. But I can\u2019t deny that kissing him made me remember what it was like to have someone special in my life. I want more than an empty condo to go home to and a job where I have to be a liar and kind of slutty. I want to stand for something. I want what I do to mean something, and I feel like helping Matt is just the ticket I need to show people that I have a brain.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to track down Matt Russo again?\u201d Lorelei questions, bringing me out of my depressing thoughts.</p><p>\u201cUmmm, yep. I tracked him down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lorelei stares at me, waiting for me to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Kennedy look great in that dress? I\u2019m so happy for her and Griffin,\u201d I muse.</p><p>Lorelei narrows her eyes at me and when I bite my lip and try to reach for the champagne bottle, her eyes widen.</p> <p>\u201cPaige, what did you do?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cGive me the champagne.\u201d</p><p>She holds it farther from my reach and I cross my arms in front of me, refusing to let her force me to tell her what happened. This is my problem and I\u2019m going to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t. Paige, did you compromise the case? Did you tell him what you were hired to do?\u201d</p><p>I immediately get defensive. I\u2019m not an idiot. I\u2019m just confused. \u201cNo! I didn\u2019t tell him what I was there for!\u201d</p> <p>At least I\u2019m not lying about that part.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s the problem then? Were you unable to get any good photos of him cheating? It\u2019s no big deal if it takes you a few tries,\u201d Lorelei says.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem. I got the photos and everything is fine,\u201d I tell her with a sigh.</p><p>Lorelei turns and we see Kennedy and Griffin kiss. They couldn\u2019t care less that they are in a room full of people right now; all they care about is each other.</p><p>\u201cIs that what\u2019s wrong? Are you sad that you haven\u2019t found someone like Kennedy has?\u201d Lorelei asks softly as we continue to watch Kennedy and Griffin together.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe that\u2019s it,\u201d I admit to her as Kennedy and Griffin say good-bye to everyone and head out on their date.</p> <p>Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m seriously considering fucking up the opportunity Kennedy gave me by going behind her back and starting a new case of my own.</p><p>\u201cPaige, you are a sweet, honest person and a great friend. You\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Lorelei reassures me.</p><p>My chest starts to ache as I feel her turn the knife a little deeper into my heart with her words. I thought that by walking away from Matt I would be able to forget about him and his problems. Instead, they followed me home. Even the guilt I feel at Lorelei\u2019s words isn\u2019t enough to make me change my mind about what I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>As soon as I kissed him, I knew I would help him. I\u2019m sure if I explain to Kennedy that there isn\u2019t a case here with Matt being a cheater, we could close it and open up a new one for him so there isn\u2019t a conflict of interest. But I know Kennedy won\u2019t believe me. She thinks I\u2019m a softie, and she\u2019ll just assume I\u2019m taking Matt\u2019s side because he\u2019s hot, especially since I convinced her she should trust Griffin because that man is sex on a stick. It doesn\u2019t matter if I was right; I need to be smart about this.</p><p>I need to have solid proof that Melanie is the cheater before I bring Kennedy in.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Paige, please. You\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth and try my hardest not to throw the phone against the wall as I sit at my desk and listen to Andy beg. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have answered the phone this morning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m being unreasonable? Are you kidding me with this right now? I\u2019m not giving you any money, Andy. If memory serves me correct, you already have plenty of my money. That\u2019s why we\u2019re divorced,\u201d I remind myself.</p><p>Like clockwork, every week for the past month, Andy has called asking for money. He\u2019s either extremely desperate, or has the biggest set of balls known to man. And since I was married to him for five years, I know for a fact the latter isn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for a lot. Just a little bit to tide me over until my bonus from work comes in. I swear I\u2019ll pay you back,\u201d he pleads.</p><p>\u201cRight, like you paid me back the six hundred grand you stole? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were husband and wife. It\u2019s not stealing. Everything is fifty-fifty when you\u2019re married,\u201d he reminds me.</p><p>\u201cWow, my math must be really rusty, because you didn\u2019t take fifty percent, YOU TOOK IT ALL!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shouting now. I really hate him for making me lose my temper.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you if it wasn\u2019t important. I owe someone money and this person is going to kill me if I don\u2019t pay off my debt,\u201d Andy explains.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. You owe me money and I am definitely planning on all the fun ways I\u2019m going to kill you if you don\u2019t stop calling me and asking me for money.\u201d</p><p>Andy sighs on the other end, and I glance down at the notepad in front of me and realize I\u2019ve written his name and made so many Xs through it that I\u2019ve ripped the page to shreds.</p><p>\u201cPaige, this is serious. I\u2019m in a lot of trouble here. It\u2019s only twenty grand.\u201d</p><p>Wow, only twenty grand. Sure, no big deal. Let me just bend over and pull it right out of my ass.</p><p>\u201cAndy, even if I did have the money, do you really think I\u2019d give it to you? I\u2019m not modeling anymore. I don\u2019t have that kind of cash,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cI talked to your agent this morning. She said she\u2019s been trying to get hold of you about a spread for InStyle. That will pay a hundred grand, easy.\u201d</p><p>The pencil in my hand snaps in half as my anger reaches an all-time high.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a piece of scum, do you know that? I cannot believe you called Penny. Go to hell, Andy. And stop calling me.\u201d</p><p>I slam the phone down just as Lorelei walks into the office. She stops in her tracks when she witnesses me lift the receiver and smack it back down over and over until I\u2019m satisfied that the call has ended.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014Andy?\u201d</p><p>She walks over to her desk and sets her briefcase on top. I get up from my chair and go over to her as she takes a seat.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why I married him. Guys like him should be required to wear a sign that says \u2018I will suck the life out of you,\u2019\u201d I complain.</p><p>\u201cHow much does he want this time?\u201d Lorelei asks as she pulls a few files out of her briefcase and I perch my hip on the corner of her desk.</p><p>\u201cOh, only twenty thousand dollars. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei laughs and shakes her head. \u201cIf he calls again, pass it over to me. I\u2019ll use a bunch of big, legal words on him and scare him straight.\u201d</p><p>I laugh with her and hear the bell ring above the front door, signaling a customer. Craning my head to look over my shoulder, the laughter dies and I let out a gasp. Without even thinking, I dive under Lorelei\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I smack her leg to make her shut up as she stares under her desk at me with a confused expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019d like to talk to someone about hiring a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>I watch from under the desk as Lorelei\u2019s head whips up, and I wince as her eyes widen in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Matt Russo,\u201d Lorelei whispers.</p><p>I smack her leg again and this time, she retaliates by kicking me in the shin. I smack my hand over my mouth to keep the yelp of pain from escaping.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. How do you know my name?\u201d Matt asks from the other side of the desk.</p><p>Oh, my God. This is not happening right now! Shit, shit, shit!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . we just . . . I know . . .\u201d Lorelei flounders and quickly glances under her desk at me. I shrug my shoulders at her in an \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck is happening right now\u201d gesture. She scoots her chair closer to the desk and I pull my knees up to my chest, making myself as small as possible while holding my breath at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . saw a write-up about you in Graphic Design USA a while back. Great article,\u201d Lorelei states.</p><p>This is why she\u2019s a big-time attorney and I\u2019m an ex-model, cowering under a desk. She can think on her feet in a crisis.</p><p>\u201cWow! I didn\u2019t think anyone even read that magazine,\u201d Matt says with a good-natured laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I like to keep up-to-date on all the current events in . . . design . . . and graphics. And stuff.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>\u201cSo what can I help you with, Mr. Russo?\u201d Lorelei asks while I listen closely.</p><p>\u201cThis is so weird. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even here asking you this, but I need to hire you guys to investigate someone. I\u2019ve never done anything like this,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cIt was so nice of you to consider Fool Me Once for your investigating needs,\u201d Lorelei says quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re really busy right now, but if you would just leave me your name and number, I\u2019ll have someone contact you as soon as possible to let you know if we\u2019ll be able to squeeze you into our schedule.\u201d</p><p>I hear Lorelei slide a piece of paper across the desk and the sounds of Matt scribbling his information and then setting the pen down. \u201cThanks, I really appreciate it. This is kind of an emergency situation, so I\u2019d like to talk to someone as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei thanks him again and a few seconds later I hear the ding of the bell as he exits the office. I let out the breath I\u2019ve been holding and scramble out from under the desk. Lorelei bends over and grabs my arm, hauling me up to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on? I thought you said you got the pictures you needed. Why is the man you\u2019ve been following coming in here to hire us?\u201d Lorelei grills me.</p><p>\u201cAre those Jimmy Choos? Are they from the spring collection?\u201d I ask, pointing down to her shoes to try to distract her.</p><p>\u201cOh, these?\u201d she asks, looking down at her feet, taking the bait. \u201cYes, I just got them yesterday at\u2014PAIGE! Stop it! We can\u2019t take him on as a client when we\u2019re currently in the middle of trying to catch him cheating. This is the biggest conflict of interest ever! I don\u2019t even know why I took down his name and number. I completely panicked. Tell me what\u2019s going on, right now!\u201d</p><p>Lorelei stomps her foot and I know she means business. I\u2019ve never seen her lose her temper before. She\u2019s as cool and calm as they come, but right now, she looks like she\u2019s ready to throttle me.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, when I trailed him the other night, he recognized me from O\u2019Casey\u2019s. We got to talking and, well . . .\u201d</p><p>I trail off, trying to come up with a way to make this NOT sound as bad as it is. I\u2019ve got nothing. The only thing I can do is just blurt it out and hope she doesn\u2019t punch me. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s cheating on his wife. She\u2019s cheating on him and trying to take his family\u2019s company because she\u2019s a gold-digging whore and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m switching teams and I\u2019m going to help him catch her because he seems like a really nice guy and I don\u2019t want to see him get hurt.\u201d</p><p>There. It\u2019s done. I take a deep breath after my word vomit and wait for the explosion.</p><p>Lorelei is quiet. Too quiet. She just stands here staring at me with her mouth open.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d I beg her.</p><p>Maybe Lorelei will feel my pain. She\u2019ll see that this is a matter of importance. She\u2019s got a heart buried somewhere in there under all that resentment of her ex-husband.</p><p>I look at her imploringly, seeing her face lose its shocked expression.</p><p>I knew it! I knew she\u2019d understand.</p><p>After a few seconds, Lorelei whispers. \u201cKennedy is going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Well, so much for that idea.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Lorelei was called back into court because a verdict for the case she\u2019s working on came in earlier than expected. Thank God for that. If I had to listen to one more minute of her explaining to me all the ways Kennedy would remove the limbs from my body, I was going to scream.</p><p>I convinced her not to tell Kennedy by promising I wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid until she got back so she could finish raking me over the coals. I wonder if Googling Matt\u2019s ex constitutes stupid? It\u2019s not like I ran out the door as soon as Lorelei left and went straight to Matt. I\u2019m being smart. I\u2019m doing research. Research doesn\u2019t compromise anything.</p><p>According to her Facebook page, Melanie Gates-Russo is single. I guess they don\u2019t have \u201cwhore\u201d as a relationship status. I look through her photo albums and don\u2019t see any pictures of her with the mystery man from the other night. She also doesn\u2019t have any pictures from her time with Matt. Not that I was looking specifically for pictures of Matt. Like ones of him shirtless. Or sunning himself on a beach. Or lifting weights with sweat dripping down his toned chest.</p><p>Research. It\u2019s just research.</p><p>Melanie certainly has quite a few Internet pictures of kittens in various poses, however. Twenty-two pictures of kittens in sweaters and eighteen of kittens in hats. Seriously? What is she, five?</p><p>Clicking out of her photo albums, I notice a status update that wasn\u2019t there a few minutes ago:</p><p>Hangin\u2019 with my grls 2nite at Blu Nightclub. Hit me up!</p><p>Are you kidding me with this? He not only married a chick who likes to post kitten pictures, he married one with poor grammar skills. Good God.</p><p>Closing out of her Facebook profile, I quickly look up where this Blu Lounge is.</p><p>Crap. It\u2019s in Indianapolis. That\u2019s almost three hours from here.</p><p>I glance at the time on my computer. There\u2019s no way I can make it there and back before Lorelei gets out of court. She specifically told me to stay put. Taking another few minutes to contemplate what I\u2019m thinking, I shut down my computer and head for the door.</p><p>I haven\u2019t taken orders from anyone since I left Andy. Why should I start now?</p><p>According to its website, Blu is a trendy nightclub in the heart of Indianapolis. Since I had a long drive ahead of me, I ran home, grabbed an appropriate dress, shoved it into my backseat, and changed at a McDonald\u2019s right before I got here. As I show my ID to the bouncer, he doesn\u2019t even glance at it as he takes in my red, backless halter dress and matching four-inch red peep-toe Steve Madden stilettos before looking at my face. His eyes widen in recognition when he sees who I am, and I smile flirtatiously at him, flustering him a bit so he\u2019ll let me in without drawing unwanted attention to myself. I\u2019m immediately assaulted by the thumping beats of Top 40 dance music courtesy of the DJ on the other side of the club. I stick close to the wall as I take in my surroundings. The dance floor is packed with sweaty, writhing bodies, and all of the VIP lounges around the outer edge of the floor are filled with partiers. I have no idea how I\u2019m ever going to find Melanie in this place, but I have to try. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The VIP areas are all roped off, and you can\u2019t even go up the three steps to get to them without an invitation, so I decide to head right through the middle of the dance floor in the hopes that I might spot Melanie.</p><p>Five minutes of shoving my way through all of the people, I\u2019m thankful that I pulled my long blonde hair up into a high ponytail. I\u2019m already working up a sweat and I\u2019m not even dancing. With one last surge of my body, I finally make it to the other side and squeeze myself in between a crowd of people standing around the bar.</p><p>The bartender hands a drink to the person next to me and then nods his head in my direction. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust an ice water, please,\u201d I shout above the music and loud conversations on either side of me.</p><p>While he turns away to grab my drink, I take the time to scan the crowd. This was the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever had. There is no way I\u2019m going to find her in this place. There\u2019s got to be at least five hundred people here.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is starting to get weird. Are you stalking me?\u201d</p><p>My head whips around when I hear the voice close to my ear and I come face-to-face with Matt. I swallow nervously until I see his face light up with a teasing smile. He\u2019s not wearing his glasses tonight. Or a sweater vest. Sweet Jesus, does he look good. He\u2019s wearing a fitted black button-down with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows tucked into a pair of charcoal-gray dress pants. Gone is nerdy-chic Matt. In his place is hot-as-balls Matt. The temperature in this place suddenly went up a thousand degrees.</p><p>\u201cI was just kidding about the stalking thing\u2014don\u2019t look so shocked,\u201d Matt says with a laugh, right by my ear.</p> <p>I\u2019m suddenly okay with the noise level in this place if it means he has to be this close to me to talk.</p><p>\u201cBut seriously, how do we keep showing up at the same places?\u201d he asks again, placing his hand on my hip and pulling me closer to him to make room for a few people trying to get up to the bar.</p><p>I\u2019m pressed up against him and staring at his throat while he reaches over to take my glass of ice water from the bartender. I\u2019ve been around plenty of hot guys before. I\u2019ve done photo shoots with half-naked male models. None of them has caused this kind of reaction from me. I\u2019m never at a loss for words. Is it because, once again, he caught me doing something that I\u2019m going to lie to him about or because I find myself attracted to him?</p><p>\u201cI, um, was in the neighborhood and thought I\u2019d check this place out,\u201d I tell him lamely, taking the glass of water from him and sucking down the entire thing.</p><p>\u201cYou were in the neighborhood? Where exactly do you live? It took me three hours to get here.\u201d</p><p>I regretfully take a step away from him and set my empty glass on the bar.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I ask, taking the focus off of myself.</p><p>He sighs and runs his hand through his hair. I suddenly have the urge to do the same with my own hand. I want to clutch his hair and pull his face down to mine so I can feel his lips again.</p><p>Holy hell, I need to get this under control. Men suck. They are all pigs, even if they seem nice at first. Andy was really nice at first too. Just because I want to help Matt out and he\u2019s easy to look at, doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>\u201cI found out that Melanie was going to be here tonight. This isn\u2019t usually the type of place she goes to, so I was hoping I\u2019d catch her with the guy she\u2019s been seeing. I really wish I had a camera on me the other night when we were at Blake\u2019s,\u201d he says.</p><p>I am such a bitch. I could have taken a hundred pictures of Melanie the other night. But in my defense, I didn\u2019t know he was the good guy at the time. I hope to God he never finds out about my role in all this.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll drop everything if you catch her with this guy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI know she will. Her reputation is important to her. She\u2019s all about looking good and making sure everyone thinks she\u2019s a saint. If I can catch her and then threaten to out her to her family and mine, she\u2019ll back down on the lawsuit. The only problem is, I would never do that to her. Even though our marriage sucked, I could never hurt someone like that. I just hope she doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Why did he have to say that? Why does he have to be such a good guy?</p> <p>\u201cSo, how do you expect to find her in this mess of a place?\u201d I ask, looking around again at all of the people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen her. She\u2019s upstairs in one of the VIP lounges,\u201d he tells me, pointing over his shoulder to the roped-off area. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any guy with her, though, just a few of her girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>I look over his shoulder and sure enough, in the very center of the VIP area, in one of the biggest lounges, I see Melanie sitting on a couch with two of her girlfriends on either side of her. They\u2019re laughing, toasting, and having a great time.</p><p>\u201cJesus. It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re not legally separated yet or all of your alimony would be going right down the drain. Just to sit in that lounge there\u2019s a fifteen-hundred-dollar cover charge, plus you have to purchase a minimum of two bottles of top-shelf liquor. In a place like this, that\u2019s around nine hundred dollars a bottle,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWait, how did you know I\u2019m not legally separated yet?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no! Oh, shit! I can\u2019t really tell him I had Lorelei look that information up for me yesterday, can I?</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m just assuming. You know, since you didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Please let him believe me, please let him believe me.</p><p>Matt accepts my lame attempt at an explanation and glances back to Melanie and her friends. \u201cAre you serious that it costs that much to sit in the VIP section? How do you even know that?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019ve partied in plenty of those lounges throughout my career. I\u2019ve hosted parties in those lounges. I could probably tell you the cost and liquor requirements for every club in the United States and the UK.</p><p>Something stops me from telling him this, though. Maybe this is the real reason why I have a soft spot for him. He still doesn\u2019t know who I am. I\u2019m just a girl he met in a bar. Someone he looks at just like any other normal girl. I want to be normal more than I want to be honest right now and it\u2019s killing me.</p><p>\u201cI asked when I first got here. You know, just wondering why they had that section roped off,\u201d I lie.</p><p>He looks back over his shoulder, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. There is no way in hell she could afford something like that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug when he turns back to face me. \u201cMaybe one of her friends paid for it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNope. No way. Melanie is a kindergarten teacher. All of those women she\u2019s with? They all teach at the same school she does. They barely make minimum wage.\u201d</p><p>Well, the multitude of kitten pictures on her Facebook page makes sense now. But I fear for the children of our future if she\u2019s the one educating them.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be the guy she was with the other night then. You don\u2019t know anything about him? You didn\u2019t recognize him?\u201d I question as someone jostles me from behind and I slam up against the front of Matt.</p><p>I put my hands up against his chest and look up at him so I can apologize. He\u2019s staring down at me. Actually, he\u2019s staring right at my lips and his arms wrap around my waist to steady me, but pull me closer instead.</p><p>We stand this way until the noise and all of the people around us fade away like in some cheesy rom-com. All I can focus on is the feel of his body pressed up against mine and the way he can\u2019t stop staring at my mouth, like he wants to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cThis is weird. Is it weird for you? Tell me it\u2019s not just me. I mean, I just met you,\u201d he explains with frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you,\u201d I reassure him, feeling equally annoyed and turned on all at the same time.</p><p>Shame on me for thinking I was going to get out of this with my heart intact.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Are you sure? I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this,\u201d Matt tells me as he grips my hand tightly while I pull him with me through the dance floor and over to the roped-off VIP area.</p><p>I stop right at the edge of the dance floor and turn around to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Don\u2019t worry. Someone needs to go up there and get her to talk, and it\u2019s obviously not going to be you. She has no idea who I am, so it\u2019s the perfect plan.\u201d</p><p>He glances back and forth between the VIP area and me. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a complete loser. What kind of guy asks the most beautiful woman in this place to spy on his ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and rub my hand up and down his arm reassuringly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. I volunteered. But thank you for the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even worrying. You\u2019re never going to be able to get in there,\u201d he tells me, staring at the bald, buff, badass-looking bouncer who is currently standing guard in front of the ropes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m pretty resourceful,\u201d I tell him with a wink. \u201cJust wait for me back by the bar so she doesn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>He leans in and kisses me on the cheek before walking away. I watch him push his way back through the crowd, then I take a deep breath and walk right up to the bouncer, tapping him on the shoulder so he\u2019ll look down at me.</p><p>He turns his head with a scowl on his face, not too happy about the fact that yet another person is going to bug him to get up into the VIP area. When he sees me standing there, the scowl turns into a huge smile that appears rather strange on a man who looks like he just got out of prison.</p><p>\u201cPaige! Holy shit! What the fuck are you doing slumming here, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Yet another thing I failed to mention to Matt\u2014I recognized the bouncer as soon as I walked into the club. He was one of the regular bouncers at a club I frequented during the height of my modeling career.</p><p>\u201cRonny, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d I tell him as he leans down and scoops me up into a bone-crushing hug, lifting me up off of my feet.</p><p>I guess when you\u2019re six foot seven and weigh over three hundred pounds, you could lift a building without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Ronny finally sets me back on my feet and holds me out at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start working here? Last time I saw you, you were breaking up a fight at the Viper Room in LA,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cEh, the wife got transferred to Indy for her job. So here I am,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cYou want to go up into the VIP area?\u201d</p><p>He nods behind him and unhooks one end of the velvet rope.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ronny. Give Kim my love,\u201d I tell him as I walk past him and into the private area.</p><p>\u201cWill do. Don\u2019t be a stranger now,\u201d he calls after me, hooking the rope back into place after I walk through.</p><p>I make my way up the three steps to the walkway that leads to all of the VIP lounges, grabbing a glass of champagne off of a passing tray as a waiter walks by. I pause just outside of the wall of Melanie\u2019s lounge and take a deep breath.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>Putting on a huge smile, I giggle at nothing as I stumble into the opening of the room and flop down on the end of the huge sectional sofa where Melanie and her friends are sitting. They immediately stop talking and stare at me. They look like Charlie\u2019s Angels. Melanie in the middle is blonde, the friend on her left is a brunette, and the one on her right has black hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh! I\u2019m SO drunk. I\u2019m totally in the wrong lounge!\u201d I tell them with another giggle and a sip of my champagne.</p><p>They immediately smile at me and Melanie speaks first. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. Drink up, sister!\u201d</p><p>She raises her glass and her three friends copy her, all of them taking a sip of their drinks. I notice two bottles of Dos Lunas Grand Reserve tequila sitting on the table in front of them and even I\u2019m shocked by the indulgence I see right now. Just one of those bottles is easily twenty-two hundred dollars. Whoever booked this room isn\u2019t playing around.</p><p>Time to get to the bottom of things.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me hiding out in here for a minute. The guy who invited me to his lounge is a total creeper,\u201d I complain with a roll of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mind at all!\u201d the brunette next to Melanie speaks up. \u201cThere are a lot of creeps here tonight. Thank God we\u2019re in here and not out there.\u201d</p><p>She points out to the dance floor and the rest of the girls nod in agreement.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys hiding out too? Wait, did you guys pay for this room yourself? You must be, like, totally rich or something,\u201d I say with wide, innocent eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no! We could never afford something like this. Melanie has a rich boyfriend!\u201d the brunette says with a laugh.</p><p>Melanie shushes her and the other friend smacks the brunette in the arm. All three of them look over at me nervously.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just . . . I\u2019m not really supposed to talk about him,\u201d Melanie tells me.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cIs he a spy or something?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s, um . . . a businessman. He\u2019s just very private.\u201d</p><p>Right. My ass he\u2019s just a businessman.</p><p>No one says anything for a few seconds and then the brunette finally rolls her eyes and laughs. \u201cOh, what the hell, Melanie. What\u2019s the point of dating him if you can\u2019t brag about it?\u201d</p><p>Melanie sighs and then looks around. When she\u2019s satisfied that no one is walking by the room, possibly listening in, she shrugs and nods to her friend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s totally dating someone in the Mob!\u201d the brunette gushes. \u201cLike in The Godfather, but cooler!\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. This is not good. Maybe they only THINK he\u2019s in the Mob. They don\u2019t seem very bright. Maybe they misunderstood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got more money than God, I swear,\u201d the one with the black hair finally adds.</p><p>Melanie is still keeping quiet about the boyfriend. I need to turn up the drunk-moron routine if I want her to tell me what I need to know. I can\u2019t really go back to the office and Google \u201cmembers of the Mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that must be so awesome. My ex was a total loser. He had a bunch of money, but never spent any of it on me,\u201d I complain.</p> <p>That\u2019s all it takes. Melanie\u2019s eyes light up and she looks at me like we\u2019re long-lost sisters.</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, me too! My ex practically owned his own company and he wouldn\u2019t even consider buying a summer home in the Hamptons when I asked him,\u201d Melanie whines. \u201cVinnie buys me stuff every day and takes me to all the best restaurants. He\u2019s a total keeper. But just in case, I\u2019m still going to take my ex for all he has.\u201d</p><p>All three of the girls laugh and clink their glasses together.</p><p>I want to punch this bitch right in her selfish little face.</p><p>\u201cSo, this guy is really in the Mob? Like, the real Mob?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cHe totally is! He\u2019s like the boss or something. But you can\u2019t tell anyone I told you this, okay?\u201d she begs.</p><p>Yeah. Right. Your secret is safe with me.</p><p>I sit with the girls for a few more minutes as they all go on and on about how amazing this Vinnie person is because he isn\u2019t afraid to shell out thousands of dollars a day on Melanie, and how Matt isn\u2019t going to know what hit him when she takes control of the company.</p><p>It\u2019s sad and pathetic and makes me even more determined to do whatever I can to help Matt. I also make a mental note to never send any future children I might have to the school system these idiots work for.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of them are forthcoming with Vinnie\u2019s last name and I find out that he\u2019s not joining them tonight because he had some business to take care of. If he really is with the Mob, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and assume this \u201cbusiness\u201d probably has something to do with offing someone. I might make a few stupid choices here and there, but even I know that trying to hunt down someone who works for the Mob just to get a few pictures of him with Melanie is a bad idea. I\u2019m going to have to come up with another plan for making sure Melanie keeps her greedy paws off of Matt\u2019s company.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p> <p>No. Absolutely not. There is no way you are going to dig deeper into this guy\u2019s background. That just has bad news written all over it,\u201d I tell Matt.</p><p>After we left the club, we decided to stop at a twenty-four-hour diner on the way home. Since we drove separately to the club, Matt followed me in his car.</p><p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do? You said it yourself: She is determined to fuck me over. I can\u2019t let that happen \u0327 Paige.\u201d</p><p>Reaching across the table, I rest my hands on top of his. \u201cI know. We\u2019ll think of something else. I have a few contacts in law enforcement. Let me have them do some checking first and find out what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Matt stares at me across the table and I can\u2019t bring myself to move my hands off of his even when the waitress comes over and refills our coffee cups. I think back to his words at the club about this thing between us being weird. It is weird, but in a good way. I feel like I\u2019ve known him forever.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you even come from? My life was total shit a week ago and then all of a sudden, you show up out of nowhere and make everything better,\u201d he tells me with a smile.</p><p>I swallow past the lump in my throat. Now would be the perfect opportunity to tell him that it wasn\u2019t a coincidence, me showing up in his life the way I did.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazing,\u201d Matt tells me earnestly.</p> <p>I shake my head at him, wishing the words would come out of my mouth as easily as they pop into my head.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he insists. \u201cI barely know anything about you, but I know that much at least. I\u2019m pretty much a stranger to you and yet you\u2019re willing to do whatever you can to help me out. That\u2019s amazing, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but you aren\u2019t a stranger, Matt. I\u2019ve read your file. I\u2019ve MEMORIZED your file.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me something about you. I\u2019ve bored you to death and most likely insulted the hell out of you with my problems. What do you do for a living when you aren\u2019t trying to make it in the modeling world?\u201d he asks, moving one of his hands out from under mine to pick up his coffee cup and bring it to his lips.</p><p>Of course he couldn\u2019t start with something easy, like my favorite color.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually given up the modeling dream. Um, I mostly just do some office work for my best friend\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>I am going straight to hell.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you give up on the modeling thing? You\u2019re gorgeous, obviously. I have a hard time believing it wouldn\u2019t be a pretty lucrative career for you once you got your foot in the door.\u201d</p><p>If you only knew . . .</p><p>\u201cI just realized it wasn\u2019t something I loved doing. It got old really fast,\u201d I explain, giving him as much as I can of myself right now. A part of me wants to tell him everything. About how I was, and still am, kind of a big deal in the modeling world. How I got tired of being paraded around in front of people for my looks, no one even considering that I might have a brain that I\u2019d want to use for something else. And how the person I loved, trusted, and married only cared about my looks and used me for what those looks provided him. It\u2019s so refreshing being anonymous that I\u2019m almost drunk from the joy it brings me.</p><p>\u201cYou should never do something you\u2019re not passionate about. I\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t doing it anymore if it didn\u2019t make you happy. Although it would have been kind of cool to drive down Route 20 and see your picture splashed across a billboard,\u201d he jokes before taking another sip of his coffee.</p><p>Well, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re not taking Interstate 69 home, then, since there is currently one of me at mile marker seventy-two modeling a bathing suit for Victoria\u2019s Secret.</p><p>I laugh uncomfortably as I watch him drink his coffee. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I want to be honest with him. He\u2019s poured his heart out to me and I sit here and continue to lie to him. He needs to know where I work, and he needs to know that I know everything about Melanie.</p><p>\u201cMatt, I need to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Jerking my hand away from Matt\u2019s, I stare up in shock at Andy standing next to our table, staring down at us with an annoyed look on his face. He\u2019s wearing his usual work attire: a black suit with an interchangeable shirt and tie in various colors. He\u2019s wearing blue right now, so it must be Friday. Andy is the most anal person I\u2019ve ever met, but something is going on with him. He\u2019s a hot mess right now. Instead of his typical clean-cut, perfectly pressed appearance, he looks like he hasn\u2019t slept in days, or if he has, he\u2019s slept in his clothes. He\u2019s a wrinkled disaster and I have never seen him with so much facial hair. He was always meticulous about shaving every single morning.</p><p>\u201cAndy? What are you doing here?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like how our last conversation ended. You didn\u2019t answer my calls this afternoon and I got worried,\u201d he explains, with a dirty look at Matt.</p><p>\u201cSo you followed me? Are you insane? GO HOME, Andy.\u201d</p><p>Andy ignores me and continues to stare at Matt. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Matt looks back and forth between us before sliding out of his seat and standing up in front of Andy.</p><p>How did I ever think that the two of them were anything alike? Seeing the two of them side by side, the differences are glaringly obvious. Andy is short, whiny, and annoying. Matt is easily five inches taller than he is, and working in an office all day hasn\u2019t diminished his intimidation skills in the least. I watch in awe as Matt stares Andy down and Andy visibly shrinks into himself and takes a step back.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Matt, and I\u2019m a friend of Paige\u2019s. I think it would be best if you do as she says and go home,\u201d he tells Andy in a calm voice.</p><p>Andy gets a sudden second wind of self-confidence and puffs out his chest, stepping around Matt and up to my side. \u201cLook, I talked to Penny again. She said you still have plenty of time to say yes to the InStyle photo shoot. The mag has even upped their original offer\u2014a hundred and fifty grand and the promise of the cover. It\u2019s their anniversary issue and they really want you for it.\u201d</p><p>Pushing myself up out of the bench seat, I get right into Andy\u2019s face. \u201cI already told you this earlier. I\u2019m not doing this just to pay off your debt. I\u2019m done modeling, Andy. Get that through your head.\u201d</p><p>Andy crosses his arms over his chest and huffs at me. \u201cYou\u2019re being childish, Paige. You\u2019re one of the top models in the entire country. You\u2019ve been in every fucking magazine they print in the US and CoverGirl wants you to do another commercial. You don\u2019t just up and quit something like that for some silly pipe dream of being a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Andy. Shut up right now,\u201d I warn him, refusing to look over at Matt.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u201d Matt tells Andy through clenched teeth as he steps in between us.</p><p>Luckily, the waitress rushes over to check on us before I pick up my fork from the table and stab it into Andy\u2019s smug face.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay here? Do I need to get the manager?\u201d she asks, glancing back and forth between the three of us.</p><p>\u201cOh no, there\u2019s no need for that. Everything is fine. He was just leaving,\u201d I state, staring angrily at Andy.</p><p>Andy huffs and turns away from me to look at Matt. \u201cMaybe you can talk some sense into her. She\u2019s never going to amount to anything at that stupid, man-hating Fool Me Once Investigations. The only thing she\u2019s good for is sitting there and looking pretty.\u201d</p><p>Andy barely finishes his tirade before Matt\u2019s fist connects with his face. Andy\u2019s head whips back with the force of the blow, and he immediately starts screaming like a girl.</p><p>\u201cOH, MY GOD! I THINK YOU BROKE MY NOSE!\u201d</p><p>Andy is bent over at the waist, holding both of his hands over his nose as the blood drips down his fingers and onto the floor by his feet.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here before I break something else of yours,\u201d Matt growls at him.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure my underwear just spontaneously combusted.</p><p>Andy finally gets the hint and scurries out of the restaurant without another word, whimpering the entire way out the door. After he\u2019s gone, Matt turns around to face me.</p><p>\u201cI think I should probably tell you, that was the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d I admit to him.</p><p>\u201cStop. Just . . . stop.\u201d</p><p>I shut my mouth and quickly realize that now is not the time for jokes. Even if I\u2019m not joking at all. I really want to throw him down on the ground and rip his clothes off.</p><p>\u201cA little modeling? You must think I\u2019m a complete idiot,\u201d Matt says softly.</p><p>I shake my head frantically back and forth. \u201cNo! It\u2019s nothing like that, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou HAVE been following me, haven\u2019t you? Jesus Christ, is anything about you even true? Did Melanie hire you?\u201d</p><p>He waits for me to argue, but I have nothing to say. Not one word.</p><p>\u201cShe did, didn\u2019t she? Fuck! This entire time, you\u2019ve been playing me for a fool. I really am an idiot,\u201d he mutters angrily.</p><p>\u201cMatt, please. Just let me explain,\u201d I plead.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough explanations for one night. Tell my ex I hope she enjoys the company.\u201d</p><p>Matt turns and storms out of the restaurant, slamming the door open so hard it bangs against the outside of the building.</p><p>\u201cSo, you ready for the check now?\u201d the waitress deadpans.</p><p>I flop down into the booth and stare longingly out the front door.</p><p>Well, so much for this night ending with another amazing kiss.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>On Sunday morning, there\u2019s a knock at my door and I contemplate ignoring it. I haven\u2019t showered in two days. I\u2019m facedown on my couch, where I\u2019ve been since I got home Friday night. At least I changed out of my dress when I got home that night. Too bad I haven\u2019t changed out of the Hello Kitty pajama bottoms and tank top I put on after I ripped off my dress and threw it in the trash. I feel gross. But I deserve to feel gross. I suck.</p><p>There\u2019s another knock at the door, this one louder than the first. I don\u2019t even lift my head from the cushion or move my body. They\u2019ll go away eventually.</p><p>\u201cPAIGE McCARTY, OPEN UP THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW OR I\u2019M GOING TO KICK IT DOWN!\u201d Kennedy yells.</p><p>Shit. Kennedy will never go away. And she really will kick my door down. I\u2019ve seen her do it before.</p><p>With a sigh, I push myself up from the couch and shuffle my feet over to the door, opening it up while Kennedy continues to pound on it with her fist.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you look like shit,\u201d Kennedy tells me as she pushes her way into my condo.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just a ray of sunshine this morning,\u201d I deadpan as I close the door behind her and go right back to my previous position on the couch.</p><p>I know why she\u2019s here. Aside from the fact that I\u2019ve been ignoring her since Friday night, I\u2019m positive that Matt called the office and filled her in on what a lying bitch I am. She\u2019s probably here to fire me. I\u2019m an ex-model and now an ex-almost-private investigator. I\u2019m washed up. A has-been. They\u2019re going to do an E! True Hollywood Story on me and it\u2019s going to be depressing.</p><p>\u201cCare to tell me why you haven\u2019t answered my or Lorelei\u2019s calls in the past two days?\u201d Kennedy asks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad about firing me. I already know I screwed up,\u201d I mumble into the couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrph feem brph amerph frmy meh. Eh affreffy mow eh srphed upff\u201d is what Kennedy hears.</p><p>Kennedy\u2019s hand slides under my face and she lifts my head up off of the cushion. \u201cYou want to try that again? I don\u2019t speak couch cushion.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, pushing myself up, and move to the middle, flopping back down on my butt this time. I repeat the part about firing me.</p> <p>Kennedy stares down at me. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Why would I fire you?\u201d</p><p>Either she has no clue what I\u2019m referring to, or she\u2019s just messing with me. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. Maybe she wants me to die a slow, painful death of humiliation.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the whole Matt Russo thing,\u201d I add, fishing for clues that she knows what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Kennedy shakes her head at me in annoyance. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t been able to catch the bastard cheating yet. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, Paige. Just give it time.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God. He didn\u2019t call and tell her everything. Wait. Why didn\u2019t he call and tell her everything?</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not hip to fashion like you are, but you do know you\u2019re wearing Hello Kitty pants, right?\u201d she asks, staring down at my legs.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say \u2018hip to fashion\u2019? What are you, ninety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck off. Get your ass up and take a shower. Do you want to . . . go shoe shopping or something?\u201d Kennedy asks, visibly wincing when she says the word \u201cshopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww, it\u2019s so sweet that you would do that just to make me feel better,\u201d I tell her with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a sale at Nordstrom today and I want to swing by a few salons so we can interview new stylists, since ours became a drug runner. We should also get you some new lingerie to make Griffin happy, and there\u2019s this black dress I want your opinion on at Express.\u201d</p><p>I watch the horror come over her face with each and every word I say, and I feel a little less sorry for myself as I tease her.</p><p>\u201cWipe that look off your face. Like I\u2019d really put you through all that torture in one day,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>\u201cThank Christ.\u201d</p><p>Now that she sees I\u2019m still alive and not planning on forcing her to shop with me all day, Kennedy turns and heads for the door. \u201cLorelei said you might have gotten a few photos the other night that you think aren\u2019t good enough to nail Matt. Upload them onto my computer when you get to the office tomorrow and I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. Now I really AM going to cry. Lorelei didn\u2019t rat me out to Kennedy either. Now I just need to think of a way to \u201close\u201d those photos and find out who this Vinnie guy is before Kennedy realizes I have completely violated the contract she signed with Melanie. Knowing that gold-digging whore, she\u2019ll come back and sue us too.</p><p>\u201cSo, I know you didn\u2019t just ask me to lunch because you miss me. What\u2019s the real reason I\u2019m here?\u201d Ted asks me.</p><p>Ted was recently promoted to detective with the South Bend Police Department after he assisted Kennedy in bringing down one of the biggest drug rings in Indiana a few weeks ago. He mostly works with the DEA, but I know he\u2019s got the inside scoop on pretty much every criminal in this state.</p><p>\u201cOf course I miss you. I feel like we haven\u2019t hung out in ages,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t born yesterday, Paige. What are you up to and does Kennedy know about it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I bristle at his comment that Kennedy needs to know everything I\u2019m doing. Once again, people misjudge my ability to get anything done on my own.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on my own case and no, Kennedy doesn\u2019t know about it. Not yet. I want to get some more concrete information before I go to her.\u201d</p><p>The lies are just flowing right off my tongue these days.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just handle office work and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to popular belief, I\u2019m not an idiot. I do have a brain, and every once in a while, I like to use it,\u201d I reply cockily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant and you know it. I just want to make sure you\u2019re being safe. My sister has a lot of experience taking down bad guys and even she was an idiot with how she handled things a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking down any bad guys, I promise. I just need information on one,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cYou swear you aren\u2019t going to go off half-cocked like she did and go to some nut job\u2019s house alone?\u201d Ted asks.</p><p>I raise my right hand. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>Ted sighs and shakes his head at me. \u201cFine. Give me his name.\u201d</p><p>I lift up my knife and fork and begin cutting up my salad. \u201cHis name is Vinnie and he might be some sort of Mob boss.\u201d</p><p>Ted doesn\u2019t answer me and I stop my cutting to look up at him. He\u2019s staring at me with his mouth open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you aren\u2019t talking about Vinnie DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Am I talking about Vinnie DeMarco? I only got his first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, whatever you\u2019re doing\u2014stop. You do not want to go fishing around in Vinnie DeMarco\u2019s life, trust me. He is bad news,\u201d Ted warns me.</p><p>\u201cHow bad are we talking? The Godfather bad or The Sopranos bad?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIs there a fucking difference? They all do whatever the hell they want and don\u2019t care about who they hurt in the process. We\u2019ve been trying to nail this guy for years, but he\u2019s slippery. He hires people to do everything for him so he never gets his hands dirty. And the people he hires are extremely devoted. They\u2019ll do life in prison before they give him up. And if they even think about ratting him out, no one ever hears from them again.\u201d</p><p>I take a minute to process this information. If this is the Vinnie that Melanie is seeing, it\u2019s even worse than I thought. Matt isn\u2019t going to be able to just snap a photo of them and threaten her with it. He\u2019ll get himself killed. I need to be smart about this.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about this Vinnie guy having a girlfriend?\u201d I ask next.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a hundred different girlfriends all over the US. Who knows who his flavor of the week is nowadays,\u201d Ted informs me, picking up his burger and taking a huge bite.</p><p>I should probably tell him that I might know who his latest conquest is. It might help them bring this guy down, but for right now, I\u2019m keeping this information to myself. I need to make sure Melanie isn\u2019t a threat to Matt before I do anything. If she\u2019s called in and questioned, it could just piss her off and make her even more vindictive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Paige. You stay as far away from Vinnie DeMarco as possible. And if you hear anything, and I mean anything, you tell me right away,\u201d Ted warns.</p><p>I smile brightly at him and dig into my salad. \u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Shame on me for making a promise on a heart that barely functions anymore.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>He was a really great guy. He was nice and pretty and . . . nice . . .\u201d I trail off as I stare into my wineglass.</p><p>\u201cYou already said \u2018nice.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I look up at the bartender and scowl. \u201cAren\u2019t bartenders supposed to be friendly and helpful? Stop judging me and bring me more wine.\u201d</p><p>The bartender walks away and I put my elbow on top of the bar, resting my head on my hand. Sliding my phone across the bar closer to myself, I stare at the blank screen. I double-check the 3G icon at the top to make sure my phone is still working. I feel like I\u2019m in high school again, bringing the receiver of our house phone up to my ear every ten minutes to make sure there was still a dial tone.</p><p>It\u2019s been five days since I last saw Matt and four days since I sent him a pathetic text apologizing for lying to him.</p><p>And four days since he never replied to my stupid text.</p><p>The bartender sets another glass of Moscato in front of me and scurries away, probably afraid I\u2019m going to start crying again. I don\u2019t blame him. I\u2019m pitiful. Since when did I become the type of woman who sits around for days on end waiting for a text from a guy and then imbibes way too much wine to make the pain go away?</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you when\u2014when Matt Russo walked into my life.</p><p>Okay, fine. I did it with Asshole Andy, but I thought I\u2019d learned my lesson since then. I\u2019d been fine all these months being alone. I was perfectly okay with the fact that I was finally becoming the strong, independent woman I wanted to be. Now I\u2019m sitting at a bar alone downing drinks and staring at my phone, willing it to send me a text from him.</p><p>I tried to keep myself busy since I sent him that text. I deleted the incriminating photos of the two of us kissing off of Lorelei\u2019s camera when she was in court so Kennedy would never see them. Looking through those pictures and seeing his lips on me, remembering how they felt, just depressed me even more.</p><p>I did some Google searches on Vinnie DeMarco and talked to Ted again in the hopes that he would give me more information on the guy aside from \u201cHe\u2019s mean and scary and you should stay far away from him.\u201d The only thing he let slip was that there is a current investigation of the guy being handled by the criminal investigations unit. Something about an illegal gambling ring and stolen property reports leading back to the members. Obviously it\u2019s nothing that will help me prove that Melanie is a cheater. I want so bad to be able to do this for Matt, and the fact that I keep striking out has made me depressed.</p><p>I hate that he thinks I\u2019m a liar and that nothing about me was true and honest. I had hoped my text to him would make him realize that I was trying to make things right. Obviously I was wrong. He wants nothing to do with me and I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Picking up my chilled glass of wine, I chug it and clumsily smack the empty glass down on the bar. When it looks like the bar tips sideways like the Titanic going under, I realize sucking down that glass probably wasn\u2019t the best idea.</p><p>My cell phone vibrates and bounces up and down on top of the bar. It takes a few tries before I can get my six hands to grab onto it and see on the display that it\u2019s Lorelei calling.</p><p>Wait, I don\u2019t have six hands, do I? This vibration feels funny. I should stick it down my pants and pretend it\u2019s Matt.</p><p>\u201cHey, hang up and call me again so I can pretend it\u2019s Matt in my pants,\u201d I answer with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, are you drunk?\u201d Lorelei asks through the line.</p><p>I can hear the annoyance in her voice. Lorelei never gets drunk. Lorelei wouldn\u2019t understand my need to get drunk and forget I ever met Matt Russo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk, I\u2019m hammered,\u201d I tell her with a snort.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHEY! BARTENDER!\u201d I yell, pulling the phone away from my ear. He stops stacking glasses behind the bar and walks over to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need a refill,\u201d he deadpans.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a funny, funny little man. Where are we?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me like I\u2019m an idiot. Screw him! I\u2019m not a drunk; I\u2019m just an idiot. Wait, no. I\u2019m not a drunk; I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>Shit! I\u2019m so drunk.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mulligan\u2019s. It says so on the glass in front of you. And on the napkin underneath it. And hey, even on this giant neon sign right above my head,\u201d he tells me sarcastically, pointing above him.</p><p>Smartass. I blow a raspberry at him like the mature adult I am and hear the faint sound of Lorelei yelling through the phone.</p><p>\u201cDON\u2019T GO ANYWHERE! I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see that? A light just went on!\u201d I tell Lorelei excitedly.</p><p>As soon as Lorelei dragged me out of Mulligan\u2019s with an apology to the bartender for my behavior, she shoved me into her sleek black Mercedes with a firm warning not to puke on her leather upholstery. We left my car in the parking lot and Lorelei promised to bring me back the next day to pick it up. Somewhere between the bar and my condo, I convinced her we needed to go to Matt\u2019s house because it was a matter of life or death.</p><p>Let it never be said that \u201cex-models turned private investigators\u201d can\u2019t act. Even with seven glasses of wine in their systems.</p><p>\u201cAmazing. He has electricity,\u201d Lorelei answers, her voice void of emotion.</p><p>We\u2019re currently parked right out front of Matt\u2019s house. As soon as we pulled up and Lorelei killed the engine, I tried to convince her that we could better assess the situation from a closer vantage point, say in his bushes, but she immediately vetoed my idea. She muttered something about crazy drunk women and how her colleagues would hang their head in shame at her for listening to me, but I tuned her out. All I cared about was getting a glimpse of him. Just one little peek.</p><p>I press my nose against the passenger-side window and spot Matt walking through his living room wearing just a pair of pajama bottoms. He scratches his muscled chest as he walks past the window and disappears from sight.</p><p>Never before have I ever wanted to be a hand more than I do right now. Who knew he was packing all of that heat underneath his button-down shirts?</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you convinced me to do this,\u201d Lorelei complains for the tenth time since we pulled up. \u201cRemind me again why we\u2019re parked outside Matt Russo\u2019s house in the middle of the night? Because right now, I am not buying your story that you think he\u2019s in danger. Stop drooling on my window.\u201d</p><p>I pull my face away from the glass and turn to face her. She\u2019s not happy with me. I sort of don\u2019t blame her. I\u2019m not happy with myself either now that the alcohol buzz has begun to fade. I may or may not have told a little white lie to convince Lorelei to take a detour on the way to my condo. There might have been a mention of someone stalking Matt, and I might have told her it was the Mob and that they all carry guns and his life could be on the line. And since I\u2019m being honest, I might as well admit that I threatened to throw myself out of her car into oncoming traffic if she didn\u2019t bring me here immediately. In my defense, it was the booze that did all of the talking for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay. Fine. A little bit of my heart as well. But mostly the booze.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure he was okay. He hasn\u2019t been happy lately,\u201d I mumble, turning away from her just in time to see Matt\u2019s living room window go dark, and I sigh dejectedly that I didn\u2019t get another look at him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he hasn\u2019t been happy lately if this is the first time you\u2019ve seen him since last week when he stormed out of the diner?\u201d</p> <p>I wince and slowly turn back to face her. I couldn\u2019t keep the guilty look off my face if I tried.</p><p>Lorelei\u2019s eyes widen and her jaw drops. \u201cOh, my God! The Mob isn\u2019t stalking him, YOU\u2019RE stalking him!\u201d she shouts.</p><p>\u201cSHHHHHHH! He might hear you!\u201d I whisper. My head whips around and I stare in horror at his front door, expecting him to come bursting out of it any minute and charge over to the car, demanding to know why I\u2019m out here watching him. Actually, now that I think about it, that might not be a bad thing. I\u2019d be able to see his naked chest up close and personal.</p><p>\u201cPaige, I highly suggest you never drink again. People make utterly unhealthy life choices when they drink and this just proves it. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning and we\u2019re parked outside a man\u2019s house because you have some misplaced affection for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not misplaced. I know exactly where it is,\u201d I tell her stubbornly, crossing my arms in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been stalking him all week, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Lorelei demands.</p><p>It\u2019s like she KNOWS I followed him to work once.</p><p>Okay, three times. I just wanted to make sure the anger and irritation I saw flashed across his face that first time wasn\u2019t a fluke. And it wasn\u2019t. Each time I saw him this past week he looked exactly the same. Like he would punch anyone who rubbed him the wrong way. I felt responsible for putting that look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop calling it \u2018stalking\u2019? That\u2019s such a harsh term. I prefer \u2018anonymous following.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She clenches her jaw and narrows her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this really about? Is it because Andy won\u2019t leave you alone about the money? Are you just latching yourself onto the first decent guy who comes along to make him jealous or something? This isn\u2019t like you, Paige.\u201d</p> <p>Letting my head thump back against the headrest, I close my eyes and sigh. She\u2019s right. This isn\u2019t like me.</p><p>\u201cIt has absolutely nothing to do with Andy. I couldn\u2019t care less if he\u2019s jealous. I just . . . I don\u2019t want to end up like my mother. Seventy years old, bitter, and alone.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever admitted anything like this, and honestly, I didn\u2019t even know it bothered me until I found someone like Matt and then lost him before it even had a chance to go anywhere.</p><p>\u201cAnd who says you will? You\u2019re the only one who has the power over your own life, Paige. YOU control your destiny. I\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t like the idea that we\u2019re sitting outside of this guy\u2019s house stalk\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off with a glare and she huffs in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cAnonymously following. I think you\u2019re insane for not telling Kennedy that you\u2019ve strayed from the original investigation, but I guess I understand,\u201d Lorelei tells me softly. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult watching Kennedy and Griffin be so in love and not have the same thing for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>This little piece of sincerity from Lorelei shocks me into stunned silence. Lorelei has always been adamant about never wanting to fall in love again. She swore off men for the rest of her life because she doesn\u2019t think love is worth the hassle.</p><p>It completely throws me that underneath the tough exterior of hers there\u2019s a mushy romantic just like me.</p> <p>\u201cCan we please just go home so you can sleep off the booze emanating from your pores? All of this honesty tonight makes me want to castrate Andy AND Matt for messing with your heart.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe not THAT mushy.</p><p>\u201cWill you promise not to judge me for the poor choices I made while intoxicated?\u201d I beg.</p><p>Lorelei starts up the car and pulls away from the curb. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ll even help you figure out a way to get Matt to forgive you, if that\u2019s what you really want. One that doesn\u2019t involve anonymous following or calling a bartender a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should probably go back and apologize for that, huh?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Without bothering to remove the dark sunglasses perched on my face, I slide into the church pew at Saint Michael\u2019s and briefly wonder if God knows I came into his house smelling like booze and shame.</p><p>\u201cTake your glasses off\u2014this isn\u2019t a disco,\u201d my mother whispers harshly in my ear.</p><p>Thankfully, I roll my eyes at her before I remove them. And avoid reminding her that it\u2019s no longer 1970.</p><p>\u201cCare to enlighten me on why you asked me to meet you at church?\u201d I ask as I wince at the bright sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows while I stuff my sunglasses into my purse.</p><p>\u201cYou mean aside from the fact that your soul needs saving and it\u2019s been over a month since you\u2019ve set foot into a church?\u201d she whispers back.</p><p>Super. Hangover from hell AND an extra helping of guilt.</p><p>I raise my eyebrow at her as the organ music blasts from behind us. She immediately stands and begins singing along with the other parishioners, ignoring me completely.</p><p>I wait for the song to end and everyone to sit back down before I try again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was so important that it couldn\u2019t wait until later today?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She shushes me when the priest begins talking, and it takes everything in me not to loudly remind her that she chose this meeting spot. After a few minutes, she leans in closer to me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole the Communion hosts from the church last week. And yesterday, the gold chalice went missing. You need to tell your friend Kennedy to help us.\u201d</p><p>I bristle a little at the fact that she didn\u2019t demand that I help her solve this case. She\u2019s convinced my only purpose at Fool Me Once is to be a whore. Even my own mother doesn\u2019t believe in my abilities.</p><p>\u201cYou know I work there too, right? Why couldn\u2019t I be the one to help you?\u201d</p><p>Not that I would. I\u2019m too busy right now failing to help Matt, but it\u2019s the principle of the thing.</p><p>\u201cYou kiss strange men and take nudie pictures. How are you going to help us?\u201d</p><p>No matter how many times I tell her that kissing those men is a way for me to catch them cheating or how tasteful the photos are that I\u2019ve done, she knows someone whose best friend goes to this church who has a daughter who posed for Playboy and then went on to do porn, or something like that. As soon as I was hired for my first modeling job ten years ago, she started praying the rosary every single night because she thought she\u2019d lost me to the dark side.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t nudie pictures. How many times do I have to tell you this?\u201d I whisper angrily.</p><p>She shushes me again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the Lord\u2019s house. This isn\u2019t the time to be talking about your boo-boos,\u201d she informs me, her hands waving in the general direction of my boobs.</p><p>I love my mother. I love my mother. I love my mother. Maybe if I keep reminding myself, I won\u2019t strangle her in a church full of people.</p><p>The organ music starts up again and everyone stands.</p><p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re a little busy at work right now. Why doesn\u2019t someone just call the police and report the theft?\u201d</p><p>She frowns at me. \u201cThat chalice was a gift from the Pope.\u201d</p><p>She quickly crosses herself at the mention of the Pope and I roll my eyes.</p><p>My mother was born and raised Catholic and she had a very strict upbringing. When she left for college, she sowed her wild oats and went a little crazy. She never settled down and by the time she was forty, she had given up on ever finding Mr. Right and having a family. Fate decided to give her a nice swift kick in the ass on her fortieth birthday, however.</p><p>My mother was . . . how do I put this nicely . . . basically, my mother was a cougar. On her birthday, she decided to celebrate with a few girlfriends at a local college bar. After too many shots of whiskey, she met my father. He was a college student from the University of Michigan, visiting a few of his friends at Notre Dame for the weekend. Wham, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am, and six weeks later, the stick turned pink. She never got my dad\u2019s name and was too mortified to ever go back to the bar and ask around about him.</p><p>My mother immediately went back to her Catholic-guilt roots and started going to confession and Mass every single day. At seventy years old, she continues to go to Mass every day, I\u2019m sure to pray for my soul, which she assumes is indecent and always naked.</p><p>\u201cSee that nice young man two rows in front of us with the blue shirt? That\u2019s Harold Johnson. He\u2019s single and his mother told me he\u2019s always had a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother looking at the man in question. Ever since Andy and I got divorced, she\u2019s been trying to set me up with random men at church.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? His name is Harry Johnson?\u201d I whisper back, trying to contain my laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with his name? It\u2019s a strong Christian name,\u201d she argues.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a strong Christian name. It\u2019s a name that shouts \u2018my parents hate me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a good job and he even takes care of his mother,\u201d she replies, ignoring my barb.</p><p>\u201cTakes care of her, or lives in her basement?\u201d</p><p>She huffs in irritation. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with a forty-year-old man living with his poor, ailing mother. You\u2019re not getting any younger, Paige. You need to find someone special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I haven\u2019t found someone special?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She pulls her head away and stares at me, searching my face to see if I\u2019m being honest. I\u2019ve never been able to lie to my mother and she knows it. Even in high school when I thought I could get away with anything because she was always gone from the house doing one thing or another for the church. Five minutes in the door and she\u2019d be able to figure out just by looking at me how many beers I snuck at a party when I was supposed to be studying.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve already found a great guy,\u201d I mumble, sniffling in sadness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never find a great guy if you continue working as a floozy,\u201d she counters.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, I am not a floozy! I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone since Andy!\u201d</p><p>Of course the church chooses that moment to go completely silent. My mother looks around frantically and smiles embarrassedly to the people within hearing distance.</p><p>\u201cAt least wait until after Communion to talk about s-e-x,\u201d she scolds in my ear, spelling out the word like I\u2019m a toddler.</p><p>I make it through the rest of Mass without doing my mother any bodily harm and as we exit the church, she walks me up to the priest.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful sermon today, Father Bob. You remember my daughter, Paige?\u201d</p><p>Father Bob shakes my hand and gives me a warm smile. \u201cOf course I remember her. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you at Mass.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks pointedly at me and I immediately feel like I\u2019m in second grade at confession for the first time and quickly drop Father Bob\u2019s hand.</p><p>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It\u2019s been a month since my last church service and I\u2019ve been having impure thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMy mother mentioned you\u2019ve had problems lately with some thefts in the church. I\u2019m not sure if she told you, but I work for a private investigations firm,\u201d I tell him, quickly shutting down my brain and thoughts of being impure with Matt.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, yes. It\u2019s really not as bad as it sounds. I\u2019m positive it\u2019s just some poor, homeless soul who has strayed from the path of God. All we need to do is say some prayers and everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Father Bob quickly excuses himself before I can reply and rushes away to greet other parishioners.</p><p>I watch him silently for a few minutes and every once in a while he looks back over his shoulder at me, turning away quickly when he catches me staring.</p><p>\u201cFather Bob looks guilty. I think he knows more than he\u2019s letting on,\u201d I tell my mother as we make our way to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cPaige Elizabeth! Father Bob is a saint. That man baptized you, gave you your First Holy Communion, and married you and Andy,\u201d she admonishes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we see how well that turned out,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cFran, Eunice, come over here and say hello to Paige.\u201d</p><p>I turn in the direction my mother is looking and see her two friends quickly amble over to us. Well, as quickly as they can considering Fran uses a cane and Eunice is pushing a walker.</p><p>\u201cPaige, it\u2019s good to see you back at church. Did you hear that Harold Johnson is single?\u201d Eunice asks.</p><p>Oh, for the love of God.</p><p>\u201cEunice, who in their right mind would date that man? He lives with his mother and collects aspirin,\u201d Fran interjects.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, he collects what?\u201d I ask in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cAspirin. Every size, shape, and color imaginable. He glues them to poster board and hangs them up all over his mother\u2019s house. I think he\u2019s a serial killer,\u201d Fran explains, dramatically whispering the last part.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very artistic,\u201d my mother says indignantly. \u201cI heard he even has aspirin from Germany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be willing to bet next week\u2019s bingo winnings that those are roofies hanging all over his mother\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>We all turn to stare at Fran.</p><p>\u201cWhat are roofies? Are those the ones from Germany?\u201d Eunice asks.</p><p>Fran opens her mouth to most likely school Eunice on all things roofies, and I quickly change the subject before this conversation goes downhill any faster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what do you guys think about Father Bob and the thefts that have been going on here?\u201d</p><p>Fran huffs and lifts up her cane to point it at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right, Paige. What is this world coming to when a church isn\u2019t even safe? We should all get guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, no! You should definitely not get any guns. That is a bad idea,\u201d I argue.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get a gun at Kroger? I have a coupon in my pocketbook for a dollar off any item,\u201d Eunice says excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI say we handle this ourselves. Take back the church!\u201d my mother shouts.</p><p>\u201cTAKE BACK THE CHURCH!\u201d Fran and Eunice echo.</p><p>I need to put a stop to this before it turns into all-out old-lady anarchy.</p><p>\u201cNo one is taking back anything!

You just give Kennedy a call for me. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be able to get to the bottom of it. In the meantime, I\u2019ll give Harold your number. Maybe he\u2019ll let you look at all his roofies.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Grabbing three canisters of pepper spray from the junk drawer in my kitchen, I shove them into my bag. Slamming the drawer closed with my hip, I pause when I hear a knock at the door.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s Lorelei. She knows I used her computer at the office to pull up old court records of Vinnie DeMarco so I could get his address. She knows I\u2019m planning on staking out his house to see if Melanie shows up. If I\u2019m real quiet, she\u2019ll go away. She won\u2019t break the door down like Kennedy if I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cPaige, are you home? It\u2019s Matt.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of his voice makes a lump form in my throat, especially since our last encounter wasn\u2019t a pleasant one.</p><p>On the way home from church with my mother the previous week, I stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few odds and ends. As I was walking back out to my car, my arms loaded with bags, I ran into Matt. Literally. I was losing the grip on one of the bags and as I stepped down off of the curb trying to juggle them, I barreled right into him. Of course the bag filled with all of the items a woman needs to get over a man spilled out at his feet: a family-size bag of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, a gallon of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, two bottles of Hershey\u2019s Chocolate Syrup, a can of Reddi-wip, and a bottle of Moscato.</p><p>The universe hates me. I would have much preferred the bag of tampons and Midol had fallen at his feet.</p><p>I could do nothing but stare at him as he bent down to pick up everything I dropped. When he stood back up and wordlessly handed me the bag, he began to walk away without saying one word to me, and I finally shook myself out of the shock of seeing him again to speak.</p><p>\u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t following you,\u201d I told him with a shaky laugh.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find it funny. He stuck his hands in his pockets and stared out at the parking lot. He couldn\u2019t even stand to look at me, and it made me want to sit down on the curb and immediately start making myself a Reese\u2019s Fudge Brownie Hershey Moscato sundae.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my text?\u201d I asked him lamely.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you read it?\u201d I tried again.</p><p>My heart thudded loudly in my ears. I knew this was my only chance to get him to understand and I was blowing it.</p><p>He sighed and turned back toward me, refusing to look at my face. His gaze landed somewhere between my chin and my neck. My plan of forcing him to look into my eyes and see that I was truly sorry wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have a lot going on in my life right now and I just don\u2019t have time for . . . this. Whatever this is. Or was. Fuck!\u201d Matt cursed, his frustration with me evident.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Matt,\u201d I whispered, willing the tears in my eyes not to fall and show him how much it hurts that he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he brushed past me and into the grocery store.</p><p>I shake the depressing memory of our encounter last weekend out of my head and rush to the door. I probably shouldn\u2019t open it because he could very well be even angrier than Lorelei right now, but I want to see him. Even if it means I have to stand here and take it when he tells me how much he can\u2019t stand me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d answer,\u201d he says in greeting as I fling open the door.</p><p>Just like every time I see him, I\u2019m taken aback by how good he looks. Even when he\u2019s frustrated or angry, I don\u2019t want to take my eyes off of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? How did you know where I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped by your office to cancel my request for a PI, and when your friend Lorelei went into the back to grab the file, I snooped through your desk and found some address labels,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cWow. That was pretty sneaky of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start with me about being sneaky,\u201d Matt warns.</p><p>He softens the blow by smiling at me. I missed that smile. I\u2019m such a sucker.</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d he asks, pointing to the bag flung over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFirst, tell me why you\u2019re here. If it\u2019s to inform me what a horrible person I am, I already got that memo last weekend.\u201d</p><p>He shoves his hands into the front pockets of his jeans and cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not a horrible person. I\u2019m sorry for losing my temper at the diner and for being so shitty at the store. It was just . . . a lot to take in and I was confused and hurt.\u201d</p><p>It takes everything in me not to reach out and touch him, not to wrap my arms around him and beg for his forgiveness. Even though I\u2019ve been a sniveling mess since I screwed things up with him, and I miss him so much it hurts, I\u2019m still me. Deep down I\u2019m still the same strong, independent woman I found again after I left Andy, and I\u2019m not about to put my heart on the line for someone until I know for sure the feelings are mutual. For all I know he just showed up here out of guilt for not giving me a chance to explain.</p><p>\u201cI should have been honest with you. I just didn\u2019t expect everything to go down the way it did. That day you showed up at the office asking to hire us to trail Melanie, I freaked out.\u201d</p><p>Matt stares at me in confusion. \u201cYou were at the office that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. I was under Lorelei\u2019s desk,\u201d I admit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why she kept shifting in her chair and coughing. I thought something was seriously wrong with her,\u201d Matt says with a laugh. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve had some time to think about everything, and I get why you did what you did. Lorelei explained everything to me. Melanie hired you guys for some asinine reason and it was a conflict of interest for you to tell me anything when you met me. I should have never expected you to put your career or your friendships on the line for someone you just met.\u201d</p><p>I silently make a promise to myself to get Lorelei the best pair of shoes money can buy as a thank-you present for having my back even if she doesn\u2019t agree with what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Nodding my head, I move in closer to him in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to lie to you. Everything just snowballed so quickly. I wanted to tell you. As soon as you told me about her lawsuit and your father\u2019s company, I knew I had to help you.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s face softens. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the whole modeling thing? I Googled you when I got home from the diner that night. Jesus Christ, Paige. You\u2019re like Cindy Crawford famous. You must have thought I was a total loser when I didn\u2019t know who you were.\u201d</p><p>I reach for Matt\u2019s hand, sliding my fingers through his.</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were a loser, I swear. It\u2019s just, for practically my entire life, people have looked at me and immediately wondered how they could use my looks for their benefit. No one ever saw the real me or realized I might want something more out of my life than sitting in front of a camera. You saw the real me, and it was amazing to just be plain old Paige and not \u2018Paige McCarty, the model.\u2019 I probably could have gone about this whole mess a little better, but I honestly didn\u2019t know what to do without screwing over everyone I care about.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Matt\u2019s mouth tips up with a grin, and he takes another step closer to me until his chest is pressed right up against mine. \u201cYou make it so hard to stay mad at you. I have a thousand questions running through my head and all I can think about is kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>Smiling back at him, I place the palm of my hand over his heart and smile back. \u201cWell, I think you should just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige Elizabeth, stop canoodling in the doorway in front of God and everyone.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>I immediately pull back from Matt as my mother shoulders past us into my condo. \u201cDo you have any Tums? My indigestion is flaring up.\u201d</p><p>Matt laughs behind me and my mother shoots him a dirty look. He immediately stops laughing and clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cWho is this yahoo, and why is he standing in your doorway? Did you stand him up for one night\u2014is that what this is?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018one-night stand,\u2019 Mom, and no. This is my friend Matt. Matt, this is my mother, Margaret McCarty.\u201d</p><p>Matt moves around me and extends his hand out to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. McCarty.\u201d</p><p>My mother crosses her arms in front of her and glares at Matt. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss, not Mrs. Are you one of the people who takes indecent pictures of my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Here we go again.</p><p>I sigh as Matt slowly brings his arm back down to his side when he sees my mother has no intention of shaking his hand. \u201cNo, Mom. He\u2019s not a photographer. And once again, they aren\u2019t indecent pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your tush in the one you did for that Maximum magazine. Everyone in my needlepoint club saw your tush,\u201d she complains.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Maxim, Mom. And what were you doing reading Maxim magazine anyway?\u201d</p><p>My mother shrugs and digs in her purse, finding a package of Kleenex and pulling one out. \u201cI read it for the articles.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckles while my mother blows her nose, her eyes zeroing in on the bag still draped over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d she asks, crumpling up the Kleenex and shoving it back into her purse.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes. I was just heading out to do some work when Matt showed up.\u201d</p><p>My mom purses her lips and crosses her arms over her chest again. \u201cAre you doing nudie pictures again? No, don\u2019t tell me. I want to make sure I show enough shock on my face when Eunice and Fran tell me they saw your bump-bump at the supermarket checkout next to Good Housekeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m not doing nudie pictures or any pictures of any kind. I told you, I retired. I work full time at the private investigation firm,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about your work as a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>Why do I bother . . .</p><p>\u201cUh, is there something else you want to tell me?\u201d Matt whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI am not a prostitute!\u201d I raise my voice to bring my point home.</p><p>\u201cYou kiss a bunch of men and get paid to do it,\u201d she reminds me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an investigator, Mom. I\u2019m paid to catch men who cheat on their wives.\u201d</p><p>My mother turns her angry glare to Matt and walks toward him. \u201cHas my daughter kissed you?\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s eyes widen in fear. He looks from my mother to me.</p><p>\u201cMom, cut it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take that as a \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d she tells Matt, completely ignoring my warning. \u201cSo you\u2019re a cheater. You don\u2019t look like a cheater. Andy looked like a cheater. I told Paige she should have never married that good-for-nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt is NOT a cheater, Mom. Matt is a good guy, so leave him alone. I really need to get going. I have work to do. Why don\u2019t I stop by next weekend for dinner?\u201d</p><p>I slide my hand around her arm and gently steer her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my bridge club next weekend, and Fran is making her Jell-O salad. I can\u2019t miss Fran\u2019s Jell-O salad. I\u2019ll just come with you to work.\u201d</p><p>I stop in my tracks and stare down at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t come to work with me. I\u2019m going on a stakeout. It could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, not really. All I plan on doing is parking my car a block away from Vinnie DeMarco\u2019s house to see if Melanie makes an appearance. The most dangerous thing that will happen is not being able to say no to the ice cream truck when it drives by ten times.</p><p>My mother reaches her hand into her purse and this time, instead of a Kleenex, her hand comes back out with a revolver.</p><p>\u201cJESUS CHRIST, MOM!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d</p><p>Matt and I shout at the same time as we dive for the floor while she waves the gun around.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of Saint Patrick, will you get up off the ground? It\u2019s not even loaded. The bullets are in my glove box,\u201d Mom says with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing with a gun?!\u201d I screech at her from my position on the floor, flat on my stomach with my hands still covering my head.</p><p>\u201cThe church was broken into again two days ago during our Altar and Rosary meeting. They took the Communion hosts for the next few years this time,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe think it was Father John from Holy Cross because he plays poker every week with Father Bob, and Father Bob keeps winning. Father John is a sore loser. Anyway, it\u2019s a dangerous world out there when someone starts stealing Communion. Eunice and I went up to the gun shop and got ourselves some protection. Get up off the floor. I can\u2019t talk to you down there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare up at her as she points the gun at me while she speaks.</p><p>\u201cCould you please aim the gun elsewhere?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>My mother sighs in irritation and lowers her arm. Matt pushes himself up off the floor when he sees it\u2019s safe to do so, reaches down, and pulls me up next to him. \u201cWhat exactly is this stakeout you speak of?\u201d</p> <p>Brushing myself off, I stare at Matt\u2019s ass as he turns away from me, bends over, and picks up my bag that fell to the ground during my dive to safety.</p><p>He really has a great ass.</p><p>My eyes flick away guiltily as he turns around and smirks at me.</p><p>\u201cI found out where Vinnie DeMarco lives. I\u2019m going to park down the street and see if Melanie shows up.\u201d</p><p>Matt stares at me in shock. \u201cWait, you\u2019ve still been working on this even after everything that happened?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cWell, yeah. It\u2019s not fair, what she\u2019s doing to you. I couldn\u2019t just let that go.\u201d</p><p>He has a really good poker face right now and doesn\u2019t give away anything that he\u2019s thinking. I hope this goes a little way toward proving to him that he can trust me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not even a question. He just tells me what he\u2019s going to do. With my sense of independence since I kicked Andy\u2019s ass to the curb, I don\u2019t take too kindly to people telling me what to do. Matt leans in close to me and brushes a lock of hair off of my cheek. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>A gun with an arm attached to it suddenly shoves its way between our bodies. \u201cSave room for the Holy Ghost. Let\u2019s get a move on. I need to get some food in my stomach so I can take my arthritis medication.\u201d</p> <p>My mom pushes her way between the two of us and walks out into the sunshine.</p><p>I grudgingly follow behind her, leading the way for Matt to follow. I close and lock the door behind us and slide my hand into his as we walk down the front steps toward the parking lot, where my mother is already tapping her foot next to the passenger-side door.</p><p>I can\u2019t help being a little embarrassed. This whole thing with Matt didn\u2019t exactly start off under great circumstances, and now I\u2019m dragging him out for an afternoon with my insane mother. Even if I did still believe in fairy tales and happily ever after, I\u2019d have to light that romantic notion on fire at this point. I\u2019m a little shocked he didn\u2019t crash through the front door like a cartoon character as soon as she pulled her gun from her bag.</p><p>\u201cIf this is too weird for you, you don\u2019t have to come with us,\u201d I tell him, stopping far enough away from my car so my mother doesn\u2019t hear us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie\u2014this is all a little crazy right now. I like you. A lot. And that scares the shit out of me because I don\u2019t know if I can trust you. You\u2019re going out on a limb to help me and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because you have feelings for me or you just feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>When I open my mouth to tell him it has absolutely nothing to do with guilt and everything to do with how I feel about him, he holds a hand up to stop me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Just . . . not yet. I\u2019m not trying to be mean or ungrateful for what you\u2019re doing. I just need time for my brain to process everything,\u201d he admits.</p><p>I put on my big-girl panties and nod at him, not letting his words cut a hole in my heart. I know what he\u2019s going through. I know what it\u2019s like to lose your trust in someone and struggle to find it again. I just never thought I would be the one someone didn\u2019t trust. At least he still thinks about kissing me, so there\u2019s that.</p> <p>\u201cWell, a stakeout in my VW Bug with my seventy-year-old, gun-toting, arthritic mother sounds like a great way for you to start processing things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I ask dryly.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t leave me alone with Margaret and her gun, I think this will be a good start.\u201d Matt smiles at me as I hit the button on my key chain to unlock the doors to my car.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Am I the first person ever to stare at you blankly when you told me your name? You must have thought I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Leaning my head back against the seat, I stare over at Matt. He mirrors my pose and I scoot my body a little closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not offended, believe me. I was serious when I said I liked it that you didn\u2019t know who I was. It was nice being able to talk to someone who didn\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d I admit to him.</p><p>Matt slides over to the edge of his seat as well until there are only a few inches and a gearshift separating us. \u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough that you\u2019re doing this for me. Are your friends going to hate you when they find out what happened?\u201d</p><p>The concern in his voice melts my heart. He\u2019s about to lose the company his father worked hard for all his life, his ex is dating a mobster who might fit us for cement shoes if he finds us trailing him, and he\u2019s worried about my well-being.</p><p>Where did this guy come from?</p><p>\u201cLorelei already knows, sort of. She hasn\u2019t told Kennedy yet, and that\u2019s a little concerning. Kennedy is the one we need to worry about. She carries a gun,\u201d I tell him with a smile. \u201cBut seriously, once we get this all figured out and I can explain to her what happened, she\u2019s going to understand. I know it.\u201d</p><p>Matt leans across the gearshift, meeting me in the middle until I can feel his breath on my face. \u201cBut this is the Mob we\u2019re dealing with. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you because of me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss someone so badly in my entire life. I still remember how soft his lips were and how he tasted. I remember the feel of his tongue sliding against mine and how tightly his arms wrapped around my body, holding me close to him. Memories aren\u2019t doing it for me right now, though. I need the real thing.</p><p>Staring into his gorgeous eyes, I start to close the distance between us, the sound of my heartbeat thumping in my ears with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHow long are we going to just sit here? My bursitis is acting up.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I pull away from Matt and glare at my mother as she opens the rear door and gets back in from stretching her legs. I guess that wasn\u2019t my heart I heard pounding a few moments ago. It was her stomping her foot against the ground trying to get some feeling back in her legs.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come with us. You could have stayed at my place,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cI thought this stakeout thing would be a little more exciting.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from her, I give Matt an apologetic look and he smiles back at me. Even with my mother complaining in the backseat, I still can\u2019t stop thinking about kissing him again. Or imagining him naked. Is it wrong that my mother is two feet away and I\u2019m wondering what it would feel like to run my hands all over his naked body? Matt\u2019s eyes darken as he stares back at me, almost like he knows what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what a shameful walk looks like. I\u2019ve always wondered.\u201d</p><p>Breaking from my lustful thoughts, I look back at my mother and see her staring out her window. Whipping my head around, I see Melanie coming down the front steps of Vinnie DeMarco\u2019s home. She\u2019s carrying a pair of heels in her hand, she\u2019s got mascara smudged under her eyes, and her hair looks like a rat\u2019s nest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018walk of shame,\u2019 Mom,\u201d I mutter as all three of us stare silently at Melanie while she stands at the end of the driveway, looking up and down the street.</p><p>A few minutes later, a taxi pulls up and she hops into the backseat. Matt and I duck down at the same time as the taxi slowly drives past my car.</p><p>\u201cThe coast is clear,\u201d my mother informs us.</p><p>As I sit up I look over at Matt to see how he\u2019s doing. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He rights himself in his seat and stares straight out the front window to the end of Vinnie\u2019s driveway, which Melanie just vacated.</p><p>Shit. Why in the hell do I do this to myself? I shouldn\u2019t be lusting after someone who\u2019s still hung up on his ex.</p><p>He just witnessed her leaving another man\u2019s home. I mean, he had a feeling she was seeing someone else, but now he pretty much has proof since she just left the guy\u2019s house with her hair looking like it spent plenty of hours on another man\u2019s pillow.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d I whisper his name and he finally blinks out of his daze and looks over at me. When he sees the worry on my face, he smiles reassuringly at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just weird. I mean, I\u2019ve known her since college. At one time she was my best friend. I knew this was happening, but it\u2019s just . . . I don\u2019t know. Hard to see it with my own eyes.\u201d</p><p>I swallow roughly and try not to let it bother me that he\u2019s hurt over that lying skank.</p><p>I remove my hand from its death grip on the steering wheel. I slide my fingers through his and give his hand a gentle squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to use my gun.\u201d Mom sniffs irritably from the backseat, and just like that, I stop feeling sorry for myself. \u201cCan we get some food now? I need to take my pills.\u201d</p><p>After stopping at a diner on our way home, my mom hops out of my car as soon as I pull into my parking spot, telling me to keep her posted and that if I need her help, to give her a call.</p><p>Matt and I stand silently next to my car, and watch her pull out of the parking lot and drive away.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was informative,\u201d Matt says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSorry about all of those childhood stories she bored you with. I swear I don\u2019t make up dances to Madonna songs anymore and force my mother and her friends to watch me perform them over dinner.\u201d</p><p>Matt moves in front of me and brushes a strand of hair out of my eyes with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I think I\u2019d kind of like to see you shaking your thing to \u2018Like a Virgin,\u2019\u201d he laughs.</p><p>I smack him playfully in the chest, leaving my hand to rest over his heart. When I feel the muscles of his pecs under my hands, my brain immediately goes right into lusty territory, and I wonder again what he looks like naked. And how soon I can get a glimpse of said nakedness.</p><p>We stare silently at each other for several minutes. The butterflies in my stomach are threatening to escape if he doesn\u2019t do something soon. Something like kiss the ever-living hell out of me.</p><p>I know I should back away. I can tell he\u2019s trying to forget about what he saw earlier and there\u2019s an internal war going on inside of him right now. Before I can move away from him, he shakes his head and curses.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my face in his hands and pulls me to him. As soon as our lips touch, I know I\u2019m never going to pass up a chance to kiss this man. Matt doesn\u2019t waste any time deepening the kiss and I moan into his mouth when his tongue skims against mine. Bringing my arms up to his shoulders, I pull him closer. He leans his body against mine, pressing me against the side of my car.</p><p>This man knows how to kiss. His lips are soft, yet firm, and his tongue does delicious things to me as it swirls though my mouth. Desire pools in my stomach and my hips instinctively shift against him. I want to feel him everywhere. I want his hands on my naked body and I want him inside me. I\u2019ve never craved anyone this much, not even Andy. I was attracted to him, and sex with him was always good, but I never felt like I would die if I didn\u2019t have him.</p><p>Matt\u2019s hands drop from my face and slide around my hips to cup my ass, pulling me harder against him. I can feel the evidence of his need for me and it just makes everything sweeter. Every slide of his tongue, every press of his lips, every whisper of air he breathes into me is so delectable that I never want it to end.</p><p>He gently sucks my tongue into his mouth and thrusts his hips between my legs. I can feel his erection sliding against me and my need for him climbs to new heights. I can\u2019t stop myself from pushing back against him, the desire I feel taking over where common sense left off. We\u2019re dry humping each other against the side of my car in broad daylight, and his kiss made me completely forget that just an hour ago, he was saddened by the sight of seeing his ex leaving another man\u2019s house.</p><p>A car honks in the distance, and Matt pulls his mouth away from mine. \u201cI really, really need to leave,\u201d he tells me softly, pressing his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I can\u2019t keep the dejection out of my voice.</p><p>I really don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t just bang me on the hood of the car.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right, because I\u2019m better than this and I need him to want me for me and not just as a distraction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, I swear. But if I don\u2019t leave right now, I\u2019m going to take you upstairs, lock the door, and refuse to come out until we\u2019re both naked, sweaty, and exhausted.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the problem again?</p><p>I nod my head like I completely understand what he\u2019s talking about. Why can\u2019t he just forget about Melanie already?</p><p>\u201cI know as soon as I walk away from you I\u2019m going to regret saying this, but I just think we need to take this slow. I\u2019ve already got one fucked-up relationship under my belt. I want things to be different this time.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t fault him for his honesty. I need to prove to him that he can trust me, and I suppose slow and truthful is better than hurried and naked. For now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I get it. But just know, when we finally are naked and sweaty, I\u2019ll make sure you won\u2019t have anything on your mind except for what I\u2019m doing to you,\u201d I tell him with a wink.</p><p>He groans, and by the look on his face, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s second-guessing his noble efforts. I laugh and kiss him quickly on the lips and then move back before I take him against his will on the sidewalk. While fun, I don\u2019t think the neighbors would appreciate the show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I make sure to add a little extra sway to my hips as I walk away from him. Just because we\u2019re taking things slow doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t torture him just a little.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Paige McCarty!\u201d Matt shouts to me as I climb up the stairs and put my key in the lock.</p><p>I can\u2019t keep the smile off of my face as I open the door and leave him outside on the sidewalk to think about what he\u2019s missing. I hear his truck start up and pull away a few seconds later as I flop down on the couch, tossing my bag onto the coffee table. Seeing a piece of paper sitting on the glass top, I lean forward and pick it up. The smile dies on my face when I see the words scribbled across it in perfectly neat, block letters:</p> <p>IF YOU KNOW WHAT\u2019S GOOD FOR YA, YOU\u2019LL STOP STICKIN YOUR NOSE WHERE IT DON\u2019T BELONG. GO BACK TO BEING IN PRETTY PICTURES AND NO ONE GETS HURT.</p><p>I drop the note like it\u2019s on fire and scramble up from the couch, staring frantically around my condo, afraid to breathe.</p><p>Someone was in my home. Someone knows I\u2019ve been looking into Vinnie DeMarco. What if they\u2019re still here?</p><p>For the first time today, I wish my mother were here with her gun.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p> <p>We\u2019re going to the fucking police right now,\u201d Matt states angrily as he hits the blinker in his F-150 truck to take us into town.</p><p>When I ran out of my house in a panic, I pulled my phone out of my purse and called the first person I thought of. Was it just because I could still taste him on my lips? I could have called my mom, but I knew she would just lecture me, and I could have called Kennedy, but that would mean I\u2019d have to come clean about what I\u2019d been doing and I wasn\u2019t ready for that. The only person I wanted in the midst of my fear was Matt. It exhilarated me and scared the shit out of me all at the same time.</p><p>I\u2019d grown used to my independence in the months since my divorce, and it was a frightening feeling to want to depend on another person again. Especially one of the male gender who could fuck me over in the blink of an eye and crush my heart to pieces if he suddenly decided he was still in love with his lying, cheating ex.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get the police involved. I probably overreacted. For all I know it was Andy trying to cause trouble because I won\u2019t give him any money.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the empty intersection and stares across the front seat of the truck at me. I can see the battle going on in his eyes. He wants so much to protect me from the person who left a threatening note in my house, but he also wants to do whatever I ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this, Paige. I don\u2019t like this at all.\u201d</p> <p>Then he sighs deeply and takes the street that leads away from downtown and away from the police.</p><p>Andy would always make decisions for me. He would tell me that he was doing what he thought was in my best interest or say that the few years in age he had on me meant that he was able to make more informed choices about my life. Really, he wanted to make me feel like I needed him to function. For the first few months after we separated, I almost believed it. I didn\u2019t know how to do anything on my own. I didn\u2019t remember how to make the simplest of decisions because I had been relying on him for so long. With the help of my friends, I was able to see just how much he controlled my life and slowly get my independence back.</p><p>Something as little as having Matt listen to me when I tell him what I want means more to me than he\u2019ll ever know. He didn\u2019t belittle me or tell me that I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. He let me make my own decision, even if it turns out to be the wrong one.</p><p>I feel my throat growing tight with unshed tears and I have to clear it to keep them at bay. I will not cry right now.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would have let me look through your place. What if whoever left that note was still there?\u201d Matt asks.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? That\u2019s like something straight out of a horror movie. You never go back into a house looking for the bad people. It always ends with a machete to the face,\u201d I argue.</p><p>\u201cA machete, huh? Do you normally have a lot of people with machetes after you?\u201d Matt asks with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m seriously considering turning the truck around and going back to the police if that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I probably just made a big deal out of nothing. I\u2019ll get hold of Andy first thing tomorrow and put the fear of God into him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t that little weasel, what then? Your friends aren\u2019t sick and twisted enough to do this as some sort of joke, are they?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie; it warms my heart even more that he called Andy a weasel.</p><p>I laugh easily at the idea that Kennedy and Lorelei would sneak into my house and leave a note like that for me, the heaviness of my thoughts from a moment ago disappearing quickly. \u201cOkay, I think it\u2019s safe to say Lorelei would have never done something like that. She would have used bigger words to drive her point home, and she would have been more polite. Like, \u2018Please discontinue your inquisitive ways or we shall be obliged to damage your appendages,\u2019\u201d I tell him in my best Lorelei voice.</p><p>\u201cI would have to agree even though I\u2019ve only talked to her for a few minutes. But what about Kennedy? She carries a gun and she sounds scary,\u201d Matt says with a dramatic shiver. The smile on his face proves that he believed me when I said they wouldn\u2019t do something like this, and he\u2019s trying to distract me by making light of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s close to something Kennedy would have said, but hers would have had more cursing. \u2018Get your fucking head out of your ass before I punch you in the goddamn face.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Matt and I laugh together as I describe my friend\u2019s personalities to him with just a few sentences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called me,\u201d he says softly as he pulls into a driveway of a gorgeous Cape Cod home and puts his truck in park.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t give me a chance to reply as he jumps out of the truck and comes around to my side, opening the door for me and taking my hand to help me down. Hand in hand we walk up the steps of his front porch, and I stand to the side, admiring his profile as he unlocks the front door.</p><p>As soon as we walk inside, Matt hits a switch and bathes the living room in light. I have to say, I\u2019m a little shocked at what I see. I assumed his place would look similar to Andy\u2019s apartment: mismatched furniture, no pictures on the wall, still-unpacked boxes littering the floors, and takeout containers in the kitchen. Matt\u2019s home is tastefully decorated and spotless. There aren\u2019t any signs that a woman used to live here, but it also doesn\u2019t look like a bachelor pad. It\u2019s gray and black and full of leather, and I love it. I notice a framed picture on an end table next to the couch, and I walk right up to it and lift it up for a better look. In the picture, Matt has his arm around the shoulders of an older man; it almost looks like a before-and-after picture. I can tell right away that this is Matt\u2019s father and also how nicely Matt is going to age. His father is a handsome man with the same bright blue eyes and dark hair as his son, except he has a few gray hairs at his temples and wrinkles around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is a great picture. I\u2019m assuming this is your dad?\u201d</p><p>Matt comes up behind me and looks over my shoulder. \u201cYep. That\u2019s Eric Russo. Obviously, he gets his good looks from me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, setting the picture back down and turning around to face him.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me where the bathroom is? I want to wash up a little. And if you have anything I can use as pajamas, that would be good too. I didn\u2019t think to grab anything when I went racing out of my house like a chicken.\u201d</p><p>Matt places his hands on my shoulders, sliding them up my neck until he cups my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can find something for you to wear. And you aren\u2019t a chicken. I would have gone screaming into the night if someone left a note like that for me too.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips a beat as he places a kiss on the tip of my nose before grabbing my hand and pulling me down the hallway.</p><p>I can\u2019t keep the smile off of my face as I stare at myself in the mirror. I washed off the day\u2019s makeup and ran a comb through my hair. I\u2019m wearing an old T-shirt of Matt\u2019s and a pair of his boxer shorts and I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable. As I head for the door, I pull the neck of the shirt up to my nose and take a deep breath, loving how it smells exactly like Matt.</p><p>I step out of the bathroom and into the hall, walking over to Matt\u2019s room to thank him and say good-night. Instead of letting things turn awkward when it came time to discuss sleeping arrangements, as soon as he handed me the T-shirt and boxers, I told him I was fine sleeping on the couch. He tried to argue with me and give me his bed, but I wouldn\u2019t have it. He\u2019s done enough for me tonight; I\u2019m not about to make him give up his bed. Or beg him to let me sleep in it with him.</p><p>I poke my head into his bedroom and lose my breath when I see him resting on top of his covers. He\u2019s shirtless and has on a pair of gray sweatpants, and his hands are resting under his head with his feet crossed at the ankles. His eyes slowly open as I hover in the doorway.</p><p>He takes me in from head to toe and I feel a little self-conscious when I remember I\u2019m not wearing a stitch of makeup.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Matt says in awe.</p><p>I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve heard this back in my modeling days. But hearing it come out of a man\u2019s mouth when I\u2019m fresh faced and wearing one of his shirts and a pair of his boxers, it warms every single spot inside of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still standing all the way over there? Come here.\u201d</p><p>He slides over and pats the bed next to him. I should turn and run down the stairs\u2014I really should.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I hedge as I stare at the happy trail disappearing into the waistband of his pajama pants.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent idea. Just let me hold you for a little while.\u201d</p><p>His voice is soft and no longer teasing. I can see in his face that he\u2019s concerned about me. Even though we made jokes and I tried to convince myself that Andy was the one who left me that creepy note, we both know there is a strong possibility someone much more dangerous could be out there watching me. In the dim light of his quiet bedroom this late at night, I realize Matt would never judge me for being weak, or admitting I\u2019m scared and don\u2019t want to be alone right now.</p><p>Padding across the floor in my bare feet, I crawl up the bed until I\u2019m next to him, curling up against his side and resting my cheek on his chest. I trace little circles on his stomach with my fingertips and watch as his stomach dips when I ghost over a ticklish spot.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming to my rescue tonight,\u201d I whisper against his skin.</p><p>Matt\u2019s hand threads its way through the long strands of my hair over and over. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called me. I like having you here, wearing my clothes.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the smile in his voice and I lift my head so I can see his face. He stares down at me with one arm still resting casually under his head. Lifting my face up to his, I press my lips against his cheek and hold them there. When I pull away, Matt is staring into my eyes. All worries about threatening notes and him being in love with Melanie fly from my mind, and all I can think about is getting closer to him. Grabbing onto my hips, he pulls me on top of him. With my legs straddling him and my chest pressed against his, I feel every hard inch of him between my legs; nothing separates us but a few scraps of cotton. Leaning up, I reach for the hem of Matt\u2019s shirt that covers my body and pull it over my head. He sucks in a breath when I\u2019m bared to him and his hands immediately come up to cover my breasts.</p><p>\u201cI know I talked a good game earlier about taking things slow. Obviously that\u2019s not going to work out for me. If you\u2019re not sure, or if this is too fast, we don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he whispers softly as he stares at his hands moving gently over my breasts, his thumbs sliding over my nipples and causing me to jerk my hips against him.</p><p>\u201cNot fast enough. Definitely not fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Resting my hands on top of his, I lean back down and kiss him. He lifts his hips against me with each sweep of his tongue through my mouth and I want more. I can\u2019t get close enough, can\u2019t move my body fast enough against him. We quickly pull away from each other and clothes are ripped off and tossed to the side of the bed. I let out a contented sigh when we\u2019re both naked, skin to skin, hands touching everywhere we can reach. Matt lets out a groan when my hand wraps around his length and I stroke him from top to bottom. He\u2019s smooth and hard in my hand. I could spend the entire night touching him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Paige. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The guttural words from Matt\u2019s mouth turn me on more than I thought possible.</p><p>\u201cThen hurry your ass up and take me.\u201d</p><p>I let out a squeak of surprise when Matt suddenly flips me onto my back and positions himself between my legs. He slides his erection through my wetness until I\u2019m clutching at his back with my nails, trying to pull him closer. The head of his penis moves back and forth over my clit and I feel that familiar coil deep in my belly, signaling my quickly approaching orgasm. I watch between our bodies as Matt grabs his erection and guides it slowly inside of me. Throwing my head back, I moan when I feel him enter me and push his way inside. He\u2019s thick and hard and nothing has ever felt this amazing or this right.</p><p>He pulls back out slowly and my hands grab onto his ass, pulling him back in hard. He starts up a delicious rhythm with his hips, not treating me like a delicate flower, and then thrusts into me over and over and my hips push up against him, trying to force him harder and deeper. Wrapping my legs around his waist I let him take me, claim me, and own me. My orgasm bursts out of me, and Matt swallows my cries with his mouth. I kiss him back hard, moving my hands up to the back of his head and holding him in place while he shudders and groans through his own release a few minutes later. I feel him throbbing inside of me and tighten my legs around him, holding him close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Through the haze of my orgasm and the distraction of Matt\u2019s tongue lazily stroking through my mouth, I hear the ringing of my cell phone on Matt\u2019s bedside table. Moving my head away from him, I crane my head to check the caller ID while he nestles his face into the side of my neck and places soft kisses against my skin.</p><p>\u201cJust let it ring.\u201d Matt speaks against my neck.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of answering it, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I reassure him as I run my fingers through his hair.</p> <p>When I see the name flash across my screen, I can\u2019t help the surprised word that flies from my mouth. \u201cAndy?\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s head jerks away from my neck and he stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say your ex-husband\u2019s name while my penis is still inside of you?\u201d</p><p>Looking away from my phone, I see the irritated look in Matt\u2019s face and I instantly feel bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! This is a little awkward. I saw his name on my caller ID. I have no idea why he\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p> <p>Matt reaches over and grabs my phone, bringing it up to his ear without taking his eyes off of me. \u201cSorry, Andy. Paige is busy right now; she\u2019ll have to call you later. And by later, I mean never.\u201d</p><p>He quickly ends the call and tosses the phone onto the floor. \u201cI hope that was okay. I don\u2019t need your ex-husband in the room with us. I\u2019m not quite finished with you yet.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his hips against me and I let out a moan. \u201cThat is perfectly fine with me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Paige? Oh, my God, Oh, my God, Oh, my God. Who the hell was that who answered your phone? Fuck, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s really bad. Those people I told you I owe money to . . . they grabbed me outside of work. They\u2019re going to kill me, Paige! They want their money by the weekend, or they said they\u2019re going to start cutting off my fingers. MY FINGERS, Paige! I need my fingers! They want a hundred grand now. I need you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Holding my phone out in front of me with a shaking hand, I look up when the voice mail cuts off. Dallas Osborne, a friend and private investigator with a neighboring PI agency, stands quietly by my desk with his hands on his hips. His face gives nothing away. I called Dallas as soon as I listened to the voice mail, and he said he\u2019d meet me at the office so I could play him the message. He\u2019s listened to it three times now, and each time, he\u2019s said nothing other than a quiet \u201cplay it again.\u201d Lorelei stands next to him, wringing her hands together with a look of worry on her face. I didn\u2019t want to involve my friends in this, but Lorelei was at the office finishing up some work when we all showed up. She hasn\u2019t said a word yet, and I\u2019m afraid of what will happen when she finally does open her mouth. She is not going to be happy with me that I\u2019ve let things go this far without telling Kennedy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already listened to this voice mail a hundred times since Matt and I woke up this morning, and I\u2019m freaking out enough as it is. I don\u2019t know if I can handle Lorelei\u2019s wrath as well. As much as I hate Andy, I would never want to see him dead. It\u2019s all fun and games to imagine lighting your ex\u2019s penis on fire until you get a call from him in the middle of the night saying someone is going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do, Dallas?\u201d I ask as I set my phone on top of my desk.</p><p>\u201cWe need to call Kennedy. That\u2019s what we need to do,\u201d Lorelei states.</p><p>\u201cI already called Kennedy. She\u2019s in Indianapolis with Griffin serving a subpoena. I figured it was best not to worry her,\u201d Dallas explains.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me right now? She SHOULD be worried. I knew I should have told her what you were up to weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pipe down, lawyer. I\u2019ve got this under control.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei puts her hands on her hips and stares angrily at Dallas. \u201cWho the hell do you think you are? You don\u2019t even work here.\u201d</p><p>Dallas crosses his arms over his chest and stares her down. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to get you out of this mess. Don\u2019t you have a case to try or something? Go away.\u201d</p> <p>Lorelei huffs indignantly, and if she wasn\u2019t such a lady, I\u2019m sure a whole bunch of profanities would be flying from her mouth right now. For some reason, Lorelei and Dallas have never gotten along. He thinks she\u2019s too uptight, and she thinks he\u2019s a Neanderthal.</p><p>\u201cYou are a pompous jerk!\u201d Lorelei shouts.</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s the best you can do? Are all your clients on death row now?\u201d Dallas taunts.</p><p>\u201cCan we please get back to the problem at hand?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cWhat are we going to do about Andy?\u201d</p><p>Dallas looks at Lorelei smugly one last time before turning his focus to me. \u201cWe wait for Andy to call back with the drop-off location. In the meantime, you need to figure out a way to get a hundred thousand dollars by the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Lorelei says. \u201cWe need to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, I\u2019ve already talked to the police, so don\u2019t get your panties all in a bunch,\u201d Dallas replies with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did NOT just call me \u2018woman\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the fight in front of me, I turn to look at Matt and see the worry written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the hundred grand,\u201d Matt tells me.</p><p>I shake my head at him and put my foot down. \u201cYou are not going to help me with this. He\u2019s my ex and I\u2019ll deal with it. I\u2019m not some poor, defenseless female who constantly needs rescuing, contrary to my actions last night.\u201d</p><p>Matt puts his hands on either side of my face and forces me to look up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t lump me into the same category as Andy. I have never treated you like you were defenseless or weak. You are one of the strongest women I\u2019ve ever met. I care about you, Paige. And I\u2019m just worried about you. I don\u2019t want anything happening to you.\u201d</p><p>Bringing my hands up to rest on top of his against my cheeks, I sigh and smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a private investigator, Matt. I may not have a lot of experience in the field, but this is what I do. If I want people to take me seriously as a PI, then I need to be able to handle my personal life on my own. I am not going to let you bail my ex-husband out of the mess he got himself into. It\u2019s not your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem either, Paige,\u201d he tells me softly.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to take care of it anyway, on my own.\u201d</p><p>More shouting interrupts our moment.</p><p>\u201cStop being such an egotistical brute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not an uptight bitch!\u201d Dallas yells back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou two need to just have sex already,\u201d I mutter with a shake of my head.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this again. I swore I was done with this business when I left Andy, and yet, here I am, sitting in a chair getting poked and prodded with curling irons, mascara wands, and tubes of lipstick. Five minutes back in this business and I already feel only good for one thing.</p><p>My agent, Penny, comes bustling up to me with a huge grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cDarling, it\u2019s so good to see you back doing what you do best. Didn\u2019t I tell you that police-officer thing was silly?\u201d</p><p>Moving away from the makeup artist with a brush aimed at my eye, I turn to look at Penny. \u201cI\u2019m not working as a police officer. I told you, it\u2019s a private investigation business.\u201d</p><p>Penny laughs and checks her reflection in the mirror in front of me, fluffing up her hair and wiping a smudge of lipstick off of her teeth.</p><p>\u201cSame thing. Stick with what you\u2019re good at, darling. You\u2019ll only have your looks for so long.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with her reflection, Penny pats me on the shoulder and walks away to shout orders at the photographer and his assistants.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a few minutes, please?\u201d I ask the makeup artist, whose name I didn\u2019t get.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished. Just don\u2019t get your face wet or go outside. It\u2019s windy, and it will take me forever to get those curls just right again.\u201d</p><p>She walks away quickly in a huff. It\u2019s always the same thing at these photo shoots. Everyone treats me like I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Please don\u2019t say it,\u201d I warn Matt as he comes up behind me and stares at my reflection.</p><p>I really don\u2019t need to hear him tell me how beautiful and amazing I look. It\u2019s not really me. It\u2019s just makeup and hairspray. And besides, they\u2019re going to Photoshop the heck out of me anyway.</p><p>But this is who I used to be and he needs to get a glimpse of that.</p><p>Even though I said I was going to do this on my own, I wanted Matt to be here with me. If he\u2019s going to trust me, he needs to see all of me\u2014the good, the bad, and the modeling. In the midst of all the craziness going on with his life\u2014meeting with lawyers and talking to his board of directors to get all of their ducks in a row before they have to go to court against Melanie\u2014he took the time out of his busy schedule to show up for this shoot. If I didn\u2019t know it already, this would just solidify the fact that I\u2019m falling hard for him.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you that you look like the Bride of Frankenstein with all that crap on your face. I think a few pictures of you just wearing one of my T-shirts would be much better.\u201d</p><p>I feel tears well up in my eyes and I blink quickly to keep them contained, but it\u2019s no use. A few slide down my face and I swipe them away before anyone notices I messed up my makeup.</p><p>\u201cOh, great. Now I\u2019m going to have to fix her foundation. Who made her cry?!\u201d I hear the makeup artist shout from somewhere behind us but I don\u2019t care. Matt just said the most wonderful words to me ever.</p><p>I stare at him through the mirror while my foundation is re-applied. He walks up closer and rests his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should know better than to insult a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and shake my head at him. \u201cBelieve me, that wasn\u2019t an insult. That was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The makeup artist touches up my face, shooting Matt dirty looks the entire time.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is what your life was like for so many years. People dressing you and fussing over you. Did you see the craft service table over there? There\u2019s lobster on it, Paige. Lobster,\u201d he stresses with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s hard to believe I gave all of this up for the glamorous life of catching bad guys. I\u2019m lucky if Kennedy brings in bagels once a month.\u201d</p><p>When the makeup artist is satisfied with her touch-up, she walks away and leaves us alone again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked me to come. Even though the food table is a thing of beauty, I think I understand. This isn\u2019t you, Paige,\u201d he tells me, gesturing at all the people rushing around setting things up for the shoot. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just sit in front of a camera and not have a say in what happens. You\u2019re smart and you\u2019re strong and you should be doing something that makes you happy. Watching you take charge and do what you were trained to do at Fool Me Once\u2014that\u2019s you. That\u2019s who you were meant to be.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s amazing that this man who has only known me for a handful of weeks gets it. He can see the mold I\u2019ve been trying to break out of.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Matt. You have no idea how much that means to me. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d I tell him softly.</p><p>Matt looks at me sheepishly. \u201cYou might want to take that back when you see who I brought with me. The board meeting ran a little late today, and my dad\u2019s car is in the shop, so I had to give him a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too hard to get a chair in this godforsaken place? I got bad hips.\u201d</p><p>Looking over Matt\u2019s shoulder, I see the man who was in the photograph with Matt at his house. Except he\u2019s not smiling and looks a little irritated as he walks up to us.</p><p>\u201cMatthew, that man over there has an earring in his nose. Is he a gay?\u201d</p><p>Matt closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cDad, I told you to stay in the car.\u201d</p><p>His father grunts and walks over to my chair in front of the mirror, taking a seat and crossing his arms in front of him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out that fancy radio of yours.\u201d</p><p>Matt walks to my side and puts his arm around my waist. \u201cDad, this is Paige McCarty. Paige, this is my father, Eric Russo.\u201d</p><p>I reach my hand out to him with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Russo.\u201d</p><p>He just stares at me and after a few seconds, I drop my hand back to my side.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be taking your clothes off for these pictures, young lady?\u201d Mr. Russo asks.</p><p>\u201cDAD!\u201d Matt scolds.</p><p>A laugh bubbles out of me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Matt. No, Mr. Russo, I will not be taking my clothes off for this photo shoot. This is for a well-known magazine, so clothing is required.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Russo narrows his eyes at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I came in here. I see a lot of charlatans in this room who could lead you astray. Like that woman over there with the blue hair and pink skirt.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and see that he\u2019s staring right at the photographer for this shoot.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s a man. His name is Simon Viper, and he\u2019s one of the best photographers in the world,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Mr. Russo\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cThis world is going to hell in a handbasket. Matt, get me some ginger ale. I\u2019m feeling parched.\u201d</p><p>Matt sighs and gives me an apologetic look as the photographer\u2019s assistant signals to me that it\u2019s time to start the shoot. I kiss Matt on the cheek and hear Mr. Russo mumble as I walk away.</p><p>\u201cIf she takes her clothes off, you better cover your eyes, Matthew.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just laugh, unable to believe there is someone else in this world who reminds me so much of my mother. The two of them should meet and share notes about what a sinner I am.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>For the first time in a long while during a photo shoot, I actually enjoyed myself. Anytime I felt a twinge of irritation, all I had to do was look over at Matt. The shouts and orders telling me which way to turn my head and how to hold my arms faded before the warmth in his smile.</p><p>When the final shot was taken and the photographer announced it was a wrap, I walked away from the bright lights and the fans strategically placed to blow my hair, and slid right into Matt\u2019s waiting arms.</p> <p>\u201cYou did amazing. I saw some of the pictures as they showed up on the computer and they were beautiful.\u201d</p><p>What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, I would finish a photo shoot and Andy would tell me all the ways I could have done better. He would walk me over to the computer that showed all of the digital images and point out the ones where my face didn\u2019t hit the light correctly or I wasn\u2019t using my angles in the best way.</p><p>\u201cGreat job today, Paige,\u201d Simon says as he walks up to us, handing his camera off to an assistant. \u201cWe\u2019ll send the proofs to Penny within a week so you can see them first before they go to print. We got some great shots to work with.\u201d</p><p>With my arms still around Matt, I thank Simon as he\u2019s hustled away by an army of assistants and Penny comes over to us.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you were amazing. The magazine gave me your advance: fifty percent of the total offer; you\u2019ll get the rest when the photos go to print. I\u2019ll deposit it today for you.\u201d</p> <p>She pulls the check for seventy-five thousand dollars out of her purse and I quickly snatch it from her hand. It\u2019s not the entire amount DeMarco is asking for, but it will have to do. \u201cNo need to go to all that trouble. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Penny gives me a strange look and I don\u2019t blame her. I\u2019ve never taken care of anything in my career. Andy made sure I had people who did that for me. But I\u2019m pretty sure whoever has Andy isn\u2019t going to want to wait for this check to clear before they get their money.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch more jobs lined up for you, so make sure to keep your schedule open. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back,\u201d Penny tells me.</p><p>\u201cPenny, I\u2019m not back. This was a onetime thing. I have another job now.\u201d</p><p>Seriously, how many times do we have to go over this?</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, you were blessed with a gorgeous face and an equally stunning body. Let\u2019s not fool ourselves into believing you\u2019ll be successful at anything else. I would hate to see you sad when it all comes crashing down. This is what you are meant to do.\u201d</p> <p>I feel the familiar ache of despair in the pit of my stomach at her words. This woman, who has been by my side for more than ten years, thinks I\u2019m only good for one thing. Before I can tell her where she can shove her opinions, Matt takes a step forward.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be in your best interest to stop talking and walk away,\u201d Matt tells Penny with a scowl on his face.</p><p>Penny looks up at him in shock. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what you\u2019re doing is being a bitch. This woman right here is amazing, and she can do whatever she puts her mind to. The last person who put her down like that received a punch to the face, so you might want to quit while you\u2019re ahead.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the smile from spreading across my face. Penny quietly apologizes to me and scurries away without another word.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be flattered or horrified that you would punch a woman for me.\u201d</p><p>Matt shrugs. \u201cI would never hit a woman. But it was fun making her think that I would. I know you can take care of yourself, and you probably would have done a better job telling that woman off, but I couldn\u2019t let her talk to you like that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, nothing else matters right now but getting this man naked. Immediately.</p> <p>Grabbing his hand, I pull him out of the studio and down the hall. \u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked one of the assistants to pray with him. When she told him she didn\u2019t believe in God, he threw his ginger ale at her. I sent him back out to the truck with firm instructions not to leave unless it caught on fire.\u201d</p><p>Pulling open the first door I come to, I flip the switch right inside and see that it\u2019s a supply closet filled with camera equipment. Glancing around to make sure no one sees us, I pull Matt inside and close the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing in here?\u201d Matt asks.</p><p>His eyes go wide as I pull the zipper down on the side of my dress and let it fall from my shoulders. I\u2019m standing in front of him in nothing but a black lace thong and four-inch black stilettos.</p><p>\u201cTake your pants off,\u201d I order him.</p><p>Matt doesn\u2019t waste a second. His pants are pulled down in record time, and as he struggles to get his shoes off with his pants wrapped around his ankles, I reach my thumbs into my thong and slide them down my legs.</p><p>When I start to pull one of my shoes off, Matt\u2019s hand comes out and grabs my wrist. \u201cNope. The shoes stay on. Those shoes are fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>Is this guy for real? He likes me better without makeup and he loves shoes? Am I dreaming?</p><p>Before I can tell him how awesome I think he is, his hands are on my ass and he\u2019s lifting me up, pushing my back against a shelf. My legs automatically wrap around his waist.</p><p>He attacks me with his mouth while his hands are everywhere, touching me, stroking me, and making me burn with need for him. My arms move above my head to grasp onto the shelf while one of his hands slides between my legs. Two of his fingers slide through me achingly slow, circling my clit before plunging inside of me. My hips thrust forward to pull him in deeper; his tongue pushes into my mouth, matching the rhythm of his fingers moving in and out of me, and it\u2019s all I can do to hold on to the shelf when I feel my orgasm quickly approaching.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Paige. I love the way you feel,\u201d Matt whispers against my mouth.</p><p>My hips move faster while his fingers pump harder, his thumb circling me and driving me wild. I squeeze my thighs tighter around his hips as I tumble over the edge, my release exploding around his fingers with his name on my lips.</p><p>\u201cMatt, Matt, oh, God!\u201d</p><p>My orgasm is still tingling through my sex when his fingers are quickly replaced with his cock. He slides into me hard, our bodies crashing against the shelf and sending photography equipment clattering to the floor. His hips thrust against me roughly, and my body takes everything he has to give. I should feel guilty right now that I\u2019m floating on a cloud of lust and ecstasy when my ex is most likely tied to a chair somewhere crying for his life, but I don\u2019t. Matt makes me forget everything. He makes me feel special and smart and I never want this feeling to end.</p><p>His hands clutch tightly to my hips and he helps me move my body faster and harder against him. The angle I\u2019m in forces my clit to slide against his pubic bone with every single thrust and I already feel another orgasm within reach. This has never happened before, and I\u2019m a little mystified at the way my body reacts to Matt; I can\u2019t get enough of him.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Paige. You feel so good around me,\u201d Matt mumbles, burying his face into the side of my neck, licking and sucking the sensitive skin right below my ear into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop,\u201d I chant.</p><p>I feel myself coming apart around him for a second time as the shelf against my back rattles with our thrusts and a camera falls to the floor, breaking into pieces.</p><p>When he feels me coming, it pushes him over the edge. He drives himself into me two more times before holding himself still, his release spilling inside of me while he shouts my name and clutches my hips tightly against him.</p><p>Our skin is slicked with sweat and we pant against each other, trying to catch our breath. Matt moves his mouth away from my neck, kissing his way up to my lips. He kisses me softly, bringing his hand up to cup my cheek.</p><p>I want to stay in this storage closet and never leave. I know as soon as we walk out that door, real life will come calling and I\u2019ll have to deal with the mess surrounding us. At least for right now, we\u2019re alone and happy and nothing can ruin that.</p><p>\u201cMatthew? Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and our lips pull apart as we stare across the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, is that your dad?\u201d I ask in a panic.</p><p>\u201cYou locked the door, right? Tell me you locked the door?\u201d Matt whispers frantically.</p><p>\u201cMATTHEW! I have to be at my doctor\u2019s appointment in thirty minutes. If I\u2019m late, all the good magazines will be gone from the waiting room,\u201d he shouts from the other side of the door.</p><p>We hear the handle rattle and I know it\u2019s only a matter of seconds before Mr. Russo throws the door open.</p><p>With my arms and legs still clinging to Matt and his penis still inside of me, he quickly shuffles us over to the door and slams his hand against it right as it starts to open.</p><p>\u201cDad! You were supposed to stay in the truck!\u201d Matt yells.</p><p>\u201cThe truck was on fire!\u201d Mr. Russo shouts back.</p><p>\u201cThe truck was not on fire, Dad.\u201d</p><p>We hear Mr. Russo huff. \u201cWell, it could have been.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a few minutes and I assume Mr. Russo finally walked away.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he knows what we were doing in here?\u201d I ask, unwrapping my arms and legs from Matt and sliding down from his body.</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not. He probably thinks this is the bathroom,\u201d Matt assures me.</p><p>Scrambling for our clothes, Matt helps me zip up my dress and I help him button his shirt.</p><p>\u201cShake a tail feather in there, you two. It doesn\u2019t take that long to put your clothes back on,\u201d Mr. Russo shouts. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody got time for this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>On the way to the office after the photo shoot, I received a phone call from an unidentified man. He told me to bring the money to an abandoned building on Lincolnway West by the next afternoon or they would start cutting Andy\u2019s appendages off. I told them to start with his penis before I hung up.</p><p>The anger over what I\u2019m doing for him makes me want to kick something, but since I\u2019m still wearing the black Manolo Blahniks that Matt loves so much, I refrain from doing them any harm and instead pound my hand against the steering wheel.</p><p>I immediately call Dallas and let him know what\u2019s going on while I\u2019m stopped at a red light.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Swing by my office. I\u2019ve got someone here you might want to talk to.\u201d</p><p>The dial tone sounds in my ear before I can reply and I roll my eyes. No wonder Lorelei finds him so annoying.</p><p>I leave a message on Matt\u2019s voice mail so he knows what\u2019s going on. Even though he trusts me to do my job, he still asked me to keep him updated so he wouldn\u2019t worry. Because of me he has yet another thing added to his plate to fret over. I feel bad. He should be worrying about Melanie and not about my pathetic excuse for an ex-husband.</p><p>Parking my car in front of Dallas\u2019s office fifteen minutes later, I hurry into the building and stop in my tracks when I see who is sitting in a chair in the middle of the room filing her nails.</p><p>She looks up at me and scowls.</p><p>\u201cWhat is SHE doing here?\u201d Melanie asks Dallas as he comes out of the back room and hands a cup of coffee to her.</p><p>\u201cDallas, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Why would he have Melanie here? She has nothing to do with Andy. And by the looks of it, she remembers me from the night at the club when I pretended to be a drunk socialite with her and her gaggle of girlfriends.</p><p>\u201cMelanie, this is Paige Mc\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts Dallas off mid-introduction. \u201cI know who she is. She\u2019s the woman fucking my husband and trying to steal my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, what?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re separated. And what the hell would I want with the creepy old guy that you\u2019ve been screwing behind Matt\u2019s back while trying to take his father\u2019s company?\u201d I fire back.</p><p>\u201cYou skanky tramp! How dare you talk to me like that!\u201d Melanie shouts, getting up from her chair and throwing her nail file in Dallas\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously just call me a tramp, you home-wrecking whore?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even realize we advanced on each other until our hands are in the air, smacking at each other like two cats playing patty-cake.</p><p>\u201cLADIES! WHAT THE FUCK?\u201d</p><p>We ignore Dallas\u2019s shout and continue with our slapping match. One of my hands manages to make its way past hers and I grab a chunk of her hair, pulling as hard as I can.</p><p>\u201cLET GO OF MY HAIR, YOU BITCH! THOSE EXTENSIONS WERE EXPENSIVE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTAY AWAY FROM MATT AND HIS FATHER\u2019S COMPANY, YOU SLUT!\u201d</p><p>I pull harder on her hair and she lets out a yelp, taking a chunk of skin out of my arm with her fingernails.</p><p>I scream in pain just as strong arms wrap around my waist and yank me away from Melanie before I can throw any more insults at her, or finish pulling out the chunk of weave I had my fingers around. My arms and legs flail as Dallas moves me across the room and far away from Melanie.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ. Why are chicks so batshit crazy?\u201d Dallas asks in exasperation as he sets me down on my feet.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of here before I kick her ass,\u201d I tell him, shooting an angry look in Melanie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on with you two, but I just found out this morning that the guy Andy owes money to is this chick\u2019s boyfriend. We need her, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, can you repeat that?\u201d</p><p>Dallas raises his eyebrow at me. \u201cWhy do I feel like I just got myself into a whole shitload of trouble by helping you out with this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFirst, tell me something. How do you know for sure that she\u2019s dating the guy Andy owes money to?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cA couple of calls that came through on your phone were from a number you didn\u2019t have programmed in your contact list. I had my guy trace the number and it was hers,\u201d Dallas explains, pointing his thumb over his shoulder in Melanie\u2019s direction. \u201cI stopped by her place this morning to question her, and she sang like a canary.\u201d</p><p>I look over at Melanie and see her pull out a compact from her purse and check her reflection in the small, round mirror. She straightens her hair and adds some powder to her nose before glancing over at us.</p> <p>\u201cCan we hurry this along? I\u2019ve got a yoga class in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Dallas sighs and puts his back to her. \u201cShe told me she and her boyfriend got into a fight because he was talking nonstop about some hot model, and how he kidnapped her husband to try and get money that was owed to him. He was showing a picture of you in a magazine to everyone, bragging about how he was going to nail you. Melanie found your number in Andy\u2019s phone. She was going to tell you to stay away from her man, but her boyfriend snatched the phone away before she could leave a message. It seems little Miss Melanie over there is jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. I am NOT jealous of her. You know what? I changed my mind. I\u2019m not going to help you,\u201d Melanie says. She turns and stalks toward the door.</p><p>Dallas runs up to her and grabs her by the arm, spinning her around. \u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t think so. You see, you\u2019re now an accomplice in kidnapping and extortion. You\u2019re going to help us, or you\u2019re getting a free ride straight to the women\u2019s correctional facility.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s face pales as she stares up at Dallas. \u201cPrison? I can\u2019t go to prison. I\u2019m too pretty for prison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, you\u2019re going to tell me everything you know about your boyfriend and where he\u2019s holding Andy. We\u2019ll see if we can work out a deal after that.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and when Dallas turns to look at me, I jerk my head to get him to come over. He sighs and walks back to me.</p><p>\u201cUm, you don\u2019t know who Melanie\u2019s boyfriend is?\u201d</p><p>Dallas shakes his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that far with her yet. I wanted to wait until you got here to grill her more.\u201d</p><p>Biting my lip, I look up at him sheepishly. \u201cI know who Melanie\u2019s boyfriend is. Now might be the time to call the police again.\u201d</p><p>Dallas grits his teeth in an effort not to shout at me. I have to commend him. He\u2019s holding it together fairly well considering he just had to break up a catfight.</p> <p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Dallas growls.</p><p>\u201cEver heard of Vinnie DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>Dallas closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me. The biggest crime boss this side of the Mason-Dixon Line? This is information that would have been useful, oh, say, YESTERDAY!\u201d</p><p>With my hands on my hips, I glare at him. \u201cHow was I supposed to know Matt\u2019s case and Andy\u2019s stupid gambling problem would collide like this? You\u2019re a PI too, and last time I checked, you\u2019ve been at it a lot longer than I have. Why the hell didn\u2019t YOU put two and two together, you pompous ass?\u201d</p><p>Dallas stares at me for a few beats before a laugh bursts out of his mouth. \u201cWell played, Paige. Well played. You might be beating Kennedy in the ball-busting department.\u201d</p><p>I lose the attitude, but keep my chin high. \u201cSo, are we going to kick a little Mob ass now or what?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>This is not a good idea. Can you please get your hands off her boobs?\u201d</p> <p>Matt stares angrily at Ted as he finishes up attaching a bug to the front clasp of my bra. Ted quickly puts his hands up in surrender and backs away from me while I button my shirt back up.</p><p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation, but it\u2019s our best option right now,\u201d Ted explains to Matt calmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to catch Vinnie DeMarco for years. The last call that came in stated that Paige was the only one they would allow to bring in the money in exchange for Andy.\u201d</p><p>To say Matt hasn\u2019t been too thrilled about the events that unfolded in Dallas\u2019s office the other day is putting it mildly. Not only was he pissed that Melanie\u2019s Mob-boss boyfriend is the one who kidnapped Andy, he was also really mad he wasn\u2019t there to see me attempt to pull her hair out by the roots. He kissed the scratch she left on my arm and told me next time I should stomp on her foot with my Guccis. And he even knew they were Guccis. If I didn\u2019t think so before, I\u2019m now certain he\u2019s a keeper.</p><p>Matt places his hands on either side of my face and stares directly into my eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I reach my hands up and place them over the top of his. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. The place will be surrounded by cops. I\u2019m just going to walk in, hand over the money, grab Andy, and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have her out of our sight for one minute, Matt. I promise,\u201d Ted assures him.</p><p>The door to Fool Me Once flies open and I cringe as Kennedy comes running inside, storming right over to me with a pissed-off look on her face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m more afraid of right now\u2014walking into a den of mobsters or dealing with Kennedy\u2019s wrath.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Paige. I had to call her,\u201d Ted apologizes.</p><p>\u201cWhat. The. Fuck?\u201d Kennedy stutters as she stands in front of me with her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cIs now a bad time to ask you if I can get a promotion?\u201d</p><p>Right when I think Kennedy is going to punch me in the face, she wraps her arms around me and pulls me against her.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted more work, all you had to do was ask. You didn\u2019t need to go hunt down a fucking mobster,\u201d she whispers against my hair.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to see I could do something other than sit there and look pretty,\u201d I admit.</p><p>My friends know the whole story about the way Andy used to parade me around. I\u2019ve never really admitted to them how deep it hurt me, though. Until now.</p><p>Kennedy lets go of me and pulls back to stare at my face. \u201cIs that seriously what you think? Paige, I trust you. I know how smart and courageous you are. I would have never asked you to be part of this business when we met in that self-defense class if I didn\u2019t believe in you. I just wanted you to get your feet wet with easy stuff before I let you kick some real ass. I never once doubted your abilities.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s very rare to hear Kennedy say something so heartfelt. She never wears her emotions on her sleeve. I feel a tear slide down my cheek before I can stop it. I should have trusted my friend to have faith in me.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck. Don\u2019t cry. You know I don\u2019t do crying. It gives me hives. Where the hell is Lorelei?\u201d Kennedy complains, looking around the room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in court, most likely cutting off another set of balls to store in her purse,\u201d Dallas replies sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days, Dallas, she\u2019s going to have your balls in her purse,\u201d Kennedy tells him smugly.</p><p>\u201cWhen pigs fly, dear Kennedy. When pigs fly,\u201d Dallas laughs.</p><p>\u201cCan we please go over the details one more time so I can stop freaking out so much?\u201d Matt asks, interrupting Kennedy and Dallas\u2019s back-and-forth over Lorelei.</p><p>\u201cMelanie is already with Vinnie. He doesn\u2019t usually take her on jobs, but she used her powers of persuasion to convince him to take her this time,\u201d Ted explains.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying she spread her legs. Got it,\u201d Kennedy adds. She turns to Matt and shrugs awkwardly at him. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apology necessary. Why do you think I\u2019m divorcing her?\u201d Matt informs Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ted continues. \u201cPaige will go in with the money and make sure Andy is still alive. Melanie is going to start up an argument with Vinnie about his crush on Paige in an attempt to get him to admit to some of his recent activity so we can get it on tape. Otherwise, with his contacts, he\u2019ll easily find a way around doing less time. He\u2019ll be in and out of jail in no time, and then we\u2019re back to square one. This is going to be our only shot to put this guy in prison for the rest of his life and we\u2019re going to take it. As soon as we get something concrete on tape, we\u2019ll come in and arrest Vinnie and get everyone out safely.\u201d</p><p>The room is silent for a few minutes after Ted finishes his explanation.</p><p>\u201cSee? Piece of cake,\u201d I tell Matt, trying to keep the nerves out of my voice so he doesn\u2019t worry any more than he already is.</p><p>\u201cSo how do we know Melanie is actually going to do what she promised? She isn\u2019t exactly the most honest person,\u201d Kennedy asks.</p><p>\u201cLast night, I took her on a trip to the women\u2019s correctional facility. We had a little tour. She was still crying when I dropped her off at home an hour later, mumbling about bitches with the most packs of smokes and how she doesn\u2019t want a prison tat,\u201d Ted tells her with a smile. \u201cI may or may not have told her that as soon as she walks in the door, she\u2019ll be considered fresh meat and the words \u2018she\u2019s my bitch\u2019 will be tattooed on her ass.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy pats Ted on the back and looks at him with respect. \u201cI knew there was a reason why I liked having you as a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we be sure that Paige isn\u2019t going to be in any danger? I mean, this is the Mob we\u2019re talking about. What if they know she\u2019s been in contact with the police and this whole thing is a setup?\u201d Matt asks worriedly as he wraps his arms around me from behind, resting his chin on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always that risk, Matt. I\u2019m not going to lie. But we have a couple of informants on the inside who swear there hasn\u2019t been any talk about this drop being a setup. They all just assume Paige is a ditsy model coming to bail out her ex,\u201d Ted explains.</p><p>\u201cDammit, now I\u2019m jealous. Paige gets to go in there, act all stupid and giggly, and help take down one of the biggest crime rings in the state, and I have to go back and finish delivering a boring subpoena,\u201d Kennedy says.</p><p>\u201cWanna trade places? I can do your makeup and hair and put you in something really cute. We can practice your giggles,\u201d I tell her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, Paige is a much better choice for this job. Good luck.\u201d Kennedy gives me a thumbs-up and takes a seat at her desk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too sad. We can celebrate by getting our hair highlighted next week. I got us a new stylist.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy scowls at me and I can\u2019t help but laugh. Laughing feels better than curling up in the fetal position in the corner, rocking back and forth in fear. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been trained for this. Kennedy made Lorelei and me take a private investigator course online so we could get our PI license. But studying and taking tests online is a little easier than walking into a situation I might not be prepared for. I\u2019m pretty sure the course never covered the topic of \u201cTaking Down a Crime Ring without Dying.\u201d If all else fails, though, at least Kennedy made sure these last few months that my self-defense skills are top-notch.</p><p>\u201cPaige, can you say a few things so I can test the sound level of your mic?\u201d Ted asks as he walks over to Kennedy\u2019s desk and types a few things into the laptop he placed there earlier.</p><p>\u201cI can take down a crime ring without dying.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s shoulders slump and he hangs his head. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t making me feel better right now.\u201d</p><p>I give him a sympathetic smile and I\u2019m overcome with the urge to tell him I love him. I don\u2019t know where that thought comes from, but it\u2019s right there, front and center and on the tip of my tongue. It\u2019s crazy, though. I mean, I just met him. Do I really love him, or am I just scared to death that I\u2019m not going to come out of this alive?</p><p>While Kennedy, Ted, and Dallas are busy fiddling with the sound levels with the microphone app on the computer, I take the time to stare at Matt\u2019s profile. He really looks nervous and scared. Nervous and scared for me. He keeps running his hand through his hair and sighing. Even though we haven\u2019t known each other that long, I know it\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s trying to keep it together.</p><p>Matt turns his head and catches me looking at him. He comes over to me and pulls me up against him. I breathe in his fresh, clean scent and let the warmth of his body calm me.</p><p>\u201cPromise me that you\u2019ll be careful. I need you to come back to me, Paige,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>Shame on me for thinking it was crazy to be already in love with this man.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>It\u2019s okay, Giovanni, you can let her in.\u201d</p><p>The goon by the front door of an abandoned church steps aside when he receives his orders from across the room. He doesn\u2019t put his gun away as I walk through the doors.</p><p>The church looks like it hasn\u2019t been closed for very long; I can still smell incense from Sunday morning church services. It must have soaked into the walls. There are pews scattered throughout the huge, vaulted-ceilinged room, but some have been ripped up from the floorboards and moved around so there\u2019s more of a wide-open space. There\u2019s a large statue of the Virgin Mary staring down at me right next to the door. Even though my mother is the religious one in the family, I still say a quick prayer to her that I make it out of this alive. Hopefully she\u2019s forgiving of the fact that I am not a regular churchgoer. Or a virgin.</p><p>I swallow nervously when I see Vinnie DeMarco lounging in a pew across the room, his big, beefy arms resting on the back. I only got a quick glimpse of him the night Matt and I saw him with Melanie at Blake\u2019s Seafood Restaurant, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of pictures. He reminds me of Tony Soprano: receding hairline and a belly that sticks out of his three-piece suit, proving that he has a weakness for pasta and a dislike of anything involving exercise. The butterflies in my stomach calm down when I think about all of the episodes when Tony doted on his kids and kindly gave money to the hookers he screwed. But then I start thinking about the hookers he killed and the butterflies are back in full force, trying to claw their way out of my stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome closer. I won\u2019t bite,\u201d Vinnie tells me with a smirk.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I make my way to him, my heels clicking on the hardwood floor, the sound echoing around the room. When I get right up in front of Vinnie, he removes his arms from the back of the pew and folds them in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI must say, you are more stunning in person than you are in magazines, Paige McCarty.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of my name on his lips gives me chills. He practically purrs and it makes me want to vomit.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>His sudden command catches me off guard and my eyes go wide. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Vinnie gets up from the pew; his large body makes the wood creak loudly.</p><p>\u201cForgive me if that seemed a little forward. Sometimes I forget my manners. Would you please remove your shirt?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve quickly gone from nervous and scared to pissed off. Who the hell does he think he is?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you.\u201d</p><p>Vinnie throws back his head and laughs at my statement. \u201cAs appealing as that sounds, this isn\u2019t about sex. I need to make sure you aren\u2019t wearing a wire.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, my not-so-bright idea in the car ride over of removing the wire doesn\u2019t seem so stupid anymore. Even though Ted assured me that Vinnie probably wouldn\u2019t check me for a wire, I didn\u2019t want to take that chance. As soon as I pulled into the parking lot, I whispered a quick \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d into the mic before ripping it out of my bra and tossing it onto the front seat.</p><p>\u201cGiovanni, I think our guest needs a little encouragement.\u201d</p><p>Giovanni is next to me in an instant with the barrel of his gun pressing into the side of my head.</p> <p>\u201cYep, I think that should do it,\u201d I mutter. My hands nervously reach up and begin undoing the first few buttons of my shirt.</p><p>Vinnie steps closer and raises his eyebrows. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t immediately reply, Giovanni pushes the gun harder against my temple.</p><p>Trying not to wince, I smile. \u201cOh, by all means.\u201d</p><p>Vinnie grabs onto the seam of my shirt and with a flick of his wrists, rips it the rest of the way open, buttons scattering across the floor as he stares lecherously at me.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he can feel my heart beating out of my chest as he runs his sweaty palms over my skin and his fingers trace the edge of my bra.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s clean,\u201d Vinnie says to Giovanni.</p><p>He finally lowers the gun from my head and I can breathe again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?! Stop touching her!\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s screech from behind me makes me jerk in surprise. Even though I can\u2019t stand her, I\u2019m relieved at her timing.</p><p>Vinnie sighs and drops his hands from me. \u201cKitten, I thought I told you to stay in the back with our friend.\u201d</p><p>Melanie stalks over to us, shooting an angry glare in my direction. I really hope this is her being a good actress, and she hasn\u2019t changed her mind about helping us. If Vinnie wasn\u2019t still standing so close to me, I\u2019d whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t drop the soap,\u201d just to remind her.</p><p>\u201cI got bored back there, baby. And that guy won\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>That must be Andy she\u2019s talking about. At least I know he\u2019s still alive.</p><p>Melanie sidles up to Vinnie and wraps her arms around his abundant waist.</p><p>\u201cI still have a little more business to attend to out here. Go in the back and make sure our friend is comfortable,\u201d Vinnie tells her, never taking his eyes off of me.</p><p>Melanie looks back and forth between us, and I can see her anger start to escalate.</p><p>\u201cYou just want me out of the way so you can make your move on her. You think she\u2019s prettier than me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Melanie complains.</p><p>She moves away from Vinnie and crosses her arms in front of her in a huff. Vinnie sighs and finally turns away from me. I take that opportunity to pull my shirt back together to cover myself as best I can now that the buttons are all gone.</p><p>\u201cKitten, you\u2019re being silly. Go in the back like a good girl and I\u2019ll take you shopping later.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s eyes light up at the mention of shopping and now I\u2019m convinced she\u2019s forgotten all about our agreement. She\u2019s going to screw me for a new Coach purse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you alone with her. I don\u2019t trust her. She\u2019s going to be all over you as soon as I leave.\u201d</p><p>Ugh, as if.</p><p>\u201cYou are trying my patience, Kitten. Get your ass in the back, NOW.\u201d</p><p>Gone is the guy with the polite act, and in his place is the Mob boss. His jaw clenches as he glares at Melanie, and I watch him squeeze his hands into fists by his side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do what you say! You\u2019re not the boss of me!\u201d Melanie shouts.</p><p>Awww, shit. Not a wise move there, Melanie.</p><p>Vinnie quickly advances on her and his meaty hand is around her neck in an instant. She lets out a whimper of fear as he drags her face closer to his.</p><p>\u201cI kept you around because you give the best head out of all the women I\u2019ve had, but now that mouth is going to get you in trouble,\u201d Vinnie threatens quietly. \u201cGiovanni, get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>Vinnie shoves Melanie away and she stumbles, falling to the ground. She tries to scramble away from Giovanni, but he quickly reaches down and yanks her up by her hair.</p><p>\u201cNO! Don\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t kill me! If you kill me, the police will be all over your ass!\u201d Melanie screams as Giovanni starts to drag her away.</p><p>Vinnie immediately goes from slightly mad to all-out pissed off. His lip curls up menacingly and his face turns beet red.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Vinnie demands as Giovanni clenches Melanie\u2019s hair tighter and she lets out a yelp of pain.</p><p>\u201cI overheard all of your conversations when you thought I was sleeping. I took notes. I made lists of all the people\u2019s names that you admitted to killing when they didn\u2019t give you the money you owed them,\u201d Melanie rambles. \u201cIf you kill me, those notes go immediately to the police, and you will be ruined!\u201d</p><p>I can tell Vinnie doesn\u2019t believe her. His anger slowly disappears and he smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing. Giovanni, I think two bullets to the head will suffice.\u201d</p><p>Giovanni starts to drag Melanie away again, but she starts screaming.</p><p>\u201cBRIAN CRANDALL, KEVIN BROSKY, ERIC RITCHIE, DAVE KEENER, FRANK ROBERTS!\u201d</p><p>Giovanni halts and stares nervously at Vinnie. \u201cWhat the hell, boss?\u201d</p><p>Vinnie laughs and shakes his head at Melanie. \u201cA few notes on a piece of paper from a whore won\u2019t stand up in a court of law. Nice try, Kitten. You have no solid proof that I had those men executed for outstanding IOUs.\u201d</p><p>If I was smart, I would turn and run out of here right now as fast as I can. Screw Andy.</p><p>\u201cYou just gave us all the proof we need. Tell him, Paige.\u201d Melanie nods her head in my direction with a confident smile.</p><p>Yep, should have run.</p><p>Vinnie whips his head around to me, and he\u2019s no longer staring at me like he wants to bang me. This look is all about murder.</p><p>Dammit, Melanie!</p><p>I should have told Matt how I felt about him when we said good-bye. I wish I had called my mother and told her that I love her even though she\u2019s a pain in my ass. Before I have time to react, Vinnie\u2019s fist shoots out and connects with my cheek. The force of the blow sends me to the ground and I land hard on my elbow. Pain shoots up my arm and my cheek throbs like it\u2019s on fire.</p><p>The sound of a gun discharging echoes through the church and I flinch from the noise.</p><p>\u201cYou touch my daughter one more time and I will blow out your kneecaps, you good-for-nothing!\u201d</p><p>It looks like the Virgin Mary really is answering my prayers. Too bad seeing my mom again wasn\u2019t the best one for her to start with.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Looking up from my spot on the ground, I see my mother dressed in her Sunday best, her giant revolver held steady in her hand as she points it right at Vinnie after her warning shot into the ceiling.</p><p>Oh, my God, this is not happening right now.</p><p>\u201cMOM! What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>My warning falls on deaf ears as she confidently walks farther into the church, her gun held high.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got it all under control,\u201d she tells me with a calm smile.</p><p>I glance over at Giovanni. He\u2019s frantically moving his gun back and forth between me and my mother, not sure what the hell is going on.</p><p>Join the club.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?! You can\u2019t take out a Mob boss by yourself!\u201d</p><p>Vinnie laughs and slides his hands in the pockets of his suit and walks toward my mother. I push myself off of the ground quickly and try to stop him.</p><p>\u201cPlease. She doesn\u2019t know any better. Leave my mother alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Paige. I think it\u2019s sweet your mother came here to try and save the day. How are you doing today, Mrs. McCarty?\u201d Vinnie asks her with a pleasant smile.</p><p>My mother raises her eyebrow at Vinnie and lowers the gun so it\u2019s aimed between his legs. \u201cIt\u2019s MISS McCarty, you old coot.\u201d</p><p>A shot rings out and the sound is deafening in the large, empty church. Vinnie lets out an uncharacteristically high-pitched scream, clutches his thigh, and drops to the ground.</p><p>I stare in shock at Vinnie sobbing and writhing in pain on the floor, blood pouring out between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. You shot him,\u201d I whisper in awe.</p><p>My mother blows imaginary smoke from the end of the gun barrel like they did in Wild West shows. \u201cI was aiming for his manhood, though. I\u2019m gonna need some more practice at the shooting range.\u201d</p><p>Our attention moves away from Vinnie bleeding out on the floor to a commotion on the other side of the room. I forgot about Melanie and Giovanni. He must have lost his concentration when his boss got shot, and Melanie was able to get in a good punch to his face. His lip is bleeding and he\u2019s cursing and shouting at Melanie as she kicks him repeatedly in the shins, her hands wrapped around his arm, struggling to keep his gun aimed at the ceiling.</p><p>I don\u2019t like her, but I can\u2019t just stand here and do nothing. I\u2019m a private investigator, dammit!</p><p>Racing over to Melanie\u2019s side, I jump on Giovanni\u2019s back like a spider monkey. I grab onto chunks of his hair with both hands and pull as hard as I can. Giovanni immediately lets go of Melanie and instead of thanking me for helping her out, she turns and runs screaming out of the church.</p><p>Giovanni\u2019s elbow connects with my ribs. The pain forces me to let go of his hair. His elbow jerks back again and hits the same spot, shoving me off of him roughly, and I fall to the ground and land right on my tailbone. The breath is knocked from my lungs, and Giovanni uses my momentary pause to catch my breath to pull his foot back and kick me right in the stomach.</p><p>I\u2019m doubled over in pain when I hear a loud, banshee-like shout from behind him. I look up just in time to see my mother\u2019s two friends Fran and Eunice hobble up to Giovanni and start beating the shit out of him with their purses.</p><p>\u201cYOU SCOUNDREL! HOW DARE YOU HURT PAIGE!\u201d Eunice shouts angrily as her black leather purse connects with Giovanni\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE THE ONE WHO STOLE THE COMMUNION HOSTS FROM SAINT MICHAEL\u2019S!\u201d Fran adds, hitting Giovanni in the stomach with her cane.</p><p>Getting up from the floor, I watch in awe as Giovanni cowers from their purse-and-cane assault with his hands over his head.</p><p>\u201cSTOP HITTING ME! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!\u201d Giovanni screams. His shouts are cut off when Eunice\u2019s purse smacks him right in the mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear at me, young man!\u201d Fran bops him on the head with her cane.</p><p>The front doors to the church burst open then, and twenty men in uniform, with Ted leading the way, charge into the room with their guns aimed.</p><p>\u201cGUNS DOWN! HANDS IN THE AIR!\u201d</p><p>I automatically put my hands up so they don\u2019t shoot me by accident, but Fran and Eunice don\u2019t stop; they\u2019re too busy teaching Giovanni a lesson, connecting with every single body part of his they can reach.</p><p>The men surround the circle of angry-old-lady chaos, not quite sure where to aim their weapons. Giovanni quickly tosses his gun away and it slides across the floor.</p><p>\u201cI surrender! I surrender! Just get these crazy bitches away from me!\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth needs to be washed out with soap, young man!\u201d Fran informs him as she swings her purse around and it smacks into his eye.</p><p>\u201cLadies! Please put the purses down!\u201d Ted orders.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to put my gun down too? I\u2019m holding a criminal in place over here,\u201d my mother shouts from Vinnie\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Ted mutters. \u201cMrs. McCarty, please put your weapon on the ground.\u201d</p><p>My mother raises her eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her that. She just shot the last guy who called her \u2018Mrs. McCarty,\u2019\u201d I warn him.</p><p>My mother gives Vinnie one last dirty look before putting her gun into her purse and walking over to us. Several officers surround Vinnie, slapping cuffs on him, while one calls in an ambulance on his shoulder radio.</p><p>The cops finally get a handle on Eunice and Fran and convince them that they can take it from here. The women stop swinging their purses and take a step back, straightening their short, gray permed hair and fixing their clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt took you boys long enough to get here. I called 911 an hour ago and told them we found out who was stealing the communion hosts from Saint Michael\u2019s,\u201d my mother complains to Ted.</p><p>\u201cMom, what in the world would possess you to come in here with your friends in the middle of a sting?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s lost her mind. \u201cPaige. They stole Communion. The body of Christ. We just couldn\u2019t let something like that go, so we took matters into our own hands when the police didn\u2019t show after thirty minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shoots a dirty look in Ted\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, ma\u2019am. We sort of had our hands full trying to take down a crime ring and didn\u2019t realize the Golden Girls were going to swoop in and save the day for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, the Golden Girls. I like it. I\u2019m Dorothy,\u201d Fran pipes up with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be Dorothy. You\u2019re not tall enough,\u201d my mom informs her indignantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I\u2019ve got curvature of the spine!\u201d Fran argues.</p><p>One of the cops who are guarding Vinnie walks up to Ted. \u201cSir, the ambulance is two minutes out. We\u2019ve got the bleeding stopped and Mr. DeMarco says he\u2019ll do whatever we ask as long as we keep the old lady with the gun away from him.\u201d</p><p>My mother smirks at Ted. \u201cWe might be old ladies, but we get the job done.\u201d</p><p>Ted laughs and shakes his head at her. Giovanni is cuffed and dragged out of the building, complaining the whole way about old ladies who carry bricks in their purses, and how he\u2019s going to sue the department for using excessive force. The ambulance arrives moments later and Vinnie is strapped to a gurney and wheeled outside.</p> <p>My mother and her friends are taken away to go down to the police station to answer questions, and when it\u2019s finally quiet, Ted turns to me.</p><p>\u201cCare to enlighten me on why you whispered an apology into the mic and we never heard anything that happened in here?\u201d</p><p>Before I can inform him that taking off that mic most likely saved my life, I hear my name shouted, and I turn to see Matt running toward me. I turn just as he gets to me, scooping me up into his arms and crushing me to him.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ. Thank God. Kennedy wouldn\u2019t let me anywhere near this place, and when she got a phone call that shots were fired, I thought I was going to lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>Matt pulls me away from him and runs his hands over my head, my face, my arms, and every part of me he can reach, checking for injuries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay,\u201d I reassure him as his fingers lightly skim the bruise that I\u2019m sure is now forming on my cheek from Vinnie\u2019s punch.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is that asshole? I\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Matt says.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My mother already got a head start. She shot him in the leg.\u201d</p><p>Matt glances over at Ted in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Paige\u2019s mom and her friends snuck in the back and took care of business, angry-old-lady style: with a couple of handbags and a revolver,\u201d Ted tells him.</p><p>\u201cWow. Now I\u2019m kind of regretting not bringing my dad with me. He\u2019s got a cane that he\u2019s not afraid to use,\u201d Matt adds.</p><p>\u201cPaige, I\u2019ll give you guys a few minutes. Meet me down at the station as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>Ted pats me on the back and then walks out of the church.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, Matt pulls me back up against him and runs the palm of his hand down the back of my head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if anything happened to you today. I know we haven\u2019t known each other very long and you\u2019re probably going to think I\u2019m saying this because of the fear of losing you, but I swear I\u2019m not. I wanted to tell you a few days ago but I chickened out.\u201d</p><p>My heart thumps wildly in my chest. I pull back and stare up into Matt\u2019s face, bringing my hand up to cover his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I want to say it too, but not while I\u2019m a complete mess with Vinnie DeMarco\u2019s blood on my pants,\u201d I tell him with a smile.</p><p>Matt brings his hand up and brushes my hair off of my cheek. \u201cPaige McCarty, you would still be beautiful to me even if you had blood on my favorite pair of black Guccis.\u201d</p><p>Standing up on my tiptoes with a smile on my face, I wrap my arms around Matt\u2019s neck and bring his head down to mine.</p><p>\u201cShame on me for ever thinking you were anything like my ex.\u201d</p><p>Right before our lips touch, Matt suddenly pulls back and stares down at me. \u201cSpeaking of Andy. Where the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>Just then, we hear a door slam open behind us. We turn to see Andy, tied to a chair, hopping and sliding his way across the floor toward us.</p><p>\u201cHello?! A little help here!\u201d Andy shouts as he looks back and forth between us.</p><p>Matt tightens his hold on me and shakes his head while we stare at him struggling.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to help me, Paige! I\u2019ve been tied to a chair fearing for my life and you\u2019re out here snuggling. I had to kick that door open all by myself and I\u2019m pretty sure I just broke my toe. You don\u2019t even care that I almost died!\u201d Andy complains as he continues to jump the chair closer to us, inch by inch.</p><p>Matt leans down and kisses me on the top of my head. He grabs my hand and we walk toward Andy.</p><p>\u201cWould it be wrong for me to kick his ass when he\u2019s tied to a chair?\u201d Matt whispers.</p><p>Andy continues to struggle, trying to get out of the bindings, and shoots us another dirty look when we finally get to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, I can\u2019t feel my hands! You guys, I CAN\u2019T FEEL MY HANDS! I can\u2019t live without my hands!\u201d Andy whines.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t kick his ass, I will,\u201d I mutter to Matt as we begin untying Andy.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>All right, Paige, I think we\u2019ve got everything we need. Thanks for coming down to the station. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re ready to get home and relax,\u201d Ted tells me as he turns off the recorder in the conference room. We stand up from the table and head toward the door.</p><p>It\u2019s definitely been a long day. I\u2019m exhausted and dirty and I just want to take a hot shower, preferably with Matt.</p><p>\u201cThanks for trusting me to do this today. Even if I screwed everything up,\u201d I say to Ted as he holds open the door to the interview room so I can go out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cPaige, you didn\u2019t screw anything up,\u201d Ted reassures me as we walk down the hall. \u201cTaking off that wire was genius. From what I\u2019ve been told by Melanie in her interview, you never once lost your calm. You did good, kid.\u201d</p><p>Ted pats me on the back, and when we walk into the waiting area, Kennedy, Griffin, Lorelei, Dallas, Matt, his father, and my mother all stop talking when they see us and jump up from their seats.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to jail, is she? I\u2019ll vouch for her,\u201d my mother says, breaking the silence.</p><p>Ted laughs and shakes his head at her. \u201cNo, Mrs.\u2014I mean, Miss McCarty. Paige is most definitely not going to jail. She did a great job today.\u201d</p><p>My mother walks over to stand right in front of me. \u201cI guess this job is better than you taking your clothes off all the time. So I approve.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes at her, I wrap my arms around her shoulders and pull her in for a hug. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back after a few seconds and sighs. \u201cNow I don\u2019t have any excuse to buy that Maximus magazine anymore if you aren\u2019t in it. Where am I going to get my information on s-e-x and relationships?\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s father walks up and holds his elbow out for her to take. \u201cHow about you and I take a seat, Miss McCarty? I can tell you about the things I learned at Paige\u2019s photo shoot the other day. Did you know men wear skirts now?\u201d</p><p>My mother links her hand through his arm. \u201cMaybe we can exchange information, Mr. Russo. My friend Eunice told me about this new thing called roofies.\u201d</p><p>I stare in shock as the two of them go back over to the chairs against the wall to continue their discussion. Luckily, Kennedy comes up and takes my mind off of the thought of my mother slipping Mr. Russo a roofie in Jell-O salad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say something right now, and after I\u2019m finished, we\u2019re going to pretend like it never happened, got it?\u201d</p><p>I nod at her even though I have no idea what\u2019s happening right now.</p><p>\u201cPaige, I love you. You are an amazing friend. I even love that you force me to get my hair highlighted every six weeks. I\u2019m sorry if you ever thought you needed to prove something to me. I have never thought of you as just a pretty face or not good enough for anything more challenging at the office. I respect you and everything you\u2019ve done with your life.\u201d</p><p>This is all I ever wanted\u2014to be taken seriously by my friends and family. The fact that it\u2019s happening all at the same time is more than a little overwhelming. The fact that it\u2019s so heartfelt and sweet coming from Kennedy is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, I . . .\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand up in front of me. \u201cAnd now begins the portion of our evening where we forget this ever happened. Good work today, Paige. You\u2019ve earned that promotion. I\u2019m going to go home now, watch football, drink beer, and do anything else un-girly that I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do me. I\u2019m about as un-girly as it gets,\u201d Griffin teases.</p><p>Kennedy looks at Griffin like she wants to rip his clothes off right in the middle of the station. She grabs his hand and I smile as the two of them walk over to a quiet corner.</p><p>Matt stands in the middle of the room with his hands in his pockets and a smile on his face. I start to walk over to him when I hear my name called. Turning around, I see Andy standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I know exactly what he\u2019s going to say. He\u2019s going to beg for my forgiveness and tell me he was an idiot. He might even add in a few promises that he\u2019s going to change.</p><p>Been there, done that, don\u2019t want to hear it. A few months ago, I might have given him a chance to explain and even told him that I forgive him. I\u2019ve let him control the way I feel and the way I think for far too long. Lorelei was right. I\u2019m the only one who controls my destiny, and right now, my destiny is screaming at me to man up and put an end to this bullshit once and for all.</p><p>Turning away from Matt, I stalk over to Andy and hold myself tall.</p><p>\u201cAndy, I couldn\u2019t care less what you have to say to me. You are a pathetic excuse for a man, and I\u2019m sorry I ever wasted my time with you. The lying, gambling, getting mixed up with the Mob and expecting me to bail you out, making me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough for all those years\u2014it\u2019s over. It should have been over the day I kicked your ass to the curb. Have a nice life. And if you ever even think of picking up the phone and calling me again, I will shove my Louboutins so far up your ass you\u2019ll taste leather.\u201d</p><p>Dismissing him with a turn of my body, I leave him standing in the doorway with his mouth gaping open.</p><p>Matt opens his arms and I walk right into them, burying my face into his chest.</p><p>Kennedy starts to clap from the corner of the room and I suddenly realize that everyone in here heard my entire tirade.</p><p>\u201cThat was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Kennedy announces.</p><p>\u201cIs that a tear? Are you crying?\u201d Ted asks, staring at her in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up. There\u2019s nothing more moving than watching a worthless man have his ass handed to him. I\u2019m so proud,\u201d Kennedy says as she beams at me.</p><p>Matt hugs me closer to him and I tilt my head back to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, Miss Hotshot PI, it looks like all of your dreams have come true.\u201d</p><p>I stand up on my tiptoes so we\u2019re eye level. \u201cNot all of them. Not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>He was seconds away from telling me that he loved me back in the abandoned church. I didn\u2019t just stop him because I wanted it to happen someplace a little more romantic. I stopped him because I wanted to make sure he really meant it when he said it. I wanted to be certain that he didn\u2019t have any lingering feelings left over for Melanie.</p><p>He looks at me in confusion and before I can elaborate, there\u2019s a commotion behind us.</p><p>\u201cMatthew! Don\u2019t let them put me in jail!\u201d Melanie shouts as she\u2019s taken past the waiting area with two police officers flanked on either side of her. \u201cI forgive you for not paying enough attention to me. We can work this out!\u201d</p><p>Her shouts are cut off as the officers lead her into the interview room and shut the door behind them.</p><p>Matt looks back down at me and when he sees the worry on my face, he smiles. \u201cYou stalked me, put your friendships on the line to catch Melanie, and saved your sorry excuse for an ex-husband. It\u2019s been a crazy month, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Melanie doesn\u2019t, nor will she ever, hold a candle to you. I\u2019m sorry for ever thinking I couldn\u2019t trust you, Paige McCarty. There\u2019s no one else in this world I could ever rely on more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need assistance with a subpoena delivery. I\u2019m pretty sure I can handle it,\u201d Lorelei tells Dallas sarcastically on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that, lawyer? We wouldn\u2019t want you to accidentally cut the poor guy\u2019s balls off with that sharp attitude of yours,\u201d Dallas replies.</p><p>Lorelei huffs. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do, like club a woman over the head and take her back to your cave?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at their typical exchange and block out their voices, content to just concentrate on the man holding me in his arms.</p><p>Sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs in life. Sometimes you have to marry a frog and then learn how to be strong again after that frog turns into an ass. But eventually, Prince Charming will finally show his face and make all those damn frogs before him worth it.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Two weeks later . . .</p><p>Can we get everyone a refill? I\u2019d like to do a toast,\u201d Kennedy announces.</p><p>Griffin walks around Fool Me Once Investigations and adds champagne to everyone\u2019s glasses.</p><p>I stare around the room at my friends and family. Kennedy is curled up against Griffin\u2019s side, Lorelei is shooting daggers at Dallas as he lounges against the wall, Ted is listening to my mother scold him about police response time, and Mr. Russo is standing next to Matt and me, complaining about the state of a world where nice, older women are forced to take matters into their own hands to catch a hardened criminal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vinnie DeMarco survived the bullet my mother lodged in his thigh and is now in jail, awaiting trial for all of his crimes. I wasn\u2019t able to get him on tape admitting his wrongdoings, but with eyewitness testimonies from Melanie and me, his fate was sealed. It also helped that he was so afraid of my mother shooting him again that he confessed to all of his sins in the ambulance ride to the hospital.</p><p>Giovanni was so traumatized after watching his boss take a bullet from an old lady, and then getting beat up by said old lady and her friends, that he took a plea bargain and gave Vinnie up. There is no way Vinnie DeMarco will be able to escape the many years of prison time that are in his future now.</p><p>My mother and her friends were hailed as heroes at Saint Michael\u2019s for their detective work in finding out who stole the Communion hosts. It turns out I was right about Father Bob looking guilty. He had a serious gambling addiction, and when he couldn\u2019t pay Vinnie the money he owed him, Vinnie sent Giovanni to the church to collect his debts in the form of enough Communion for every church service for the next five years, and every single gold chalice and church heirloom he could stuff in his bag. The Communion wasn\u2019t worth a dime to him, but it was Vinnie\u2019s way of sticking it to Father Bob. Father Bob became so paranoid that the Catholic Church would find out what he\u2019d been doing, strip him of his clergy status, and take away his church that he began stealing money from women\u2019s purses during Altar and Rosary meetings. My mother, Fran, and Eunice caught him red-handed and made him \u2019fess up.</p> <p>My mother apologized to Father John at Holy Cross for wrongly accusing him, and they have since asked him to join their congregation. My mother, Eunice, and Fran have also started up a community watch program called The Golden Girls: We\u2019re Armed and Dangerous. So far they have twenty-five members. I hope to God they don\u2019t all buy guns, or the police force will have to look for a new line of work.</p><p>After Melanie was questioned, she was sent off with a warning to stay as far away from the Mob as possible and not do anything stupid, or else a prison tat on her ass would be the least of her worries. The next day, she immediately signed the divorce papers for Matt and told him she didn\u2019t want his father\u2019s company after all. Vinnie had given her enough money in the year and a half they dated that she was able to save quite a nice chunk of change. She wouldn\u2019t need a job for quite a while. Little does she know, though, that that money has all been earmarked as stolen, and it will be disappearing from her bank account before she can make it to the mall.</p><p>Andy is still Andy. Nearly dying because of his gambling debt didn\u2019t change him at all. Last I heard, he decided to move to Vegas and become a professional poker player. My guess is that he\u2019ll be slinking back home with his tail between his legs very soon. Or the Vegas Mob will get hold of him and we\u2019ll never hear from him again. One can only hope.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please raise your glasses,\u201d Kennedy tells the room.</p><p>We all comply, and Kennedy smiles at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this short and sweet because I think I\u2019ve embarrassed myself enough lately with my girly speeches. To one of my best friends\u2014Paige. You\u2019ve annoyed the hell out of me with salon appointments and shopping trips, but you have proven to be an asset to Fool Me Once Investigations,\u201d she announces. \u201cWith your help, the South Bend Police Department was able to take down one of the largest crime rings in the city, and Fool Me Once got credit for it. I am officially promoting you to lead investigator, and you are free to handle any case that comes in.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone claps, cheers, and whistles before taking a drink of champagne. I hold my glass in front of me without taking a sip while the conversations resume around me.</p><p>\u201cHey, why didn\u2019t you drink to that? It\u2019s awesome news and I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Matt tells me.</p><p>Setting my glass down on the closest desk, I turn and cock my head at him. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just in shock. I mean, this is what I\u2019ve always wanted\u2014to be taken seriously.\u201d</p><p>I trail off and Matt sets his own glass down and gathers me to him. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s just one thing missing. Something I never thought I would ever want again. Something I stopped believing in a long time ago,\u201d I tell him softly, bringing my hands up to cradle his face. \u201cI love you, Matt Russo.\u201d</p><p>Matt smiles and rests his forehead against mine. \u201cI love you, Paige. I\u2019m so glad you thought I was a cheater.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh and he presses his lips against mine. We get caught up in the kiss and don\u2019t even realize that everyone in the room has their eyes on us until we hear someone clear their throat.</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a nice young man, Matthew. But if you cheat on my daughter, there will be nowhere for you to hide,\u201d my mother threatens him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, pretty lady. I\u2019ll make sure my boy stays in line,\u201d Mr. Russo assures my mother, walking up next to her.</p><p>\u201cIs someone going to order food? I\u2019ve got to take my arthritis pills,\u201d my mother announces to the room at large.</p><p>\u201cAre these the only chairs you\u2019ve got in this place? My back is killing me,\u201d Mr. Russo adds.</p><p>Matt and I turn away from them as they begin to argue about whether food or comfortable chairs are more important to their health.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Matt. And I even love your crazy father,\u201d I tell him with a laugh.</p><p>He tightens his hold on me. \u201cAnd here I thought it wasn\u2019t possible to love you any more than I already do. Our parents are insane, but if putting up with the two of them means I get to have you for the rest of my life, then shame on me for not letting them meet each other sooner.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
