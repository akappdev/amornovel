Brynn\u2019s date was spiraling toward DEFCON 1\u2014imminent disaster. In the brief time it had taken her to down three hors d\u2019oeuvres, her sexy doctor had tumbled from fantasy fodder to potential therapy client.</p><p>Dr. Depressed propped his elbows on the table and leaned forward, his brows knitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. One minute we\u2019re in love and planning the future, the next I catch her in the copy room with her arms wrapped around the pharmaceutical sales rep.\u201d</p><p>Brynn frowned as tears gathered behind his glasses. Oh, hell. She couldn\u2019t have another guy cry on her. That\u2019d be the second one this month. She was becoming the Barbara Walters of dating\u2014taking a perfectly put-together person and reducing him to tears without trying. She reached across the table and gave his hand a quick squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. It sounds like she took advantage of what a nice guy you are.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her for a moment, and then released a breath. \u201cGod, what am I doing? I\u2019m breaking that cardinal rule, right? No ex talk on dates. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t ask me to come to this fund-raiser so you could hear me yammer about my breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Breakups can be tough,\u201d she said, giving her therapist half-smile\u2014the one that said I feel your pain and am so not judging you, even though she was already formulating a hypothetical treatment plan in her head. She drew her hand away and sipped the last of her iced tea.</p><p>The lines in his face relaxed, and he leaned back in his seat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let it come up. You\u2019re just so easy to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccupational hazard, I guess,\u201d she said, trying to lighten the mood. But the truth of her statement turned the words to sawdust in her mouth. She enjoyed her work, but did that mean she had signed up to heal every guy she dated? For once, she\u2019d love to worry, like other women did, that a guy had asked her out simply to get her in bed. Instead, she had to worry if someone asked her to dinner because it was cheaper than a therapy session.</p><p>A waiter stopped by with a tray of champagne flutes. Brynn accepted one of the drinks, but her companion shook his head. \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m on call. Plus, I don\u2019t want to fall asleep on my lovely date before the end of the night.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a hopeful smile, his brown eyes still red-rimmed from unshed tears. Brynn fought back the defeated sigh that gathered in her throat. If he was staying awake on her account, he shouldn\u2019t bother. She didn\u2019t care how nice of a guy he was or how hot he probably looked naked. She was not going to be his rebound sex. Nothing like knowing a guy is closing his eyes in bed because he\u2019s picturing someone else beneath him. Brynn took a long gulp from her glass.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d he said, reaching into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out his cell phone, \u201ccould you excuse me for a minute? I need to check in with the answering service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, take all the time you need.\u201d Really, he could take as much time as he wanted because this date was over\u2014sign the death certificate and slap a toe tag on it. Done.</p><p>After he strode off, Brynn pushed her chair away from the table and straightened the hem of her black-and-white shift dress as she stood. She needed something stronger than champagne.</p><p>She navigated through the crowd and the steady hum of polite conversation, pausing occasionally to smile and shake hands with donors. The Women\u2019s Crisis Center of Dallas had a fund-raiser twice a year and, thanks to a very active board, had managed to snag a number of high-dollar supporters for this one. Good thing, considering her job was dependent on the generosity of these strangers. She grabbed a mini quiche off a passing waiter\u2019s tray and shoved it in her mouth, hoping her obvious chewing would deter more people from stopping her to chat.</p><p>Brynn spotted a familiar face near the bar. Melody, her coworker, flipped her auburn hair over her shoulder and laughed at something the bartender said. Brynn walked over but hovered behind her for a moment, not wanting to interrupt Mel\u2019s flirting. The woman was a master and seemed to have the young bartender sufficiently under her spell until another party guest pounded a fist on the counter and demanded a refill. With an apologetic smile, the bartender excused himself and Melody huffed.</p> <p>Brynn tapped her on the shoulder. \u201cHey, girl, I haven\u2019t seen you all night. Where\u2019ve you been hiding?\u201d</p><p>Melody turned around and grinned.</p><p>\u201cHey, I could say the same to you. Although, I have an idea of what\u2019s keeping you busy.\u201d She nodded toward Brynn\u2019s table. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with the yummy doctor? Are you ready to play nurse yet?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s the best you can come up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m three drinks into this. My comedy skills suffer when I\u2019m tipsy.\u201d</p><p>Brynn set her champagne on the bar, and then turned back to her friend. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a disaster. He almost cried already.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Brynn held out her palms and shook her head before her friend could go into pity mode. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about it. I\u2019m apparently cursed to be a thirty-year-old born-again virgin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, screw that. You just need to stop looking for the perfect guy and find a guy to have some fun with. You could ask out that lawyer who\u2019s starting at the crisis center,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI think he\u2019s Cooper\u2019s friend. And believe me, I mentally undressed him a little while ago and liked what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really, you got to meet him?\u201d Brynn asked, scanning the crowded room to see if she could spot Cooper and her new coworker.</p><p>Mel sipped her drink. \u201cMm-hmm. I ran into Coop a few minutes ago and he introduced us. Apparently, the guy\u2019s starting Monday, so you have two nights to get around your I-don\u2019t-date-people-I-work-with policy. Just enough time for a dirty little fling.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cRight. I think that\u2019d make for an awkward staff meeting on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an interesting one. I\u2019d bet Mr. Dark and Dashing would know exactly how to break you out of your dry spell. You should see the size of his hands,\u201d she said, holding up her palm with a knowing nod.</p><p>Brynn snorted. \u201cIf he\u2019s so great, why aren\u2019t you weaving your wicked web around him by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I like mine blond\u2014feeds my Leonardo DiCaprio fantasies. Plus,\u201d she said, nudging her shoulder, \u201cyou need the action more than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, could you make me sound any more pathetic? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to shrivel up and die if I don\u2019t get laid.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned deadpan. \u201cYou may. The lawyer may be your only chance before you spontaneously combust from sexual frustration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Brynn bent down to fiddle with the strap on her shoe. Damn thing was cutting into her ankle like razor wire. She loosened the strap and rubbed her reddened skin. \u201cI\u2019m not going to combust. Who needs the lawyer when I have a perfectly functioning vibrator at home?\u201d</p><p>Brynn expected to hear a witty retort, but there was silence. She froze, her gaze still on her shoe. Mel, a former sex therapist, would never stay quiet after a comment like that, especially when her tongue was loose from alcohol. Unless... Shit. She closed her eyes briefly.</p><p>\u201cHey, ladies, hope I\u2019m not interrupting,\u201d Cooper said, her boss\u2019s baritone voice barely concealing amusement.</p><p>Brynn straightened, finding Cooper wearing a shit-eating grin and Melody biting her lip like she was three seconds from bursting into laughter. Brynn slapped on a smile and tried to keep her voice light. \u201cHey, Cooper. Not interrupting a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause I wanted to introduce you to the new lawyer.\u201d Cooper nodded at someone behind Brynn. \u201cThis is Reid.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s response lodged in her throat, the all-too-familiar name ringing in her ears. No, couldn\u2019t be. But a sinking feeling settled in her gut. She\u2019d only met one Reid in her life, and that Reid was a lawyer. She closed her eyes and took a steadying breath before she turned around to face her new coworker.</p><p>Reid\u2019s blue-eyed gaze met her head-on, hitting her like an air bag to the chest. She sucked in a breath and fought the old instinct to lower her eyes in deference. Son of a bitch, where had that urge come from? She ticked up her chin and gave him her best I-hate-you-but-will-be-polite-because-I\u2019m-the-bigger-person glare. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Cooper walked around Brynn and clapped Reid on the shoulder. \u201cReid, I\u2019d like you to meet our other social worker, Brynn LeBreck.\u201d</p><p>Reid nodded, his expression annoyingly unreadable. \u201cBrynn, pleasure to see you again. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Not long enough. Three years had passed since she\u2019d last seen him. His inky hair was longer on top and a few lines creased the corners of his eyes, but time hadn\u2019t softened her warring responses to him. The urges to pummel his face and strip naked before him held almost equal weight. Luckily, the venue was too public to give in to either. She feigned an air of indifference. \u201cIt has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill as beautiful as ever, though.\u201d</p><p>The warm notes of his voice stirred the dark recesses of her memory, further inciting the old longing. She shifted in her heels as hot tingles crept from deep in her belly and moved downward to settle between her legs. Un-fucking-believable. Her body was a whoring traitor.</p><p>Melody stepped next to Brynn as if sensing her need for support, and Cooper\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><p>Boy, did they\u2014in just about every way a man and woman could. She searched Reid\u2019s face, and he tipped his head infinitesimally, as if giving her permission to answer the question. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cUsed to. Long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Cooper smiled, either oblivious or unperturbed by the tension zipping through the air between her and Reid. \u201cGreat. Guess introductions weren\u2019t needed then.\u201d</p><p>Nope. Not needed. Brynn knew exactly who Reid Jamison was. A first-class bastard.</p><p>Reid tucked his hands in his pockets, his relaxed confidence taunting her. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? Weren\u2019t you working with kids the last time I saw you?\u201d</p><p>So this is how he was going to play it, like they were old buddies. Fine. She nodded. \u201cI was. But after my mother\u2019s murder, I decided I should work with troubled women. Someone needs to be on their side.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the scoff that threatened to escape. Of course, her ass. He\u2019d been all too happy to take on her mother\u2019s killer as a client. Who gave a shit about guilt or innocence if the paycheck was good, right? The ridiculous hormonal surge he\u2019d caused turned frigid with the memory. She shot a pointed glance in the direction of her table. \u201cSorry I don\u2019t have more time to chat, but I can\u2019t leave my date waiting.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s mouth curved upward, the effect more predatory than friendly. \u201cNo worries. We\u2019ll have all kinds of time to catch up now that we\u2019ll be working together again.\u201d</p><p>Together. Every day. With Reid. The words felt like shackles locking around her limbs. She attempted a facsimile of a smile, exchanged good-byes with everyone, and then hurried back to her table. Dealing with a weepy date suddenly seemed like cake compared to spending one more second under the knowing gaze of the guy who, once upon a time, had brought her to her knees with a single, charged glance.</p><p>Reid watched the swaying ass of Brynn LeBreck as she hightailed it away from the group and returned to her date. Poor bastard. He\u2019d overheard Brynn say something about her vibrator, so he assumed the guy wasn\u2019t going to be asked in for \u201cdrinks\u201d tonight. For some reason, knowing her date didn\u2019t do it for her gave him an odd sort of satisfaction. It\u2019d even been on the tip of his tongue to tell her that if she was in need of a good toe curling, he\u2019d be more than happy to cuff her to his bed tonight\u2014no battery-operated intervention needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>But he figured the whole hating-his-guts thing would probably get in the way of her accepting his invitation. If time was supposed to heal all, Brynn definitely hadn\u2019t gotten the memo. The fury that had flared in those green irises of hers could\u2019ve set his suit on fire. Unfortunately, sharing air with the sexy blonde again had set other things aflame as well. His dick had jumped to attention like a soldier reporting for duty.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t even going to acknowledge the little flip his heart had performed in his chest. Stupid.</p> <p>It\u2019d been a few years since he\u2019d seen her, ten since he\u2019d touched her, but he remembered the feel of her curves and the taste of her skin as if he\u2019d been buried inside her luscious body yesterday. He yanked at his collar, his tie suddenly feeling like a noose. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been such a good idea to take Cooper up on his offer of cheap rent in exchange for some pro bono work. He\u2019d hesitated when he\u2019d seen Brynn\u2019s name listed on the brochure for the crisis center, but he\u2019d figured he\u2019d be immune to the woman by now. Plus, the deal had been too good to pass up. But now that he\u2019d seen her again, he couldn\u2019t deny that the residue of his old attraction still clung to his bones. Fuck me.</p><p>\u201cWell, boys, I\u2019m off,\u201d Melody said, dragging Reid\u2019s attention back to the two people standing beside him. \u201cThese shoes were made for dancing and the night\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p><p>Cooper turned to him after Melody traipsed off. \u201cMan, you look like you need a beer.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s shoulders relaxed a bit, and he gave his friend a half-smile. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Coop got the bartender\u2019s attention, ordered two Shiner Bocks, and handed one to Reid. They moved away from the busy bar, but remained on the fringes of the milling crowd. His friend took a swig of his beer, then nodded in the direction of Brynn\u2019s table. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you two?\u201d</p> <p>Reid shook his head. \u201cLong story. Shitty ending.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m guessing there was nakedness involved. I\u2019ve never seen her look so horrified to see someone. Although, I\u2019m having trouble imagining the two of you dating. Brynn\u2019s, uh, not exactly into guys like us.\u201d</p><p>Reid eyed his friend. \u201cGuys like us?\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave him a wry smile. \u201cThe bossy type. I know it\u2019s been a while, but I doubt you\u2019ve changed that much since college.\u201d</p><p>Reid absentmindedly rubbed the spot on his finger where a ring used to be. No, some things couldn\u2019t be changed, no matter how hard he\u2019d tried. Too bad he hadn\u2019t figured that out before he\u2019d married a woman who thought he was some kind of deviant for wanting to take control in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d However, Cooper\u2019s assessment of Brynn confused him. Back when he\u2019d known her, she\u2019d been exactly the kind of girl for his flavor of kink.</p> <p>Coop pointed his bottle at him. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s between you two, but I suggest you clear out that old stuff quick. The last thing we need at the crisis center is drama between the employees. Believe me, our clients provide enough of that.\u201d</p><p>Reid gave a curt nod. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Now he just had to figure out how. This was supposed to be his fresh start, both from his failed marriage and from the stress of working in his family\u2019s high-profile practice. Tiptoeing around Brynn and being on edge at work were not part of the agenda. He\u2019d done enough eggshell walking over the past few years to last him a lifetime. That stopped now.</p><p>The way he saw it, she\u2019d ripped his heart out ten years ago and then he\u2019d let her down during her mother\u2019s trial\u2014they should be even. So whether she liked it or not, the two of them were going to dump their ugly history on the table and deal with it.</p><p>Based on previous experience, that kind of discussion would either end up in a screaming fight or a screaming fuck. Regardless, he wasn\u2019t waiting until Monday to have it with her. To hell with her date\u2014and her vibrator. There would only be one guy driving Ms. LeBreck home tonight.</p><p>TWO</p><p>ten years earlier</p><p>Brynn fought the urge to roll her eyes as the other girls in the campaign office fawned over the senator-to-be\u2019s nephew. Reid had only been in the building for ten minutes and already her fellow coeds had provided him with cupfuls of coffee and an eyeful of cleavage. Not that Reid looked like he minded. He leaned back in his desk chair and graced the two women with his sly smile, holding court.</p> <p>Brynn shook her head. Must be nice to have things handed to you without having to work for it. College paid for, a cushy summer job, and designer jeans that probably cost more than her entire wardrobe\u2014all because you were lucky enough to win the family lottery.</p><p>She dropped her gaze back to the pink notepad in front of her and scribbled down the message from the phone call she\u2019d taken a few minutes earlier. She tore off the sheet and put it on the growing stack of \u201cwhile you were out\u201d notes for Davis Ackerman, the campaign manager. Her neck ached from cradling the phone to her ear all morning, but she wasn\u2019t going to complain. This new receptionist gig sure beat running the register at the Chicken Fried Chick down the street. She\u2019d take sore muscles over hair that smelled like fryer grease any day.</p><p>The sound of a throat clearing made her raise her head. Reid propped his hip on the edge of her desk and peered down at her, his dark blue eyes analyzing her. \u201cBrynn, right?\u201d</p><p>She sat straighter in her chair in an attempt to look more professional. \u201cYes, sir. Brynn LeBreck.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled at the corner. \u201cI\u2019m hardly old enough to drink. I don\u2019t think you need to call me sir, although it sounds kind of good coming from you. You have a nice voice.\u201d</p><p>She groaned inwardly. All these girls tripping over themselves and he was going to turn that southern charm on her? Super. Not that he wasn\u2019t nice to look at, but she didn\u2019t have time for guys right now, especially ones who were related to the man who signed her much-needed paycheck. She forced a polite smile. \u201cGuess that\u2019s why they hired me to answer phones.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, my uncle said he offered you the job because you were giving an unruly customer the what-for when he went in to get lunch one day. Figured you\u2019d be able to handle all the craziness around here just fine.\u201d</p><p>She smirked at the memory. The redneck had quickly regretted ogling her and asking if there was an up-charge for large breasts. \u201cYeah, not my proudest moment, but that customer deserved it.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cUncle Patrick said you insulted the dude\u2019s manhood... and his mother.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cWell, the guy was being a dick. What else was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together as if holding back a laugh.</p><p>She cringed. \u201cSorry. Sometimes my mouth opens before my brain gets involved.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the deep sound so genuine the tension in her shoulders relaxed. \u201cDon\u2019t censor yourself on account of me. I didn\u2019t hire you. I can\u2019t fire you. So no filter necessary. Talk dirty to me anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth lifted. \u201cIf that\u2019s your pick-up line, I\u2019d work on it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his brows furrowing. \u201cNo good?\u201d</p><p>She sat her chin on her hand and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cReally? Huh.\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d bet Molly or Krista over there would eat that shit up.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could recite the Pledge of Allegiance and the sorority twins would turn cartwheels.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his face serious. \u201cThat\u2019s true. They do recognize my innate awesomeness. Too bad having a conversation with them is about as interesting as alphabetizing my CD collection.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at the two girls in question. Both were giving her versions of the stink eye. He followed her gaze, and they hurriedly looked away. \u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m not getting an invite to girls\u2019 night now.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her, his eyes sparkling with mischief. \u201cSo, if I were to need a decent pick-up line to entice, let\u2019s say, a smoking-hot blonde who likes to talk dirty to have a burger with me, what would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated, unable to fend off the effects of his easy charm. No wonder he had girls following him around like ducklings. She glanced down at her desk, wishing she could say yes, but knowing she couldn\u2019t. She and Reid Jamison lived on different planets. She didn\u2019t have time for flings or dating. She needed to work, get through the summer, save every penny, and hopefully have enough to afford the move to Austin for school in the fall. She looked up at Reid. \u201cI would suggest you find someone who has time to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even enough time for a simple burger?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She tapped her desk calendar. \u201cI\u2019m in high demand these days. Gotta book months ahead.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cGood thing I wasn\u2019t talking about you then.\u201d</p><p>She fought a smile. \u201cGood thing.\u201d</p><p>He rose from his perch and gave her a quick grin. \u201cJust know that I\u2019m a pretty thick-headed guy. Takes me a while to get the point.\u201d</p><p>She straightened the papers he had mussed on her desk. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a mock salute. \u201cNice to meet you, Brynn LeBreck. Be seeing you.\u201d</p><p>Reid bumped a shoulder against the entrance to the guesthouse and tried to get the humidity-swollen door unstuck. When it didn\u2019t budge, he gave it another hard shove and it released, banging against the inside wall. \u201cPiece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s such a hardship, you could always move back into the main house,\u201d said a female voice.</p><p>Reid startled and nearly dropped the sack of groceries he\u2019d been carrying. \u201cJesus, Aunt Roslyn, what are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>His aunt rose from his couch and crossed her arms over her chest, her face as tight as the bun in her dark hair. \u201cYou got a package today.\u201d</p><p>He set the bag of food on the counter of his efficiency kitchen and stared at the large cardboard box in front of her. \u201cOkay. I appreciate the heads-up, but no need to personally deliver it.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the box and flipped it over, dumping the contents onto the coffee table. A slew of items spilled across the surface and Reid groaned. Handcuffs. Floggers. A blindfold. A few brightly colored vibrators and a number of other things even he couldn\u2019t identify. Son of a bitch.</p><p>She turned her angry-parent death stare on him. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Reid? Do I need to call Dr. Leonard? I know he only sees patients until eighteen, but he may make an exception for us.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, the ridiculous suggestion making his blood curdle. \u201cBack off, Aunt Ros. This isn\u2019t even my stuff. Jace must\u2019ve had it sent here since he\u2019s staying with his sister right now. And what are you doing opening my packages anyway?\u201d</p><p>Her stern expression didn\u2019t soften. \u201cThe label said R. Jamison. And I have the right to open anything that\u2019s put on my doorstep.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face. He was going to kill Jace. Beyond the embarrassment factor of being in the same room with his aunt and box of sex toys, he knew where this was headed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. He should\u2019ve never sent this here.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him with her trial lawyer shrewdness. \u201cReid, I don\u2019t have to remind you how important it is that you do nothing to bring attention to yourself during this campaign. Your uncle is running on a family values platform and I refuse to let your... issues put that at risk.\u201d She sighed and shook her head. \u201cI thought we were past this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy issues?\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhat the hell? I haven\u2019t gotten in any trouble since high school. And even then, it was just stupid shit. You act like I\u2019m a goddamned criminal.\u201d</p><p>She walked around the coffee table and came to stand in front of him, her diminutive stature doing nothing to diminish her powerful presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cBut your father was. And this\u201d\u2014she cocked her head toward the emptied box\u2014\u201cwas his specialty.\u201d</p><p>Like he needed a reminder. \u201cIt\u2019s not my stuff. And even if it were, I would never hurt a woman. I\u2019m not him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGenes are a powerful thing, Reid. Don\u2019t underestimate them.\u201d She touched his shoulder, her tone gentling. \u201cI know you can overcome them, but don\u2019t put yourself in bad situations. I\u2019m only looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>And the campaign. She didn\u2019t say it, but he knew that\u2019s what she meant. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of this stuff. I can\u2019t even imagine what poor Vanessa would think if she saw you with this filth. Don\u2019t mess things up with her\u2014she\u2019s a fine young lady.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa. He hadn\u2019t thought about her all day. Hell, he hadn\u2019t thought about any woman since the new receptionist had started at work. He didn\u2019t know what it was, but something about Brynn held him captive. He\u2019d barely gotten a lick of work done in three days.</p><p>But he definitely couldn\u2019t tell his aunt about Brynn. He knew Ros had heard wedding bells the minute he and Vanessa had started to see each other a few months ago. Both she and his uncle tag-teamed him regularly, pushing for him to make the relationship with the mayor\u2019s daughter exclusive. He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ros gave his shoulder a quick squeeze, and then headed past him. He didn\u2019t unclench his teeth until she\u2019d clicked his door shut behind her.</p><p>Stalking to the couch, he pulled his phone from his pocket and hit speed dial.</p><p>His best friend answered on the first ring. \u201cHey, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace, not only am I going to kill you, I\u2019m going to do it slowly and painfully.\u201d Reid sank onto the couch.</p><p>Jace laughed. \u201cYou must\u2019ve gotten my present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking, sending this crap over here?\u201d He lifted the handcuffs and examined them, heat rising in his gut as an image of him sliding the cool metal over the narrow wrists of a certain blonde receptionist filled his mind. He dropped them on the table. \u201cMy aunt opened it before I got home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now she\u2019s ready to sign me up with the kiddie shrink again, because I\u2019m apparently a rapist-in-training.\u201d</p><p>Jace groaned. \u201cDude, I\u2019m sorry. I just wanted to make sure</p><p>my sister didn\u2019t see it. I told them to have it delivered to the guesthouse.\u201d</p><p>Reid didn\u2019t even want to ask what Jace could possibly need with all that stuff. He had enough crap to throw a goddamned orgy. \u201cJust come and pick it up. I don\u2019t need her bringing my uncle over here to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look, take whatever you want from the box to keep,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s top-quality stuff. Consider it my apology for getting you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the different items that had tumbled out of the box\u2014things meant to restrain a woman, to cause pain, to bring pleasure. He wet his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Jace said, his tone sly. \u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t want to try some of that stuff out on that pretty receptionist you were drooling over today?\u201d</p> <p>He coughed, his throat threatening to close as erotic images crowded his brain. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>Liar. Imagining Brynn bound and naked had his cock straining against his pants. Hell, talking to her that afternoon had done as much. But he couldn\u2019t tell Jace that\u2014couldn\u2019t tell anyone. He\u2019d kept those urges in check for as long as he could remember, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t risk screwing that up, especially with someone like Brynn. He liked her. Liked her enough not to inflict his darkest desires on her. No, with Brynn, he\u2019d have to be extra careful.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Brynn waved as her date drove out of the dark parking lot. He\u2019d received an emergency call and had to head to the hospital, saving Brynn the awkward end of night, this-ain\u2019t-gonna-happen conversation. She leaned against the brick wall outside the banquet hall and rubbed her hands over her face. What a disaster of a night.</p><p>Thank God tomorrow was Sunday. At least she could sleep in and pretend the outside world didn\u2019t exist for a little while. Maybe a day of pajamas, HGTV, and massive amounts of junk food could make her temporarily forget about facing Reid on Monday... and every workday after that. She groaned and tapped the back of her head against the wall, hoping maybe this was all some nightmare and she\u2019d wake up.</p><p>\u201cSent him packing, huh?\u201d The deep drawl caused her eyes to snap open. Reid leaned his shoulder against the wall, a hint of a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and straightened. \u201cHe got called into work. Not that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck and looked at the half-empty parking lot. \u201cLet me give you a ride home. It\u2019ll give us some time to catch up.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the derisive laugh that bubbled to her lips. \u201cNo thanks, I have my car, and please tell me you\u2019re not suggesting we need to catch up like old friends. Even you can\u2019t be that dense.\u201d</p><p>He angled toward her and planted a hand against the wall, right next to her head. His face moved to within inches of hers. \u201cYou really hate me that much, sugar?\u201d</p><p>His calm, commanding tone and the old nickname sent goose bumps along her skin. She pressed her back against the wall, her heartbeat switching to double-time. Here it comes. She sucked in a ragged breath, and the smell of his cologne wrapped around her like a familiar blanket. Her muscles stiffened, bracing for the panic attack she knew would hit her at any moment. Being cornered sent all her fear triggers firing.</p><p>But the terror never came.</p><p>Instead, she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the sensual curve of his mouth. She remembered all too well the things he could do with those lips, that tongue\u2014how he could tease her body without mercy and then when she\u2019d thought she\u2019d go mad with need, send her rocketing into oblivion. A heated shudder rumbled through her and a sharp ache settled between her thighs.</p><p>His finger slipped under her chin and tilted it upward, so that she had to meet his eyes. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>His voice was so close it was as if he\u2019d climbed inside her head. She wet her lips. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>The blaring ring of her cell phone jolted her from her haze. Reid frowned down at her purse and shoved away from the wall.</p><p>She dug through her bag with shaking hands and grabbed the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Late-night calls from her sister usually meant one of two things: she needed money or she was in some kind of trouble. \u201cHey, Kelsey. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you busy? I know it\u2019s late, I\u2019m sorry, I just... I need to talk with you and I couldn\u2019t wait until morning, and I... Can you talk?\u201d</p><p>Shit. A rambling Kelsey\u2014never a good sign. Brynn glanced at Reid, who was now sitting on the railing of the handicap ramp, watching her intently. She turned her back to him and faced the wall. \u201cI have a minute, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, like, talk in person. Something\u2019s going on, and I... well, I may need to get out of town for a while. But I want to talk to you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up. Leave town? What are you talking about?\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cKels, are you on something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s, I... Can you just meet me at my apartment? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Brynn pinched the bridge of her nose to ward off the sudden pounding in her head. The last thing she felt like doing was traipsing across town at midnight to go deal with what would surely be unfounded drama, but what else could she do? Her sister had been making slow progress toward bettering her life. If she was having a bout of paranoia or had slipped up and gotten high again, Brynn had to help her through that. Plus, Kelsey had no one else to go to\u2014never had. \u201cSure, I can be there in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, B. Hurry, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Just hold tight.\u201d Brynn clicked her phone shut and tucked it back in her bag. She didn\u2019t want to turn around. She could feel Reid\u2019s stare burning into her back. God, why had she let him get so close before? She needed to institute a five-foot rule with him\u2014anything closer than that and her hormones could not be trusted. He\u2019d probably seen the arousal written all over her flushed face.</p><p>\u201cYour sister okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and turned around. \u201cEavesdrop much?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, unapologetic as usual.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She just wants me to stop by,\u201d Brynn said, rummaging through her purse for her keys.</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d He looked down at his watch.</p><p>She threw him a what\u2019s-it-to-you look, grabbed her keys, and headed in the direction of her car. His hand caught her upper arm when she passed him. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled out of his grip, the skin-to-skin contact too much for her frazzled nervous system to handle. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this tonight. My sister needs me and it\u2019s not a short drive to Quincy Heights. So this little come-to-Jesus is going to have to wait.\u201d</p><p>His frown dipped deeper. \u201cQuincy Heights? You can\u2019t go there at this hour. That neighborhood\u2019s a war zone.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI grew up in neighborhoods like that. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She started walking again, but he hopped off the railing and caught up with her. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you. I promise not to speak... much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because a hotshot lawyer in a Brooks Brothers suit is really going to scare off the bad guys.\u201d She halted her step and turned to face him. \u201cLook, Reid. The last time I asked for help, you told me no. I don\u2019t plan on asking again. So, go home. Stop acting like there is some discussion we need to have. There isn\u2019t. Everything\u2019s been said. Just come to work on Monday and pretend like we\u2019ve never met. \u2019Cause that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her, his jaw visibly flexing, but didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>Good. She\u2019d take his broody silence as agreement. She spun on her heel and didn\u2019t bother to look back. Reid Jamison might\u2019ve been able to bend her to his will when she was twenty, but if he thought his sexy smile and whispered commands would get him anywhere with her now, he was more delusional than her clients.</p><p>Brynn turned her car onto her sister\u2019s street. The apartment complex was the last residential holdout on a street littered with pawnshops, bail bondsmen, and strip clubs. Reid hadn\u2019t been off base in his assessment of the neighborhood. The Quincy Heights area probably had more hookers, drug addicts, and shootings than any other part of the city. Unfortunately, that type of area was more familiar to Brynn than the middle-class suburb she now called home. The part of Fort Worth she\u2019d grown up in hadn\u2019t looked much different than this.</p><p>She parked along the curb, then opened her glove compartment to grab her mace. She may have told Reid she could handle it alone, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She wasn\u2019t going to go out on these streets this late at night with only a few self-defense training classes under her belt. Weapons were better. She tucked the mace in her purse and climbed out of the car.</p><p>Besides a woman in stilettos and spandex standing on the corner a few yards away, the sidewalk was empty. Brynn clicked the alarm on her car and hurried to the stairwell of the three-story apartment complex. She had tried to convince her sister to move closer to her\u2014even offered to help with the costs\u2014but Kelsey had been dancing at the club down the street and said she was perfectly fine here.</p><p>Brynn suspected Kelsey\u2019s reluctance had more to do with her fear of being under Brynn\u2019s watchful eye than commuting convenience, but Brynn hadn\u2019t pushed. Her sister was making baby steps in the right direction, and she didn\u2019t want to scare her off by being overbearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Her feet ached by the time she reached the top floor. Strappy black pumps were not meant for hiking up three flights of stairs. The 3B label on her sister\u2019s door was peeling off around the corners. She smoothed her fingers over it, but the ends curled back up again. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever state her sister was in, and knocked on the door.</p><p>No answer.</p> <p>She knocked again, but got the same response. With a huff, she pulled out her cell phone and called her. It went straight to voice mail. Terrific. Kelsey had probably gotten over whatever crisis she had called her about and now had gone out.</p><p>Or.</p><p>Anxiety crawled up her spine. She\u2019d had nightmares of getting that call in the middle of the night\u2014the one that would say something had happened to her sister. She\u2019d received a call like that about her mother three years ago, and she\u2019d sworn to herself at the time that she would do all she could to make sure she never got that kind of call about Kelsey. Unfortunately, Kels hadn\u2019t always been so cooperative in helping Brynn keep that promise.</p><p>Brynn sorted through the keys on her key chain and found the one for her sister\u2019s apartment. If nothing was wrong, Kelsey would be pissed that she\u2019d gone in without asking, but Brynn wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep tonight if she didn\u2019t make sure everything was okay. She closed her eyes and said a silent prayer she wasn\u2019t walking into a real-life version of one of her nightmares. But when she swung open the door, the only thing that greeted her was an empty apartment.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been to her sister\u2019s place in over a month, but her mouth dropped open over the change. The last time, everything had been in disarray\u2014empty cans and take-out boxes littering the counters in the tiny kitchen, dirty clothes piled on one side of the couch, and a layer of dust coating the few remaining surfaces. Now the only things that seemed out of place were a few cardboard boxes on the kitchen table. Everything else looked neat and freshly cleaned. Her sister had even draped bright afghan blankets over the shoddy brown couches, giving the room an almost cheery vibe.</p> <p>\u201cKels,\u201d she called out. \u201cYou here?\u201d</p><p>Brynn stepped inside and closed the door behind her. When she received no answer, she made her way across the small living room and tapped on the slightly ajar bedroom door. \u201cKelsey?\u201d</p><p>She opened the door a bit and peeked inside. The bed was unmade, and a shirt and pair of jeans were strewn across the flower-print comforter, as if her sister had stripped them off in a hurry. Her mirrored closet door was open, revealing more empty hangers inside than clothes. Hell, had Kelsey been serious about leaving town? She barely had enough money to make rent each month, how was she going to afford a road trip?</p><p>Uneasiness settled over her. After another failed phone call to her sister, she headed back to the front door. Maybe Kelsey had gone by the club where she worked. Or, at the very least, maybe someone there would know where she was. Brynn locked up behind her and made her way down the stairs, her brain swirling.</p><p>The stench of stale alcohol hit her too late. A sweaty hand clamped over her forearm as she stepped off the last stair. \u201cHey, sweetheart, where ya going so fast?\u201d</p><p>Brynn sucked in a breath, her heart stuttering in her chest. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to yank away from the man\u2019s grip, but he dug his fingers in tighter. A smile edged his thin lips. He couldn\u2019t have been older than his mid-twenties, but his face had the hardened look of a longtime drug user. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I wouldn\u2019t hurt a pretty thing like you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah right, and she was the queen of England. She jammed the pointy heel of her shoe into the top of his foot, putting every ounce of her strength behind it. \u201cI said, let go, asshole.\u201d</p><p>A slew of curses flew from his cracked lips, and his green eyes turned feral. Instead of releasing his grip like she\u2019d hoped, he shoved her back into the darkened stairwell and slammed her against the wall, knocking the wind out of her. He leaned in close, his sour breath making her gag. \u201cWell, I was just going to ask if you could spare a little cash, but now you\u2019ve gone and pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to ward off the oncoming panic attack, but it was too late. She gasped for breath, her lungs\u2019 capacity seeming to shrink in her chest. Sweat dampened her skin, and her head spun. She squeezed her eyes shut. Breathe, Brynn. Think.</p><p>The man\u2019s hand grasped the strap of her dress and yanked, tearing the thin piece of material.</p><p>Her knees went weak beneath her. She tried to think of the self-defense moves she\u2019d learned, but she couldn\u2019t focus on anything except the fact that she was trapped. That this was happening again. She wouldn\u2019t survive a second rape. Her mind had barely survived the first. Her words tumbled out at a frantic pace. \u201cYou can have my purse, I have cash in my wallet. Please don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve thought of that before you broke my fucking toe,\u201d he growled. His hand pulled harder on the torn strap, exposing her bra. She opened her mouth to scream, but he smacked her hard across the face, her ears ringing from the blow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, or I\u2019ll make this much worse.\u201d</p> <p>The image of his face blurred as tears pricked her eyes. Then, it disappeared from view.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d the man started, but was interrupted by a sharp crunching sound.</p><p>Brynn swiped at her eyes to find the guy on the ground, holding his bloodied nose, six feet of suit-clad lawyer standing over him with rage on his face. The man jumped up and started swinging at Reid, landing a fist to his chin. He was much smaller than Reid, but Brynn knew drugs could make a person pretty powerful.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She pulled herself out of her shocked state and plunged her hand into her purse. Her fingers curled around the can of mace, and she ran toward the fray. The two men were punching and swinging at each other in a violent dance. She didn\u2019t know how to help. The wild-eyed man noticed her standing there and lunged at her. She reacted without thought, emptying the can of mace in his general direction.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he cried, grabbing at his eyes.</p><p>She almost smiled, but then heard a deep groan from Reid. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Brynn glanced at Reid and cringed when she saw he was also reaching for his eyes. The would-be rapist stumbled past her, out of the stairwell, and onto the street, apparently admitting defeat. She hurried to Reid\u2019s side, her throat itching and eyes watering from the residual spray. \u201cOh, God, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>His face was red and tears streamed out the corners of his closed lids. He opened his mouth to respond, but went into a coughing fit instead.</p><p>She wiped at his face and patted his back, not sure what to do. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I panicked. I didn\u2019t mean to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d he asked between coughs.</p><p>She looked back to the street. \u201cHe ran\u2014he\u2019s gone. What can I do to help you?\u201d</p><p>He moaned. \u201cWater? Fire hose? Something to flush it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, okay.\u201d She grasped his elbow. \u201cCome on, I have a key to my sister\u2019s apartment. Let me get you up there.\u201d</p><p>Reid leaned his head sideways over the kitchen sink as Brynn poured another cup of cool water over his eyes. They still burned like the fires of hell, but at least his vision had returned and he could speak again. She brushed her hand over his forehead, pushing his hair out of the way. \u201cAny better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll live,\u201d he said, straightening. She handed him a clean dish towel, and he patted his face with it. \u201cNext time aim for the bad guy, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one was that, again?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a withering look.</p><p>She gave a sheepish smile. \u201cKidding. I got him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I hope he stumbled into the street and got hit by a goddamned truck,\u201d he said, his anger firing up again in his belly. Fucking bastard. The guy was lucky Brynn had sprayed her mace. Otherwise, Reid might not have been able to stop himself from beating the man into an early grave. The way Brynn had been shaking. Jesus. From wildcat to kitten with the flip of a switch. \u201cWe need to call the police. Report him.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her bare arms and nodded. \u201cYeah, although I\u2019m sure he\u2019s long gone by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may have to go to the hospital for the nose. They could check for him there.\u201d</p><p>She sank into one of the dining chairs, her cheek still scarlet from where the jerk had struck her. \u201cWhat were you doing there anyway?\u201d</p><p>He smirked and propped a hip against the kitchen counter. \u201cBecause a hotshot lawyer can take care of the bad guys in a pinch, so I followed you. I wasn\u2019t going to let you come out here alone at night... looking like that.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her dress. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>His gaze traced the delicate line of her neck, the deep V-cut of her dress, and the swell of her breasts. His mouth watered at the memories of how that ivory skin tasted\u2014like sugared strawberries. He cleared his throat and looked down at the now bloodied dishtowel clenched in his fist. \u201cNever mind. It\u2019s just not a place you should come to by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d she said, getting to her feet again, \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice your hand. You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his biceps and guided him back to the sink. \u201cRinse it with soap and water. I\u2019ll go and see if Kelsey keeps any first aid stuff around.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared into the bathroom, and he turned on the faucet. The soap stung, but the cuts seemed minor, although his knuckles were already starting to swell. He shook his head. That\u2019d be great for first impressions with clients on Monday. Yes, let me help you with your domestic violence case. Oh, yeah, don\u2019t mind the black-and-blue knuckles. I\u2019m really a good, responsible professional.</p><p>Brynn emerged from the bathroom with a handful of Band-Aids and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide. She pointed to the dining room table. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He dried his hands with a paper towel and fought a smile. She always had been a bossy little thing. But he knew the truth. Underneath all that tight control was a woman who, at least when he\u2019d known her, loved handing over the reins. He swallowed hard, tamping down memories he didn\u2019t need to rehash at the moment.</p><p>He dropped into one of the chairs, and Brynn sat across from him, her knees bumping against his. He widened his legs, and after the briefest of hesitations, she scooted forward, allowing his thighs to frame the outsides of hers as she reached for his injured hand. She circled her fingers around his right wrist, his pulse jumping at her touch, and brought his hand up to her face to examine it. His fingers itched to reach out and trace the bow of her lips.</p><p>Dammit. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his desire to touch her in check, but the citrus scent of her shampoo drifted to his nose and sent a bolt of carnal need straight to his groin.</p><p>He stared down at her. One quick grasp of her waist and he could lift her to straddle his lap, bunch up that dress, and slide his cock right into her sweet heat\u2014kiss away all the tension furrowing her brow, drive her to that place of wild abandon he knew she could reach.</p><p>Without thinking, he lifted his other hand and twined her broken dress strap between his fingers, brushing the backs of his sore knuckles across her collarbone in the process. The small catch of breath in the back of her throat made his balls tighten. Such a feminine sound, so close to the noise she would make as he entered her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t raise her eyes to him and beg him to take her like he secretly hoped she would. She simply took the slip of material from him and tucked it under her bra strap to hold it in place, sending her message loud and clear. Not yours.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cThis may hurt a little,\u201d she said, her voice tighter than it had been. She laid his hand on the table, moved her chair back a notch, and dampened a cotton ball with disinfectant.</p><p>He winced when the cotton touched his open skin, the sting helping to drag his mind back from the depths. He shifted in his seat. \u201cSo where is your sister anyway? Isn\u2019t she the whole reason you rushed out here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She glanced up, her green eyes glinting with worry before she dropped her focus back to her task. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t here when I arrived, and I can\u2019t get her on her phone.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIs it standard MO for her?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged, but the motion seemed tense instead of casual.</p><p>\u201cIs she still...\u201d He paused, not knowing how to phrase it politely.</p><p>Brynn smirked at him. \u201cFucked up?\u201d</p><p>Looking at this refined blonde in her elegant outfit, he\u2019d forgotten where Brynn had come from. She\u2019d never been one to mince words. He nodded.</p><p>She rose and returned to the adjoining kitchen, turning her back to him as she opened the freezer. \u201cAfter the murder, she</p> <p>really took a turn for the worse, blamed herself. And she was still convinced the asshole you defended was innocent.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his neck bunched. Hank Caldwell was innocent\u2014is innocent. Unfortunately, Reid had failed to prove that to the jury, which was the first in the trifecta of lost cases that had led to his demotion from lead attorney. Now Hank sat rotting away in prison with a life sentence, waiting for Reid to pull a miracle out of his ass for an appeal.</p><p>However, he knew better than to preach Hank\u2019s innocence to Brynn and throw a match on that powder keg. The one time he\u2019d approached her during the trial to see if he could interview Kelsey for the defense, Brynn had jumped his shit like he was the devil asking for her soul. She\u2019d wanted him to drop the case entirely, but of course he couldn\u2019t do that. Not when he knew in his gut that Hank wasn\u2019t the guy.</p><p>The stark betrayal that had flashed in Brynn\u2019s eyes that day had sliced right through him. He\u2019d seen the switch flip\u2014the look of total dismissal. You no longer exist to me. So if she had any clue he was actively working on Hank\u2019s appeal now, she\u2019d probably shove him out of Kelsey\u2019s third-floor window.</p><p>Luckily, Brynn continued on without waiting for his input. \u201cBut the last few months, she\u2019s been making some progress. I got her to go to a detox program and a few therapy sessions. And she\u2019s been sober\u2014at least she was the last couple of times I saw her. But tonight, she sounded a little freaked out, paranoid.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his fingers, which were quickly stiffening. \u201cAny idea where she could be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere, this will help with the swelling.\u201d She handed him a plastic baggy full of ice. \u201cI honestly have no clue. It\u2019s not like her to ignore her phone. I was headed over to the club where she works to see if anyone knew anything when that asshole attacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, we need to put in a call to the police.\u201d He dug in his pocket, but she waved him off.</p><p>\u201cI got it. I saw him up close and personal. I\u2019ll be able to give a better description.\u201d She walked into the tiny living room and pulled out her phone, putting as much distance between the two of them as possible.</p><p>Her voice didn\u2019t waver as she relayed the information to the police, but she paced around the room, wearing a track into the already threadbare carpet. Occasionally, she would stop to peek through the blinds of the front window as if to will her sister to appear.</p><p>Reid stood and tossed the bag of ice onto the counter, Brynn\u2019s nerves setting him on edge. Why would her sister drag her out here then bail without even calling her back? He eyed the boxes on the dining room table, then flicked a quick glance at Brynn to make sure she was sufficiently absorbed in the conversation. He hooked a finger into one of the boxes and slid it closer so he could peek at the contents.</p><p>Papers, envelopes, a small notebook\u2014all shoved in there in no apparent order. He rifled through some of the papers, then picked up the notebook and flipped through a few pages. There were a couple of initials and random phone numbers, one of which was for Cowgirls, the strip club down the street. He set the notebook to the side and rifled through another stack of papers.</p><p>As he reached the bottom, he froze, a familiar company name catching his eye. Grant Waters, Inc. To the rest of Dallas\u2014the wealthy vineyard owner and producer of Water\u2019s Edge Wines. But to those in the know\u2014someone completely different. The yellow paper was the carbon copy of a background check form Kelsey had filled out.</p><p>A sinking feeling settled in his stomach. Last he\u2019d checked, Kelsey was no farmhand. He set the form aside and grabbed the notebook again, flipping back to the number for Cowgirls. Maybe the strip club would have some information. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialed the number.</p> <p>\u201cCowgirls, this is Nina,\u201d a cigarette-roughened voice said over the blaring background music.</p><p>\u201cHey, is Kelsey performing tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, Kiki isn\u2019t here,\u201d she said, smacking her gum loudly. \u201cBut if you like blondes with d-cups, Alexis is going on in about half an hour. She\u2019ll get you going as well as Kiki could\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>He sighed in mock disappointment, making sure the girl continued to believe he was a customer. \u201cIs Kel\u2014I mean, Kiki, on vacation or something?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat is it with that girl? You\u2019re, like, the third call I\u2019ve gotten asking about her. I\u2019m sorry, but she quit a few days ago. Said she got a better-paying gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, you got it bad, huh? She didn\u2019t say, but I know it\u2019s not one of the clubs around here. I would\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Nina. Thanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>He clicked the phone shut and turned back toward the living room. Brynn was leaning on the back edge of the couch watching him, her lips pressed into a grim line. \u201cShe\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cQuit a few days ago. The girl said Kelsey took another job.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s threw her hands out to her sides. \u201cWhy the hell wouldn\u2019t she tell me she\u2019d changed jobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have some idea,\u201d Reid said, glancing at the background form again. \u201cDo you know if Kelsey is into anything kinky?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the table, then back to him, a little crease between her brows. \u201cWell, stripping isn\u2019t exactly run-of-the-mill.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and met her confused gaze. \u201cNo, I mean, like the D/s scene.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shifted away and he could almost visualize porcupine quills popping out of her skin. \u201cHow the hell would I know that? \u2018Do you let a guy use you like a whore?\u2019 is not exactly a question that comes up in sisterly conversation.\u201d</p><p>He cringed, the words wrenching his gut. \u201cIs that what you think it was? You think I used you?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him. \u201cWhat exactly would you call it, Reid? I bet you weren\u2019t tying up and ordering around that debutante girlfriend of yours\u2014you know, the one you forgot to tell me about.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He hadn\u2019t been topping Vanessa. She would\u2019ve sent her father after him with a shotgun if he\u2019d done so much as copped a feel. But he\u2019d had to toe the line\u2014parade around with the girl he was expected to date. He blew out a breath and raked a hand through his hair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. Do the depraved stuff with the chick whose mother is a hooker, do the respectable things with the girl you want everyone to see on your arm. It\u2019s an old story,\u201d she said, sounding tired. \u201cI was just too naive to see what role I was playing in the game.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up the bad guy in all this. I seem to recall I wasn\u2019t the only one you were playing with.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and all the fight seemed to leave her stance. \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter, okay. What\u2019s done is done. I just want to know what all this has to do with my sister.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, part of him wanting to hash out their past, drag everything out in the open, and deal with it head-on, but the lines of worry in her face stopped him. He crooked a thumb at the boxes. \u201cI looked through some of your sister\u2019s stuff. She filled out a background check form for Grant Waters\u2019 company.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead scrunched. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns two big vineyards outside of town. And he runs The Ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that another strip club?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, tension taking root in his shoulders. \u201cNo, and I\u2019m not sure on the details. But what I do know is that it\u2019s</p><p>a BDSM retreat. Elite, exclusive, and if someone wants to disappear for a while\u2014a good place to hide.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip, as if mulling over the information. \u201cBut if it\u2019s so exclusive, how would Kels get in?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYour sister\u2019s a beautiful girl who\u2019s not afraid to show her body. My guess is that they probably hired her on as a server or attendant of some kind.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the few steps to the counter and grabbed her purse and keys. \u201cWell, then, what are we hanging around for? Let\u2019s go to this stupid place and get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn.\u201d He grabbed her wrist before she reached the door.</p><p>She glanced back over her shoulder, urgency rolling off her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea where this place is. And even if I did, you\u2019re not going to be able to get in without an invitation... or a master.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from her face. She glanced down at his fingers circling her wrist and jerked her arm free. \u201cWhat? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, calm down,\u201d he said, frowning down at her. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything tonight, but I know someone who may have a connection there. Let me see if I can get any information\u2014find out if your sister is even there. In the meantime, you can go home and call anyone you can think of\u2014her friends, boyfriends, whoever. Someone has to know where she is.\u201d</p><p>Brynn chewed her lip, considering him, then nodded. \u201cOkay. I guess that\u2019s the best we can do tonight.\u201d</p><p>He walked her down to her car, keeping an eye on their surroundings to make sure her attacker hadn\u2019t decided to hang around.</p><p>She pulled open her car door and slid in, looking up at him with tired eyes. \u201cThanks for your help. I take back the comment about you not being able to scare off bad guys.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThanks, and I don\u2019t mind helping.\u201d</p><p>She dug in her purse and pulled out a business card. \u201cHere. My cell is on there. Call me if you find anything out.\u201d</p><p>He took the card from her and slipped it into his pocket, then feigned a grimace. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must\u2019ve left my cell upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She moved to climb out of the car. \u201cOh, well, I can go grab it for you.\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cNo, it\u2019s late, and the sooner you\u2019re out of this neighborhood, the better. Why don\u2019t you just give me your sister\u2019s key and you can leave? I\u2019ll get the key back to you on Monday.\u201d</p><p>She paused, evaluating him for a moment, then glanced down the darkened street. \u201cYeah, okay, but just make sure everything\u2019s locked when you leave.\u201d</p><p>She slid the key off her key chain and handed it over. Trusting him.</p><p>Guilt flooded him, but he charged forward with his plan anyway. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll just run in and then lock back up. And</p><p>I promise I\u2019ll touch base with you tomorrow if I can find anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She pulled her seat belt across her chest. \u201cGood night, Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe, sugar.\u201d He shut her door and waited on the curb, watching her taillights fade around the corner. As soon as he was sure she was far enough away, he jogged back up the stairs and let himself into Kelsey\u2019s apartment, locking the door behind him.</p><p>Surveying the room, his eyes honed in on the boxes he hadn\u2019t been able to explore while Brynn was there. The ones labeled Mom\u2019s things. Thinking about what could be in those boxes had made his heart pick up speed. Last week when he\u2019d visited Hank in jail, he\u2019d told Reid that Kelsey had called him\u2014said she may have found something that could help him get an appeal. Reid had planned to contact Kelsey to see what she had come across, but now... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He tapped down the guilt about being there uninvited and went into the kitchen to grab a pair of rubber gloves from under the sink. If he found anything of use, he didn\u2019t want his fingerprints all over it. He hoped what he needed was in one of those boxes. But if it wasn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t going to leave the apartment until he\u2019d searched every inch of the place. If Kelsey had some key to getting Hank out of jail, he was going to do every damn thing possible to get his hands on it.</p><p>Even if that meant he\u2019d have to hunt down Brynn\u2019s sister himself.</p> <p>FOUR</p><p>then</p><p>Mr. Jamison stepped out of his office with Reid not far behind. Brynn smiled as the older man stopped in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cMs. LeBreck, it\u2019s almost seven, what are you still doing slaving away?\u201d</p><p>She held up a stack of envelopes. \u201cI told Mr. Ackerman I would stay late tonight and stuff these.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned over her desk and looked at the piles of flyers on the floor. He shook his head. \u201cYou work late all the time. You\u2019re too young to work that hard. Go home, my dear. Take a night off. I\u2019ll make sure you get paid overtime for the evening.\u201d</p><p>Reid broke into a wide grin behind his uncle.</p><p>Brynn smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really nice of you, but I don\u2019t mind staying.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his palm against the desk. \u201cThat\u2019s an order, Ms. LeBreck. Get out of here. I\u2019ll close up behind you.\u201d</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t going to argue with that. Mr. Jamison strolled off toward the copy room, and Reid replaced him at the front of her desk. She raised an eyebrow at him and pulled out her purse. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the shit-eating grin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a date tonight.\u201d</p> <p>She choked back the bitter taste that stole across her tongue, knowing that she had no right to be upset. She and Reid had fallen into a comfortable friendship at work over the last few weeks\u2014their playful banter the bright spot in her long days. But she\u2019d never given him any indication she was interested in anything more or told him that when she finally lay in bed at night, that it was his face she pictured, his hands she imagined on her when she touched herself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell him. Their lives were so far apart from each other, they might as well belong to different species. She gave him a stiff smile. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and held out his hand. \u201cCome on, LeBreck. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his open palm. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a date\u2014me, you, some food, all congregating in the same general area. You told me the day we met you didn\u2019t have time for a burger. Now you\u2019ve been given two hours you didn\u2019t plan on having, so you owe me a date.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and pushed her hair behind her ears. \u201cReid\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wagged his finger at her. \u201cNope, can\u2019t turn me down. You don\u2019t want to be responsible for crushing my fragile ego, do you?\u201d</p><p>She snorted, but slipped her hand into his and let him help her to her feet. \u201cYour ego is about as delicate as a freight train.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her closer to his side and guided her toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s just a burger, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Reid turned his truck into the drive-thru at the Burger Haven and ordered their meals. She shifted in her seat, the leather sticking to her bare legs. \u201cI thought we were going to eat here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up to the window and paid for the food, then handed her the greasy paper bags. \u201cThe grub here is good, but the ambience leaves a lot to be desired.\u201d</p><p>She snuck a fry from one of the bags and popped it in her mouth. \u201cSo where are you taking me, then?\u201d</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cMy evil lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd I thought I was a control freak. Relax. We\u2019re not going far.\u201d</p><p>Reid drove a few miles off the highway and parked next to a tree-lined pond, shutting off the engine right as the final edge of sun slipped beneath the horizon. Brynn peered out the window at the small park, its only occupant a lone goose wandering around one of the benches that lined the water\u2019s banks.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a real popular place,\u201d she said, unbuckling her seatbelt.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt is during the day. People just don\u2019t realize how cool it is at night.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the window again. Obviously, coolness was in the eye of the beholder. \u201cYeah, I bet serial killers and drug dealers find it very appealing.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a snort from him before he stepped out of the truck and came around to her side to open her door. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the food and stepped down, the warm breeze lifting her hair off the back of her neck. He grabbed her hand, his fingers interlacing with hers. She couldn\u2019t fight the smile that played around her lips. Reid was making an effort for this to feel like a date, which she appreciated. She\u2019d been out with a few guys during high school, but usually the \u201cdates\u201d consisted of hanging out at each other\u2019s houses and having awkward make-out sessions before their parents came home. Although, in her case, she always made sure she went to their place instead of bringing them to hers.</p><p>Reid placed the bags in the bed of the truck and unhitched the tailgate. \u201cHop up.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNot the best day to wear a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I was thinking it was an excellent choice.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll help you. I promise not to peek.\u201d He put his hands on her waist and hoisted her up as if she weighed nothing. The wind caught the light material and sent her skirt fluttering upward, no doubt revealing her underwear in the process. She tamped it down with her hands, but not quickly enough. Reid grinned and put a foot on the tailgate, stepping up in one fluid motion.</p><p>She punched his thigh. \u201cYou are such a liar. You totally looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, rubbing his leg and laughing. \u201cIt happened too fast. And they\u2019re pink panties. It was like a tractor beam. How am I supposed to turn away from that?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cGuys are all the same.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the truck\u2019s steel storage bin and pulled out a flannel blanket, smiling as he spread it out. \u201cWhen it comes to the chance to see up a pretty girl\u2019s skirt, you\u2019re probably right. I\u2019m sorry. Guess I shouldn\u2019t have made a promise I couldn\u2019t keep.\u201d He took the burgers and fries out of the bags, uncapped the two bottles of soda, and then patted the spot next to him. \u201cStill willing to eat with me?\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve been annoyed\u2014the wicked glint in his eyes said his apology was less than authentic. But instead, his unrepentant playfulness only drew her to him more. Even with the effect he had on her hormones, something about him put her at ease\u2014made the air around her feel lighter, the stress of the day not as daunting.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been working with him, she would\u2019ve assumed this was how Reid went through life\u2014always cracking a joke, enjoying every moment, not a care in the world. But she hadn\u2019t missed his switch in demeanor when his aunt and uncle were around. As soon as one of them walked through the office, it was as if Reid had a steel rod shoved up his back and all that easy confidence seemed to drain away.</p><p>Brynn wasn\u2019t sure which version of Reid was the real one\u2014the self-assured charmer or the wary political son. Maybe neither.</p><p>She scooted over to his side and unwrapped her sandwich. \u201cSo what\u2019s so cool about this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact that we\u2019re here?\u201d He sipped his drink and glanced at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Should start anytime now.\u201d</p><p>They ate their burgers for a few minutes, the song of the cicadas and frogs providing the only chatter. She wanted to lean into him, to know what it would feel like for him to wrap his arms around her, to taste his kiss, but she glued her butt to the spot. This was just a burger. He\u2019d said so himself. She needed to enjoy it for what it was. And even without him cuddled close, an unfamiliar feeling of contentment settled over her.</p><p>Every evening she either ate her meals on the run or in her room after she had cooked for her sister. Having someone to sit with was nice. She turned to Reid to tell him how much she appreciated him bringing her here, but a loud whooshing sound cut her off. \u201cWhat in the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Reid said, and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cLie back and look up.\u201d</p><p>She set her sandwich down and lay next to him, her gaze going to the stars. The roaring grew louder, until it was almost deafening. She winced, but just when she thought her ears couldn\u2019t take any more, the inky sky disappeared and the silver underbelly of a plane replaced it. The massive aircraft seemed as if it was going to land on top of the truck, but instead zoomed past them and touched down on a runway hidden behind the trees. The leaves around them shook and warm air gusted over her in the jet\u2019s wake.</p><p>She turned to Reid. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, his face inches from hers. \u201cAwesome, huh?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cScared the hell out of me at first, but yeah, definitely. I had no idea you could get this close.\u201d</p><p>His gaze scanned her face, pausing on her lips, tracking down her neck, then back up. \u201cYeah, the view\u2019s pretty amazing this close up.\u201d</p><p>Her body warmed under his stare, her heartbeat picking up tempo. She turned back toward the sky, hoping her voice would come out steady. \u201cSo can the people in the plane see us down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Not at night. I\u2019ve landed on this runway during the day and all you can see of the park is the pond and trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be pretty neat to see it from that perspective. I\u2019ve never been on a plane,\u201d she said, an unexpected wistfulness tingeing her tone.</p><p>He shifted onto his side, propping himself up with his elbow and looking down at her. \u201cMore of a road-trip girl?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly have room in my life for vacations.\u201d</p><p>His eyes searched hers. \u201cNo time for trips, no time for dates, what\u2019s got you so busy, Brynn LeBreck? You\u2019re not secretly working undercover for the FBI or something, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhy? You have something to hide?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in a bit, like he was going to tell her a secret. \u201cOnly that I\u2019ve got a mad crush on a girl who won\u2019t even tell me the littlest thing about herself.\u201d</p><p>The balmy notes of his voice moved over her like a caress, turning her insides liquid. She attempted a lighthearted smile. \u201cThere\u2019s just not that much to tell. I\u2019ve been going to community college for two years and am working to save money so that my sister and I can move to Austin in the fall. I have a scholarship to UT. That\u2019s about it. My life isn\u2019t exciting like yours.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cYou think my life\u2019s exciting? I go to summer school, and then play the political game for the rest of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She turned onto her side, mirroring his pose, needing to get some space between them. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to mind playing the role at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing good at something and enjoying it are two totally different things. I hate the whole song and dance of politics. Drives me nuts. I just want to tell all those people who are trying to kiss Uncle Patrick\u2019s ass via mine to fuck off. But he\u2019s done a lot for me, so I smile and shake hands like I\u2019m supposed to.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhy do you live with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the only family I have around here.\u201d A glimmer of sadness crossed his features. \u201cMy mom died of cancer when I was twelve. Aunt Roslyn took me in, and she and Patrick adopted me officially a year later. Hence, the Jamison last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Losing your mom that young had to be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t handle it so well. Gave my aunt and uncle hell for a few years. I was pretty angry at the universe. But then I realized my mom would\u2019ve kicked my ass if she saw how I was behaving, so I got my act together.\u201d The corner of his mouth tilted into a wistful smile. \u201cI wish she were still around. She was awesome\u2014really got me, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Brynn nodded, although she had no idea what it must feel like to have someone like that.</p><p>\u201cBut at least I had somewhere to go when I lost her, even if it meant dealing with all that goes along with filling the role of the Jamison son.\u201d He leaned over and tucked a stray lock of her hair behind her ear, sending goose bumps down her neck. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I like about you. You don\u2019t seem to give a damn about who my family is, so I can just relax around you.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYeah, once I found out you couldn\u2019t fire me, you lost all shot of me kissing your ass.\u201d</p><p>He slipped a hand onto her hip and pulled her closer, their bodies almost touching. \u201cSo what\u2019s your stance on kissing other things?\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in her body strained to move forward, to close the sliver of distance between them, but she held still. \u201cProbably not a good idea since we work together.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. \u201cSee, you\u2019re always such a half-empty kind of girl. Working together means we\u2019ll get paid to hang out with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everybody in the office will think I\u2019m hanging out with you for the wrong reasons.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t tell. It\u2019s none of their business anyway.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip. \u201cI like you, Reid, but I don\u2019t know... it\u2019s just complicated. I\u2019ve got a lot\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put a finger over her mouth, hushing her. \u201cStop overthinking things, Brynn. It doesn\u2019t have to be so complex. I know you don\u2019t bullshit, so I\u2019m not going to either. Since the first day I met you, I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about what it would be like to touch you.\u201d He cupped her chin and ran his thumb over her lips. \u201cTo taste you. I leave the office every day fighting a hard-on because just hearing your voice sets me off.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, the blunt words and his finger on her lips throwing gasoline on the flickering flame of longing she\u2019d been fighting since they\u2019d left the office.</p><p>\u201cSo in about three seconds, I\u2019m going to kiss you. If you don\u2019t want that, you tell me to stop, and I\u2019ll never try again.\u201d He curled his hand around the back of her neck, his gaze tattooing her. \u201cOne... two...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He leaned over and touched his lips to hers, a deceptively gentle press that, from someone else, would\u2019ve seemed sweet, innocent even. But the heated grip on the back of her neck and jolt of awareness that sizzled down her nerve endings were something else altogether. With a maddeningly slow pace, he tasted each part of her mouth\u2014the corners, the bow at the top, the line where both lips met\u2014like he was cataloguing every nuance of her skin, each flavor. She gave a little whimper of protest and he pulled back, holding her gaze for a moment. \u201cChanged your mind?\u201d</p><p>She should stop him; that\u2019d be the smart thing to do. But her hormones claimed veto power over her brain. She reached for him, gliding her fingertips over the hint of stubble on his cheek, then down his neck to his collar. She gave it a gentle tug and pulled him with her as she rolled from her side to her back. If she was going to be stupid, why do it halfway? \u201cKiss me like you want to kiss me. I can feel you holding back.\u201d</p><p>The blue in his eyes darkened as they swept over her face, her neck, lower. \u201cBe careful what you ask for, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She shivered beneath his hungry perusal. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>Something unidentifiable flickered across his features before he dipped his head and claimed her mouth again, blanketing her with his upper body. This time, there was no tentativeness, no teasing. Only white-hot rawness.</p><p>Just like in the fantasies she weaved in the privacy of her bedroom, Reid took control\u2014his kiss as unapologetic as the man himself. Commanding fingers twisted in her hair, and his tongue coaxed her lips open, exploring her mouth with an adeptness that made her ache for more of him. Her nipples tightened against the thin material of her bra at the mere thought of what Reid\u2019s talented tongue could offer them. She fisted the back of his polo shirt and arched into him.</p><p>He dragged his teeth against her lower lip and then nibbled along her jawline, making his way down to her neck. \u201cGod, you taste better than I could\u2019ve imagined... so sweet.\u201d</p><p>She writhed under his attention. The thought that he had imagined what she would taste like sent a ridiculous giddiness through her. Her voice came out in a whisper: \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about this? About me?\u201d</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cEvery fucking day, Brynn. I can\u2019t get you out of my mind. Every time you even look my way at the office, all I can think about is how bad I want you, wondering what it would be like to have you come apart beneath me.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against him, and a murmur of pleasure passed her lips before she could stop it. She\u2019d never had a guy talk so blatantly about sex, but instead of offending her, it made the throbbing between her thighs more unbearable.</p><p>He chuckled, the sound low and dark. \u201cAnd you like dirty talk. Sugar, you\u2019re going to make me lose my damn mind.\u201d</p><p>He moved lower, pressing soft kisses to her collarbone, then to the vee of skin exposed by her blouse. His fingers toyed with the first button and paused for a second, as if waiting for her to say something. When she didn\u2019t, he unfastened the top two and opened her shirt. Gentle hands caressed her over her bra, providing just enough stimulation to whet her need, but not enough to satisfy. She closed her eyes, her voice a quiet plea. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhook it for me, show me what you want,\u201d he said, his seductive tone like warm cashmere against her skin.</p><p>With clumsy fingers, she released the front clasp of her bra, baring her curves to him and the muggy night air. A lazy smile crossed his face as he cupped one of her breasts and ran a thumb across its peak. \u201cI could spend all night just focusing on these. Look how hard and pink they are for me already.\u201d</p><p>He pinched one of her nipples and rolled it between his fingertips, the sensation rocketing straight down her abdomen to the swollen bundle of nerves between her legs. She bit her lip and whimpered.</p><p>Before she could suck in another breath, the hot cavern of his mouth closed over one nipple. Tongue and teeth alternately laved and nibbled, the twining pleasure/pain combination making her back arch. She threaded her hands into his dark hair, gripping hard, trying to hold on to the shred of self-control she still had.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t this kind of girl. Despite what the high school rumor mill had said once people found out what her mother did for a living, she\u2019d only slept with one guy. But right now, she couldn\u2019t think of anything she wanted more than Reid inside her, claiming every part of her.</p><p>His head lifted as his teeth nipped her ear, his hot breath marking her neck. His hand moved to her knee and then slid up her leg at a languid pace, pulling her skirt with it. She parted her thighs, so ready for his touch she thought she would hyperventilate if he didn\u2019t get there soon.</p><p>Recognizing the invitation, he ran his palm against the outside of her panties, rubbing the soaked satin against her clit. She rocked against his touch, and he slipped his hand below the waistband, sliding his fingers along her hot button before dipping lower.</p><p>Her head tipped back, sharp darts of pleasure shooting through her. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Reid groaned and pulled his hand back.</p><p>A flutter of panic seized her. Why was he stopping? \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, lines of strain etching his face. \u201cBrynn, tell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips, her throat going dry. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t why I brought you here.\u201d He raked a hand through his dark hair. \u201cAnd because if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to strip you bare and fuck you until you scream so loud the people flying overhead will be able to hear you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are,\u201d said a booming, southern voice.</p><p>Brynn jumped at the stranger\u2019s words, scrambling to pull her top closed and her skirt down. \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d</p><p>The beam of a flashlight pierced the darkness, and Reid put a hand up to block his eyes. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>A stern, middle-aged face peered over the side of the truck. The state trooper adjusted the brim of his hat. \u201cWhat the hell do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Reid sat upright, scooting in front of Brynn. \u201cEvening, Officer. We were just, uh, having a little dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d the man said, shining the flashlight on Brynn as she fastened the last button on her shirt. \u201cI have a feeling I know what\u2019s on the menu. Do you kids know I could arrest you for indecency in a public park? Or worse.\u201d He turned his light back to Reid. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give this young lady money for her services, did you?\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cJesus, I\u2019m not a prostitute. We were just kissing.\u201d</p><p>The cop quirked an eyebrow at her. \u201cWell, then I suggest the two of you try to conduct yourselves in a more respectable manner. If I catch either of you out here again, I\u2019ll take you both in.\u201d</p><p>Reid raised his hands and gave the officer a smile that dripped with sincerity. \u201cWe are so sorry, Officer. It won\u2019t happen again. We\u2019ll get right on out of here. Thank you for letting us by with a warning.\u201d</p><p>The cop grunted and crossed his arms over his chest. Waiting.</p><p>They hurriedly gathered their things and climbed into the cab of the truck. Brynn\u2019s cheeks burned so hot, she was sure she had turned a shade of purple. God, how had she let that get so out of hand? She\u2019d never lost control like that with anyone. One kiss and she\u2019d been ready to screw Reid until the sun came up. All the reasons of why a relationship with him was a terrible idea had evaporated from her mind the instant his lips had touched hers. Dangerous.</p><p>Reid merged onto the highway and after a long stretch of silence, cleared his throat. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just a little embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a rueful smile. \u201cSorry about what happened.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look out the window, afraid that he\u2019d be able to read her thoughts on her face. \u201cNot your fault. I\u2019m just glad he didn\u2019t take us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. I can\u2019t even imagine how happy the media would\u2019ve been over that\u2014candidate\u2019s nephew gets arrested for public indecency. My aunt and uncle would\u2019ve had a shit fit.\u201d</p><p>She stared out the window as cars whizzed by, feeling like she was in some alternate universe. Reid\u2019s biggest worry about an arrest was media coverage; hers was that she\u2019d have no one to post bail to get her out. The contrast would\u2019ve been laughable if it wasn\u2019t so damn depressing.</p><p>He reached out and gave her hand a quick squeeze. \u201cI promise less mortification and threat of arrest on our next date.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned against the headrest, hoping he would take the hint she didn\u2019t want to talk. She\u2019d thought that maybe she\u2019d be able to keep it light and have a little fun, but an hour alone with Reid and she\u2019d been ready to lose herself. Something she couldn\u2019t afford to do with someone like him. She couldn\u2019t tell him right now, but no matter how much she liked him, there would be no second date.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Reid ordered another coffee and dumped some salsa on his huevos rancheros while Detective Will Green examined the papers Reid had given him. Reid knew not to bother the man once he\u2019d retreated into the zone\u2014that place where cops go when trying to put all the pieces together. But he couldn\u2019t help but watch every tick of the cop\u2019s expression, hoping Will saw as much potential in the documents as he had.</p><p>One refill and a clean plate later, the detective looked up, lines of frustration cutting into his dark skin. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>Reid dodged the question, not ready to tell the detective he\u2019d found the ledger\u2014via illegal search\u2014in a hollowed out dictionary in Kelsey\u2019s nightstand. \u201cKelsey, the vic\u2019s youngest daughter, contacted Hank about the evidence a few days ago. I think she found it when she went through some of her mother\u2019s old things. I just got ahold of it last night, but from what I can tell, the ledger lists all of the victim\u2019s client appointments and payments going back two years before her death. Including a big transaction scheduled for the day she was killed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, I saw that. Not sure what a hooker could do to warrant a twenty-five-thousand-dollar fee. No lay is that good.\u201d</p><p>Reid gave him a humorless smile. \u201cCelia LeBreck used to work in the high-end strip clubs. Not until after she had her second child did she start turning tricks on the street. Maybe she still had connections to someone she met in her glory days.\u201d He pointed at the photocopies he\u2019d made of Celia\u2019s appointment book. \u201cThis J. Kennedy person listed on the last day. He\u2019s in there a number of times before that, but only for a thousand bucks at a time.\u201d</p> <p>Will\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMaybe she had something on him and was upping the ante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Reid said, nodding. \u201cAnd maybe he didn\u2019t want to pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis definitely throws suspicion away from your client. I never did believe that kid was the guy, but I don\u2019t know if this is enough to get you an appeal.\u201d The detective stared at the copies again, rubbing his chin. \u201cUnless we can figure out her code and actually get some solid suspects. Every name in here is a fake one.\u201d</p><p>Reid sank back in the booth and sighed. \u201cYeah. J. Kennedy, C. Eastwood, S. Poitier, A. Lincoln. All celebrities or historical figures. Smart lady\u2014protecting her ass and her clients.\u201d</p><p>The waitress stopped by and refilled Will\u2019s coffee cup. He dumped a few packets of sugar in and stirred, the contemplative look crossing his face again. \u201cMy guess would be that she didn\u2019t pick the names randomly. If this was her way of keeping people straight, she probably had some reason to assign each name. Like Sidney Poitier probably isn\u2019t a young white guy.\u201d</p> <p>Reid nodded. \u201cRight. And she may have let clients pick their own code names as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Kelsey any help with who the names belonged to?\u201d he asked, sipping his coffee.</p><p>Reid shifted in the booth. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t exactly been able to talk to her about it.\u201d</p><p>Will nailed him with shrewd eyes. \u201cYou have her evidence, but haven\u2019t talked to her? How\u2019s that work, Counselor?\u201d</p><p>Reid cleared his throat. \u201cUm, well, I sort of had the opportunity to get this from Kelsey\u2019s apartment... without consent.\u201d</p><p>Will titled his head back as if he were going to shout at the heavens. \u201cJamison, what the fuck? I know this case has eaten at you, but you\u2019re breaking and entering now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that. I got ahold of a key from the other daughter. She just didn\u2019t know my intentions.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cStill makes the evidence inadmissible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless Kelsey agrees to give it to me, which I think she would do\u2014if I could find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where she is?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his eyes, the all-nighter starting to catch up with him. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of disappeared. She called her sister last night and then never showed up to meet her.\u201d</p><p>His pissed-off expression switched to concern. \u201cUh-oh. You think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Kelsey doesn\u2019t have the best track record. She\u2019s got a drug history and from what I gather, a habit of being flighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she doesn\u2019t show up by the forty-eight-hour mark, her sister needs to report her missing\u2014just to be safe. Although with the overload at the department, I don\u2019t know how much focus it will get.\u201d Will frowned and added even more sugar to his cup, as if the sweetener could make the bitter situation easier to swallow. \u201cThat girl was still living at home when all this went down. She\u2019s the only one who may have a shot at identifying some of the people behind these names. Without her and her permission to admit this ledger as evidence, you ain\u2019t got shit.\u201d</p> <p>Acid burned in his stomach. \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>This case had ruined Reid\u2019s reputation and had continued to keep him up at night. There was no way he was going to let such potentially explosive evidence go by the wayside. No, he needed to find Kelsey and find her fast.</p><p>Reid\u2019s cell phone vibrated against the table, and he picked it up to check the caller ID. Ah, just who he needed to talk to. He plunked a few bills on the table and slid out of the booth. \u201cWill, I gotta take this. Thanks for your help. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He lifted his coffee cup in salute. \u201cHope you find your girl, Counselor.\u201d</p><p>A bloodcurdling scream wretched Brynn from the depths of sleep, and she jolted upright, nearly hurling herself off her living room couch. She glanced around frantically, her chest heaving with choppy breaths, but found nothing amiss in her sunlit living room.</p><p>She sank back against the arm of the couch and put her hand to her sweat-slicked neck, the rawness in her throat confirming where the scream came from. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had a nightmare in over a month and had dared to hope she was past them. But the blanket twisted around her legs and her pounding heart confirmed otherwise. She rubbed her eyes with her hands, the familiar images from the awful dream seeping through now that her mind was fully awake.</p><p>Unwanted hands. Being trapped. Darkness. Flashes of the always-faceless rapist now mixing with the image of the man who\u2019d attacked her in Kelsey\u2019s stairwell.</p><p>She released a groan of frustration and threw the blanket off her. \u201cI am so sick of this shit.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to holler the words, throw something through the sunny window, shake her fists at the fates. But she knew none of it would do any good. And right now, she didn\u2019t have time to bellyache about her own problems.</p><p>She glanced at the clock on her DVD player. Right past noon. She\u2019d stayed up all night, calling Kelsey\u2019s friends, the clubs she\u2019d worked at in the past, hospitals, and even put in a message with her police contact. But so far, she didn\u2019t have squat and was at a loss as to what her next step should be.</p><p>Pound the pavement to talk to people in person? Report her missing?</p><p>She shook her head. Part of her wished she could just shrug the whole thing off and chalk it up to Kelsey being irresponsible. But she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was really wrong. Why wouldn\u2019t Kels have called her or left a note, something? She\u2019d sounded really freaked out on the phone. Was she using again? Was that what this was about? She hoped to God that wasn\u2019t the case. Last time her sister had gone on a bender she\u2019d nearly killed herself.</p><p>The memory clenched Brynn\u2019s chest in a vise grip. Kelsey was the only family she had left. If she lost her...</p><p>She gave herself a mental shake and took a breath. No. She wouldn\u2019t go there. Would. Not.</p><p>She grabbed her cell phone off the coffee table and checked the screen. No messages. With a sigh, she leaned forward to set it back down, but it rang in her hand. The sudden noise made her jump, but she had the phone to her ear in record time.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Reid. Even after ten years, he apparently didn\u2019t feel the need to say who it was. Like he knew she\u2019d be able to identify his voice from any other man\u2019s. She could. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word from your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s seen her or heard from her. I\u2019m running out of people to call. What about you? Did you find out anything?\u201d</p><p>Papers shuffled, like he was turning the page of a notebook. \u201cI talked to someone who\u2019s a member and found out that The Ranch does hire attendants and pays them well. A person gets a bonus of ten grand when he or she completes the intense training program, which apparently involves a few weeks of total immersion in each side of the D/s relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no kidding. It could be pretty tempting for someone like Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her legs beneath her. \u201cSo how do I find out if she\u2019s taken a job there?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. The place is like Fort Knox. The only way you\u2019re going to find out is if you go there yourself and look for her. My friend said he could probably get you in as a guest.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cHow would that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t allow doms to come in as guests, only as full members, so your only option is to go in as a sexual submissive. You would have to be willing to submit to a member.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into the twisted blanket on the couch, the material still damp from her sweat-inducing nightmare. A bone-deep shudder went through her. \u201cReid, I don\u2019t... I can\u2019t... do that.\u201d</p><p>The line went quiet, and she wondered if the call had dropped, but then he took a breath. \u201cI could go with you. Save you the stranger part.\u201d</p><p>Her throat seemed to close. Not just submit, but submit to Reid? The idea sent her brain and body into a tailspin. Her gaze darted to the picture on her side table\u2014the last one she and her sister had taken with their mom. Before the murder. Before the trial. Anger stirred in her belly.</p><p>\u201cBrynn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she bit out, her voice finally returning. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cCalm down, LeBreck. It was just an idea. If you\u2019d rather hand yourself over to some stranger, I\u2019m sure there will be many at The Ranch happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, bile burning the back of her throat. No way would she survive either of his suggestions. \u201cLet me make a few more calls. I\u2019ll let you know if I need your friend\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d I even bother?\u201d Brynn hung up her office phone and rubbed her forehead, a piercing headache hatching behind her eyes. Two days with hardly any sleep, and her body was no longer responding to caffeine.</p><p>A light tap on her open door made her lift her gaze. Mel stepped into her office, lines of concern creasing her forehead. \u201cStill no word from your sister?\u201d</p><p>Brynn shook her head. \u201cI just keep calling her like all of a sudden she\u2019s going to come to her senses and answer her phone.\u201d</p><p>Mel plopped into the chair across from Brynn\u2019s desk. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>Brynn sighed, her shoulders sagging. \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019ve talked to everyone I can think of, and I can\u2019t even officially report her missing to the police until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Reid\u2019s friend? Have you given any more thought to trying to get into that resort? Sounds like a good lead.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach flipped over. \u201cMel, I don\u2019t know if I could pull that off. I thought I was past all this crap. I did the therapy, took the self-defense classes, but the minute that guy put his hands on me the other night, the panic sucked me in. I was completely useless.\u201d</p><p>Mel eyed her for a long moment, and Brynn could almost hear the gears grinding in her friend\u2019s head.</p><p>Brynn pursed her lips. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...\u201d Mel said, then waved her hand. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Brynn said, shaking her head. \u201cJust say whatever it is you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve ever held back before.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and straightened the papers in Brynn\u2019s outbox, adeptly avoiding eye contact. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just, maybe this is exactly what you need, you know? Exposure therapy.\u201d</p><p>Brynn stared at Mel as if her friend had sprouted antlers. \u201cAre you being serious? Exposure therapy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, but still didn\u2019t raise her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think turning myself over to some stranger\u2019s sexual demands is a bit of an extreme prescription? I was raped, Mel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to kick a fear of spiders or something.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, B. I\u2019m not trying to minimize what you\u2019ve been through. I just wish I could help you get past it. Exposure therapy is brutal, but you know it can be effective.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Brynn waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI already did the protocol with a therapist where I went through a retelling. The exposure stuff hasn\u2019t worked. It didn\u2019t even get the nightmares to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperiencing the memory in the counselor\u2019s office isn\u2019t the same as putting yourself in your most feared situation. And it wouldn\u2019t be like getting raped again. They have rules at places like that. You could make the person stop at any time.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn pinched the bridge of her nose, the pounding in her head getting worse. \u201cMel, I love you, but you\u2019re talking crazy. Not only does the whole idea make me feel like I\u2019m going to puke, but I\u2019m not going to hand my body over to some stranger who gets off on hitting women. I spend all day working with my clients trying to get them away from men like that.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDominance and abuse are two totally different things. You and I both know that.\u201d</p><p>Brynn quirked an eyebrow. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re speaking from experience.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, and then focused on picking invisible lint off her black pants. \u201cI may have gone to one of those kink clubs once during grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me? What sort of roommate leaves that kind of choice information out? I told you everything that was going on with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, like that was so scandalous,\u201d she said, looking up and smirking. \u201cYou were dating an accounting major for God\u2019s sake. I didn\u2019t want to freak you out. And anyway, I just went for research purposes. I didn\u2019t actually participate in anything.\u201d</p><p>Brynn propped her elbows on her desk and placed her chin in her hands. \u201cSo what exactly did you do if you didn\u2019t join in?\u201d</p><p>Melody rolled her eyes. \u201cDuh. Watched.\u201d</p><p>Brynn leaned back in her chair. \u201cOh, hell, I hadn\u2019t even thought about that part. Even if I had the guts to try to get in the club, I forgot about the fact that others could see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\u201d Mel\u2019s voice took on a saucy tone. \u201cSome people find it exciting to be watched. You never know, you may be an exhibitionist under that good-girl facade.\u201d</p><p>A long-dormant memory tickled the back of Brynn\u2019s mind, making her cheeks heat. Her best friend had no idea how, once upon at time, she\u2019d been far from angelic. She cleared her throat. \u201cSounds like my personal nightmare, not a fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>Mel gave her a sympathetic smile. \u201cFair enough. Just know I\u2019m not trying to tell you what to do, hon. You need to figure out what feels right for you.\u201d She stood and gave Brynn\u2019s hand a quick squeeze. \u201cBut either way, Kelsey is lucky to have a sister who still cares enough to worry about her. A lot of people would\u2019ve given up on her a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s words hung in the air long after her friend stepped out, wracking Brynn with guilt. Mel was wrong. Her sister was far from lucky. The only person in the world who cared about her was sitting on her ass in her office too scared of her own demons to try to help. A useless coward.</p><p>She pressed the heels of her hands to her forehead, turning Mel\u2019s suggestion over in her mind again. Exposure therapy. Full immersion in her fear. The idea sounded padded-cell crazy, but what if her friend was right? What if the only way she was ever going to get past this was to jump off the proverbial cliff and plunge into her nightmare?</p><p>She was so tired. Tired of being scared. Tired of waking up in a cold sweat. Tired of letting what some monster did dictate so much of her life.</p><p>Maybe this was the answer. God knows nothing else had worked.</p><p>Her phone rang, startling her from her thoughts. She fumbled for the receiver. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, it\u2019s Tony Flores.\u201d</p><p>Her contact with the police department. Thank God. \u201cHey, Tony.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m just getting back to you, but I had to check on a few things before I talked to you. Do you have a minute?\u201d</p><p>She sat up straighter at the cop\u2019s grim tone. She worked with Tony regularly for her clients\u2019 domestic violence cases, and knew he only reserved that tone for bad news. \u201cOf course, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get your message until last night, but I ran your sister\u2019s name through the system to make sure she hadn\u2019t been arrested or hadn\u2019t gotten in an accident or something. And I didn\u2019t find either of those to be the case, but her name did pop up under something else.\u201d</p><p>Her grip on the phone tightened. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday night we got called out to work an assault. Guy by the name of Nick Camden got himself beat up pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s on-again-off-again boyfriend. The knot of anxiety in her stomach grew larger.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the report, the paramedics said your sister showed up a few minutes after the attack, running late to meet Nick. They asked her to wait for us to get there so we could talk to her, but she bailed before our officers arrived. Nick didn\u2019t see his attacker, but he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s Raymond Miller, one of the big dealers in the area. Dangerous guy.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cNick told us your sister owes this guy a lot of money. He thinks she was the intended target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d She sank back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from your sister yet?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not answering her phone, and I\u2019ve called everyone I can think of. No one has a clue where she is.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh. \u201cLook, we have our guys trailing this Miller guy. He drove by your sister\u2019s apartment this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s still looking for her?\u201d The thought sent goose bumps across her skin.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cThe good news is he doesn\u2019t seem to know where she\u2019s hiding out. The bad news is we don\u2019t know where to find her either. We want to offer her some protection if she\u2019s willing to cooperate with us. We believe she has vital information that could put this guy behind bars. But we can\u2019t do anything until we get a hold of her, and I don\u2019t have the manpower to hunt her down. Unfortunately, Miller might.\u201d</p><p>Brynn pinched the bridge of her nose once more. Kelsey cooperate with the police? Not likely. After their mother\u2019s murder and Hank\u2019s arrest, she\u2019d developed quite an aversion to the boys and girls in blue. No wonder her sister had run off. She was hiding from the bad guys and the good guys.</p><p>\u201cTony, I promise I\u2019ll keep doing what I can to find her and will let you know if I hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Brynn. And I\u2019ll call you if I have any news on this end. Just be careful poking around. You don\u2019t want to end up on this guy\u2019s radar, too. Lie low.\u201d</p><p>Another thought hit her. \u201cWait, one more thing. Did Nick happen to say how much Kelsey owed this guy?\u201d</p><p>The clicking of a keyboard, then: \u201cLooks like somewhere in the neighborhood of ten or fifteen grand.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted back against her chair, the conclusion she\u2019d spent the last day and a half trying to deny taking shape. Shit. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone with a trembling hand and sucked in a few long, steadying breaths to quell the adrenaline rushing through her. She knew what she had to do. For her sister, and hell, maybe for herself, too. The only question was if she could actually do it without having a total mental breakdown in the process.</p><p>She stared at her desk calendar, the names of the women she counseled staring back at her. Women who she encouraged to take charge of their situations, to tackle their fears, to stand on their own feet and claim their lives.</p><p>She was such a goddamned hypocrite.</p><p>Her fists clenched and something strong and steely wrapped around the ball of fear in her chest, stifling its hold on her and straightening her spine.</p><p>Without giving herself time to reconsider, she stepped around her desk and headed out of her office. One foot in front of the other. The steady clicking of her heels against the linoleum and her pounding heartbeat the only things filling her head. She didn\u2019t stop until she had knocked on his office door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Reid called, and she pushed open the door. He glanced up from a box of files on his desk. Despite the temporary truce they\u2019d forged over the weekend, she had avoided him after the obligatory greeting at the communal coffee pot that morning. If he was surprised to see her, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Brynn squared her shoulders, trying to hold on to her newfound determination and ignore the swirl of emotions the lawyer incited in her. Seeing Reid on a daily basis was going to take some getting used to. Why couldn\u2019t he have lost all his hair and sprouted man boobs by now? Then, she could just focus on hating him and wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the attraction that seemed burned into her DNA. \u201cAll moved in?\u201d</p><p>He tapped the box in front of him. \u201cLast one to sort through.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and folded her arms across her chest, lingering in the doorway, anxiety leaking into her system again. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a few files from the box and set them on the desk. \u201cAny new leads?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Kelsey\u2019s at The Ranch. I talked to my friend at the police department and found out Kels owes a lot of money to a local dealer. They think he\u2019s after her to pay up.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWell, The Ranch would be a great place to hide, especially if she\u2019s looking to make some cash quickly.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her throat threatening to close. Her flight response was kicking in just thinking about asking the question. Dammit. Get it together, Brynn. She reached for the doorjamb to hold herself steady.</p><p>His blue eyes evaluated her, and his mouth sunk into a deeper frown. Before she could force out a word, he rose from his chair and crossed the room, his focus never leaving her face. She wondered</p><p>if he was going to embrace her, ward off the panic. The thought seemed both appealing and abhorrent all at the same time.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t hug her. Instead, he slipped his hand into the inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out a small white card. When she didn\u2019t make a move to take it, he grabbed her hand and with a gentle pressure uncurled her fist. He placed the card in her palm. \u201cI told my friend to expect you around eight tonight.\u201d</p><p>She lifted Reid\u2019s business card, flipped it over, and read the handwritten address. \u201cBut how did you know to make an appointment? I hadn\u2019t even decided to do it.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cTen years may have passed, Brynn, but I still know you.\u201d</p><p>Anger at his knowing glance chased away the burgeoning panic. \u201cWhat? That I\u2019m a girl who willingly jumps in bed with anyone?\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened. \u201cNo, I was going to say because I know how protective you are of your sister. But maybe your assessment is more accurate.\u201d</p><p>She flexed her fingers, wishing that she\u2019d taken the kickboxing class instead of the self-defense one because punching Reid\u2019s smug face would have been so satisfying. But she really didn\u2019t need to get fired for interoffice violence on top of her already shitty day. \u201cScrew you, Reid.\u201d</p><p>He smirked, tilting his head closer as if he were going to share a secret. \u201cYou already did that, sugar. And from what I remember, you loved every minute of it. All you have to do is ask and I\u2019ll come along with you.\u201d</p><p>Heat rushed to her cheeks, but her tone turned icy. \u201cDon\u2019t misconstrue my appreciation for your help this weekend with forgiveness. You lost the right to touch me a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He rocked back on his heels and tucked his hands in his pockets. \u201cGood luck with your stranger, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>Your stranger. Her lunch threatened to make an encore appearance, and she turned on her heel, striding away before Reid could see how much he\u2019d gotten to her.</p><p>SIX</p><p>then</p><p>Brynn flinched as Davis Ackerman slammed his fist on his desk, a strand of perfectly gelled hair falling across his forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cDammit, Brynn. How could you leave the governor on hold that long?\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her skirt, worrying the hem between her fingers and wishing\u2014not for the first time\u2014that she worked directly for Reid\u2019s uncle and not for the power-happy campaign manager. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I... um... I had an emergency call on the other line. I got distracted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat call could possibly be more important? He\u2019s the goddamn governor!\u201d Davis\u2019s face turned the color of the cinnamon gum he incessantly chewed.</p><p>Tears brimmed her eyes, but she blinked them back. Explaining to him that her sister had called her in hysterics a minute after she thought she\u2019d transferred the governor\u2019s call would not win her any points. She cleared her throat. \u201cI promise it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d he said, rising from his chair, his hand still clasping a copy of the e-mail the governor had sent to him about sitting on hold so long he\u2019d hung up. \u201cI know Patrick has taken a liking to you, but this kind of thing will not be excused. No more mistakes, Ms. LeBreck.\u201d</p><p>She breathed an inner sigh of relief. Thank God. No pink slip today. She nodded and stood. \u201cYes, sir, I understand. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She yanked open the office door and escaped in such a hurry she didn\u2019t notice Reid until she barreled into him. A stack of papers dropped from his hands. \u201cWhoa, there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said, sinking to her knees to gather the mess. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He knelt next to her and laid a hand over hers, stilling her frantic pace. \u201cHey, chill. It\u2019s okay. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to meet his gaze and died a little when a hot tear slid down her cheek. No, please, not in front of him. She wiped the moisture from her face and pulled her other hand from beneath his. \u201cI\u2019m fine, just in a rush.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the closed door behind her. \u201cDid Davis upset you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and straightened the documents into a neat stack before handing them to Reid. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I made a mistake, and he was talking to me about it.\u201d</p><p>Reid stood and set the papers onto a nearby desk, his blue eyes narrowing. \u201cMore like yelling. I could hear him from across the office. God, that guy can be such a prick sometimes. He thinks just because he landed a management position at thirty he can piss on everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>She walked past him and grabbed her purse from underneath the reception desk. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I deserved it. I shouldn\u2019t have messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up.\u201d He caught up to her and grasped her shoulder, spinning her to face him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what mistake you made. You never deserve to be yelled at.\u201d</p><p>His touch burned through the thin material of her blouse, and the worry in his eyes made her want to cry again. She shrugged out of his reach. She would not let Reid see her shed tears. And she certainly wasn\u2019t going to tell him why Davis yelling was the least of her worries at the moment.</p><p>She had managed to maintain her friendship with Reid, even while dodging his repeated invitations for a second date. She refused to ruin it by letting him see who she really was. \u201cI appreciate your concern, really. But I\u2019m fine. And I have to go. I have a bit of a family emergency to deal with.\u201d</p><p>She hurried past him and headed for the exit door. Home. She needed to get home. Kelsey had blubbered through most of the conversation. But Brynn had gotten the gist. And she wasn\u2019t looking forward to what she would face when she arrived.</p><p>She climbed into her \u201988 Chevy and turned the ignition, but the engine didn\u2019t fire. She gritted her teeth and twisted the key again. Nothing. Not even a click. The damn car wasn\u2019t even trying to start. She banged her fists against the steering wheel, the tears finally escaping. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die on me now?\u201d</p><p>A sharp tap on the window made her jump. Reid peered in and mouthed, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>God, couldn\u2019t a girl get a moment alone to wallow? She grabbed a tissue from her purse and dried her face before shoving open the door. She climbed out and forced a smile. \u201cEver have one of those days where you wish you had just stayed under the covers?\u201d</p> <p>He grasped her elbow and pulled her into an all-encompassing hug, the sudden contact stunning her into silence.</p><p>Her first instinct was to pull back. For the last few weeks, she had carefully avoided touching Reid again, protecting herself from the internal longing she knew his touch would incite. But the warmth of his embrace was too delicious to reject. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time anyone had really hugged her. He smoothed her hair, and for a few luxurious seconds, she let her cheek rest against his solid chest.</p><p>He sat his chin on top of her head. \u201cWhatever it is, sugar, let me help.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, inhaling his cologne, imprinting the feel of him on her brain so that she could access the memory later. She slipped from his hold and stepped back. \u201cI don\u2019t need help.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the powder blue heap behind her. \u201cI could call you a tow truck.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t afford to pay for a tow or for anyone to fix it once it got to the garage anyway. \u201cUm, no, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get a friend to come take a look at it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans. \u201cWell, then I\u2019ll give you a ride home.\u201d</p><p>She cringed inwardly. No way was she letting him see where she lived, much less witness what would greet her when she got there. He\u2019d either be appalled or, worse, feel sorry for her. The thought turned her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take the bus, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and crooked a thumb toward the shiny black pickup behind him. \u201cGet in the truck, Brynn. You said you have a family emergency. If that\u2019s the truth, then you don\u2019t need to waste time on the bus. Stop being so hardheaded.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips, ready to tell him to shove off, but then remembered the frantic edge in her sister\u2019s voice. Her shoulders sagged as she said a silent good-bye to the friendship she and Reid shared. Once he saw who she really was, he\u2019d bail like all her other friends always did. She gave him a dejected nod and followed him to his truck.</p><p>When she told him her address, she expected a raised eyebrow, but his face remained stoic. \u201cI know where that is.\u201d</p><p>They rode in silence, the muscles in Reid\u2019s forearms flexing as he gripped the steering wheel. Clearly, she had done something to annoy him, but she didn\u2019t have the energy for conversation. Instead, she stared out the window, watching the state of the neighborhoods decline as they passed each exit\u2014from upper class to barely getting by in a mere fifteen miles.</p><p>By the time Reid pulled into the driveway of her family\u2019s shoddy rental, she was burning with embarrassment. She grabbed the cool metal of door handle and didn\u2019t dare look at him. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>The automatic locks clicked, preventing her from escaping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I know everything\u2019s all right.\u201d His tone brooked no argument.</p><p>She bit her lip, not knowing what to think of this version of Reid. The power that radiated off him made her insides twist with an emotion she couldn\u2019t pinpoint. She took a steadying breath. \u201cOkay, stay out here. I\u2019ll come back out and let you know if I need you or not.\u201d</p><p>He stretched an arm across the back of the seat, as if settling in for the wait, and nodded.</p><p>After disengaging the lock, she scooted out of the truck and said a silent prayer as she pushed open the front door. The small puddle of blood on the vinyl tile of the entryway and the sound of soft sobbing sent panic through her. She dropped her purse and ran for the kitchen. Her fourteen-year-old sister\u2019s tear-stained face lit with relief when she saw Brynn. \u201cOhmigod, what took you so long? She wouldn\u2019t let me call 911.\u201d</p><p>Brynn turned toward the kitchen table. Her mother sat slumped in one of the chairs, her head resting against the back wall, one eye swollen shut.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Ma, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She lifted her head and peered at Brynn with her good eye. \u201cIs that you, baby?\u201d</p><p>Brynn groaned at the slurred words and knelt in front of her mom to check her over. Her low-cut top had been torn slightly at the vee and finger-shaped bruises marked her upper arms. The puffiness around her eye was already turning a sickly shade of purple. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d her sister asked, wrapping her arms around herself.</p><p>Brynn frowned. Kelsey was a tough kid, but no one should have to see their own mother like this. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, Kels. Thanks for calling. I\u2019m sorry I got stuck late at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d she said, shifting from one flip-flop to the other. \u201cI was supposed to sleep at Becca\u2019s tonight \u2019cause we have a school project to work on, but I didn\u2019t want to leave until you got here. I can stay and help if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs her mom going to be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And she said she\u2019d drive us both to school in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Brynn cocked her head toward the back door. \u201cGo ahead. Just ring the phone when you get there so I know you arrived safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her shoulders noticeably relaxing. \u201cOkay, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only be three doors down. I\u2019ll come get you if I need you, all right? Go get your stuff.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey turned to head to her room, then yelped.</p><p>Reid put his hands up as he filled the doorway. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d He looked at Brynn. \u201cI was getting worried out there.\u201d</p><p>Brynn glanced from Reid to her mother to the stack of empty liquor bottles on top of the counter.</p><p>Now he knew. She wanted to fold in on herself and disappear.</p><p>Reid tried to keep his expression flat as he took in the scene. He didn\u2019t know what he had expected to find when he\u2019d barged into Brynn\u2019s place, but finding her with a bloodied and bruised woman had not been it.</p><p>Brynn turned her back to him but not quick enough for him to miss the horrified expression on her face. She grabbed a cloth off the table and patted beneath the woman\u2019s nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot you were waiting. We\u2019re fine. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>Reid moved out of the way as the younger blonde, Brynn\u2019s little sister he presumed, hurried past him. He shoved his hands in his pockets and took a breath. \u201cWhat I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders dipped as if she were carrying sandbags on them, but she didn\u2019t turn to look at him. \u201cJust leave. Please.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like that was going to happen. For the last few weeks, he had let Brynn get away with her casual rebuffs and subtle distancing. He had deserved it after the way he\u2019d lost control on their first date. But he\u2019d be damned if he was going to let her push him away from something like this. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She swung her head around, her eyes filling with tears and her face red with shame. \u201cCan\u2019t you take a hint? You\u2019re making this worse. I don\u2019t want you to be here to see this.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed. I just want to help you.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I\u2019ve been handling my mother for years, I\u2019m a pro. So why don\u2019t you leave, pretend you never saw this, and I\u2019ll see you at work. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her request, Reid turned and walked to the refrigerator, then pulled open the freezer door. Except for the three cheap bottles of vodka, the contents were slim, but he found what he was looking for. He brought a bag of frozen corn back to Brynn. \u201cPut this on her eye, it will help with the swelling. Does it seem like anything\u2019s broken?\u201d</p><p>Brynn took the bag and stared at him for a long moment before standing up and placing it on her mother\u2019s black eye. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cDo you think she needs to go to a doctor or the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll refuse to see either.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cOkay, then why don\u2019t we get her somewhere she can rest and sleep it off?\u201d</p><p>Brynn sighed and stood. She gave her mother\u2019s shoulder a soft squeeze. \u201cMa, I\u2019m going to help you get up and walk to your bedroom, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her mother reached up and patted Brynn\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks, baby.\u201d</p><p>Reid went around the opposite side from Brynn and gently grabbed her mother\u2019s upper arm to help her to her feet. She stumbled a bit, but managed to stand with their assistance. With slow, steady steps they led her out of the kitchen and down the narrow hallway. Brynn bumped open one of the doors with her elbow.</p><p>The room was barely bigger than the closet in Reid\u2019s own bedroom and looked way too neat to belong to a woman who was clearly out of control. He wondered if Brynn had led him to her own bedroom to protect herself from more embarrassment.</p> <p>Brynn pulled back the sheets, and the two of them helped her mother to sit on the edge of the bed. She bent down and slipped off her mom\u2019s heels, then placed them on a rack in the closet. Reid frowned. This wasn\u2019t Brynn\u2019s room, but apparently she played maid to her mother along with everything else.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d said a slurred voice.</p><p>Reid turned to see her mother squinting at him with her uninjured eye.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYour daughter\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hurried to her mother\u2019s side and shot him a withering look. \u201cCome on, Ma, let\u2019s get you into your nightgown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll only break your heart,\u201d she said. \u201cCheating bastards\u2014all of \u2019em. Believe you me. They all do it eventually. I\u2019d be broke otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are broke,\u201d Brynn muttered, and glanced at Reid. \u201cI\u2019m going to get her changed. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped into the hallway, shutting the door behind him. As he made his way back to the living room, his heart broke for the girl who had quickly become the sole focus of his days. No wonder she didn\u2019t have time for a burger. She was taking care of everyone around her. He sank into the well-worn couch and ran a hand over his face.</p><p>After his last date with Brynn, he\u2019d thought she might be the girl he could share his secret with, but now he knew he had to keep his lips sewn shut. The last thing she needed was to hear about his sordid fantasies. Her opinion of men had already been warped enough.</p><p>No, what Brynn needed was a hero\u2014a guy who would treat her with the respect no one showed her mother. The only question was, did he have enough self-control to be that guy?</p><p>Brynn clicked her mother\u2019s door shut and took a moment to gather herself before facing Reid. She didn\u2019t want to discuss what had happened, but she couldn\u2019t just kick the guy out with no explanation after he\u2019d been decent enough to help. She smoothed the creases in her black pants, straightened her shoulders, and walked toward the living room.</p><p>Reid was sitting forward on the couch, forearms on knees, and his mouth in a grim line. His black tailored shirt and expensive jeans looked out of place against the faded flower pattern of their secondhand furniture. He looked up when she sank into the love seat. \u201cGot her in bed okay?\u201d</p><p>Brynn kicked off her heels and tucked her legs beneath her. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s already out. Thanks for helping me get her to her room. I\u2019m beyond embarrassed that you saw all of this.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed, the sound holding no humor. \u201cFine? Yeah, I\u2019m sure this is exactly how you spend your evenings\u2014cleaning up an alcoholic after one of her dates decides she didn\u2019t do enough to earn her money.\u201d</p><p>Deep frown lines etched his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell her you were my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt just came out. I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019d like to be.\u201d</p><p>Brynn groaned. \u201cYou must be a masochist. Look around, Reid. This is my life. I\u2019m not like the other girls at the office. I have a lot going on and hopefully am leaving for college in a few months.\u201d</p><p>His brows dipped. \u201cLeaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that on our first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but how are you going to do that with all that\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m busting my ass with overtime at work. I\u2019m going to get an apartment and take Kelsey with me\u2014file for guardianship.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see what I mean? You need to go find some chick like Molly or Krista who can go and do all the fun things people our age are supposed to be doing. I\u2019m not that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, \u2019cause those airheads at the office are awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I mean, look, one evening with me and I bet I\u2019ve completely messed up your plans. Isn\u2019t Thursday college night at all the bars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome \u2019ere,\u201d he said, motioning for her. Reluctantly, she rose and stepped closer to him. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down to his lap before she could protest. \u201cI don\u2019t want some chick. I want you. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. The thought of having Reid, of affording herself that little luxury for a few months, was so tempting. But their worlds existed on different orbits. \u201cI like you, Reid. I just don\u2019t know how anything between us could work. You have political mixers and frat parties, I have a household to run and now, apparently, crime scene cleanup. There\u2019s no way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, smoothing her hair. \u201cStop overanalyzing everything. Don\u2019t you ever shut off that busy brain and let yourself feel what you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhat about that night in my truck? You seemed like you were able to let go a bit. Weren\u2019t you acting on feelings then?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cWell, yeah. I don\u2019t get half-naked for guys as a personal hobby. Of course I felt something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was different?\u201d</p><p>She thought back to that night\u2014the confident way he had touched her, the dirty talk, the way his kiss had made her senseless. She shifted in his lap, suddenly very aware of how close they were, and dropped her focus to her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You took control, I guess. I didn\u2019t have to make any decisions for a change, and it was kind of a relief.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger under her chin and tilted her face toward him. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we try that again? You stop worrying, we\u2019ll order pizza and hang out tonight. You won\u2019t have to decide on anything except meat lovers or vegetarian. Although, if you pick vegetarian, I may rethink this whole wanting to be your boyfriend thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you had plans tonight. I don\u2019t need a pity parade.\u201d</p><p>He curled a lock of her hair around his finger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about pity. I want to be with you and it\u2019s you who keeps coming up with excuses to get rid of me. I\u2019m going to develop a complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You look crushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Shattered, really. So to help me recover, you\u2019re going to get on that phone and order us a pizza. Then we\u2019re going to relax, forget the previous few hours, and watch some horrible made-for-TV movie.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, unable to maintain her foul mood around him. \u201cSo now I\u2019m the pizza wench?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the phone sitting on the side table. \u201cYes, woman. I\u2019m wasting away here.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but climbed off his lap and grabbed the phone.</p><p>Two hours and an entire pizza later, Brynn curled into the crook of Reid\u2019s arm, feeling more content than she had in a long time. Despite the crazy evening, cuddling with six feet of yummy male made it hard to hold on to stress. And the more time she spent with him, the more her resistance to trying something with him crumbled.</p><p>Yes, they were far apart in the social stratosphere, but did that mean they couldn\u2019t enjoy each other\u2019s company for a little while? She\u2019d hopefully leave for Austin at the end of the summer, he\u2019d return to law school. With all that she had to deal with, a summer fling could be the one treat she allowed herself.</p><p>She craned her neck to look up at Reid. \u201cSo is this, like, your pitch to date me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a low chuckle. \u201cOnly if it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019re doing an okay job, I guess. It\u2019s a very extensive interview process, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? What areas do I need to work on?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip, then decided if she was going to go for it with Reid, she may as well do it with gusto. She scooted from under his arm and shifted around so she could straddle his lap, earning a raised eyebrow from him. \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t even tried to kiss me tonight.\u201d</p><p>The playful expression on his face dissolved. \u201cI know. I\u2019m trying to make up for the mistakes I made on our first date.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rubbed her upper arms. \u201cI took things too fast, and I should\u2019ve never talked to you the way I did. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I got caught up in the moment.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth tilted up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly stopping you. I think we both lost our heads a bit.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hair back over her shoulders. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start over? Take things slower?\u201d</p><p>A small twinge of disappointment gnawed at her belly. Yes, she had let things go too far that night, but part of her had enjoyed the rawness of it, the abandon. She nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan. As long as kissing is still part of the agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. Item number one, in fact.\u201d</p><p>He curled his palm around the nape of her neck, drawing her closer, then brushed his mouth against hers. The move was sweet, a simple whisper of his lips against hers, but her body shuddered in response. She\u2019d spent so much time the last few weeks keeping a careful distance from him and trying to forget the night in his truck that even the minute contact sent her nerve endings alight.</p><p>His fingers threaded in her hair, gently tugging her head back, allowing him access to her neck. The tender force behind the movement caused an odd thrill to rush through her. They had agreed they both wanted to take things slow, but the tension in his grasp made her think he was fighting the urge to charge forward. He kissed the tender skin behind her ear, then her jawline, leaving goose bumps trailing along her skin. Her eyelids fluttered closed as she relished the delicious decadence of his touch. By the time his mouth found its way back to hers, her whole body had flushed with heat.</p><p>His hands moved down to her waist, then braced against the tops of her legs, his thumbs making circles on her inner thighs while his tongue explored her mouth. His fingers bit into the soft flesh of her legs through the cotton of her pants. Unraveling restraint, that\u2019s what it felt like. Like he was riding the edge of his control and if she made one wrong move, he was going to throw her down on the coffee table and rip off her clothes\u2014an idea that frankly sounded all kinds of enticing at the moment.</p><p>Even though she told herself they were simply going to kiss, her body refused to believe it. Slick moisture flooded her sex and desire, sharp and wicked, clouded her thoughts. Unconsciously, she spread her legs wider, and Reid\u2019s growing erection brushed against her. A low murmur of pleasure escaped her, but was quickly swallowed by his kiss.</p><p>Reid pulled back, his breathing heavy. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t even kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the sudden break in contact. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head back and raked his hands through his hair. \u201cI think you know.\u201d</p><p>She moved her hand to his crotch, his cock as hard as steel against the denim of his jeans. She ran her nails along the scratchy material, loving the fact that she could turn him on so quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Apparently, we\u2019re not so good at slow and easy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and moved her fingers under the edge of his dress shirt, walking her fingertips along the ripples of his abdomen. \u201cI just want you to be you\u2014whoever that is.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his head, his eyes darkening. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her wrists and gently removed her hands from beneath his shirt, then placed a soft kiss on each one. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long, emotional night. I\u2019m going to leave before we take this too far again.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw fell open. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders and eased her off his lap, his expression pained. \u201cI\u2019m not going to risk you hating me in the morning. We\u2019ll go out tomorrow night on a real date. If you still want this by then, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest, anger bubbling in her belly. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Reid. I\u2019m not some flighty chick who is going to jump in bed with someone because I had a bad night. And I\u2019m not some virgin princess either. You don\u2019t have to treat me with kid gloves. Anything I do with you is because I want to.\u201d</p> <p>Reid\u2019s eyes turned stormy, the vibe rolling off him almost animalistic. He opened his mouth to respond.</p><p>\u201cBrynn? I need you.\u201d Her mother\u2019s scratchy voice drifted from the hallway and scraped across her ears.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>Reid\u2019s expression smoothed into an unreadable mask, and he leaned over to kiss Brynn on the forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about all of this later, sugar, when we\u2019re both thinking more clearly. See you tomorrow at work.\u201d</p><p>She hauled herself off the couch and stomped down the hallway. The self-righteous bastard could find his own way to the door.</p><p>Reid collapsed onto the couch of his darkened living room, his head still spinning from his disastrous make-out session with Brynn. Fuck. What was wrong with him? Thank God her mother had interrupted them. He\u2019d been about half a second from throwing Brynn down and taking her right there\u2014with no mercy, no restraint. He shifted his position, his dick straining painfully against the zipper of his pants.</p> <p>He thought he could control himself around her, but she stirred dark urges he\u2019d long been trying to suppress. Something about her made it next to impossible for him to act like a sane person. Brynn had been through hell\u2014she deserved to be cherished, respected, treated like the amazing girl she was. But all he wanted to do anytime he was around her was tie her up and fuck her until she was hoarse from screaming his name and limp with satisfaction.</p><p>He tilted his head back against the couch, staring at the ceiling. Maybe his aunt was right. Maybe he needed to stick to a girl like Vanessa\u2014one that he had no trouble controlling himself around.</p><p>But at the moment, he couldn\u2019t even recall Vanessa\u2019s face.</p><p>Instead, erotic images of Brynn on her knees, blindfolded and bound, flooded his mind. He groaned and closed his eyes. Automatically, his hand undid his fly and he released his straining erection.</p><p>Brynn had such a hot mouth, he knew her lips wrapping around his cock would be nothing short of heaven. He would tangle his fingers in her silky hair and command her to take all of him, to let him fuck her mouth with abandon while she held his gaze. Then he\u2019d have his turn on her\u2014tasting her, teasing her, pushing her limits until he brought her to an edge of bliss that, at least for a few moments, would take her away from all the ugliness in her life.</p><p>His balls tightened as the forbidden fantasy played in his mind, and in the darkness of his quiet living room, he fisted his cock and gave it long strokes from root to head. He didn\u2019t allow himself any gentleness or finesse. Hard and rough\u2014just like he wanted to take Brynn. He imagined her sucking him hard, scraping her teeth along the tender skin, licking the drops of fluid from the tip, offering him her sweet and utter submission.</p><p>Sweat beaded his forehead, and with one last stroke, he let out a guttural moan. Hot fluid splashed onto his shirt and abdomen, and he sank against the sofa, his breath coming in short pants.</p><p>God, he was a sick bastard. Even with his best efforts, he couldn\u2019t fight the dangerous craving within him.</p> <p>Maybe pursuing a relationship with Brynn hadn\u2019t been such a good idea after all. She had enough demons in her own life; he didn\u2019t need to unleash his on her, too. But now that he\u2019d gotten close to the beautiful blonde, he didn\u2019t know how to turn off his desire to be with her. He was going to have to find a way to slay this burning need he had before he crossed the line and scared off Brynn.</p><p>And he knew the very person who might be able to help him with that.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Brynn looked down at the address on the business card one more time, then raised her eyes to the storefront. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>The elegantly scrawled sign for Wicked blended in with the upscale shops around it, but its name left no question about the store\u2019s purpose. Leave it to Reid to fail to mention that the uptown address he\u2019d given her was a sex shop. She sighed. What else would it be? She wasn\u2019t exactly applying for membership to the PTA. She slung her purse over her shoulder and fed a few quarters into the parking meter, pleased her hand didn\u2019t shake during the process.</p><p>The tapping of her high-heeled boots silenced as she stepped from the sidewalk to the posh carpet of the store\u2019s entrance. Wine-colored walls and soft music enveloped her, giving her the sense that she\u2019d stepped into some private boudoir. The only indications of the store\u2019s wares were the gorgeous black-and-white erotic photos that adorned the walls.</p><p>Brynn\u2019s eyes traveled over each one, the bondage scenes sending a hum of electricity through her nervous system. How something could be so beautiful and frightening to her all at the same time was a wonder.</p><p>She drifted closer to the picture on her right\u2014a photo of a woman on her knees, back to the camera, arms laced in intricate strips of leather behind her. The woman\u2019s head was dipped forward in deference to the mysterious man in front of her. The photographer had kept the focus on the girl and left the dom blurred in the distance, a strong and imposing force despite the fuzzy edges. Unconsciously, Brynn lifted her hand as if to touch the picture.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said a friendly male voice.</p><p>Startled, she instantly dropped her hand and stepped back from the art. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A young, raven-haired man came around the register positioned on the back wall and walked toward her. \u201cThat one is one of my favorites. I love how she\u2019s showing such trust in the face of the unknown.\u201d</p><p>A nervous smile jumped to her lips. \u201cUm, yes, it\u2019s very... powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He nodded, emanating a sage energy that didn\u2019t match his boyish looks. \u201cSo what can I help you with today? Are you looking for art or something else?\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight to the opposite leg and resisted the urge to wipe her sweaty palms on her pants. \u201cI was supposed to ask for Jason.\u201d</p><p>One of his perfectly groomed brows twitched a bit, but he quickly smoothed his expression. \u201cOf course. My name\u2019s Marius. Let me take you upstairs where the main store is. You can look around while I go get him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and followed his lead to a narrow staircase. \u201cSo the whole store is upstairs? Why rent the downstairs space as well?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her and smiled. \u201cA lot of people prefer the privacy of knowing that those walking by on the street can\u2019t peek in and see what they\u2019re shopping for. Many of our customers have conservative jobs or public images. So that\u2019s important. Plus, I doubt the neighborhood would\u2019ve agreed to allow this type of store if our merchandise was going to be on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Brynn said, climbing the last step and walking into the main shop. The d\u00e9cor matched the bottom floor, but instead of erotic photography, there were rows of sex toys, bondage equipment, and high-end lingerie.</p><p>Marius crooked a thumb behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Jason for you. Feel free to browse. You have the store to yourself right now. We usually don\u2019t get busy until after ten or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She waited until he disappeared before she took him up on the browsing offer.</p><p>Brynn wandered down the first aisle, trying to keep her mind off the conversation she was about to have. She eyed the collection of vibrators, the shear variety astounding her. She shook her head. Dolphins, rabbits, butterflies. Why were they all named after animals? What was sexy about that? If she invented a line, she\u2019d name them after movie stars. The Mark Wahlberg. The Brad Pitt. She smiled. Maybe she had missed her calling.</p><p>She turned the corner to the next aisle and sucked in a breath. Rows of black leather restraints, paddles, and whips lined the shelves along with loads of things she couldn\u2019t identify. The photo from downstairs flashed through her brain. This was what she was signing up for\u2014complete submission to a stranger. A golf-ball-sized lump lodged in her throat.</p><p>She picked up one of the items, a flogger according to the tag, and threaded her fingers through the soft strips at the end of the handle. The leather felt cool against her skin, but she imagined the material would heat up quickly when wielded by a strong hand. She resisted the urge to smack it across her palm to test the theory.</p><p>She\u2019d never done anything with actual equipment. She and Reid had both been new to the idea back then and hadn\u2019t ventured very far into this world. They\u2019d worked with whatever they had around. She drew the leather across her hand again, and images of Reid standing behind her, flogger in hand, invaded her thoughts. A hot tingling fired up in her belly and crept lower.</p><p>She shook her head\u2014God, she was so twisted up with this. Her body hadn\u2019t forgotten what it had been like with Reid, how unbelievably explosive the sex had been. But the same thoughts that got her body slick and ready made her mind want to splinter into a thousand pieces.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Brynn LeBreck,\u201d said a genial voice, startling her from her errant thoughts.</p><p>She looked up, fumbling to put the flogger back on the rack, and her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for you to get more gorgeous,\u201d Jace said, green eyes sparkling. \u201cBut clearly I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace?\u201d she asked, her mind still processing his presence as the broad-shouldered man gathered her into a crushing hug.</p><p>He stepped back, smiling. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that\u2019s who you were coming to see?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, Reid didn\u2019t mention it, and I didn\u2019t realize your full name was Jason.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and scrubbed a hand through his surfer-style blond hair. \u201cThat shithead. I\u2019m sorry. I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>No, but it would\u2019ve been nice to be warned. She was going to kick Reid\u2019s ass when she got back to the office tomorrow. She took a deep breath and smiled. Her problem was not with Jace. He\u2019d never been anything but kind to her. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Actually, better than fine. It\u2019s great to see you.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for her to follow him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on back to my office so we can chat?\u201d</p><p>When he reached his door, he swung it open and let Brynn walk in before him. The space was large, but cozy, resembling a sitting room in a fancy hotel more than an office. Only the massive cherrywood desk gave away the room\u2019s true purpose. She settled into the cushioned wingback chair. \u201cBeautiful office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019d take credit for the decorating, but this was my sister\u2019s project. She was starting an interior design business, and I was her guinea pig.\u201d Instead of sitting behind his desk, Jace dropped into the matching chair across from her. \u201cSo how the hell have you been? Reid tells me you\u2019re a therapist now.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs and tried to give the appearance of being at ease, although her insides were knotted into a pretzel. \u201cI am. I work at the Women\u2019s Crisis Center.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. I always knew you\u2019d do something great. You were the only one who took your job seriously when we were working for Reid\u2019s uncle. The rest of us were just a bunch of slackers. I only lasted a few months before Roslyn told me I should explore other opportunities.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have much choice. It was work hard or head back to \u2018Would you like fries with that?\u2019 \u201d She glanced around the posh office again. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not slacking anymore. Although, I\u2019m a little surprised at the business choice. Weren\u2019t you supposed to become a financial planner or something?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in the chair and smirked. \u201cYeah, the fam wasn\u2019t too thrilled with my little venture. They\u2019ve cut me out of the family fortune. But my finance jobs were soul sucking. I needed to follow my passion.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cAnd your passion is selling whips and vibrators?\u201d</p><p>A warm chuckle rumbled from deep in his chest. \u201cAmong other things. But yeah, I enjoy helping people indulge in their fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and fiddled with the clasp of her watch, not sure what to say next. Was she supposed to just come out and ask? Hey, Jace, can you help me get into that super-duper fancy kink club?</p><p>He sat forward, his mop of blond hair falling across his forehead. \u201cRelax, Brynn. Reid told me about your sister and why you want into The Ranch.\u201d</p> <p>She blew out a breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m a little nervous about sneaking you in. Grant, the club owner, is one of my biggest customers and if he found out I brought someone in under false pretenses, not only would I lose my membership, but a big chunk of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jace. I don\u2019t want to put you in that position. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u2014I know if my sister was in trouble, I\u2019d want to do everything I could to help her, too. I was even willing to go look for Kelsey for you, but Reid said she\u2019s not going to trust a stranger.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s hiding from some pretty scary people, so there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to talk to someone she doesn\u2019t recognize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that means it\u2019s up to you. We just need to make sure you pull this off flawlessly.\u201d</p> <p>She wet her lips. \u201cFlawlessly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Grant Waters is crazy good at reading people. It makes him a top-notch master, but it also means he can sniff out bullshit at a hundred paces. You can\u2019t go in playing sub\u2014you need to be a sub. Really surrender.\u201d</p><p>She uncrossed her legs and tucked her hands in her lap, trying to keep them from shaking. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He gave her knee a quick reassuring squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you this to scare you\u2014just to help you understand what needs to happen. The key is going to be not to overthink it. You know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like it was a big secret that you and Reid were experimenting with D/s back when I knew you. You\u2019re not a novice.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her jaw. \u201cYes, apparently Reid was quite free with that information.\u201d</p><p>His tilted his head. \u201cReally? I thought I was the only who knew.\u201d</p> <p>No, at least one other person knew. And whoever that someone was had used it to their ultimate advantage to hurt her. Unless... She stared at Jace for a moment, a sick feeling rolling through her. What if he had been the one?</p><p>No. She dismissed the thought as quickly as it appeared. Jace didn\u2019t have a cruel bone in his body. He would\u2019ve never violated her that way. She shifted in her chair, shaking off the ridiculous idea. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Ancient history.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment as if he were going to push further, but the look on her face must have made him think better of it. He crooked a thumb toward the mini-fridge next to his desk. \u201cYou want something to drink? Beer, soda? I would offer wine, but despite the d\u00e9cor, I\u2019m not that refined.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth tilted up. \u201cA beer would be great.\u201d</p><p>He stood, turning his back to her. \u201cSo, are you saying you haven\u2019t continued to explore the Scene?\u201d</p><p>The Scene. What an innocuous term for something that had the potential to rip her apart from the inside out. \u201cNo, I dropped the whole idea after Reid and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed two bottles from the fridge, twisted off the caps, and handed her a beer. \u201cWow, really? I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip, the fizzy liquid easing the dryness in her throat. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and sat on the edge of his desk. \u201cWe were all new to it back then, but it didn\u2019t take an expert to see how well you took to the sub role. I was all kinds of jealous that Reid had you all to himself. Too bad he was such a selfish bastard\u2014things could\u2019ve gotten much more interesting.\u201d</p><p>Brynn wet her lips and gripped the bottle with both hands as images more erotic than the art downstairs filled her mind. She knew Jace\u2019s kink back then had extended beyond D/s and into m\u00e9nage. And even though she\u2019d always viewed him as more of a buddy than a lover, she couldn\u2019t deny that the handsome blond could get her hormones hopping.</p><p>She cleared her throat, trying to shake the images from her brain. \u201cPerhaps. And that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m here. Beyond wanting to get to my sister, I also think I need to do this for myself. There are some things I need to work through, and I think this type of thing could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze away, trying to come up with something\u2014anything\u2014other than telling him about the rape. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just lately, I\u2019ve found myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsatisfied?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She nodded, goose bumps pricking her skin. She had wanted her lie to sound authentic. But hearing it out loud hit a bit too close to home. Shit. She hadn\u2019t needed to make up a fib. Unsatisfied was exactly what she was. \u201cI thought maybe this could be the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re willing to go into this blind, with a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows knitted. \u201cYou sure? I could try to get Reid a membership if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cTime doesn\u2019t heal everything, Jace.\u201d</p><p>He swigged his beer, keeping his eyes on her. \u201cYou realize that going into a place like The Ranch is the real deal. What you and Reid did back in the day was dabbling. The members at this place vary from one end of the spectrum to the other. You might find a dom who\u2019s just looking for a little casual play, but many others are seeking total submission.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat seemed incredibly loud in the quiet intimacy of the room. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning guys who want to break down every barrier you have\u2014physical, psychological, sexual\u2014until you\u2019re totally and completely theirs to command. Master and slave. It can be an incredible rush to get into something like that, but also can be seriously overwhelming for the inexperienced.\u201d</p><p>Sweat beaded her back, and she shifted in her chair. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe club is very selective about membership for doms. They do background checks, there are income requirements, and you have to have a clean bill of health. And as for the play itself, there are safe words and surveillance cameras to make sure people only take it as far as they mutually want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d A little flash of relief went through her, not just for herself but for her sister.</p><p>He shot her a stern look. \u201cBut that\u2019s not across the board, Brynn. They don\u2019t broadcast it, but be aware that there are also unmonitored areas you can get into if you sign a waiver. You need to promise me you won\u2019t venture into any of those areas until you\u2019ve established a trusted relationship with someone. Only the assholes will try to get you into an isolated place this early in the game. And that is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Shit. \u201cSo what happens when I go to The Ranch?\u201d</p><p>He set his beer down on the desk. \u201cWell, if you go in as a single, guest sub, you\u2019d be presented to the members who were interested in taking you on, and you would get to select which one to be with. Then you\u2019d have to demonstrate your submission to him in front of the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I have to do that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to make sure you\u2019re serious. Some members of the club are pretty important people. If a reporter or private investigator tried to sneak in, they\u2019d have to really want to get a story to go through public submission. Grant will be there looking for that kind of thing, so that\u2019s why you have to make sure you\u2019re absolutely convincing.\u201d</p><p>Her knuckles turned white against the bottle. \u201cAnd what exactly does public submission involve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the hell your dom wants.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly, then glanced up at him. \u201cI\u2019m kind of freaked out about the whole thing. What if I can\u2019t convince that Grant guy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and stepped closer to her, placing a warm hand on her shoulder. \u201cI have faith in you. All you need to do is channel whoever you were back when you were Reid\u2019s sub. You have it in you. The key is going to be to not focus on anything but your own personal reasons for being there. Give yourself over to the experience. Once you\u2019re past initiation, you can worry about tracking down your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, trying to convince herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. I bet after a few days there, the sub role will become second nature to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait? A few days?\u201d she asked, her voice coming out too high.</p><p>He stepped over to his desk and grabbed a few papers. \u201cThe Ranch is a retreat, not a drop-in club. You can\u2019t sign up for anything less than a three-day stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to pull some strings to get you in this quickly.\u201d He handed her the documents. \u201cFill these out and fax them back to me by tomorrow morning, and I can get you in for the retreat starting on Wednesday. There is also a rule sheet in there for you to go over.\u201d</p><p>She set her beer on the side table and took the pages from him. A hopeful thought hit her. \u201cAre you going to be there?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a rueful smile. \u201cDoll, I\u2019d love to take you on as my sub for a while, if you\u2019d have me, but I can\u2019t bail on the store without more notice.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged.</p><p>He sighed and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. Just trust your instincts and don\u2019t be afraid to use your safe word if someone pushes you too far.\u201d</p><p>She managed a shaky smile and stood. Now she needed to make sure she pulled off this ruse to the nth degree for yet another reason. She definitely didn\u2019t want to get Jace in any trouble with the club or screw with whatever business dealings he had with The Ranch.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jace. I really appreciate you risking your hide to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, doll.\u201d He pulled her in for one last bear hug. \u201cMake sure you call me and let me know how it goes. And don\u2019t be a stranger. I can get you discounts on all kinds of naughty stuff.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have friends in high places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>Jace sank into his desk chair with a groan. He\u2019d been looking forward to seeing Brynn again, but he hadn\u2019t anticipated the raging hard-on she would inspire. The hopeful look on her face when she\u2019d thought he might be able to go to The Ranch with her had sent him over the edge. God, he\u2019d love to be the guy who got to experience the sweet submission he knew she was capable of. But he was under strict orders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He adjusted the crotch of his jeans, then picked up the phone to dial a familiar number.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>Jace tilted his chair back and closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s done. She\u2019ll be there on Wednesday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, are you sure you want to do it this way? I kind of feel like a dick.\u201d</p><p>Reid sighed. \u201cTrust me. I know what she needs even if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jace snorted. If he were a betting man, he\u2019d put his money on Reid\u2019s balls getting handed to him on a plate, but he\u2019d learned long ago not to try to change his friend\u2019s mind once he had it set on something. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. For both your sakes.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p> <p>then</p><p>Brynn rolled her wrist, her hand aching from all the notes she\u2019d taken during her boss Davis\u2019s staff meeting, and sank back into the conference room chair. She glanced around the oval table and noticed everyone\u2019s eyes had glazed over. Davis stepped around the whiteboard he\u2019d been scribbling on and stood behind Brynn. \u201cAny questions, people?\u201d</p><p>Most shook their heads.</p><p>Davis\u2019s hands settled on Brynn\u2019s shoulders and squeezed, the unexpected touch jolting her from her daze. \u201cDid you get all of that, Brynn?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and tried not to squirm beneath the unwanted touch. The man didn\u2019t like her, so his seemingly friendly gesture was all for the benefit of the other workers. \u201cUh, yes, sir, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. So Brynn will type up the notes for everyone and e-mail them to you before the end of the day,\u201d he said, patting her shoulder one last time before heading to the door and swinging it open. \u201cThanks for all your attention this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn gathered her things and followed everyone out. She\u2019d hoped to pin down Reid earlier in the day to discuss the previous night\u2019s disaster of a make-out session, but they\u2019d all been so busy it\u2019d been impossible to say more than a few passing words. So she was happy to see him veer toward her desk instead of his own as they trailed out of the meeting.</p><p>As she slipped into her seat, Reid sank into the chair at the front of her desk, his customary grin noticeably absent. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself,\u201d she said, dropping her legal pad and pen on her desk. \u201cI was beginning to wonder if you were avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cCourse not, just been busy. But I do have to confess, I\u2019m here to deliver a bit of good and bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, why don\u2019t you start with the good?\u201d</p><p>He dug in his pocket, then tossed a key onto her desk. She picked it up and examined it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for a rental car. I have a friend whose dad owns a repair shop. He owes me a favor, so they\u2019re going to try to fix your car for free. If it can be fixed, that is. In the meantime, he was able to hook me up with a loaner for you, so you don\u2019t have to take the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow, you didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she said, stunned by his gesture.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem, and hopefully, it will make you less mad at me for the bad news.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cLay it on me.\u201d</p><p>He sagged in the seat and blew out a haggard breath. \u201cSomething\u2019s come up, and I\u2019m going to have to move our date to tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but his frown lines didn\u2019t match his assurance. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d promised to go to this thing tonight. I don\u2019t want to back out.\u201d</p><p>Brynn kept her expression smooth, though her chest tightened. She\u2019d seen more people bail when they found out about her mother than stick around, and Reid\u2019s change of plans sounded suspiciously like the warning shot before the classic cut-and-run. Maybe fixing her car was her consolation prize. \u201cWhat kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNothing you\u2019d be interested in. Otherwise, I\u2019d bring you along.\u201d</p><p>Sure he would. Right. She pasted on a smile. \u201cNo problem. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>Roslyn stepped behind Reid and laid a hand on his shoulder. \u201cReid, dear, stop pestering Brynn. She has a lot of notes to type up before the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at her. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll be done in a second. She\u2019s just clarifying something from the meeting for me.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired woman pursed her lips, but walked off without another word. Reid leaned forward and kept his voice low. \u201cI promise we\u2019ll do something tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Brynn propped her legal pad next to her computer screen. \u201cAll right, sounds good. And really, thanks again for my car. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He paused as if he were going to say something else, but then apparently decided against it because he rose and headed back to his desk. Yep, no doubt, he was going to bail. His whole essence screamed guilt. She clicked her fingers along her keyboard with a little more force than necessary. Well, better now than later. At least her heart hadn\u2019t latched onto him yet.</p><p>She glanced over to his desk and tried to ignore the way her gut churned at the thought of him returning to the status of coworker only. Okay, so maybe she was a little attached. Nothing she couldn\u2019t handle. She\u2019d learned long ago that everyone lets you down eventually\u2014it was just a matter of when.</p><p>Reid sat in Jace\u2019s living room, nursing his second beer and staring through the TV, not really seeing the baseball game. He shifted forward in the overstuffed chair, bracing his arms on his thighs. He couldn\u2019t get comfortable. Not in the room. Not in the chair. Not in his own fucking skin.</p><p>Maybe this was a bad idea.</p><p>Something nicked him in the head. \u201cWhat the\u2014?</p><p>He raised his hand in defense as Jace launched another peanut at him. \u201cCalm the hell down, dude. You\u2019re stressing me out.\u201d</p><p>Reid set his beer down and wiped his damp palms on his jeans. \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are,\u201d he said, lowering the volume on the television and angling himself on the couch so he could face him. \u201cLook, she\u2019s going to be here in a few minutes. You asked for my help, so don\u2019t punk out on me. And what guy is going to bail when a beautiful woman is on her way over to fulfill your sexual fantasies?\u201d</p><p>He groaned and sank back against the cushions. What had he been thinking? Jace had agreed to hook him up with a girl he knew\u2014a girl who supposedly liked things a little rough in bed and preferred two guys to one\u2014so that Reid could work through his shit.</p><p>Last night the whole idea had seemed like the perfect solution to his problem\u2014a pretty girl who didn\u2019t mind some kink, Jace there to keep Reid from crossing any lines, and no strings. But now that he was here, neither his heart nor his dick were onboard.</p><p>He needed to go.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Jace grinned. \u201cRight on time.\u201d</p><p>Jace hustled to the door, leaving Reid with his warring thoughts and pounding heart. Part of him wanted to sneak out the side door and not look back. But the other part was still holding on to the hope that maybe this would fix it. Fix him.</p><p>However, when Jace pulled open the door, and Reid heard</p><p>the voice on the other side, his blood seemed to halt in his veins.</p><p>Mother. Fucker.</p><p>He hopped up from the chair and crossed the room in three strides, stepping up behind Jace. Brynn\u2019s eyes locked with his over Jace\u2019s shoulder, her teeth tugging at her full bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Reid bit out, then grimaced when he realized how rude his question sounded.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d she said, shifting her gaze between the two of them, looking as unsure of herself as he\u2019d ever seen her. \u201cI was just telling Jace that Roslyn found your wallet on the floor in the office. She, uh, knew where you were and asked if I would drop it by on my way home. She didn\u2019t want you driving home without your license.\u201d</p><p>He automatically grabbed for his back pocket\u2014of course, nothing was in there. \u201cDamn, how did I lose that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, and then stuck out her hand, giving him the wallet.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d His fingers brushed hers as he took it from her, and his dick\u2014which hadn\u2019t twitched all night despite the upcoming threesome\u2014instantly stirred to life.</p><p>God, what was it about this girl? Seeing her there, feeling the heat her presence alone fired within him, slapped him with hard reality. He was so screwed. He could fuck his way through sorority row and then hit every whorehouse on the way home afterward, but it wouldn\u2019t matter. Nothing was going to slake the dark desire Brynn inspired.</p><p>The realization burned an aching hole in his chest. Maybe he\u2019d never be able to trust himself around her.</p><p>She pushed her hair behind her ears. \u201cSo, yeah, I guess I\u2019ll get going. Y\u2019all enjoy your boys\u2019 night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay and have a beer if you want,\u201d Jace offered. \u201cThe Rangers game is on.\u201d</p><p>He whipped his head in Jace\u2019s direction. Had the idiot lost his goddamned mind?</p><p>Brynn snuck a tentative peek at Reid. His horror must\u2019ve been obvious on his face because she quickly waved a dismissive hand. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to interrupt. Far be it from me to interfere on dude time.\u201d</p><p>Headlights flashed through the darkened street, and she glanced back as another car pulled into the driveway.</p><p>Reid\u2019s heart leapt into his throat. Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, stepping forward, his words tumbling out. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not a baseball fan anyway. And the game\u2019s a blowout so far. Why don\u2019t I walk you to your car?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed as he took her elbow. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>But as they turned to head down the sidewalk, Leah exited her car and sashayed into their path, looking like a teenage boy\u2019s wet dream. Shorts hugging her ass, legs up to her ears, and non-God-given tits spilling out her top. Definitely not a baseball-watching outfit. Definitely not a dude. Facts not lost on Brynn.</p><p>She stiffened in his grasp and halted her step.</p><p>Goddammit. And goddamn his aunt for sending Brynn here. Even without trying, Ros had managed to meddle like she had some sixth sense on how exactly to fuck with his life.</p><p>Leah\u2019s glossed lips pulled into a seductive smile as she approached. \u201cJace didn\u2019t tell me we were bringing in a fourth, but...\u201d She gave Brynn an up-and-down perusal. \u201cI guess I\u2019m open to new things.\u201d</p><p>Reid closed his eyes, wishing the sidewalk would crack open and swallow him up. Fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>Brynn\u2019s fingers curled into fists, her nails digging into her palms, but she forced herself to choke down the rest of her reaction. She would not give Reid the satisfaction.</p><p>She eased her elbow from his grip and gave the supermodel-like girl a polite smile. \u201cThanks, but I was just leaving. I think I may be exactly one too many. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hiked her purse strap further up her shoulder and traipsed past the woman.</p><p>\u201cBrynn, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she pretended she didn\u2019t hear Reid and kept walking, her steps picking up speed. She just needed to get in her car, lock all of this out before she embarrassed herself. She had no claim on Reid. Had no right to feel so possessive. No logical reason to want to yank that bitch down by her ponytail and scratch her eyes out.</p><p>Two steps more.</p><p>A hand clamped over her forearm and spun her around. \u201cI said wait, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Reid,\u201d she said, her voice losing its calm edge. \u201cLet me go. I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, just let me explain.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and glanced back toward the house. Jace and Barbie had gone inside and shut the door. \u201cI think I can figure it out. I don\u2019t need a diagram. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d But the guilty shift of his eyes said otherwise.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cReid, it\u2019s fine, okay? It\u2019s none of my business. But I think it\u2019s a good idea if we just end whatever has been going on with us right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. It\u2019s not like I was expecting exclusivity or whatever, but I think I\u2019ll have a hard time scraping the image of the three of you from my brain.\u201d A flash of the beautiful girl wrapped around Reid\u2019s naked body went through her mind, making her want to heave.</p> <p>He latched his other hand on her opposite arm, squaring her to face him, his blue eyes fierce. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her, I want you.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her arms from his grip, no longer able to keep the lid on her boiling anger. \u201cOh, right. Because cancelling a date with me to go tag-team fuck some other girl is exactly the way to show me you care. You should write goddamned Hallmark cards.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand over his face, his expression stricken. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just... complicated.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. Now you know why I didn\u2019t want you to come inside my house. My life is ugly. I wouldn\u2019t want to get involved with me either. Good-bye, Reid.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to him and stuck her key in her car door.</p> <p>\u201cScrew it. You want to talk about secrets?\u201d he asked, his volume rising. \u201cLet\u2019s do that, then.\u201d</p><p>She turned the lock and reached for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cYou know why that girl is here? Because I\u2019m screwed up, Brynn. When I look at you, I don\u2019t just want to play nice and date you. I don\u2019t just want to fuck you. I want to own you. Tie you to my bed and do whatever the hell I want to you. Use you.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in her body stilled and some foreign emotion stirred low and deep in her belly. She couldn\u2019t turn around; she just stared back at her own wide-eyed reflection in her car window.</p><p>\u201cAnd it scares the hell out of me because I can\u2019t keep that desire in control when I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t trust myself not to hurt you, to take it too far.\u201d</p><p>The sad current of his words made her chest ache. She swallowed past the dryness in her throat, hoping her voice would still function. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why that girl?\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, and she could picture his chest heaving with the weight of what he had revealed. \u201cI asked Jace to help me find a way to get rid of this insane need so that I could be with you. Have a normal relationship. That\u2019s what tonight was about. Brynn, I\u2019m so sorry. I just\u2014I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>She should get in her car and go. Not look back. Her mother had always told her that when people told you who they were, you should believe them. If Reid thought he was dangerous, maybe he was. But the anguish in his voice tugged at her. This man wasn\u2019t violent\u2014every ounce of her God-given instincts told her that.</p><p>She took a deep breath, turned around, and met his stormy eyes. \u201cWhat if I tried to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The shame on his face turned to confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said tonight was about getting this out of your system. Maybe you\u2019re right, maybe that will help,\u201d she said, trying to keep her voice steady. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need that girl. You could try with me.\u201d</p><p>Something unreadable lit his features, but then he grimaced. \u201cNo way. You have no idea the things that go through my head, the stuff I want to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo show me,\u201d she said, cutting him off, her courage rising. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re scaring me off, but the only thing that\u2019s going to do that is you lying to me. So you have some stuff to work through. I have a lot of baggage, too. Maybe we can do this, get you past it, and then move on and date like normal.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe can date like normal without doing this. If you\u2019re still willing to give me a chance, I can leave this behind. I think you knowing about it will help me control the urge better.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a half-smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. My mother makes her money fulfilling the fantasies guys keep from their partners. If we\u2019re going to date, I don\u2019t want to be wondering if you\u2019re secretly sneaking off to feed that part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you. I swear I won\u2019t lie to you again.\u201d He said the words fervently, like he truly believed them. But she knew him wanting the statement to be true wouldn\u2019t actually make it so.</p><p>She had no idea if there was a certain protocol in his slave-girl role-play, but she put her hands out to him, palms up. \u201cI\u2019m giving myself to you tonight. Let me help you check this off your fantasy list.\u201d</p><p>Storm clouds gathered over his face. \u201cStop, Brynn. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing up for.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze, refusing to look away, despite the anxiety hammering through her. \u201cLike I said, show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She let her arms fall to her sides and turned back to her car. \u201cHave a nice life, Reid.\u201d</p><p>His deep groan cut through the night and strong hands landed flat on the roof of her car, his muscular arms imprisoning her on each side. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Heavy footsteps sounded behind them. \u201cIs everything all right out here?\u201d</p><p>Jace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Reid said through clenched teeth, his fierce tone rippling over her and awakening her senses.</p><p>His quickening breath was hot on her neck, and his body heat radiated against her back. She should\u2019ve been scared; she could sense his dwindling self-control\u2014the man\u2019s easy-going facade being stripped away by some dark, primal instinct within him.</p><p>But something inside her wanted it. Wanted to push him over the edge. Her voice came out as a whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t let me leave, Reid.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his arms flexed and bunched as if the war within him was raging in every sector of his body. He remained silent for agonizingly long seconds, then pushed himself away from the car. \u201cFine, you think this is what you want? Then lose the dress, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-What?\u201d She spun around, looking from him to Jace, who stood a few steps behind him with raised eyebrows, then to the area around them. Jace\u2019s driveway was protected by hedges and trees and far off the road, but did Reid actually expect her to take off her clothes out here? In front of his best friend?</p><p>Reid\u2019s lip curled up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to give yourself to me, to know what this is about. Well, you\u2019re getting your wish. If this isn\u2019t what you want, then say \u2018stop,\u2019 and we\u2019ll go to dinner and have a date like normal people.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth. So that\u2019s what this was about? He wanted to prove he was right. That she couldn\u2019t handle him. Well, screw that. She reached behind her and unzipped her dress, then slipped the narrow straps off her shoulders. After one fortifying breath, she let go and the material puddled onto the cobblestones at her feet, leaving her in her sheer bra and panties.</p><p>A pained expression flitted over Reid\u2019s face, and Jace\u2019s eyes lit with male appreciation.</p><p>\u201cJace, is the guesthouse unlocked?\u201d Reid asked, his voice disconcertingly calm.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can go grab the key and open it for you.\u201d</p><p>Reid nodded. \u201cThanks. Do that.\u201d</p><p>Jace jogged toward the side of the house, and Reid walked toward Brynn with deliberate steps, his eyes not leaving hers. The moonless evening and the soft garden lights cast his face in a combination of light and shadow, but the intensity of his expression was clear. She held her breath, her heart beating so fast she worried it would hop out of her chest and flop onto the ground between them.</p><p>When he reached her, his hand cupped her bare shoulder. \u201cTurn around and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She followed his instruction and faced the car. Soft cotton brushed against her face, then tightened over her eyes\u2014her dress, now a blindfold. His fingertips caressed the back of her neck, making her shiver despite the muggy night air. \u201cYou\u2019re mine tonight. I let Jace look at you, but he gets nothing else now, you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, relief flooding through her. She liked Jace, but it was Reid she wanted touching her. Even if this version of Reid was one she hadn\u2019t quite met yet.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder blade, nipped at it. \u201cYou remember what you called me the first time we met?\u201d</p><p>She paused, trying to wrangle in her buzzing brain so she could concentrate. What had she called him? Reid? No. She wet her lips. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>His hand curled around her waist, caressing her bare stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Tonight, that\u2019s what you call me.\u201d</p><p>The feel of his fingers and the seductive confidence of his voice hypnotized her. She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cTell me you understand,\u201d he said, his voice low but firm.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, girl. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>In one swift movement, Reid lifted her off her feet and into his arms as if she weighed nothing. She grabbed for his neck, disoriented from the blindfold. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you, sugar. I won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>Sounds drifted to her ears as they made their way across the yard\u2014crickets, frogs, the rustle of the leaves as the breeze touched them. She wondered if the landscaping continued around the side of the house or if she\u2019d be exposed to the neighbors. The idea that people might see her half-naked, being carried by this powerful man, should\u2019ve bothered her, but she was at ease in his arms.</p><p>She had given herself to him, so if he wanted her exposed to others, then that was up to him. Tonight, he owned her.</p><p>Damp heat pooled between her thighs at the thought.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>What had she gotten herself into?</p><p>What the hell had he gotten himself into? Reid sat a blindfolded Brynn down on the edge of the bed and tossed her purse by the footboard. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He stalked back to the doorway of the bedroom and leaned against the frame, watching her. He had fully expected her to bail the minute he\u2019d asked her to strip in front of Jace\u2014that had been his intent. But she\u2019d shocked him, calling his bluff. And the minute he\u2019d seen her bend to his will, he\u2019d gotten an intoxicating rush so strong, it had made his head spin.</p><p>Jace laid a hand on his shoulder, keeping his voice low. \u201cThe room\u2019s yours. Leah and I will hang out in the main house. You need anything else from me? Do you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>Possessiveness ripped through him like lightning, and he had to dial it back before responding. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll be... fine.\u201d</p><p>Now if only he could believe that.</p><p>Jace\u2019s gaze flitted to Brynn, then back to him. \u201cJust trust yourself. She does.\u201d</p><p>Reid nodded, the weight of that knowledge settling over him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Jace closed the door behind him, shutting out his last safety net. Reid stared at Brynn. Even in the soft lamplight of the room, he could see the rosy buds of her nipples peeking through the lace of her bra. His cock strained against the denim of his jeans, hardening to the point of agony. Since she\u2019d shown up on Jace\u2019s doorstep tonight, he\u2019d been trying to hold back, trying to prove to himself he was over this stupid fantasy. But seeing Brynn offer herself to him so naively had only served to conjure familiar images of her collared before him. God, he was so fucked.</p><p>His mother had always taught him you could tell everything about a man based on the way he treated a woman. She\u2019d spent her life as an advocate for women\u2019s rights. And now here he was, unable to resist the urge to dominate Brynn like she was some kind of slave. His mom would\u2019ve been so ashamed.</p><p>But he was done questioning it for the night. He had to cleanse this from his system, and Brynn needed to see why she shouldn\u2019t jump into things she knew nothing about. By the end of this, they could both move on. They\u2019d either go forward and start a normal relationship, or more likely, she would run away completely freaked out and want nothing to do with him. Either way, tonight he was giving himself over to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He walked over to her and caressed her cheek with the back of his hand. She startled at the touch.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m going to take off your blindfold. I want to be able to see your pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The sweet femininity of her voice went straight to his gut. This girl was so tough, but there was an untouched innocence in her that made him want to take care of her, protect her. He untied the dress and let it fall to the carpet. She blinked up at him, her cheeks tinged pink, her lush bottom lip swollen from her biting it.</p><p>\u201cYou can still back out.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her green eyes defiant. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>No going back now. The steely voice that passed his lips was unrecognizable to his own ears. \u201cStand up.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn swung her legs to the side of the bed and rose on shaky knees. Reid\u2019s hands moved up her arms as his eyes traveled over her. She\u2019d never seen this side of him before\u2014so focused and serious. Her nipples tightened beneath his hungry gaze, and the response didn\u2019t seem lost on him. He skimmed his finger along the edge of one cup of her bra, sending tiny shivers through her. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>The quiet authority of his voice melted over her like chocolate, soothing some of her twitching nerves. She reached behind her back, undid the clasp, and let the bra fall to the floor. Reid gave her a slow smile and reached out to cup one of her breasts, running his thumb across its hard peak. \u201cGorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and he bent his head to draw the opposite nipple into his mouth, while continuing to strum pleasure from the other with his hand. The combination of sensations sent liquid fire straight to her core. She closed her eyes and let out a soft whimper, his tongue caressing her with painfully gentle strokes.</p><p>God, was he going to be this slow and deliberate with everything? She\u2019d burn into a pile of embers by the time he got to the actual sex. He drew back a bit and circled her areola with the tip of his tongue, carefully avoiding what she most wanted. She threaded her hands in his hair and urged him forward, wanting more, needing all of his mouth again.</p><p>Cool air replaced his touch as he backed away.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>He pressed a finger against her lips, quieting her. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of your pleasure, not you. Trust that I\u2019ll take you where you need to go.\u201d</p><p>Her throat went dry, but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cTake off your panties.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and put his hands in his pockets, watching her, making her feel both wanted and vulnerable all at the same time. Her hands hovered near her hips, suddenly nervous about standing naked before him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask twice, Brynn,\u201d he said, his voice calm but firm.</p><p>She took a slow breath, then hooked her thumbs in her panties and shimmied out of them. His gaze ate up every inch of flesh, and the impressive bulge in his jeans twitched. Her body tingled beneath his clear approval. She yearned to reach out and touch him, to undress him and feel his skin beneath her fingertips, but she fought the urge to take over control.</p><p>His hand cupped her hip and he dragged her against him, the stiff material of his jeans brushing the soft curls covering her mound. He pressed his lips to the pulse point below her ear, his palm sliding from her waist to the curve of her ass. Warm breath lapped over her skin like ocean water. \u201cYou know how many times I\u2019ve imagined you stripped bare for me like this? How many nights I\u2019ve stroked my cock just at the thought of touching you again?\u201d</p><p>The words turned her insides molten, the juices of her arousal coating her sex. She edged her hips toward him, seeking relief.</p> <p>He trailed his fingers along her backside, the cleft of her ass, the small of her back\u2014each touch unbearably delicate. His voice was barely a whisper. \u201cHave you ever touched yourself and thought about me?\u201d</p><p>Her face flooded with heat. She had. More times than she could count since she\u2019d met him. But she had never admitted to masturbating to anyone. She swallowed hard. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and buried his forehead against her shoulder, the first sign that maybe she was affecting him as much as he was her. She bit back a pleased smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. In for a penny, in for a pound. \u201cLast night, after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He lifted his head, his eyes meeting hers. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>His hand glided along her tender skin and dipped inside her channel, finding her wet and wanting. She tilted her head back at the sweet invasion. \u201cOh, God. Yes, like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, so hot and ready for me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The pad of his thumb found her clit and massaged.</p><p>She bucked against the contact and let out a soft moan, sharp darts of pleasure shooting up her spine and radiating outward. Her nails sunk into his shoulders as she tried to keep from tipping over to orgasm. How could she be so close to the edge with just one touch?</p><p>He chuckled, low and warm. \u201cDon\u2019t come yet, sugar. I haven\u2019t given you permission.\u201d</p><p>He pumped his fingers in and out in a languid rhythm, and her knees began to quiver beneath her. \u201cDon\u2019t know if I can control that.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he pulled back, removing all physical contact and halting her galloping journey toward release. She opened her mouth to protest, but he hushed her, using his fingers to gloss her parted lips with her own cream. He cradled her cheeks and dipped his head to claim her mouth in a scorching kiss. All her muscles seemed to liquefy, and she had to grab onto the bed behind her so she wouldn\u2019t end up in a puddle at his feet.</p><p>Far too soon, he eased back and gave her a chastising smile. \u201cHmm. Guess you\u2019ll have to learn how to control it. Otherwise, you\u2019re not going to get what you want.\u201d</p><p>She managed a nod, her head still spinning from the kiss. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin with his finger, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cSo, what is it that you want, sugar? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>She willed her voice not to shake. She knew he expected her to ask for her orgasm, but she yearned for something more than that. Something she thought about every day and ached to do anytime he was within ten feet of her. \u201cI want to touch you. To please you.\u201d</p><p>Feral desire flared in his eyes, mixing in with the tension still rolling off him, an internal battle playing out in front of her. He ran a thumb over her cheek, staring at her for a moment more, then his expression turned resolute. He moved his hand to her shoulder, pushing down. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>She lowered herself onto the plush carpet, keeping her focus on his face. He was trusting her with his dark side, showing her what he didn\u2019t want anyone to see. Something stirred deep within her chest, warming her. Never had she imagined she would let a guy command her this way, like she was his whore. The idea should have been appalling considering her mother\u2019s profession, but something deep within her ached to please Reid, to be his safe place.</p><p>He circled around her, stalking, like he had to see her compliance from every angle. The air seemed to charge and spark between them, making every fiber in her body hum in anticipation. Finally, he stopped in front of her, his stance wide, and unbuttoned his jeans. Her tongue darted out and moistened her lips as he freed his impressive erection from his boxers. He stroked his cock and stepped forward, bringing it within centimeters of her face. \u201cOpen that pretty mouth of yours. I\u2019ll show you how to please me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted and he grabbed a fistful of her hair, pulling so tightly her scalp tingled. He tilted her head to the angle he wanted and without any additional warning, slid his cock into her mouth with a deep, satisfied groan. His utterly male flavor filled her mouth and she closed her eyes, savoring the taste of salt and musk and arousal. Slowly, she ran her tongue along the thick, smooth shaft, taking as much as she could, then eased back to lick the head. He twisted his fingers deeper in her hair and thrust forward, causing her to cry out around him. Not from pain, but from the heady feeling of him taking what he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t close your eyes, sugar. Look at me while you suck me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flew open and she lifted her gaze to him. His face was ravenous, like a man possessed. The laid-back Reid had left the building. Intense power and calm control sizzled off him, drowning her, arousing her. He stroked her cheek with his free hand as he eased deeper into her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good, sugar. You\u2019re going to take all of me. Relax your throat.\u201d</p><p>She followed his instructions, focusing on releasing the muscles and accepting him. Soon, he buried all the way to the hilt, a shudder stealing over him. \u201cAh, shit. That\u2019s right.\u201d He moved in long, steady thrusts, tapping the back of her throat with the smooth head. \u201cGod, your mouth is even better than I imagined.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist touching him any longer, she reached up and palmed his sac as she dragged her tongue along the thick vein on the base of his cock. He moaned, then abruptly pulled out, releasing her hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could touch me yet.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, shocked by the sudden absence of contact. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought it\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s your mistake. Your job isn\u2019t to think. It\u2019s to listen. To obey. You\u2019re mine, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I mean, yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her chin. \u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve gone home. A night alone would\u2019ve been a lot easier on you than dealing with me is going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need easy. I want you,\u201d she said, the steadiness of her voice not betraying her spiking anxiety.</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you ask for.\u201d He dropped his hand from her face. \u201cGet on the bed. Facedown.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the edge of the mattress and climbed onto the bed with wobbly limbs. As she scooted along the sheets, the cool cotton caressed her burning skin, making her hyperaware of her nudity. Reid\u2019s eyes followed her progress, and he made no attempt to hide his perusal of her most intimate areas. Her body ached for those heated gazes to turn into touches.</p><p>Once she reached the center, she flipped over and settled on her stomach. Nerves skittered down her spine, the intense vulnerability of the position testing her resolve to follow his instructions. What exactly was he planning to do? She trusted the Reid she\u2019d become friends with, but this version of him was unfamiliar\u2014dangerous. She knew he was trying to prove a point to her, but how far would he take it?</p><p>The loud sound of ripping fabric filled the room. She craned her neck around and found Reid tearing a pillowcase into strips. He also had removed the tieback cord from the drapes and had that hanging around his neck. \u201cEyes down, LeBreck.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face forward again, and he walked to the side of the bed. Strong fingers lifted her left wrist, and smooth material wrapped around it. She peeked at him from underneath her lashes as he knotted the makeshift bindings. The question bubbled to her lips before she could stop it. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sidelong glance and tightened the strap. \u201cYou just can\u2019t give up the control, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he took another strip of pillowcase and smiled. A blindfold. Shit. With swift movements he slipped it over her eyes, pulling the knot taut in the back. Then a loud crack broke the quiet of the room, and her ass cheek lit on fire. She cried out, the sound muffled by the mattress.</p><p>\u201cLearn to keep your questions to yourself.\u201d</p><p>She balled her fists, ready to end it, to insist he stop. He\u2019d hit her. But then warm, pleasant heat replaced the stinging in her skin, and her pussy throbbed in response. Fuck. What was wrong with her? She wasn\u2019t supposed to like this. This was to help it get out of his system, not to inspire interest in hers.</p><p>Footsteps padded on the carpet, and another strip wound around her right wrist. Reid\u2019s hot palms slid up her arms, then moved her hands to rest above her head on the bed so he could bind her wrists together. Something silky brushed against the tops of her hands\u2014the braided cord from the curtain. With a grunt and yank on the cord from Reid, her muscles were stretched, drawing her arms taut above her and securing her to the headboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Instinctively, she tugged back, but the restraints only provided a hair of slack. She buried her face in the sheets and tried to steady her breathing. She was at his mercy. Blind and bound for whatever he chose to do to her.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees.\u201d He gripped her waist and helped her tuck her knees beneath her. Her face and breasts remained against the sheets, the restraints not allowing her to rise any higher. A gentle hand caressed her ass, smoothing over the area he had hit. \u201cDo you know how fucking sexy you look with my handprint marking you?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, but didn\u2019t dare speak.</p><p>His finger traced the cleft of her ass, brushing across her most private opening. She automatically tensed. \u201cI have to tell you, Brynn. Spanking such a beautiful ass could get addictive. I\u2019m not sure if I got enough out of the first time.\u201d</p><p>Before she could process what he was saying, the flat of his palm landed a sharp blow on her opposite cheek. She bit her lip and moaned, the pain/pleasure mix rocketing through her. \u201cCan you take it, sugar? Handle what I\u2019m planning to dish out?\u201d</p><p>She braced herself as his hand came down again and again, covering her ass and the backs of her thighs with stinging heat. He never slapped the same spot twice, but instead methodically covered every inch of virgin skin with his attention. Her back arched and she writhed, the heady buzz of pain and endorphins overloading her system and fogging her brain. To her mortification, hot moisture leaked down her thighs as if her body were begging for more.</p><p>When the spanking ceased, gentle hands moved over her skin, soothing her. His voice was choppy, his breathing quick. \u201cHave I scared you enough yet, Brynn? Are you ready to run?\u201d</p> <p>She moaned into the sheets, half out of her mind with need. \u201cFor the love of God, please touch me.\u201d</p><p>His hands stilled as if he was shocked by her words. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She parted her knees, opening herself to him, not caring at the moment what kind of girl that made her. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, he moved his hand between her legs and dragged his fingers down her folds. Her entire body trembled, and a deep groan rumbled from his chest. \u201cJesus. You\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p><p>Her hands flexed and fisted in the bindings as he pulled away. If he didn\u2019t do something soon, she was going to lose it. Her words came out in a barely coherent jumble. \u201cI need... I... You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of clothes rustling filled her ears. Lord, she wished she could see him and touch his bare skin, but she knew she wouldn\u2019t be granted that privilege tonight. He was trying to punish her, to scare her away. Only it wasn\u2019t working. She wanted him more.</p><p>The crackling of what she assumed was a condom wrapper replaced the other sounds, and the bed dipped around her. Strong hands grasped her hips and lifted, raising her backside fully and spreading her thighs to bare everything to him.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want, Brynn?\u201d The blunt head of his cock pressed against her opening.</p><p>She tried to back into him, to force him into her, but the arm bindings bit into her wrists, holding her in place. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me what you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath quickened and the ache inside her hit the point of pain. \u201cFuck me, Reid. Please, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>With one swift thrust he buried himself inside her, causing her to arch and gasp. Her tissues stretched taut, trying to accommodate his size. She\u2019d only been with one other guy, and he hadn\u2019t been nearly this big. Being filled so completely was overwhelming.</p><p>Reid hummed with pleasure, but held himself still inside her. \u201cFuck, baby, you\u2019re tight. Am I hurting you?\u201d</p> <p>The small break in his hardened demeanor made her melt beneath him. She shook her head, all of her senses on fire. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and the bed dipped again as he leaned down and draped his hard chest against her back. One hand slid down her stomach to her pelvis and parted her curls. With a roughened finger, he stroked her clit, and began to pump into her from behind. Lightning rushed through her veins as she tiptoed on the edge of release. In and out. The sweet glide of him against her delicate tissues driving her mad. She gritted her teeth, trying to hold herself back from falling into the abyss. She would wait for his permission. Would prove that she could do it.</p><p>Sweat slicked their bodies as Reid picked up the pace and relentlessly fucked her, stroking her hot button all the while. \u201cYou ready, baby?\u201d</p><p>Her body quivered beneath him, no longer in her conscious control. \u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Brynn.\u201d His fingers pinched her clit and rolled it between his fingers, eliciting a scream from deep in her throat. Her nerve endings exploded, electric bliss crashing over her in all-encompassing waves.</p><p>She continued to cry out with each ripple of climax, her voice turning hoarse way before she was able to quiet herself. Reid increased his tempo, diving into her with frantic thrusts. Her body rippled around him, milking him with her orgasm, and a low moan sliced through the air as he found his own release.</p><p>When they both had gone silent and their breathing had slowed, he pressed his lips to the spot between her shoulder blades and eased out. Her legs collapsed beneath her, and she sank fully into the bed, too exhausted to even lift her head. She had no idea what Reid was doing, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care. Her eyelids fluttered closed behind the blindfold.</p><p>\u201cHey, wake up, sugar,\u201d Reid said, putting a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Brynn blinked, the lamplight of the room burning her eyes. \u201cDid I fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>He brushed the dampened hair off her forehead, his expression guarded. \u201cJust for a few minutes. I tried to let you rest for a little while, but we should probably get out of here. Jace\u2019s sister will be home in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>She lifted herself on her elbows and saw that she was no longer bound and that Reid had thrown a blanket over her. \u201cCan you get my clothes?\u201d</p><p>He stood and grabbed her things from the floor. \u201cHere, do you need me to help you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the blanket off her and rose to her feet, shivering from the sudden chill. Reid shoved his hands in his pockets, looking like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world but here. She slipped her panties on and the material brushed against her the tender skin on her bottom. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>Reid cringed and dragged a hand through his already disheveled hair. \u201cHell, Brynn, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t believe I did this. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I asked for it. I wanted you to.\u201d</p><p>He sat his chin on top of her head and rubbed her bare back. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t ever let it happen again. I\u2019m done with this.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on his chest and stepped back. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows scrunched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her bra off the floor and put it on, then hauled her dress over her head, anger tainting the mellow afterglow she\u2019d been enjoying. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t enjoy yourself?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath and leaned against the windowsill. \u201cI hit you, Brynn. Used you. Talked to you like I owned you. You don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>She zipped up the back of her dress and narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou loved it.\u201d</p><p>His frown lines dipped deeper, and he turned his back to her, looking out the window toward the swimming pool outside. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like this. I want a normal relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest as she toed on her shoes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be with someone who\u2019s lying to me. If you want to date me, you either come into it as you are\u2014quirks and all\u2014or go find someone else to play pretend with.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, staring at her in the reflection in the window. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to explore this, I\u2019m game. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re signing up to get married. We have a summer. I like you, you like me. And tonight was... pretty incredible. So, you decide.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cAnd if I just want to go back to a normal relationship?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt won\u2019t be with me. I don\u2019t want to spend my time wondering if you\u2019re satisfying this need with some other girl while playing Mr. Perfect around me.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped. \u201cBe careful on your drive home, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>Fury boiled low in her belly and her cheeks burned. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to walk me out?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn to look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>Soft classical music wrapped around Brynn as she inhaled deeply through her nose, counted to five, then blew the breath out through her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRelax your hands, sweetie. You\u2019ve got them clenched so hard, you\u2019re going to make your palms bleed,\u201d Melody said in a quiet voice.</p><p>Brynn sighed and sat up from her reclined position on the couch. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>Mel frowned and crossed her hands in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s relaxation therapy, not surgery. Maybe you should take a Valium.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, \u2019cause that\u2019s what I want to do\u2014be drugged up when I hand myself over to a stranger.\u201d</p><p>Mel pressed her lips together. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Brynn gathered her hair in her hands and held it off her neck, trying to cool her sweating skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to frigging faint. Right there in the middle of a sex club. Like one of those goats.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cGoats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the ones who freeze up and faint when they\u2019re startled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds hilarious,\u201d Mel said, then waved her hand. \u201cI mean, the goats, not you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Brynn sank back into the couch and let her hair fall around her shoulders. How could she treat countless clients for post-traumatic stress and not even be able to talk herself down from a panic attack? She ran her hands over her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d</p><p>Mel stood and crossed the few steps to Brynn, then kneeled in front of her, taking her hands in hers. \u201cBrynn, you are the most kick-ass chick I know and are stronger than this fear. You\u2019re going to be able to do this. If not for yourself, then for your sister.\u201d</p><p>Brynn gave her hands a squeeze. \u201cThanks, Mel.\u201d</p><p>A light tap sounded on the door, and Mel rose to unlock it. Cooper poked his head in. \u201cThere\u2019s a car here for you.\u201d</p><p>Brynn nodded. \u201cThanks, tell them I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He looked from Mel, then back to Brynn. \u201cYou gonna be okay, darling?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cMel told you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI dragged it out of her. We\u2019re all just worried about you. You know how the safe word thing works, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Cooper. I don\u2019t want to discuss this with you. I\u2019m mortified that you even know where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his shoulder against the doorframe. \u201cReally, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ve been to a club before. I would never judge you.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow, but kept her questions to herself. She didn\u2019t need to know that much about her boss. \u201cI need to get going. They apparently start initiations promptly at eight.\u201d</p><p>Both Mel and Cooper gave her tight hugs, and she shuffled off to her office to grab the suitcase she\u2019d brought into work. The Ranch had insisted on a driver picking her up, saying that only members were allowed parking spaces. But she suspected it was really just another way to show her submission to the process.</p><p>She walked past Reid\u2019s office, but the door was closed. Just as well. She\u2019d been avoiding him since Monday, and the last thing she needed was for him to see her in this state. He\u2019d be able to pick up on her fear from thirty yards away. Even after all these years, the man still seemed to be able to read her as if she were wearing a billboard with emoticons on it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She rolled her bag out of her office and into the front lobby where a lanky, young man waited in one of the chairs. When he saw her, he rose to his feet and straightened his pinstripe suit. \u201cMs. LeBreck?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Adam, I\u2019ll be driving you this evening. Here, let me take your bags.\u201d</p><p>She passed the handle of her suitcase to him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She followed him outside and shivered. The air had turned cooler, and she wished she\u2019d chosen to wear something besides a sleeveless blouse and linen pants. She rubbed her arms as she rounded the building and turned toward the parking lot. A sleek limo waited for her at the curb and her stomach tightened. She was really going to do this.</p><p>Adam pressed a button on his keypad and popped open the trunk, loading her things inside, then turned to her. \u201cYou ready, Ms. LeBreck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d she said, her voice wavering a bit.</p><p>His lips tilted up, the gesture softening his dark looks. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to be nervous. But just go with it. The anticipation can enhance the experience.\u201d</p><p>Or kill her. One or the other. She gave him a wan smile, and he yanked open the door for her. With one last steadying breath, she stepped forward and climbed in. To her surprise, Adam slid in right behind her. She cocked her head. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to prepare you,\u201d he said, grabbing a small bag from the floorboard.</p><p>She inadvertently scooted backward. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He dug through the bag and pulled out a pair of handcuffs and a blindfold. He held them in front of her. \u201cYour submission starts now, Ms. LeBreck. The safe word at The Ranch is Texas. Now please put out your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to get to see where the hell you\u2019re taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands, Ms. LeBreck. You asked to participate. These are the rules.\u201d</p><p>Son of a fucking bitch. She gritted her teeth and held out her arms. With two quick clinks, he locked the cuffs around her wrists.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>She parked her bound hands in her lap and moved to face away from him. The silk sash slid over her eyes, blocking out all remnants of light. She forced herself to take deep breaths as her nervous system threatened to go into red alert mode. Adam grabbed her shoulders, and she almost jumped out of her skin. \u201cRelax. I\u2019m just leaning you back, so I can get your seat belt on.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut behind the sash and fought the frightened tears that brimmed her lids. This man wasn\u2019t going to hurt her; he was doing his job. She had to calm down or she was going to blow it before she even got to the damn place. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He finished strapping her in, and the seat dipped as he moved away. \u201cSettle in. We have a bit of a ride in front of us.\u201d</p><p>Jace sat on the edge of the couch in The Ranch\u2019s staging room, his foot tapping. Where was she? Had she changed her mind? She should\u2019ve arrived by now.</p><p>He knew the other members were already starting to fill up the common room in anticipation of the new subs coming in. There would be three tonight, but Jace only cared about one. He\u2019d lied when he\u2019d told Brynn he wasn\u2019t going to be at The Ranch for this retreat. He couldn\u2019t let her know he\u2019d be available to be her dom because he knew she would\u2019ve taken him up on the offer. Subs weren\u2019t allowed to make many decisions, but the one they had complete control over was who to play with.</p> <p>No, he couldn\u2019t offer himself as a choice. He sank back against the sofa and groaned. Let no one ever accuse him of not keeping a fucking promise.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said she was scheduled for pickup at six,\u201d he said, glancing at the man sitting on the opposite couch.</p><p>Grant chuckled and propped his boot-clad feet on the coffee table, looking every bit the laid-back cowboy. \u201cThis one\u2019s important to you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an old friend. I know she\u2019s kind of nervous about all this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took a sip of his soda. \u201cShe should be here any minute. I\u2019ll go easy on her.\u201d</p><p>Jace didn\u2019t buy that for a second. Grant Waters hadn\u2019t built this level of privacy by chance. He was a master at reading people and didn\u2019t let anyone walk into the place without a thorough observation. Brynn would be no exception. He just hoped to hell Brynn could pull off the whole thing without Grant sensing she was hiding something.</p><p>A quick knock on the door made Jace sit up straight again. One of the staff girls poked her head in. \u201cMr. Austin, your girl just arrived. Are you ready for her?\u201d</p><p>Jace rubbed his palms on the legs of his pants and nodded. \u201cSure, Annalise. Just make sure they don\u2019t tell her my name. She\u2019s a friend and I\u2019d rather her not know who\u2019s preparing her.\u201d</p><p>The raven-haired girl arched a pierced eyebrow but kept her opinion to herself and nodded. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Adam led a blindfolded Brynn into the small room. Even in the soft light, Jace could see the anxiety cloaking her body. Her hands clenched and unclenched in the cuffs and her bottom lip looked puffy, like she\u2019d been gnawing on it.</p><p>Adam made sure Brynn was steady on her feet and released her elbow. \u201cMs. LeBreck, one of our masters is going to get you ready for the initiation while Mr. Waters, our owner, talks with you for a bit. Do you remember your safe word?\u201d</p><p>Her throat muscles visibly flexed as she swallowed. \u201cTexas.\u201d</p><p>Adam squeezed her shoulder and nodded at Jace. \u201cEnjoy yourself. We\u2019ll make sure to take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>Jace rose and crossed the room, the sound of his shoes echoing off the dark wood floors. He walked around Brynn slowly, knowing she\u2019d be able to sense him there and feel the vulnerability of her position. He needed to make this experience as authentic as possible.</p><p>Grant\u2019s low drawl came from behind him. \u201cWelcome to The Ranch, Ms. LeBreck. What name do you want to use while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>She startled at the sound of his voice, but recovered quickly. \u201cUm, Brynn is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Brynn. Now I just want you to relax. Master J is going to help get you ready for our members. And I\u2019m only here for the pleasure of seeing a new sub prepared for initiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-What exactly is involved in preparation?\u201d she asked, her words catching in her throat.</p><p>Jace frowned. He wanted Brynn to be keyed up. That was a normal sub response. But he hadn\u2019t expected her to be this frightened. He touched her elbow and she flinched.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he soothed.</p><p>Grant interrupted, saving Jace from having to reveal who he was by speaking. \u201cHe\u2019s just going to get you changed. He won\u2019t step over any lines because you aren\u2019t his, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders dipped and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a little freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Grant asked, putting his feet on the floor and sitting forward, his gaze no doubt taking in every nuance of Brynn\u2019s demeanor. \u201cYour file says that you\u2019ve had a previous D/s relationship. Is it fear of not knowing who your partner is going to be?\u201d</p><p>She gave a stiff shrug, and her lip began to tremble.</p><p>Oh, hell. Was she going to cry? Jace didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to keep his cover if she crumbled in front of him. A crying chick was his kryptonite. He pitched his voice lower and risked speaking. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and pulled her shoulders back, apparently fighting to keep her composure. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just haven\u2019t been able to give over control to anyone for a long time. You can start getting me ready. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, even though he knew she couldn\u2019t see him. His fingers trailed down her arm and then pressed the release on her cuffs. She rolled and stretched her wrists, while he moved his hands up to her neckline. He started unfastening her blouse, while Grant continued his questioning. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019ve resisted giving over control?\u201d</p><p>Jace reached the end of the buttons and slid her shirt off her shoulders, letting it fall to the floor. Goose bumps rose on her ivory skin and she shivered. He rubbed her bare arms with his palms, trying to chase the chill for her.</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, and Jace could tell Grant was measuring her every word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Grant said finally, his tone as smooth as silk. \u201cYou\u2019re holding something back.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Jace shot a warning glance over his shoulder. What had happened to going easy on her? But it was too late. Grant had that look in his eye\u2014the one that said he\u2019d switched into master mode.</p><p>\u201cTell us the real reason, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>She began to quiver beneath Jace\u2019s hold on her.</p><p>\u201cI... I was raped.\u201d</p><p>His hands stilled against her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I really don\u2019t want to talk about it. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to get past the fear.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. That was the personal reason she\u2019d alluded to in his office? So many questions rose in his throat\u2014who, when, and did Reid know? He\u2019d bet his left nut Reid had no idea. Otherwise, his friend would be in jail for killing the fucker who\u2019d hurt her. Shit. No wonder she was shaking like a frightened puppy.</p><p>Grant rose from the couch and came to stand in front of Brynn, his normally unreadable face full of concern. \u201cDo you want me to tell my members what you\u2019re dealing with so they can take that into account?\u201d</p><p>She wagged her head. \u201cNo, please don\u2019t tell anyone. I can\u2019t even believe I told you. I just want to blend in. No special treatment. And please,\u201d she said, her voice edging on desperate, \u201cMaster J, keep going.\u201d</p><p>Jace bent to slip off her heels, his mind still reeling, and Grant reached out and laid a gentle hand on her shoulder. He leaned forward a bit as if he was making eye contact with her despite her blindfold. \u201cBrynn, you\u2019re extremely brave to come here and do this. But you need to be careful. I\u2019m as concerned about the mental well-being of my customers as their physical safety. I don\u2019t want you to push yourself too far. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice sounding tiny in comparison to Grant\u2019s firm tone.</p><p>Grant continued, \u201cIf at any time you need out, a break, whatever, you use that safe word. There is no shame in exercising that right.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, straightening under his touch. \u201cThank you. But I\u2019ve given this a lot of thought. I want to do this. I need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I hope we can provide you with what you\u2019re seeking. I\u2019m going to let Master J finish getting you ready, but if you need anything while you\u2019re here, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Grant stepped away and slipped out of the room, nodding at Jace as he left.</p><p>Jace eased her pants down her legs, then ran a palm along her calf to indicate she should step out of them. Once he gathered all her things from the floor, he rose and took in the view.</p><p>God, she was a gorgeous girl. Even though years had passed, she looked as sexy as she had that first night he\u2019d seen her strip for Reid in his driveway\u2014all curves and soft femininity, her creamy skin standing out in contrast to her black satin bra and panties. But who knew under all that softness was a woman tough enough to suffer a rape, then come to a place like this to try to heal herself. He shook his head in awe.</p><p>Whomever she ultimately decided to give her submission to was one lucky bastard.</p><p>He just hoped to God she\u2019d choose correctly and not hand herself over to someone who could exploit her fear.</p><p>Brynn could feel Master J\u2019s eyes on her and wondered what was going through his mind. She couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d told him and Grant about the rape. But now she was glad she had. Despite her raging anxiety, telling them the truth about why she was here\u2014or at least part of it\u2014had somehow managed to ease her down from a panic attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bind you now, Brynn. Just relax,\u201d said Master J, who\u2019d been silent most of the time she\u2019d been in here.</p><p>She tilted her head, something about the way he\u2019d said her name giving her pause, but then the thought flew from her mind when his fingers touched her throat.</p> <p>Master J wound something around her neck. The smell of new leather filled her nose, and fingers of fear wrapped around her windpipe again. After a quick clink of metal, he tugged at the collar. \u201cIs that too snug?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed past the tightness in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>His footfalls echoed off the floor as he moved behind her. A warm hand gathered her wrists and bent her arms behind her back into L-positions. Leather cuffs locked around them and when she tested the hold, the collar around her neck pressed against the hollow of her throat, causing her to cough.</p><p>\u201cEasy. It\u2019s all connected to a strip down your back. Move one thing, it moves all of it.\u201d</p><p>Officially trapped. She bit her lip and nodded. She would... not... cry. This was just sex. Sex. It was supposed to be fun. Used to be great. None of these guys were here to rape her. There were rules and surveillance cameras. She had her safe word.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach threatened to heave.</p><p>Master J clasped her upper arm and eased her forward on her bare feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk you into our common room. All the members interested in taking on a new sub will be there. You are to remain on your knees with your head down until someone addresses you. If someone wants to take you on, they will stand in front of your post. Only after everyone has made their selections will your blindfold come off. At that point, you\u2019ll be able to choose who you want to be with. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want any of them?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cThen you go home.\u201d</p><p>The squeak of a door swinging open made her suck in a breath. The soft buzz of conversation washed over her as the air temperature around her warmed. They had arrived. A crowded room, and she was half-naked and bound for all to see. Her legs wobbled beneath her, and Master J\u2019s grip tightened on her arm to keep her from falling. \u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p> <p>A few more steps and he halted her. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>He helped her bend, and her knees landed on a soft pallet. His hand ran along the back of her hair. \u201cChoose wisely, doll.\u201d</p><p>She reared up like someone had pinched her. Only one person had ever called her doll. She turned her head and opened her mouth to ask the question, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking.\u201d And with that she heard his footsteps fade.</p><p>Well, hell.</p><p>A sharp tinkling sound cut through the hum of voices\u2014metal on a wine glass she guessed. \u201cMembers, it\u2019s time for the initiation. For those of you participating tonight, please step forward. For those here to watch, please have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Brynn sat back on her calves and flexed her fingers, her arms starting to tingle from the restricted position. This was it. No turning back now. She said a silent prayer that she\u2019d get someone who would go easy on her. Heavy footfalls circulated around her, and the air shifted as people stepped into her space, bringing a mix of male scents to her nose\u2014cologne, soap, sweat. She set her mouth in a firm line and kept her expression smooth, determined to keep her fear hidden.</p><p>A finger pressed under her chin, lifting her face to some unknown suitor. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, beautiful?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart crashed against her ribs, her panic rising like mercury in a thermometer. She cleared her throat and tried to keep her voice even. \u201cBrynn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been in a D/s relationship before?\u201d asked another male voice.</p><p>\u201cOnce, a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>There were a few murmurs of approval, and the first man released her chin. Then a third voice, deep and melodic, chimed in. \u201cDid you love the guy or was it a casual relationship?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her forehead, confused by the question. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question, sub.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her jaw. \u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think you can keep it casual now?\u201d asked the first man.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know I can.\u201d</p><p>The men asked a few more questions, then the sound of the clinking glass hushed everyone again. \u201cTime to choose.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s head swam and sweat beaded her skin. She dug her nails into her palms and started counting backward from one hundred in her head, a habit she had picked up as a child when she\u2019d wake up from nightmares in an empty house.</p><p>Ninety-nine.</p><p>Feet shuffled around her.</p><p>Ninety-eight.</p><p>The strong smell of cigar smoke filled her head as someone else neared.</p><p>Ninety-seven.</p><p>What if she couldn\u2019t handle it? What if she was repulsed by all her choices? Tears gathered beneath her lids.</p><p>Ninety-six.</p><p>She tightened her fists and focused on the image of her sister when she was little\u2014blond pigtails and wide, trusting eyes\u2014before she and Kelsey had been tainted by the world around them. Brynn tilted her chin up.</p><p>Ninety-five.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter who was standing in front of her. She would do what she needed to do. She was tired of living with this crippling fear. And on top of that, her sister needed her. If she fainted like one of the damn goats, then so be it. A hand touched the back of her head and yanked at the knot on her blindfold.</p><p>Ninety-four.</p><p>The wisp of silk fluttered to the floor, and Brynn blinked as her eyes adjusted to the low lighting of the room. Three sets of shoes came into vision.</p><p>\u201cLift your head, Brynn, and choose your master.\u201d</p><p>Brynn raised her eyes and stared into the familiar blues of Reid Jamison.</p><p>TEN</p><p>then</p><p>Brynn yawned as she lifted the stack of files and set them on her desk. She hadn\u2019t gotten a lick of sleep the rest of the weekend. Every time she\u2019d laid her head down, images of her night with Reid had flooded her senses. How could the guy walk away from something like that? Why couldn\u2019t he just accept that he\u2019d enjoyed it? Yes, it was a little... alternative. But so what? Didn\u2019t people always say that the college years were the experimental ones?</p><p>She glanced over at Reid\u2019s work area. He had his head turned toward his computer screen and was typing away. He\u2019d barely looked in her direction all day. She plopped into her chair with a huff. What an asshole. Even if he didn\u2019t want to pursue anything with her, it was shitty to ignore her after he\u2019d slept with her.</p><p>She picked up the date stamp and started stamping each file with a little more vigor than necessary. The silent treatment was going to drive her mad. He should at least have the balls to face her and not cower behind his computer all day. Men. She finished the files and moved them to the side of her desk, then spun in her chair to grab the other stack off the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou stamp those things any harder, you\u2019re going to rip through the paper. I can hear you pounding away at them from across the room.\u201d</p><p>Brynn jumped at the interruption and swung around to face Reid. She slammed the new pile of folders on her desk with a heavy thunk. \u201cSo sorry, did I break your concentration?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down, palms splayed on the top of her desk. \u201cAm I sensing some hostility here, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, you\u2019re bright.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I sent you away. I needed to get my head straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it worked. It\u2019s apparently still stuck up your ass.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI guess I deserved that.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him and went back to stamping. Flip page. Stamp. Flip page. Stamp.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, stilling her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting request, considering you\u2019re the one who can\u2019t seem to bear a glance my way today.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her arm and scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cIt hurts to look at you.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cGee, you really know how to flatter a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Brynn. You know that\u2019s not what I mean. It\u2019s just every time I see you, I\u2019m reminded of how I treated you this weekend, how I lost control.\u201d</p><p>She shut the file folder and met his gaze. \u201cSeems like you were pretty in control to me.\u201d</p><p>His closed his eyes, and she noticed the deep bags beneath them for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know I probably made you feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath, his remorse taking the wind out of her tirade, and touched his arm. \u201cHey, stop making assumptions. Yes, you pissed me off sending me home without even walking me out. But you know what I felt before that?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his expression wary. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to respond, but she cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. You don\u2019t get how it is for me. I spend my days worrying about if I\u2019m going to have enough money. Am I doing right by Kelsey? Is my mom going to be okay if I leave and take my sister with me? And on and on it goes. The noise inside my head can be deafening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2014\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand, letting him know she wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cBut, for some reason, when you took control in the driveway, all those worries and stresses that race around my brain all day quieted. From that moment on, all I had on my mind was you and how you made me feel. It was... freeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the way I talked to you, the things I did...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere all things I could\u2019ve stopped at any moment. But I didn\u2019t want to. I knew you wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She wanted to reach out and grab his hand, but was afraid people in the office would start raising eyebrows. She placed her palms on her lap. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of you. Or of what happened this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am. I don\u2019t want to be that guy,\u201d he said, his tone making her chest ache. \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn into some monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster,\u201d she said, believing it with every ounce of her being.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen help me understand, Reid, because I can\u2019t be the only one who felt the... rightness of what happened between us.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head back and groaned. \u201cLook, go tell Davis you\u2019re leaving for your lunch break, then meet me in the parking lot. There\u2019s something I need to show you.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes and one painfully silent drive later they turned onto the winding driveway of the Jamison estate. Brynn had no idea what Reid was bringing her here to see, but getting a chance to check out where he lived was motivation enough for her. She\u2019d heard more than one story in the office about how amazing the Jamisons\u2019 house was. And the reality did not disappoint.</p><p>The sheer size of the plantation-style home astounded her\u2014the garden alone taking up more space than her rental house. She half expected Scarlett O\u2019Hara to pop her head out one of the windows and ask them inside for coffee and biscuits.</p><p>Reid had told her he lived in the guest space over the garage, so presumably the massive white mansion housed two people. Two! She shook her head. What must it be like to grow up with such luxury, such security? Never wondering if the lights were going to get cut off at the end of the month of if there would be enough money left over to buy groceries for the week. She couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some house.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and shot the house a derisive glance. \u201cNo one would ever accuse my aunt and uncle of doing anything halfway.\u201d He parked his car in front of the closed garage. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He led her up a flight of stairs on the side of the garage and unlocked his door. She stepped inside the apartment, and he bumped the door shut behind them. The living room was small, but cozy, and was open to the small efficiency kitchen. Camel-colored couches and dark wood furniture, a big-screen TV in the middle of the biggest wall. Practical, unpretentious. Probably the complete opposite of what resided in the main house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice place,\u201d she said, running her fingers along the back edge of the suede couch.</p><p>\u201cThanks, it works for me. Gives me a little privacy from everything.\u201d He tossed his keys on the kitchen counter. \u201cSit wherever you\u2019d like.\u201d</p> <p>She maneuvered around the front of the couch, but before she could sit, the purr of an engine outside made them both turn their heads. Reid stepped toward the window next to the door and peeked through the blinds. \u201cShit. Aunt Roslyn\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she was supposed to be at a luncheon today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too,\u201d he said, still peering through the window. \u201cDammit, she noticed my car and is headed this way.\u201d</p><p>Her heart picked up speed. \u201cCrap. She can\u2019t see me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry. Go in the bedroom and lock the door. I\u2019ll get rid of her.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn hustled through the small living area and into the bedroom, clicking the door shut behind her. She held her breath when she heard Roslyn\u2019s voice. The last thing Brynn needed was for the senator\u2019s wife to know she was... Well, she didn\u2019t know exactly what she was doing with Reid, but she doubted the woman would approve regardless.</p><p>Unable to resist, she pressed her ear against the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing home? You didn\u2019t cut out early did you? I told you no special privileges at the office,\u201d Roslyn said, her words clipped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my lunch break, Aunt Ros. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the office to talk to you and Molly said you left with the receptionist.\u201d</p><p>Brynn cringed on the other side of the door. Fucking Molly.</p> <p>\u201cBrynn needed a ride to pick up her car. It\u2019s been in the shop. It was on my way here, so I offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dropped her off already.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and Brynn imagined Roslyn was deciding whether she believed her nephew or not. \u201cIs that all there is to it\u2014a friendly favor? Don\u2019t lie to me, Reid. I\u2019ve noticed how chummy you\u2019ve gotten with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, how is that your business? I\u2019m not sixteen anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how old you are. I know you probably don\u2019t know a lot about that girl. Brynn\u2019s a decent worker, but we\u2019ve done background checks. Her family is... less than desirable.\u201d Roslyn had lowered her voice to where Brynn could barely decipher the words. \u201cAnd the press would have a field day if they found out you were... cavorting with her.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cCavorting? Come on. Nothing is going on, all right? We\u2019re friends. She needed a ride. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cYou better not be lying to me. I know she\u2019s probably a lot looser with her morals than the girls you\u2019re used to, but don\u2019t fall into the trap. Women like her have one thing on their mind when it comes to boys like you\u2014a paycheck. Touch her and she\u2019ll either be filing sexual harassment or getting pregnant and petitioning for support faster than you can say \u2018good-bye future.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not together. And anyway, she\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Roslyn\u2019s tone turned icy. \u201cThey\u2019re all like that. You need to get your head out of your pants and get things back on track with Vanessa. You\u2019re going to end up ruining your chance with her.\u201d</p><p>Reid made a frustrated sound, and Brynn stopped listening. She stepped away from the door and sank onto the edge of Reid\u2019s unmade bed, deflated. Was she ever going to escape her family background? Even a woman who treated her with the upmost politeness to her face secretly believed Brynn was a whore-in-training. Tears lined her lids, and she swiped at her eyes. She knew she should be used to the judgment by now, but hearing it from the lips of someone she respected wrenched her gut.</p><p>The door cracked open and Reid peeked in, quickly noticing her tears. \u201cSugar, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Brynn shook her head and tried to smile. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He strode over to her and put an arm around her. \u201cYou heard what she said.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Vanessa is just a girl I was seeing at the beginning of summer. I\u2019m not with her anymore.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just hard to hear what people really think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what everyone thinks of you,\u201d he soothed, rubbing her arm.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it though? The girls at work know I don\u2019t have money, so they think I\u2019m trash. Your aunt thinks I\u2019m trying to tempt you with my wanton ways. And you think something\u2019s wrong with me because I enjoyed the other night. Hell, maybe I do have warped morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said, his voice soft but firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m not screwed up, yet you believe there\u2019s something the matter with you because of what happened between us. Your logic sucks, Reid.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cListen, that\u2019s why I brought you here. Maybe I can help you understand. You\u2019re not the only one who wishes they could change their family background.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the bed and crossed over to a small desk stacked with textbooks and papers in the corner of the room. He yanked open a drawer, rifled through it, and pulled out a manila envelope. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He tossed it onto the bed and shoved his hands in his pockets, his posture turning rigid. She eyed him warily and picked it up. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s claim to fame.\u201d</p><p>She slid her fingers beneath the flap to pull out the contents. A yellowed newspaper clipping. The picture on the article was of an older man with Reid\u2019s features, but none of his warmth. Cold, gray eyes stared from the page, sending a ripple of uneasiness through her. The headline read Serial Rapist Caught. Her stomach flipped over. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrutalized thirteen women before he was arrested. Tied them up, beat them, raped them.\u201d His voice caught on the last part. \u201cMy mother was his sixth victim.\u201d</p><p>The breath left her lungs. Reid was born out of rape? Growing up, she\u2019d thought nothing could be worse than her situation\u2014not knowing who her father was. But man, she\u2019d been wrong. She glanced up and found Reid staring at his shoes, his shame and embarrassment palpable.</p><p>She set the article down on the bed and went to him, sliding her arms around his waist, though he kept his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and put his arms around her. \u201cNow do you see why we need to be careful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She pulled back so she could look at his face.</p><p>He threw his hands out to his sides. \u201cI came from a monster, Brynn. Half of me is from him. What if all these urges I have to dominate you are an early version of what he became? What if he started by just wanting to tie a girl up and spank her a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Reid, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head, her heart breaking for him. \u201cYou have as much in common with that man as Molly has with a brain surgeon. You can see it in the photo, that man has no heart, no soul.\u201d She cupped his face and met his eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2014you\u2019re all heart and soul.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, his eyes swirling with an amalgam of emotions. \u201cWhy do you keep putting your trust in me? I don\u2019t know if I trust myself.\u201d</p><p>She wound her arms around his neck and held his gaze. \u201cMy mom has dated abusive men. When guys like that walk into the room, it\u2019s like the air stops moving. My skin crawls and all I want to do is leave. But when you walk into the room, the opposite happens\u2014I\u2019m not scared. All I want to do is get closer to you. And get naked.\u201d</p><p>A laugh broke through his pained expression. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and stepped back. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not into me...\u201d</p><p>He hooked her waistband with one of his fingers and yanked her against him. \u201cNow hold up right there, sugar. I never said I wasn\u2019t into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do about it, then?\u201d she asked, her tone challenging.</p><p>His gaze met hers. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sank into his desk chair and pulled her down onto his lap. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m in. I\u2019m tired of struggling against my instincts when I\u2019m with you. So, let\u2019s try it your way. You want me to be myself, well, here I am.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did a little twirl in her chest. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and ran his thumb along her cheek. His eyes pleaded with her. \u201cYou just have to swear that if I ever do anything you don\u2019t want me to, you\u2019ll make me stop. We\u2019ll come up with a code word that means quit, but even with that, you have to promise you\u2019ll do whatever you need to get your point across. Don\u2019t let me push you too far.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and brushed her lips across his. \u201cI promise. I will totally kick your ass if you step out of line.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, the tension lines in his face softening and the heaviness in the air seeming to lift. His hand curled around her hip, and he put his forehead to hers. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve never told anyone about my dad besides Jace. I thought for sure you would run for the hills.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and shrugged. \u201cI refuse to believe that we\u2019re doomed to our parents\u2019 fate. If I bought into that logic, I may as well slit my wrists now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour outlook on life is such a ball of sunshine,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She tapped her temple. \u201cYep, like I told you, it\u2019s all rainbows and unicorns in here.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry smile and closed the space between them to claim her mouth in a heated kiss. Her lips parted, and she could feel the tension draining from both of their bodies as they gave themselves over to the simple pleasure of tasting each other\u2014an acceptance of each other\u2019s ugly histories and a promise to move forward despite it all.</p><p>He pulled away from the kiss, his cheeks flushed. \u201cYou know we still have a half hour before we\u2019re due back to the office? Maybe we should practice our new arrangement.\u201d</p><p>She shifted on his lap so that she could straddle him, and adjusted her skirt. Her panties brushed directly against the hardening erection in his pants, sending a dart of warmth through her. \u201cThat isn\u2019t very much time.\u201d</p><p>He shoved her skirt farther up her hips and with a yank, ripped off her panties.</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m supposed to go back to work in those,\u201d she protested.</p><p>He pulled the swath of material from under her and tossed the panties onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you some new ones. But for the rest of the day, I want to look across that office and know that there\u2019s only this thin skirt between me and what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>His fingers found her heat and glossed her clit with her juices. She tilted her head back, and his other hand unbuttoned her blouse and freed her breasts. His hot tongue sucked a needy nipple through the lacy material of her bra, then he bit hard enough for her to gasp. She moaned and rocked against his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sugar. I love how responsive you are for me. I can\u2019t wait to take you somewhere tonight, tie you up, and taste every delicious part of you. Make you beg for release.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. God, just his words could set her off.</p><p>\u201cBut right now\u201d\u2014he leaned back, undid his fly, and released his cock\u2014\u201cjust hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, sir.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Brynn swayed on her knees, the shock of seeing Reid in front of her hitting her like a bullet to the chest. She stared at him, a hundred questions coloring her thoughts. Why was he here? How had he even gotten in? And what the hell was he expecting\u2014that she was just going to jump at the chance to be with him after she\u2019d explicitly told him she never wanted him to touch her again? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His stern expression didn\u2019t answer any one of her silent demands.</p><p>\u201cYou need to choose your master, Brynn,\u201d said a well-dressed man standing to the left of Reid. She glanced at the man\u2019s tapered fingers; he held a chain, no, a leash. Oh. He was one of her choices, as was another shorter man on Reid\u2019s right. Shit. Both guys were attractive enough, but could she turn herself over to them\u2014put her trust in one of these strangers?</p> <p>Her gaze darted to the second man\u2019s waistband where a whip was attached, coiled like a sleeping snake. His fingers toyed with the handle as if his hand itched to wield it. Oh, hell no. Scratch him off the list. Anyone that eager to whip her wasn\u2019t going to go easy.</p><p>She tilted her face and ventured another glance at Reid. His expression remained smooth, but something in his eyes yanked her back in time\u2014back when she wanted nothing more than to give herself over to him, body and soul. Yes, he\u2019d burned her like no man had ever before or since, but he\u2019d also had moments of tenderness that had stilled her heart. He wouldn\u2019t physically hurt her. She knew that. Which was more than she knew about either of the other guys.</p><p>But could she temporarily seal off the wound that sent slicing pain through her anytime she was around Reid and see him as simply a means to an end for the few days they were here? At least behind closed doors she wouldn\u2019t have to pretend with him like she would the others. She inhaled deeply, causing the bindings on her arms to bite deeper into her skin, and held Reid\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she\u2019s made her pick,\u201d said the man with the leash.</p><p>Reid shook his head. \u201cNo, I want to hear you say the words, Brynn.\u201d</p> <p>Her fists clenched behind her. Why did he always have to push? Always make things more difficult than necessary? She put as much contempt as possible into her tone. \u201cI choose you, sir.\u201d</p><p>The set line of Reid\u2019s jaw relaxed, and he gave a slight nod. The other men looked mildly disappointed, but stepped away and melded back into the shadowed groups sitting around small tables near the bar on the other side of the room. Reid hooked a finger in the loop on her collar and his other hand on her elbow. \u201cOn your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d She eased to her bare feet, relying heavily on Reid for support. She\u2019d never realized how much she counted on her arms for balance. A few feet away, a gangly man who was hauling his own sub to her feet turned his head in their direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to talk without permission unless it\u2019s to say \u2018yes, sir\u2019 or your safe word,\u201d Reid said, his words loud enough for the other initiation pair to hear.</p><p>Oops. She dropped her gaze to the floor. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Reid said, and gave her ass a swat. \u201cNow move.\u201d</p> <p>She gritted her teeth. Was that a smile she heard in his voice? She bet the bastard was marinating in smugness. He\u2019d gotten his way, and now she couldn\u2019t even protest\u2014at least not when anyone could hear. She was only one slipup away from losing her chance to stay in the club. And now she was obligated to submit to whatever act Reid selected to demonstrate her submission in front of the group. Damn it all. She must\u2019ve really pissed off karma in some former life.</p><p>Reid guided her to a curved love seat at the edge of the staging area and moved his hand to her shoulder. \u201cOn your knees, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a steely glare. After being on her knees for far too long already, he wasn\u2019t going to let her sit on the plush couch?</p><p>He shook his head, a tsk passing his lips. \u201cSo defiant. You have three seconds to comply, or I\u2019ll make sure your upcoming show for everyone is much more unpleasant than what I have planned.\u201d</p><p>His words splashed over her like ice water. The show. Public submission. Her anger at Reid had momentarily drawn her thoughts away from what she was about to face\u2014humiliation, panic, possible fainting-goat behavior. The contents of her stomach threatened to make an appearance. She dropped to her knees, facing the open area she\u2019d just left.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Reid sank onto the couch behind her, placing a thigh on each side of her. He gave her hair a light stroke. \u201cYou can sit back on your calves. We\u2019re going to watch one of the others go before it\u2019s our turn.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and rested her butt on the backs of her legs, which offered a bit of relief. She wiggled her arms to try to get some of the tingling to stop, but the minute movement the bindings allowed was not enough to accomplish anything. Reid ran his fingers along the leather straps, grazing her skin along with it. His head dipped next to her ear. \u201cI forgot how fucking sexy you look when you\u2019re tied up for me\u2014just me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the Persian rug beneath her, her jaw tightening. She hadn\u2019t missed his dig. He still thought she\u2019d cheated on him. That she\u2019d been playing games with him the whole time they\u2019d dated. She could set him right, but what did it matter? Better for him to think that than know the truth\u2014that she\u2019d loved him with everything she had, only to find out later that he\u2019d been the one who\u2019d had a girlfriend the entire time. Asshole.</p> <p>She shifted forward infinitesimally, moving away from his touch, and he gave a low chuckle. Maybe she should have gone with the guy who had the whip\u2014that might have been less painful after all. Reid cupped her chin from behind and lifted her face toward the front. \u201cI want you to watch. The show\u2019s about to start.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted and locked on the scene before her. The gangly man was strapping a pixie-sized woman to a large wooden X in the front of the room. He\u2019d stripped off her clothes, and her freckled back seemed to quiver with anticipation each time the man locked another leather restraint in place. Sweat prickled Brynn\u2019s brow, and her heart seemed to take up residence in her throat. If Reid decided to strap her to something like that, she\u2019d surely lose it.</p><p>Before she spiraled into a full-scale panic, she dragged her stare away from the action and scanned the room, quickly noting with disappointment that her sister was nowhere in the audience. At least twenty other people dotted the tables and couches around them, some talking quietly and sipping drinks, others riveted by the tableau at the front of the room. If not for the provocative clothing and the occasional man or woman sitting at someone\u2019s feet, it could have been any high-end club. Glossy mahogany furniture, votive candles or fresh flowers on each table, a few cocktail waitresses milling around, even muted jazz in the background. The fact that all those lovely, refined people were there to watch and participate in public sex acts almost made Brynn laugh. It was all so absurd.</p><p>The sharp smack of leather on skin yanked her attention back to the front. The man held a riding crop in one hand and a telltale red mark darkened the woman\u2019s left thigh. \u201cNo squirming. You take what I give you without complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He dragged the crop along her back, slowly tracing each notch of her spine, the small of her back, the crack of her ass. The woman\u2019s back rose and fell with her quickening breaths, and Brynn felt her own breathing pick up tempo. The whole room had gone quiet, the man\u2019s practiced patience drawing them all in. He moved the crop between the woman\u2019s spread legs, caressing her with the flat of the leather. Gentle. Sensual. Brynn could almost feel the smooth material gliding along her own clit, imagining Reid as the one wielding the crop.</p><p>But before she could get carried away with her own images, the man gave a quick flick of the wrist and snapped the leather against the woman\u2019s sex, startling Brynn. The woman gave a sharp cry and her fists flexed in her bindings, but her body stayed stock-still.</p><p>\u201cVery good, pet,\u201d the man said, running his hand along the sensitized skin and earning another, softer whimper from her. He moved to a table lined with what looked like half of Jace\u2019s stock from Wicked and selected an impressively sized dildo. \u201cI think you\u2019ve earned a reward.\u201d</p><p>He stalked back toward his sub and, not bothering to give her any additional warning, he placed the blunt head of the dildo against her and pushed. Brynn winced, but the ease with which it slid in told her the woman was more than turned on by his treatment. With a slow smile, the gangly dom pulled a small remote out of his pocket and hit a button that sent a buzzing sound through the rapt room.</p><p>The woman reared up and let out a desperate moan. Vibrator.</p><p>\u201cI said no moving. And don\u2019t you dare come.\u201d The man lifted his riding crop again and rained blows across her ass, thighs, and back\u2014the smack of the leather filling the room and making Brynn\u2019s head spin. The woman\u2019s muscles tensed beneath the rapid assault, her pale skin quickly turning pink then red, and her cries becoming mewls of pleasure.</p><p>Brynn squeezed her eyes shut, her mind rocketing back to her and Reid\u2019s night at Jace\u2019s house\u2014how Reid\u2019s hands had reddened her bottom, the mind-numbing pleasure he\u2019d coaxed out of her. What would it be like to have him handle her like that again? Despite the fear that still shrouded her, a kernel of heat spread between her tightly closed legs.</p><p>She bit the inside of her cheek. No. She was not that girl anymore. She wanted to get past the fear, but this was not a lifestyle she wanted for herself. This was only the tool to get her where she needed to be\u2014to get her to the place where she could have a normal life again.</p><p>\u201cWho is your master, pet?\u201d the gangly man demanded.</p><p>Brynn forced her eyes open, determined to tamp down the dangerous memories.</p><p>The girl\u2019s back glistened with sweat and blotches of red. Her voice, as tiny as her frame, quivered when she spoke. \u201cYou are, Master K.\u201d</p><p>The man twirled the crop between his fingers. \u201cAre you sure? You don\u2019t sound too confident about that answer, pet. Do I need to remind you a little more?\u201d</p><p>Her words came out in breathy pants, clearly fighting the orgasm the vibrator was coaxing out of her. \u201cNo, sir. Please. I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>The man smoothed a hand over her ass, his erection straining against his leather pants, and then slid his fingers to her clit. A visible shudder ratcheted through the woman\u2019s body and her groan turned guttural. But just as quickly as he\u2019d touched her, the man withdrew his hand and grabbed his remote. The humming stopped. \u201cNot yet, pet. You haven\u2019t quite earned that. But I will accept your offer of submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Master K. Thank you,\u201d the woman said, her whole body sagging against her restraints.</p><p>Reid\u2019s hand touched Brynn\u2019s shoulder and she jumped. \u201cYou\u2019re all flushed, sugar. Saw something you liked?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>His tone dipped. \u201cSo if I slipped my hand between those gorgeous legs of yours, you wouldn\u2019t be all creamy for me?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips into a line. He wouldn\u2019t call her bluff like that, would he?</p><p>\u201cAh, silence is very telling, Brynn. Guess the girl I used to know is still in there somewhere, huh?\u201d The smile had returned to his voice.</p><p>If she were a cartoon character, smoke would have shot out of her ears, but she held her tongue. She refused to give him any additional fodder to make her punishment in front of the crowd worse. Reid had always enjoyed the power position a little too much and apparently he hadn\u2019t lost that proclivity.</p><p>The gangly dom released his woman from her bindings and slipped a silky robe around her shoulders. She leaned into him, and a trembling smile crossed her makeup-streaked face as he led her past the crowd and out a door at the back of the room. The second they disappeared from view, the crush of anxiety squeezed Brynn\u2019s chest. She was next.</p><p>A man in a crisp white shirt, dark jeans, and cowboy boots rose from one of the tables and headed to the front of the room. All eyes followed him, and Reid shifted restlessly behind her. The man\u2019s casual dress and mussed dark hair did nothing to diminish the air of importance and power that rolled off him. Brynn had the urge to sit up straighter. He graced the audience with a smile that probably melted the panties off most of the women in room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Reid leaned forward and whispered against her ear, \u201cThat\u2019s Grant. The owner.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Grant glanced in her direction and gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cLadies and gentleman, our next initiation will be given by a new member. Please welcome Master Reid to our ranks.\u201d</p><p>Reid rose and clasped Brynn\u2019s elbow. \u201cUp.\u201d</p><p>A quiet smattering of applause followed them as she and Reid made their way to the front. Brynn\u2019s arms ached and her legs had trouble remembering how to work. She stumbled slightly before reaching their destination, and Reid drew her closer to his side. Grant shook Reid\u2019s free hand.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to The Ranch, we\u2019re glad to have ya,\u201d he said, the now familiar deep West Texas drawl coloring his words.</p><p>Reid nodded. \u201cPleased to join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely sub there. What do you think she needs for an initiation?\u201d</p><p>Brynn kept her eyes on the polished wood floors and began counting. If she looked up or thought about what was about to happen, she\u2019d tip over the edge. Already, her heart was pounding hard enough to splinter a rib. Please let Reid pick something simple. A blow job. A quick, unrestrained spanking. She could maybe handle something basic. But blindfolds and handcuffs or helplessness would guarantee flashbacks and panic. She inhaled deeply through her nose and blew the breath out her mouth. In. Out. In. Out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to have to use the safe word, knew from Grant\u2019s concerned words earlier that if she broke down, he\u2019d probably send her home\u2014for her own mental health.</p><p>Reid ran a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cWell, I think my sub is feeling feisty. She\u2019s talked back to me multiple times since I chose her, so a punishment is in order.\u201d</p><p>Brynn dared a glance up. Talked back? When?</p><p>Grant eyed her, evaluating her reaction. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Reid continued, \u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure of spending time with this sub in the past, and I know she\u2019s big on the exhibitionism. So I refuse to grant her the pleasure of displaying herself in front of the group. She hasn\u2019t earned such a privilege yet.\u201d</p><p>Brynn bit her lip. What was he doing? Was he actually going to save her from having to deal with this? Oh, please, maybe she had misjudged his earlier behavior.</p><p>\u201cBut I still want her to demonstrate her submission. So, I\u2019m going to get the one thing that will make sure she knows she\u2019s giving herself to me personally and not just any random master.\u201d Reid pinched her chin between his thumb and forefinger and forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cA kiss.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. What?</p><p>Reid\u2019s mouth curved upward. \u201cRelease her bindings.\u201d</p><p>One of the attendants standing near the back of the room stepped up and started unfastening the leather straps as the reality of Reid\u2019s request sliced through her. She should\u2019ve been happy. A kiss was as simple an act as you could get... but also the most intimate. If he\u2019d have forced her to her knees and made her get him off, she would\u2019ve had the outside chance of blocking out what was happening\u2014thought of numbers or England or her grocery list. But how could she zone out with his lips against hers?</p><p>Her tingling arms fell to her sides and she balled her fists. Reid was doing this to punish her. What had he said? To make sure she knows she\u2019s submitting to me personally. God, hadn\u2019t ten years been long enough for him to get over her supposed infidelity? She narrowed her eyes at him. Nope, not with an ego the size of his.</p><p>Once all the leather had been removed, the attendant and Grant moved away, leaving her alone with Reid. He hooked an arm around her waist and dragged her against him, wickedness glinting in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s see if this is better than a stranger.\u201d</p> <p>She shot him her best I-hate-you look before he brought his lips down on hers.</p><p>Despite his firm grip, his kiss was teasing. His lips moved against hers\u2014nibbling, tasting, drawing her in like a moth to light. The tension in her muscles softened in his grasp, and something white hot and long dormant unfurled inside her. As if on their own volition, her lips parted and granted his tongue access. The taste of mint and Reid danced in her mouth, and her arms looped around his neck. When she pressed her breasts against his solid chest, she couldn\u2019t tell if the groan that reached her ears was his or her own.</p><p>Reid groaned as Brynn\u2019s half-naked body molded against his. Shit. He\u2019d thought a kiss would be the safest route to go since he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to control himself if he\u2019d chosen something more sexual. He sure as hell didn\u2019t want to fuck her when she had no option to say no. But he\u2019d forgotten that a kiss with Brynn had never been just a kiss. The moment his lips had touched hers, he\u2019d wanted to strip her down and take her in front of all these goddamned people.</p><p>Her superior acting skills weren\u2019t helping matters either. She was kissing him back with the fervor of a sub set on pleasing her master. His cock swelled against his dress pants. Fuck, how was he going to make it through the weekend? Regretfully, he slipped a hand into her hair and tugged gently to separate her from their kiss. He sucked in a haggard breath, trying to reclaim his cool control. She stared at him with question marks in her eyes.</p><p>He had to clear his throat twice before he was able to speak. \u201cWho\u2019s your master?\u201d</p><p>As if snapping out of a daze, she straightened her shoulders. \u201cYou are, sir.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his grip on her hair. \u201cUse my name, sub. I don\u2019t want you confused on who you\u2019re supposed to please.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, defiance flaring in them. \u201cYou are, Master Reid.\u201d</p><p>Reid didn\u2019t miss the cocked eyebrow Grant gave him at Brynn\u2019s snarky tone. He palmed the back of Brynn\u2019s skull, drawing her face closer. \u201cYou need to drop the smart mouth or you\u2019ll force me to gag you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t drop her gaze.</p><p>Dammit. Why couldn\u2019t she play by the rules for a change? He couldn\u2019t show weakness in front of this group or Grant. \u201cI think you need to learn some manners, sub. You get off on being defiant, don\u2019t you? Dip your fingers in that tight pussy of yours and show everyone how wet you are.\u201d</p><p>Shock crossed her features, and he could hear her silent plea, but he couldn\u2019t back off. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait. It displeases me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted toward the crowd, then to the floor. With a shaking hand, she slipped her palm beneath the band of her panties and dipped her fingers inside. The visual alone sent all his blood rushing to his groin, his cock turning to steel. She removed her hand and raised it to him, shame coloring her cheeks.</p><p>The evidence of her arousal glistened along her fingers, the sweet scent of her juices tickling his nose. His zipper pressed into his sensitive skin as his erection flexed against it, begging for relief. Without thinking, he circled her wrist and lifted it to his mouth, sucking the honey from her fingers. He closed his eyes, savoring her flavor and the fact that he could still turn her on even through all that ire.</p><p>His eyelids lifted slowly, and he found Brynn\u2019s attention riveted on his mouth. He lowered her hand. \u201cWho made you so wet, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his feet. \u201cYou did, Master Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t forget who you belong to.\u201d Reid pulled a strip of leather from his back pocket and slipped the collar around Brynn\u2019s neck. Once it was secured, he grabbed a chain off a nearby supply table and hooked the leash to the loop on the collar. \u201cThere, maybe this will remind you of your role. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He led her from the open area to the table Grant was sitting at. Grant gave Brynn a long look, then gave Reid a knowing smile. \u201cI think you\u2019ve found a good pairing.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension in Reid\u2019s shoulders eased. They\u2019d fooled the most important person\u2014at least for now. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think she may need some time in my room before I allow her to participate in any club fun, though.\u201d</p><p>Grant nodded. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. Have her sign the waiver then feel free to use your private room however you like. Activities will be going on in the common areas all evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be around later,\u201d Reid said, and tugged at Brynn\u2019s chain. \u201cCome on, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Reid could see the tight set in her jaw, but he knew Brynn wouldn\u2019t break character now. She ducked her head in deference and played sub, following him through the crowd of onlookers. Even though he knew it was all an act, seeing the beautiful blonde under his command flipped all his erotic switches.</p><p>During his four-year marriage to Vanessa, he\u2019d tried to shut the dominant part of himself off so he could be the man she and his family had wanted him to be. His wife had found the whole idea of D/s abhorrent and hadn\u2019t been open to doing anything but once-a-week vanilla sex. The minute he\u2019d even suggested trying anything kinky she\u2019d thrown his father\u2019s history in his face, knowing exactly how to make him feel like shit. The whole thing had been miserable for them both.</p><p>The only moments of indulgence he had allowed himself was the occasional jerk-off session when he\u2019d let his mind travel back to those few glorious months with Brynn before the bottom had fallen out. Transport himself back to the only time in his life he ever remembered being truly happy.</p><p>And now, here she was, right next to him\u2014wet and wanting\u2014a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked. Too bad she despised him. And if she found out he was here to get information from her sister for the appeal and not simply out of chivalry, she\u2019d really be ready to castrate him.</p><p>They exited the main room and entered a wide hallway with chocolate brown walls and soft sconce lighting. All noise except the gentle padding of their feet on the plush carpet ceased. He eyed the red lights of the strategically placed security cameras and drew Brynn next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you make me do that?\u201d she demanded in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t challenge me as a dom in front of everyone. If I hadn\u2019t punished you, they would\u2019ve gotten suspicious. And I tried to pick something that was as... non-intrusive as possible. I could\u2019ve done anything I wanted to you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulder sagged against him, the reality of his words settling in. They walked in silence for a few moments before she spoke again, her tone decidedly less hostile this time. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tomb in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rooms are soundproof so no one interrupts anyone else\u2019s scene. Although, those things that look like mirrors can actually be lifted if the people inside want to allow people to watch.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJesus, they\u2019re not messing around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes down, sugar. The cameras can\u2019t hear us, but they can see us. Make sure you look like a sub.\u201d</p><p>She followed his instructions, but didn\u2019t stop talking. \u201cWhy are you here, Reid?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and guided her around a corner, guilt about his real reason gnawing at him. \u201cBecause I knew you were full of shit when you said you were okay submitting to some stranger. And I figured it\u2019d be easier to find your sister if you didn\u2019t have to pretend with someone twenty-four seven. You could\u2019ve gotten a guy who wanted to lock you in his room for the whole weekend, and you wouldn\u2019t have even had a chance to look.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered at the thought. \u201cBut why do you care?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his neck tightened. \u201cBecause despite what you may think, I\u2019m not heartless, Brynn. You\u2019ve been through a lot. I don\u2019t want to see you or your sister go through any more tragedy.\u201d</p><p>At least that much was true.</p><p>She glanced up at him, and for a moment, the mask dropped, revealing the stark fear beneath it. The worry in her big green eyes stirred up a fierce protectiveness deep within him. He had the urge to reach out and pull her in for an embrace.</p><p>He peeked over his shoulder and dipped his head next to her ear just in case anyone was listening. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, sugar. I was going to wait to tell you until we got to our room, but I\u2019ve already confirmed that Kelsey is here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Her eyes widened, hope filling them. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I flirted with the girl at the front desk earlier. I got her to leave her post for a second and was able to peek at the employee schedules. There\u2019s a Kiki listed in the sub training slot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank God.\u201d The relief was visible in every inch of her stance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the only problem is anyone in training is on lockdown with their master\u2014no outside contact unless the master allows it. So it\u2019s not like we can go make a social call at whatever cabin or room she\u2019s staying in. We\u2019re going to have to wait for her master to bring her out.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t let her out for the whole time she\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if that were the case. If he\u2019s training her to work here, he\u2019s going to want to expose her to as much as possible\u2014public displays, special equipment, et cetera. I think we\u2019re just going to have to keep our eyes peeled, try to blend in, and participate in as many of the group functions here as possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, some unreadable expression crossing her face. \u201cRight. Participate.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cWow, is being here with me really that horrible? You didn\u2019t have to pick me, you know.\u201d</p><p>She turned and started walking again. \u201cNot everything is about you, Reid. Let\u2019s just leave it at\u2014I appreciate your help, alright?\u201d</p><p>Biting back a sigh, he caught up to her and swung open the exit door, and the damp night air washed over them.</p><p>She shivered and crossed her arms over her barely concealed breasts. \u201cWhich way are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rented one of the private cabins. It\u2019s just a few yards down that path.\u201d He glanced down at her and watched goose bumps rise on her exposed skin. He let the door click shut behind them and hooked the leash to his belt. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>With quick fingers, he unbuttoned his blue dress shirt and shrugged out of it, leaving him in just his gray slacks. Brynn\u2019s eyes darted to his bare chest. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>He smirked. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have a quick fuck right here against the wall. Break the ice.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a you-must-be-on-crack look.</p><p>He shook his head, glad to be back in comfortable territory. Exchanging barbs with her kept them both safe. Kept him from examining the little whispers of old feelings she\u2019d stirred with that kiss. He handed her the shirt. \u201cHere. I wouldn\u2019t be a very good master if I let my woman freeze to death before reaching the room.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the shirt and wrapped it around herself, the bottom reaching her mid-thigh. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m not sure what they did with my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they have a closet full in our cabin.\u201d He turned his attention to her bare feet, then to the slate stone path leading to the cabins. \u201cAre you going to be okay barefoot? You can hop on my back... or my front, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said, her voice as cool as the air around them.</p><p>He laughed, grabbing her elbow and leading her forward. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun at all anymore. What\u2019s the deal with you, LeBreck?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened next to him, but didn\u2019t say another word until they reached the porch of their little wooden cabin. A white envelope labeled \u201cJamison companion\u201d was clipped to the front door. She grabbed the letter and held it up. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably your waiver. You have to sign it saying you\u2019re okay with being in unmonitored zones.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cUnmonitored?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a key out of his pocket and stepped past her to open the door. \u201cI paid extra to get a room without security cameras. Most clubs would never allow it because it\u2019s too risky for the sub, but they\u2019re all about catering to privacy here. So there are private cabins and unmonitored zones. No senator or CEO is going to come here and allow some lackey to have video evidence of his carnal indiscretions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace told me to avoid those areas\u2014that it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be if you were with someone you didn\u2019t know.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWhat? You scared of me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But the wariness on her face made him think she wasn\u2019t being entirely truthful.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I went through the trouble of reserving one of these so that you wouldn\u2019t have to play the role the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t have to pretend in here?\u201d she asked, her whole demeanor visibly relaxing.</p><p>He ushered her into the small living room, unhooked her leash from his belt, and flipped on the lights. \u201cNope, you can insult me as the need strikes.\u201d</p><p>Instead of heading to the other side of the little living room like he expected, she stepped so close he could feel her quick, little breaths on his naked chest. The awareness in his body sparked like she\u2019d touched him with a cattle prod.</p><p>What the hell was she doing?</p><p>She slipped her hands onto his waist, pressing herself against his lingering erection, and peered up at him with steely resolve in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I need.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust himself to touch her. She had to be setting up some kind of joke or she was going to kick him in the balls. \u201cOkay, then what do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you not to ask questions.\u201d She let his borrowed shirt fall to the floor, revealing miles of delicious ivory skin. \u201cAnd for you not to stop unless I say Texas.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>then</p><p>Five days. Five goddamned days of Reid gone on vacation, and it was like Brynn\u2019s world had tilted off its rotation. Man, she was in trouble. She missed him. Really missed him.</p><p>She propped her elbows on her desk and pressed the heels of her hands to her brow bone. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. This was supposed to be a fun fling. Nothing else.</p><p>For the past few weeks, she and Reid had kept up their ends of the fun bargain, stealing moments whenever they could to be together. To talk. To laugh. To have hot, sweaty sex in a sundry of places and positions. She\u2019d been having such a good time she\u2019d never let herself pause long enough to think about what could be developing between them. But now that he\u2019d been in Florida with his family for the week, she\u2019d had nothing but time to think. And pine.</p><p>Pining. She was pining. Oh, good God.</p><p>She peeked over at Reid\u2019s desk\u2014empty\u2014just like it had been since Monday. He hadn\u2019t called much because he was afraid his aunt or uncle would hear him. But she found herself worrying that maybe he really didn\u2019t want to call and was using that as an excuse. Maybe he was having too good of a time without her. They were only a fling anyway, right? There were probably loads of girls hanging around the Jamisons\u2019 sure-to-be-fancy beach house just waiting to take a shot at her guy.</p><p>Her guy. Yep, she was screwed.</p><p>With a sigh, she scooted from behind her desk and headed through the darkened office to the employee lounge, hoping a change in scenery would get her spiraling thoughts to go away. She needed to focus and get some work done. Everyone else had left for the day, but she\u2019d agreed to stay late to stuff goody bags for the next campaign fund-raiser. Bad idea. Between her racing mind and her lack of sleep, she hadn\u2019t even made a dent in the project. She was going to be here every freaking night for a week at this rate.</p><p>Not bothering to flip on the lights, she walked toward the fridge and rummaged around for something with sugar, and preferably caffeine. The people around the office drank coffee like fiends, but she\u2019d never had a taste for the stuff, so she had to rely on soda to get her fix. She saw a glint of red behind all the diet lemon-lime drinks and stretched her arm farther in to reach the cola.</p><p>A light squeeze on her ass made her jolt upward, nearly banging her head on the top of the fridge. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar. It\u2019s just me,\u201d Reid said from behind her as he slid his arm around her waist and nuzzled her neck. \u201cI couldn\u2019t resist with you bending over like that.\u201d</p><p>She spun around in his grasp, the blasting cold from the refrigerator chilling her backside as his body warmed her front. \u201cReid! You scared the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a hand over her hair. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>She tried to catch her breath, not sure if her pounding heart was from being startled or from being so close to him. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You\u2019re not supposed to be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hopped an earlier flight.\u201d He dipped his suntanned face closer and brushed his lips against hers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away from you for another minute. I\u2019ve never hated the beach so much in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Too many beautiful, bikini-clad girls for you?\u201d She poked his ribs.</p><p>\u201cOoh, jealousy. I like it on you.\u201d His thumb stroked the small of her back, her skin coming alive beneath his touch. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t need to check out the other girls. I already have the one</p><p>I want.\u201d</p><p>She stared into the bottomless blue of his eyes, unable to tell if he was being serious or simply being his charming self. How could she be who he wanted? He couldn\u2019t even take her out in public for fear someone in his circle would see them. She pushed the ugly thought away and tilted her chin up. \u201cGuess I shouldn\u2019t have spent my week working my way through the guys in the office, then. I didn\u2019t realize you were going to have such a strict moral code on your trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that what you\u2019ve been up to?\u201d The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cI\u2019m not enough to satisfy you? Maybe I should\u2019ve taken Jace up on his offer to join us for a threesome.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and retort got hung up in her throat. Reid and Jace. Whoa.</p><p>He laughed and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I told him no. Even though I\u2019m guessing by the way your body just quivered, you\u2019re not totally opposed to the idea. Naughty girl. Too bad I\u2019m too selfish to share you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, dismissing the erotic images the crazy suggestion had sparked. \u201cYou\u2019re more than enough for me to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Then why are your cheeks getting all red?\u201d he asked, trailing his fingers along the curve of her ass. \u201cWhat other fantasies are rolling around in that pretty head of yours?\u201d</p><p>Fantasies. She looked down so he couldn\u2019t read her expression. Was that all this was about for him? Exploration. Games. Sex. Or did he get the same fist-to-the-solar-plexus feeling she got anytime she thought about the end of summer?</p><p>She hid her thoughts with a saucy smile. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicious tease.\u201d He dragged her away from the open fridge and lifted her with ease, guiding her legs around his waist. Her skirt bunched around her thighs, and he nipped at her lower lip. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve missed you like crazy this week.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stave off the smile that hopped to her lips, a little zip of giddiness going through her at the obvious sincerity of his words. Maybe he did feel something more. \u201cReally? You missed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sugar, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did a little flip, confirming how far into crazytown she\u2019d strayed. Okay, so this was stupid. Insane. She was getting in too deep. She should run hard and fast. There were a thousand reasons why this couldn\u2019t work long-term.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn away from him. No one had ever made her feel this good, this free to be herself. Alive. So she shoved the worries in a mental closet and kicked the door closed. Stressing about the inevitable wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere. She would figure out how to say good-bye. Soon.</p><p>But not while he was giving her that look that made her insides turn liquid. She kissed along the curve of his neck. \u201cSo are you going to show me how much you missed me? Or do I need to call one of the other guys?\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbled from his chest as he swung her to the left and planted her back against the wall. \u201cWell, I was going to take you to get some dinner first. But if you insist, I\u2019ll gladly fuck you right here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d only been asking for a kiss, but the new suggestion sent a shot of lust-laced adrenaline through her vitals. She glanced at the empty hallway over his shoulder. \u201cThere aren\u2019t hidden security cameras around, are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He dragged his greedy gaze over her chest, and her nipples tightened under the perusal, her whole body going achy with want. \u201cGrab the edges of the shelf above your head and don\u2019t let go. I\u2019ll show you exactly how much I missed you.\u201d</p> <p>She stretched her arms above her and wrapped her fingers around the cool metal, her heart hammering against her ribs. \u201cAre you sure no one\u2019s going to come back here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He set her on her feet, giving her a dark smile, and shoved her skirt to her waist. \u201cWant me to stop?\u201d</p><p>His fingers trailed up her inner thigh, sending hot and tingly desire steamrolling over any lingering worries. She shook her head. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The backs of his knuckles brushed against the cotton of her panties. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know if I could make it through a whole meal knowing how hot and wet you are under these already.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled against his touch, seeking more, needing all of him. Now. \u201cWell, whose fault is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sassy tonight.\u201d His hand slid beneath the band of her underwear, dragging heated fingers over her slick tissues and the throbbing bundle of nerves. \u201cGuess I need to remind you who\u2019s in charge.\u201d</p><p>He pinched her clit hard enough for her to cry out, and she jolted against him, squeezing the shelf so tightly her nails bit into her palms. \u201cYes, like that. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you obey my orders while I was gone?\u201d he asked, continuing to stroke her with firm fingers. \u201cOr did you touch this pretty cunt and come without my permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI obeyed, sir,\u201d she panted, grasping at her unraveling rope of control. She wouldn\u2019t last long. He\u2019d told her not to touch herself the whole time he was gone, and for some reason, she\u2019d listened. Now she was like a grenade with a loose pin.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Without finesse, he yanked her panties down, and she kicked off her heels. \u201cLet\u2019s see if it was worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Her head lolled back against the wall.</p> <p>She had no doubt he\u2019d be worth the wait, but would he be worth the heartbreak?</p><p>Reid fumbled with his belt and unbuttoned his pants, the need to claim Brynn burning through him like wildfire. A week without her had been like walking around with a hole in his chest. He\u2019d planned to surprise her tonight, take her to a nice dinner. Talk. But now she was here in front of him, smelling like strawberry shampoo and feminine arousal. Looking like sin. And he was about to lose his goddamned mind. Food and the discussion he wanted to have with her could wait.</p><p>Not even bothering to step out of his pants, he rolled a condom on and grasped the backs of her thighs, lifting and spreading her. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go slow and easy right now, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes met his, the low light of the room not dimming the fire behind them. \u201cThen take me hard, sir.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and dug his fingers into the soft undersides of her thighs as he thrust forward. Her wet heat closed around him like a velvet fist, causing a bone-deep shudder to wrack his body. \u201cGoddamn, you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Part of him wanted to stay like this, buried inside her balls deep, feeling her stretching around him, watching how her teeth bit into her full bottom lip as she fought to keep her composure. The tender skin at her neck jumped with the frantic beat of her heart, and he dipped forward to run his tongue along the pulse point.</p><p>She moaned and her muscles flexed around his shaft, nearly sending him over the edge before they even started. \u201cReid, please, I need you.\u201d</p><p>He slid out until just the head of his cock rested inside her, relishing the view of their carnal connection, then plunged forward, deep and hard. Her feminine grunt of satisfaction, that little catch in her throat, was all it took to strip the last remnants of patience from his system. He hitched her legs higher and rocked into her with the speed and gentleness of a freight train, the sound of skin hitting skin drowning out the mundane noises around them.</p> <p>She writhed against the wall and sweat slicked both their bodies as he balanced on the precipice before release. He refused to let it end too soon. He wanted to savor the feel of having her in his arms, enjoy the wild look in her green eyes as she hurtled</p><p>toward her own bliss. \u201cTouch yourself, sugar. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers uncurled from the shelf, and she lowered her hand to her swollen clit, stroking over it with the confidence of a woman who wasn\u2019t ashamed to take her pleasure. The move shot lightning through his blood, tightening his balls and dragging him even closer to the edge.</p><p>She leaned her head back, her breath turning choppy. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. You come for me. Let me hear how much you like me fucking you hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d she ground out, the word rattling out her throat and her inner muscles rippling around him as she flew apart.</p><p>Unable to resist the combination of her orgasm and the erotic sound of her calling his name, his entire body tensed, the sweet ecstasy of oncoming release rushing along his nerve endings. His cock swelled inside her, and he crushed her against him as the heated pulse of his own climax jetted through him.</p><p>When they both quieted, his legs felt as if they would collapse beneath him. Keeping a snug hold on her, he turned until his back was against the wall and then slid them both to the floor.</p><p>She touched her forehead to his and laced her fingers at the nape of his neck. \u201cOkay, so that was worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed the corner of her mouth. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t plan on ever making her wait that long again. The trip had been a mistake. He\u2019d agreed to go with his aunt and uncle for the vacation, thinking it would be a good way to get his head clear and get some perspective on his situation with Brynn. Maybe shake off the feelings she stirred up in him\u2014feelings that had no place in a summer hookup.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t worked. Instead, hanging around with his family\u2019s hoity-toity crowd had only made him want Brynn more.</p><p>For a while, he\u2019d convinced himself their scorching sexual chemistry was the only reason the sun seemed to get brighter anytime she was near. But the week away had burned that theory into a pile of ash. As he sat on the beach night after night, staring at the ocean, he\u2019d realized that the agonizing ache he felt didn\u2019t reside below his belt but square in the middle of his chest.</p><p>He missed her.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he felt comfortable in his own skin, and she was the reason. The people in his world always came with conditions, fine print. But not Brynn. Even after he\u2019d told her about his father, she hadn\u2019t judged, only accepted. She\u2019d embraced the dark parts of him as well as the bright spots. He\u2019d never experienced that kind of total acceptance\u2014not even from his mom. And he didn\u2019t want to give that up.</p><p>Not now. Not at the end of the summer. Maybe not ever.</p><p>And he had no idea what in the hell to do with that realization.</p><p>Asking Brynn to be in a relationship with him was akin to inviting her into a snake pit. The people who ran in his family\u2019s social circle could be vicious. They\u2019d slice her apart with their genteel passive-aggressiveness and backhanded comments before she even realized what was happening. Plus, if he and Brynn started dating publicly and the press dug into her background... Hell, he didn\u2019t even want to think about that. Beyond the fallout from his aunt and uncle over the campaign, he\u2019d never forgive himself for bringing that kind of scrutiny and exposure down on Brynn.</p><p>But he was getting ahead of himself.</p><p>Even if he could figure out a way to shield her from the land mines in his life, she\u2019d given him no signs that she had any interest in him beyond the summer. Sure, the whole thing was fun and different for her right now. She was trying it out. Just like she\u2019d try out a threesome if he offered one. But would she want this kind of relationship with him for real?</p><p>He intended to find out soon. If she felt even an inkling of what he felt for her, maybe they could figure out a way to be together.</p><p>He shook himself from his thoughts and smiled. \u201cHow about some dinner, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted to answer, but a noise coming from down the hall made them both freeze.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered. He strained to listen. What in the hell was that? \u201cIs that the... the copy machine?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she climbed off his lap, hurriedly standing and tugging her skirt down. \u201cDid you lock the front door?\u201d</p><p>Had he? He thought he had, but maybe in his rush to see Brynn he\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>He buttoned his pants and stood, putting his finger to his lips to hush her. If someone was in the office, he and Brynn could be in trouble for a number of reasons. He didn\u2019t want anyone knowing about their relationship, but that was the least of his worries at the moment. If someone had broken in, they could be in much more serious danger.</p><p>He leaned next to her ear. \u201cStay here. Don\u2019t come out until I call for you. If I\u2019m not back in ten minutes, call 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d she whispered, latching on to his shirtsleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t go out there, what if it\u2019s a burglar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine. What burglar would use the copy machine?\u201d he whispered, trying to reassure her, but not convincing himself.</p><p>He crossed over to the sink and pulled open a drawer but found only plastic utensils. Damn. He bent and opened the cabinet below. He grabbed the small fire extinguisher. It wasn\u2019t much, but it would have to do.</p><p>He headed toward the doorway and poked his head out into the hallway. Empty. The copy machine was still going at a steady pace in the distance. Click and glide. Click and glide.</p><p>He slipped into the hall, keeping his back close to the interior wall, and inched forward on quiet feet. If he could get to the end of the corridor, he\u2019d be able to peer around and see the spread of the main office area. Step by agonizing step he made it closer to his destination, all the while telling himself that the stealth was for nothing. That it was probably just one of the office workers stopping in for something. But the hairs on the back of his neck said otherwise.</p><p>As he reached the end of hall, he carefully peeked around the corner. The whole office was dark except for the parking lot lights illuminating the glass doors at the front and the green and white dance of lights under the lid of the unattended copy machine across the room.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he called out. \u201cAnyone there?\u201d</p><p>Only the monotonous rhythm of the damn copier answered.</p><p>Unwilling to traipse around the place in the dark to search, he reached for the light switch and flipped on the bank of overhead fluorescents. He scanned the room quickly to make sure no one was in sight, then started looking behind desks, keeping the fire extinguisher poised for his lame spray-and-distract plan.</p><p>Once he\u2019d secured that area and checked that the front door was indeed locked, he did a cursory search of the private offices. Not a soul anywhere.</p><p>He blew out the breath he\u2019d been holding.</p><p>Huh. Maybe some weird glitch in the copier.</p><p>He stuck his head in the hallway and called out, \u201cBrynn, all clear.\u201d</p><p>He headed across the room to shut off the annoying contraption that had caused the drama. The machine had been queued up for five hundred copies and was steadily pumping them out. He hit the stop button and grabbed the top page of the stack in the output slot.</p><p>His blood ran cold.</p><p>A photo filled the center of the page\u2014the two faces in profile easily identified. He and Brynn naked by the lake during a midnight tryst from a few weeks ago, her arms bound behind her, his hand poised above her backside, ready to strike. Underneath the photo, a handwritten message in small block letters: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>YOUR DADDY WOULD BE SO PROUD.

The papers quivered in his shaking hands. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, sugar.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reid asked, his stubbled jaw hanging open at Brynn\u2019s proposition.</p><p>Brynn stared up at him, willing herself not to turn tail and run after coming on to him. She needed to do this or she was going to spend the whole weekend flinching like a wounded bird.</p><p>During the kiss with him in front of the group, she had glimpsed a feeling\u2014a whisper of freedom that she hadn\u2019t felt since the day someone had decided to violate her. If she could just rip off the bandage\u2014guerilla-style exposure therapy like Melody had suggested\u2014then maybe she could break the shackles that seemed to weigh her down any time she was near a dominant man.</p> <p>She wet her lips. \u201cI said not to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cLast I checked, I\u2019m the dom here, so I\u2019ll ask what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you attracted to me?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms, the muscles in his shoulders shifting and bunching. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not fucking dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, please, just go with it. I don\u2019t want to talk about the past or why we hate each other. Let\u2019s leave all of that outside these grounds for the next three days. You know we\u2019re not going to be able to make it through our stay here only kissing in front of people.\u201d</p><p>He looked left, then right. \u201cThere are no people here now. Who is this show going to be for?\u201d</p> <p>My sanity. At least if she panicked, she wouldn\u2019t have to do it in front of the whole club. \u201cMyself. I don\u2019t want to flinch every time you touch me. Maybe your breaking-the-ice idea wasn\u2019t such a bad one\u2014we could get this first time out of the way in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it out of the way. Like I\u2019m a dentist appointment or something?\u201d He smirked, but she didn\u2019t miss the weariness in his voice. \u201cCome on, be honest. Why don\u2019t you just admit that underneath that big grudge you\u2019re holding, you still want me?\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back and groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk sometimes, you know that? Yes, I\u2019m attracted to you, okay. I wouldn\u2019t offer to have sex with you if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a triumphant smile, picked up the shirt from the floor, and handed it to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sugar. I\u2019ll make sure we get it out of the way, but it\u2019s not going to happen because I\u2019m some item to scratch off your to-do list. I\u2019ll decide when and what happens.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Couldn\u2019t the man cooperate with anything? She yanked the shirt from his hands. \u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>He walked past her and stretched out on the couch. \u201cLater. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She balled her fists and fought the inclination to stomp her feet like a child. She\u2019d never met a more frustrating man in her life. How had she ever fallen for such a jackass? Without wasting another breath on him, she stomped past him, down the narrow hallway, and slammed the bedroom door behind her.</p><p>Like the rest of the cabin, the upscale rustic theme continued in the bedroom\u2014dark woods, cream-colored fabrics, and soft lighting. It could have been a luxury cabin at any fine resort if not for the metal loops drilled into the walls and a leather and wooden bench contraption at the foot of the bed. She grimaced. This was going to be the longest freaking weekend of her life.</p> <p>She rubbed her arms to fight off a shiver, and Reid\u2019s heady scent wafted up from the shirt, reminding her of balmy nights and twisted sheets. The urge to bury her face in the soft cotton ratcheted through her. Damn it to hell. Why did the jerk have to smell good, too?</p><p>All right, enough of this ensemble. Letting the shirt fall to the floor, she headed to the closet and slid the louver doors open. But the contents only inspired a groan. Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood called\u2014they want their inventory back. She flipped through the satin-covered hangers with a huff. Lingerie, slinky dresses, vinyl getups, and enough leather to outfit a Judas Priest fan club. Terrific. She\u2019d thought the items she\u2019d packed had been sexy enough, but apparently the dress code here required hooker chic.</p><p>She grabbed a black bustier and a brief leather skirt and held them up in front of her. At least these would cover the essentials\u2014not a guarantee most of the other options afforded. She tossed the items on the bed and grabbed a pair of knee-high black boots from the floor of the closet. Well, at least those weren\u2019t so bad.</p><p>A sharp rap on the door sent her bolting upright. \u201cBrynn, you\u2019ve got five more minutes to pout, then I need you out here. Company\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d she called through the closed door.</p><p>\u201cJust put your game face on and get out here.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later she heard Reid let someone in and the murmuring of male conversation. She gave herself one last glance in the mirror, pulled up the bustier a little more to make sure her boobs wouldn\u2019t tumble out, and headed into the living room. The click of her boots earned raised heads from both the men.</p><p>Reid\u2019s eyes widened as his gaze swept over her new clothes. \u201cGuess you found the closet.\u201d</p><p>Brynn ignored him and focused on their guest. \u201cHi, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn, girl, you look smoking,\u201d he said, a wide smile splitting his face.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He didn\u2019t look so bad himself. Linen pants, untucked button-down shirt, and wavy blond hair pulled back in a short ponytail. If she weren\u2019t so annoyed with him, she would\u2019ve returned his compliment. She settled into the overstuffed chair opposite the one Jace sat in. \u201cSo what happened to \u2018I\u2019m not going to be here this weekend.\u2019\u201d</p><p>His gaze darted to Reid, then back to her. \u201cPlans changed at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice, Brynn,\u201d Reid warned. \u201cJace doesn\u2019t do one-on-one stuff\u2014he\u2019s known around here for m\u00e9nage. It would\u2019ve looked suspicious if he\u2019d taken you on. Plus, he\u2019s already doing us a huge favor by getting us in. I don\u2019t want to risk him or his business with Grant by dragging him in deeper.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, conceding. Reid was right. Who was she to be mad at Jace when he was putting himself on the line for her? \u201cSorry for snapping at you, Jace. I really do appreciate the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, doll. I\u2019m going to do all I can to help you\u2014with everything.\u201d His gaze met hers.</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, getting the message and silently thanking him for not bringing up the revelation she\u2019d made in the staging room. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we were discussing before you walked in,\u201d Reid said, buttoning the cuffs of the black shirt he\u2019d put on to replace the one he\u2019d lent her. \u201cJace chatted up one of the staff members and found out that new sub trainees are on total lockdown tonight and won\u2019t be allowed on the main grounds until tomorrow at the earliest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said, her hope for finding her sister tonight plummeting. \u201cWhat the hell are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>Reid shrugged. \u201cWe need to go out and be seen. Jace offered to have dinner with us and to give us a tour of the main clubhouse so we can get our bearings. After that, who knows?\u201d</p><p>She eyed the two of them, getting the feeling that the only one who didn\u2019t know was her.</p><p>An hour and two courses later, Brynn still hadn\u2019t managed to eat anything more than a few bites of salad. Between the ball of anxiety burning in her stomach and the breath-stealing bustier, she doubted even chocolate would tempt her. They\u2019d toured the building, and she\u2019d seen things that would be seared into her brain forever. Some of the scenes had gotten her heated in all the right places, but others had nearly sent her into a panic attack just watching.</p><p>She needed to get this exposure therapy over with now. The anticipation alone was going to be the death of her. She pushed a baby carrot back and forth across her plate as Jace and Reid talked.</p><p>Reid speared a piece of steak. \u201cSo how serious does it get here? Is it mostly light stuff or do they cater to those who go for the extreme?\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged as he finished chewing his bite. \u201cIt kind of runs the gamut. But there are limits. No blood play and definitely no breath play. Grant allows a lot of things, but doesn\u2019t want anyone messing with the deadly stuff.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s fork stilled, but she kept her mouth shut and let Reid continue.</p><p>\u201cSo besides that, pretty much anything goes, then,\u201d Reid said. \u201cGuess I shouldn\u2019t expect any less with all the high rollers around here. No one would pay this much money to go somewhere with a lot of restrictions.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cYeah, they cater to people who aren\u2019t used to hearing the word \u2018no.\u2019 You\u2019ll get to see all the bigwigs tomorrow night. There\u2019s a Bacchanal planned after sunset to celebrate the grape harvest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Reid said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Grant only holds it once a year, so I guarantee all the rooms and cabins will be empty tomorrow night. No one misses this event.\u201d</p><p>Reid and Jace both looked at her, confirming the message. Kelsey would probably be there.</p><p>She dabbed her mouth with her napkin, and glanced at the nearby tables. They had to be careful about what they said. \u201cWow. A festival honoring Bacchus at a place that doesn\u2019t let you drink alcohol.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed. \u201cYeah, I know. The no alcohol rule is important with all the stuff that goes on here. But believe me, that\u2019s the only excess the party won\u2019t have.\u201d He eyed her, his face turning more serious\u2014no doubt thinking of what she\u2019d revealed to him in the dressing room. \u201cBut it can be overwhelming. The rules for D/s don\u2019t really hold up in there. It\u2019s kind of a free-for-all. Although, the safe word always applies.\u201d</p><p>She took a long gulp of her tea, digesting the information, nerves skittering through her.</p><p>How was she supposed to survive a goddamned orgy? She was jumping out of her skin at even the simplest touch. The thought of an anything-goes night with a crowd of hedonistic strangers made her want to curl into a fetal position and hide. The panic and flashbacks would surely engulf her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t have time for a nervous breakdown. That was going to be her best chance to convince her sister to come home and go to the police.</p><p>Brynn straightened in her seat, her decision made. She was going to have to do something about her fear tonight, prove to herself that she was stronger than what that monster did to her.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI definitely want to check that out. Sounds like something I shouldn\u2019t miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure,\u201d Reid said, giving her a purposeful nod. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Jace smiled. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Reid glanced down at her plate. \u201cSugar, you\u2019ve barely touched your food. Do you want me to order you something different? We\u2019ve got a big night ahead of us. I can\u2019t have you fading on me.\u201d</p><p>She set down her glass, his subtle warning setting her on edge, but she pushed forward with her plan. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything else. I\u2019m ready for whatever you guys have planned.\u201d</p><p>Reid lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhatever is a broad word, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. I can do this. Once upon a time, she\u2019d loved this man, trusted him, and had enjoyed some seriously hot sex with him. She needed to keep that last thing in the front of her mind. Maybe if she could hone her focus onto the physical, indulge the part of her that was still hopelessly attracted to him, she could block out the fear that threatened to undo her and enjoy herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cI know, Master.\u201d</p><p>Reid grinned, wickedness glinting in his eyes. He rose from his chair and dropped his napkin on his plate. \u201cJace, why don\u2019t you head to the nightclub area with Brynn and I\u2019ll meet you? I\u2019m going to have them box up dessert to take with us.\u201d</p> <p>Jace stood and Brynn downed the rest of her drink before getting up to join him, wishing it was some of the wine the vineyard produced instead of iced tea. She\u2019d kill for some liquid courage tonight.</p><p>Jace slid a hand onto the small of her back as Reid strode off. \u201cCome on, doll. Let\u2019s go join the reindeer games.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, but let him nudge her forward. As they passed another table, a man reached out and stopped Jace. \u201cHey, Jason, I didn\u2019t realize you were going to be here this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook the man\u2019s hand and offered a polite smile to both him and the scantily clad brunette who kneeled on the floor next to his chair. \u201cHi, Davis. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s insides chilled as the name and familiar voice dinged bells inside her. She ventured another look at the man\u2019s face and then quickly dropped her gaze. Shit. Davis Ackerman, her old boss, and now current city councilman. Just what she needed\u2014yet another person seeing her half naked and collared. She dipped her head down even farther and hoped the man had a bad memory.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s going excellent,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd I wanted to thank you for getting that order to me so quickly. I\u2019m really happy with everything.\u201d</p><p>Jace absently rubbed Brynn\u2019s back, and she sensed he was itching to move on from the conversation. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sub you have there tonight.\u201d Davis\u2019s tone made it sound like he was admiring the night\u2019s dinner specials. \u201cAre you two looking to join up with anyone?\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Not in this lifetime. The thought of that man laying a finger on her made her soul shudder. Jace\u2019s palm moved to her hip as he gathered her closer. \u201cSorry, Davis. I appreciate the offer, but we actually have plans with someone else tonight. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to find an available couple in the group room, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, oh, well. Maybe we\u2019ll see you at the festival tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>The men exchanged good-byes, and Jace hustled her away. \u201cSorry about that, doll. Davis hasn\u2019t gotten any less annoying with age, but I\u2019d be stupid to get on a councilman\u2019s bad side. Plus, he\u2019s a steady customer at the store.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think he recognized me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s so drunk on lust for that chick he\u2019s with. He wouldn\u2019t be able to pick his own wife out of a lineup right now.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019s married?\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, being single isn\u2019t one of the requirements for membership at The Ranch.\u201d</p><p>A sound of disgust escaped her. Thank God that\u2019s not who her sister was paired up with.</p><p>Jace gave her a rueful smile as they exited the restaurant and headed down one of the unnaturally quiet hallways. \u201cI know it\u2019s not right, but it is what it is. At least you don\u2019t have to worry. Both of your men tonight are footloose and fancy-free.\u201d</p><p>Her steps stuttered. Both? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He paused outside a set of double doors and turned to her. \u201cBrynn, before we go in there, I want to make sure you\u2019re okay with this. Reid asked me to join you guys tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI know, shocked the shit out of me, too, because you know how he is. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m definitely a willing participant, but if you don\u2019t want that or think it\u2019s going to freak you out, tell me now. I know you haven\u2019t told Reid what you\u2019re going through, but I know he wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019s going to scare you.\u201d</p><p>Both of them. Both of them. Her heart hammered in her chest, but the rush of adrenaline didn\u2019t feel like fear. No, this rush was something totally different. After a few moments, she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I trust you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what to say if anything goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, giving her a smile that suddenly seemed more than friendly. He pushed through the double doors, and pounding dance music drowned out her question. He bent close to her ear and shouted, \u201cCome on, doll. Into the den of inequity we go.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand and followed him through the throng of people on the dance floor. Couples and groups of every possible makeup\u2014some clothed, some not so much\u2014bounced and writhed to the pulsing beat. Hands and bare skin brushed against her as she and Jace were absorbed into the crowd. The scents of sweat and sex enveloped her, and despite her racing worries, her body jumped to attention.</p><p>She mentally grabbed on to that physical sensation\u2014that\u2019s what she needed to focus on. She closed her eyes, centering herself, drawing herself down into her senses and into an almost meditative state. Nothing exists outside this moment. This room. All you need is what your body feels.</p><p>A hot hand cupped her ass and jolted her from her internal chanting. She turned her head to tell whoever it was to back off, but Reid\u2019s confident smirk greeted her. \u201cKeep moving.\u201d</p><p>Once they made it off the dance floor and to the fringes of the room, the music faded to a manageable volume. Jace found the last open couch. \u201cThis\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Brynn frowned at the small love seat. No way would the three of them fit on that. Hell, was she going to have to kneel on the goddamned floor again? Jace sank onto the dark brown leather, and after setting a paper bag on a nearby cocktail table, Reid moved past her to take the other spot. She huffed. Guess \u201cladies first\u201d had no application in this world.</p><p>She sighed and started to kneel, but Reid\u2019s hand circled her wrist. \u201cPlenty of room for you on my lap, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a tick as he patted his leg in invitation. She used to love being on Reid\u2019s lap. Back when she\u2019d felt like her whole world was balancing on the edge of a dime, his embrace had made her feel cherished, safe. But right now, she doubted his intent had anything to do with safety.</p><p>Before she could respond, he dragged her closer and pulled her onto the tops of his muscular thighs. With ease, he shifted her whole body until her ass was in his lap and her legs were draped across Jace\u2019s. \u201cThere, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>She looked back and forth between the two men and wet her lips. \u201cBut, I\u2019m taking up Jace\u2019s space, too.\u201d</p><p>Reid ran the backs of his knuckles along the outside of her exposed leg, sending shivers along her skin. \u201cI don\u2019t think he minds.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s eyes followed Reid\u2019s movements. \u201cNot at all. The view is mighty fine.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s palm slid toward the inside of her thigh, and he parted her tightly closed knees, spreading her until Jace could most definitely see up her skirt. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy, sugar. You were ready to take Jace on as your dom last week, so I know you\u2019re not opposed to letting him have a little fun with us.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the swift heat that nestled between her legs. Maybe staying focused on the physical wouldn\u2019t be a problem. She turned to Reid, her brows knitted. \u201cWhat happened to your no-sharing policy?\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft chuckle, even though something akin to pain flashed in his eyes, and kissed the spot below her ear. \u201cBack then I was young and stupid and thought I was in love. Now that it\u2019s just sex, I don\u2019t mind sharing.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. Sure, he\u2019d been in love with her\u2014so in love that he\u2019d been cheating on her the whole time they were together. What a stand-up guy.</p><p>Reid frowned and pushed a stray hair away from her face. \u201cBut, we\u2019re leaving the past behind while we\u2019re here, right? Let\u2019s not let that taint the experience of \u2018getting this whole sex thing over with.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but his finger pressed against her lips.</p><p>\u201cShh, relax and keep an open mind, Brynn. I promise if you do that, this will be way better than a dentist appointment.\u201d</p><p>Her retort shriveled in her throat. He was right, as much as it killed her to admit it. This was what she had walked in here to do. Beyond the fact that this would make them look like authentic guests, she needed to do this for herself. If she was going to get past this fear and learn to enjoy sex again, what better way to do it than to hand herself over to the most dominant man she\u2019d ever met?</p><p>Despite their issues, she knew Reid wouldn\u2019t physically harm her. And although she and Jace only had friendship between them, she\u2019d never deny that the man was sex on a stick. The idea of both of them... Well, her damp panties certainly indicated that her hormones were a fan.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell with deep breaths. This was it. Take the leap, Brynn. Just be in the moment. You\u2019re safe.</p><p>She gave a final nod, mentally slamming the door shut on everything but the feel of the two beautiful men against her skin.</p><p>Reid removed his finger, his blue eyes glittering in the club\u2019s flashing lights. \u201cGood, girl. Now, I think you\u2019re ready for dessert.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s hand curled under her knee and she startled. \u201cEasy, doll. We\u2019re going to take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>While Reid leaned to the side to grab the bag he had brought with him, a vinyl-clad waitress stopped in front of them. Her heavily lined eyes danced across Brynn\u2019s two companions, her interest obvious. \u201cDo you need anything from the bar... or from an attendant?\u201d</p><p>Reid lifted his head, and Jace continued to caress Brynn\u2019s leg. Reid traced a finger along the edge of Brynn\u2019s bustier. \u201cI think we have all we need right now.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s bottom lip jutted out a bit, but she nodded and moved on. Brynn sniffed. \u201cI think you guys have a new president for your fan club.\u201d</p><p>Reid laughed and pulled a pint-sized container from the paper bag. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. You might want to apply for the job once we\u2019re done with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cConfident, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace, I think our sub has a bit of a smart mouth.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head. \u201cSeems so. I think it\u2019s this outfit. It\u2019s making her feisty.\u201d</p><p>Reid yanked at the laces holding the front of the bustier together, sending her breasts spilling out the top. She gasped and her hands instinctively flew to cover herself.</p><p>Reid frowned. \u201cDrop your hands, Brynn, or we\u2019ll be forced to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted around the crowded room. She had known that public display would be involved in this, but knowing it and experiencing it were two different things. A couple sitting a few yards away openly ogled the scene, and Brynn had the urge to grab the paper bag and put it over her head.</p><p>Reid\u2019s fingers grasped her chin, and he turned her face toward him. \u201cLook only at us. You\u2019re here to please me and Jace\u2014no one else gets the privilege of your attention. Now I\u2019m giving you one more chance to drop your hands or I\u2019m pulling out the cuffs.\u201d</p><p>Cuffs. The word tried to slip through the hold she had on her fear. Restraints equaled panic. She stared into Reid\u2019s eyes, feeling his grip on her face, letting his unwavering focus draw her back to center. She let her arms fall to her sides, and her nipples instantly tightened from the exposure.</p><p>Reid\u2019s gaze traveled over her breasts as if he was seeing the female form for the first time, and she couldn\u2019t help but warm beneath the full glow of his appreciation. He kissed her bare shoulder. \u201cThank you. A body this gorgeous deserves to be worshipped not hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that,\u201d Jace said, his normally genial face turning serious.</p><p>She knew there were far more beautiful women in the room, knew that her belly was a bit too round and her breasts a bit too heavy to call perky. But in that moment, the two men\u2019s hungry perusal made her feel like a goddess upon an altar. The traces of panic started to drain out of her completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>These men wanted her, would take care of her. And suddenly she found herself wanting them back. Really wanting them.</p><p>Reid pulled off the lid of the container he\u2019d brought and dunked a finger inside. \u201cReady for dessert, sugar?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his hand to her lips, rubbing something thick and warm over them, then lowered his head and claimed her mouth in a slow, possessive kiss. Mmm. Reid and the sweet, buttery flavor of caramel glazed her taste buds\u2014a heady combination that sent her inner thermostat inching upward. He sucked her lower lip and removed the last of the sticky confection just as another streak of warmth painted the sensitive skin of her leg. What the...</p><p>He smiled as awareness dawned within her. \u201cFour hands can be so much more efficient than two.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s mouth returned to hers right as Jace\u2019s hot tongue glided along her inner thigh, lapping up the caramel sauce and setting a match to her nerve endings. Holy shit. Was she actually going to do this? Two men\u2014no, not just two men, Reid and Jace. Heaven help her.</p><p>As Reid\u2019s tongue stroked over hers, his growing erection pressed against her bottom. She wiggled against him, and he hummed his approval into the kiss. Jace\u2019s hair brushed against her legs as he continued to taste the skin higher and higher on her thigh, maddeningly close to the slow throbbing between her legs. Her knees instinctively parted farther, seeking relief as the combination of the two men\u2019s attention coalesced in her core, sending moisture hotter than the caramel straight to her sex.</p><p>When Jace nudged the bottom edge of her skirt, Reid pulled back from the kiss and grabbed the container again. Creamy caramel drizzled over each of her nipples, and she arched from the contrast in temperature. Reid\u2019s fingers spread the sugared sauce over one of the tightened buds, then tilted her farther back against the arm of the couch, putting her on full display like a buffet to be sampled. Jace slid out from beneath her and moved to the floor, settling at her side. Both heads lowered, and each man latched on to a breast, sucking and laving in tandem\u2014Reid\u2019s mouth hot and firm, Jace\u2019s more teasing.</p> <p>She threaded her hands in their hair, pulling Jace\u2019s short ponytail free in the process, and let her head fall back. The last threads of resistance burned into wisps of smoke as the call of her body overruled the voice in her head. Heated palms slid up her legs and hiked her skirt to her waist. Reid\u2019s teeth scraped against her left nipple sending a shot of pleasure/pain through her before he released it. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for something sweeter than caramel.\u201d</p><p>Jace didn\u2019t stop his ministrations but cupped the breast that Reid had abandoned and rubbed a thumb across the tip. Reid scooted from under her and set her ass on the couch. Before she could process what he was doing, he spread her legs wide and ran a finger over the soaked crotch of her panties. \u201cMmm, I think our little sub likes us, Jace.\u201d</p><p>Jace lifted his head and smiled down at Brynn, the green of his eyes dark and dangerous. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Reid grabbed her wrist and moved her hand beneath the waistband of her underwear, the pads of her fingers resting on her mound. \u201cJace is being so nice to you, don\u2019t you think you should give him a little taste?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered in her chest, and she moistened her lips. \u201cY-Yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Reid caressed her arm. \u201cGo ahead then, sugar.\u201d</p> <p>After a steadying breath, she lowered her hand and ran two fingers along her slick folds. One brush against her clit and she thought she may tip over the edge right there. Just a few strokes and she\u2019d be there. But she wasn\u2019t ready for it to be over yet; she wanted to let the guys decide when it was time.</p><p>Jace\u2019s hooded gaze never left hers as she raised her hand to him. He grabbed her forearm and brought her glistening fingers to his mouth. With unhurried reverence, he sucked them clean. \u201cYour girl is so fucking sweet, Reid.\u201d</p><p>Her pussy clenched as if he\u2019d licked her clit instead of her fingers, and a whimper slipped past her lips.</p><p>Reid\u2019s hands kneaded her legs. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to refresh my memory.\u201d</p><p>Coarse fingers moved to her hips, and Reid tugged her panties off. A low groan rumbled from him. \u201cJesus, Brynn, you\u2019re going to fucking kill me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to see his hungry gaze trace over her Brazilian wax job\u2014something she\u2019d started doing a few years earlier. \u201cYou approve?\u201d</p><p>He traced his fingers over the baby smooth skin, making her writhe. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a sexier cunt in my life. So pretty and pink.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and his lips curved upward. \u201cStill love the dirty talk, huh, sugar? I bet that lame-ass date you had the other night would\u2019ve whispered gentle, polite words to you while he fucked you. Is that what you\u2019d rather have?\u201d</p> <p>Two fingers slipped inside her channel, and Jace resumed sucking a breast. Her hips bucked against the delicious invasion, and she could only reply with a moan.</p><p>Reid\u2019s fingers pumped harder, filling her just enough to make her yearn for more, but not enough to satisfy the needy ache. \u201cAnswer me, sub. Tell me what you prefer?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not wanting to give in, even though she knew he knew the answer.</p><p>He bent lower and the very tip of his tongue flicked her clit once. Her muscles jolted and tilted her hips upward, seeking more. He kissed her mound, his lips landing right above her slit. \u201cNo, darling. You don\u2019t get what you want until you answer me.\u201d</p><p>As if punctuating Reid\u2019s point, Jace pinched the nipple he wasn\u2019t sucking, hard enough to make her gasp. Reid\u2019s fingers slipped out of her, and she squeezed her eyes shut, a second shy of begging. \u201cI like it when you talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s fingers moved back inside, and she let her head relax against the arm of the couch again. With his free hand, he positioned her legs over his shoulders \u201cNow you get to come for us, sugar.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed against her sex and his tongue swirled around her clit, sending electricity pulsing through her veins. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for long. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been this keyed up, this turned on. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d been truly sexually satisfied that she\u2019d almost forgotten what the climb felt like.</p><p>Her breaths turned to pants as the need for release gnawed at her dwindling control. Jace captured her mouth with his, and the lingering tastes of her own juices and caramel swirled along her tongue. She slid her hand along his muscled chest and twisted her other hand in Reid\u2019s hair.</p><p>Sensations and scents and tastes whirled into a maddening tornado, twisting inside her, pushing her to the edge of the abyss. Reid sucked her clit into his mouth and dragged his teeth lightly over it. Oh, God. A piercing scream ripped from her throat and poured into Jace\u2019s kiss, her orgasm shattering her into a million different shards of glittering pleasure.</p><p>The men continued pushing her, ratcheting up her volume, until she wondered if the people outside the building could hear her. Then, as if sensing she couldn\u2019t take another second, both eased back, giving her a chance to drift back to earth.</p><p>After her breathing calmed, her body sagged into the couch, sweat glazing every inch of her. Reid slipped her legs off his shoulders and replaced Jace at his side. He brushed the damp hair off her forehead and her lids fluttered closed. \u201cBeautiful, sugar. Take a minute to relax. We\u2019re not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blinked open, and he smiled as he took her hand and put it on the impressive erection straining against his pants. \u201cYou still have two very hard cocks to take care of.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand along the length of him, all brain activity numbed by the afterglow of her rocking orgasm. \u201cLooking forward to it, sir.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her tenderly, catching her off guard. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>His girl. The words sent a jagged slice through her chest, ripping through the stitches of the old wound. She turned her head before he could see the stupid tears that jumped to her eyes.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>then</p><p>Brynn slipped off her shoes before she pushed through the front door so she wouldn\u2019t wake her sister or her mother with the click clacking of her heels. But when she stepped inside, she was surprised to see the light of the television flickering on the walls of the living room, and her mother lying on the couch awake.</p><p>Brynn glanced at the time on the VCR\u20142:21 a.m. Usually her mother went to bed early on her nights off. \u201cHey, what are you still doing up?\u201d</p><p>Her mom sat up, pulling the afghan she had draped over her legs around her. With her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and no makeup on, she looked younger than her thirty-eight years\u2014pretty, even with the world-weary lines around her mouth and eyes. She nodded in Brynn\u2019s direction. \u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a date.\u201d</p><p>Her mother eyed her outfit, her gaze shrewd enough that Brynn knew she hadn\u2019t been drinking tonight. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that dress?\u201d</p><p>She and Reid had gone to a restaurant outside of town, and he had surprised her with a new dress for the occasion. Brynn set her shoes by the door, wishing she had come through the back instead of the front. \u201cIt was a gift.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s shoulders rose and fell with a heavy sigh. \u201cBaby, you\u2019re treading in dangerous territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that boy you\u2019ve been going out with. Saw his clothes, that brand-new truck he\u2019s driving. And I can tell you that dress cost at least a few hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and dropped onto the love seat. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been down that path. Handsome guy. Lots of money. Makes you feel like a princess. It\u2019s hard to resist. But relationships with boys like that are bad news.\u201d</p><p>Anger began to percolate in her belly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his type. And his type only dates girls like you for one reason. They use you and then when they get bored, they leave and go marry a girl who\u2019s a member of their country club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, with all due respect, you\u2019re the one who lets guys use you for sex. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of the angry retort she expected, sadness crossed her mother\u2019s tired face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve made more mistakes than I can count. I never meant for my life, your lives, to be this way. But sometimes once you start rolling down a hill, you find there\u2019s no way back up it.\u201d</p><p>Brynn looked down at her hands, unable to bear the tears gathering in her mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, her voice soft. \u201cI\u2019ve earned it. But I\u2019ve also learned a lot along the way, and I love you too much to watch you follow the same path. You\u2019re too smart and good-hearted to let some guy take advantage of you. Go to school. Get a job that allows you to support yourself without any help from anyone. Then, worry about falling in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love,\u201d she said, maybe a bit too quickly.</p><p>Her mother nodded, though the knowing look in her eye said she didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cJust be careful, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise,\u201d she said, even though her mother had it all wrong. Reid wasn\u2019t one of those guys. He\u2019d proven over and over how much her cared about her and wanted to be with her. She climbed off the love seat and headed toward her bedroom, but paused before she left the room. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she asked, her gaze lifting from the TV.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know, baby.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s shoulders tensed as soon as he parked his truck in the driveway and saw the kitchen lights were still shining brightly through the windows of the main house. He checked the clock on the dash. Almost three a.m. Not a good sign that someone was still up. The back door swung open before he\u2019d even cut the engine. Aw, hell. An even worse sign. His aunt was waiting up for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he climbed out of the truck and shut the door. \u201cEverything alright, Aunt Ros?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to you. Inside. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. We.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face and slinked inside the house, feeling like he was fourteen again. He squinted in the bright lights of the pristine kitchen. His uncle was perched on a stool next to the marble island, sipping a glass of amber-colored alcohol and his aunt was standing next to him, arms crossed over her chest and lips pressed in a hard line.</p><p>\u201cNice night, Reid?\u201d she asked, her tone cutting.</p><p>He leaned against the counter, his gaze hopping back and forth between the two of them. \u201cIt was... fine. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed a sheet of paper off the island and flipped it over. She jabbed a finger at it. \u201cHow could you do this to us?\u201d</p> <p>He took the few steps forward to grab the page. Fuck. The photo from the lake again\u2014only this time with no message.</p><p>\u201cAunt Ros, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said, smacking her hand hard against the countertop. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. I told you to stay away from her, that you\u2019d only get yourself in trouble. Get us in trouble.\u201d She shook her head, her body visibly quivering with her anger. \u201cDo you know what people will say if they find out that our son\u2014that he does this to women? We\u2019re running on a family values platform, Reid!\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip, letting her get her tirade out, his cheeks burning with shame.</p><p>His uncle put a hand on Ros\u2019s shoulder. \u201cReid, it\u2019s not just the campaign. We\u2019re worried about you. These are very dangerous waters considering your history. Did Ms. LeBreck consent to this, uh, activity?\u201d</p><p>Reid jaw fell open. \u201cHold up. You think I raped her?\u201d</p> <p>Patrick\u2019s gaze dropped to his glass. \u201cWe just want to know what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Oh, my God, you guys really think I\u2019m that screwed up, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Neither his aunt or uncle met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d He raked his hands through his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s my girlfriend, all right?\u201d</p><p>His aunt cringed, as if him dating someone outside their social circle was just as egregious as committing a rape would\u2019ve been.</p><p>\u201cWell, this has to end immediately,\u201d she said, her words clipped. \u201cWhoever left this picture is probably building a blackmail case and doesn\u2019t need any more ammunition. For heaven\u2019s sake, the girl herself may have told someone to follow you two and grab a picture so she could make a little money off your relationship herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw accusations at her,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cShe\u2019s not interested in my money.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t be so naive. Everyone\u2019s interested in money.\u201d</p> <p>His fists balled. \u201cJust because you judge people\u2019s worth by their bank account doesn\u2019t mean everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d his uncle barked. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You\u2019ve had your aunt in tears all night over this, and I will not have you sit here and insult her. This family has done a lot for you. You need to have respect for the people who care about you.\u201d</p><p>Reid deflated, his uncle\u2019s words dousing him like a bucket of ice water. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay? To both of you. I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. But Brynn is leaving for Austin in a few weeks, so we\u2019ll be out of sight soon. We\u2019ll lay low until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d his aunt asked.</p><p>Reid sighed and shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cBrynn doesn\u2019t know it yet, but I\u2019m going to transfer down to UT with her if she\u2019ll have me. I know you guys don\u2019t approve of our relationship. But... I love the girl.\u201d</p><p>His uncle downed the rest of his alcohol.</p><p>\u201cOh, the hell you will,\u201d Ros said, angry tears brimming her lids. \u201cYou are staying right here. I will not have you chasing some tramp to some state school. You are our son now, and I will not stand by and watch while you throw your life away.\u201d</p><p>Steam was ready to burst from his ears, but he kept his tone calm. \u201cIt\u2019s not your decision. I\u2019m an adult. My trust fund can pay my tuition wherever I want to go. And please don\u2019t call Brynn names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d she said, tears spilling over for real now. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave the only family you have? The family who loves you. Your mother wanted you to be with us.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t recall ever seeing his aunt cry, and the show of emotion and mention of his mother tugged at his heart. Yes, they were the only family he had. But he sometimes forgot that he was the only child his aunt and uncle had ever had as well. Even though he\u2019d come into their lives late in the game, they\u2019d never treated him like anything but a son.</p><p>Fuck. He ran his hands over his face. \u201cLook, I just need some time to think, all right? I love you guys, too, but Brynn is important to me. Why can\u2019t I have a life with all of you?\u201d</p><p>His uncle gave a world-weary sigh. \u201cBecause that\u2019s not how the world works. Life is about the tough choices. And you need to make the right one for you, for this family, and for everyone\u2019s future.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders sank with the weight of his words. For the first time since he\u2019d met Brynn, he wished she had the pedigree of someone like Vanessa. A girl who would be accepted into the fold with open arms. Life would be a hell of a lot easier.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t help who he loved.</p><p>Now he just had to figure out if love was enough.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Stupid. So fucking stupid. Reid had seen the wince cross Brynn\u2019s face when he\u2019d called her his girl. Here he was, preaching about leaving the past behind them, and he had to go and say something to remind her of it. The words had just rolled off his tongue before he could stop them. God, he was an idiot.</p><p>Sex. That\u2019s what this was. A kinky, no-strings fuck. That\u2019s why he\u2019d invited Jace for a m\u00e9nage. He had to make sure his own head didn\u2019t get screwed up being one-on-one with Brynn again. But even knowing that it was for the best, Reid had still wanted to break Jace\u2019s fingers the minute he\u2019d touched Brynn. The girl had a way of crawling beneath Reid\u2019s skin and flipping his \u201cmine\u201d switch, making him entertain bonehead ideas.</p><p>No more relationship shit. The entire four years with Vanessa had been a miserable, expensive mistake. He realized now that fighting his nature had been pointless. His dominant desires weren\u2019t going to go away, so he had to accept he\u2019d never be Mr. Ideal Husband for anyone. Long-term love wasn\u2019t in the cards. Women wanted him\u2014just not forever. Both girls he\u2019d ever tried to do the commitment thing with\u2014Brynn being one of them\u2014had confirmed it.</p><p>Still confirmed it. Based on how Brynn had reacted to having both him and Jace touching her at the same time\u2014the woman\u2019s needs still erred on the \u201cmore the merrier\u201d side. Which was fine. Once he\u2019d shoved down the wave of possessiveness that had clouded the first few minutes of their encounter, he\u2019d been able to enjoy watching Brynn writhe beneath both his and Jace\u2019s attention, had been turned on by it. And he sure as hell was going to enjoy what they had planned next. But all it could be was a fuck. He couldn\u2019t let old feelings and sentimentality blur that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make the same mistakes twice. Period. He tucked his hands in his pockets. \u201cJace, help her back into her clothes. We\u2019re moving to my cabin.\u201d</p><p>A few onlookers who had gathered at the nearby tables grumbled. Reid didn\u2019t blame them. Brynn had put on quite a show. The woman had no idea how sexy her feisty submission was. His cock flexed in his pants at the memory of her keening orgasm. Hell, if he didn\u2019t get her to his room soon, he was going to end up fucking her against the nearest wall. He inhaled a deep breath. Patience.</p><p>He had Brynn right where he needed her\u2014humming from orgasm, but slightly unsatisfied. He knew as soon as she was sated, that relentless worry segment of her brain would kick back into gear and she\u2019d revert to ice-queen status around him. Tonight he wanted to show her what could\u2019ve been\u2014what she lost when she went behind his back. Because he sure as hell knew what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>As Jace was finishing up with Brynn, Grant strolled over to Reid. The owner had the easy gait of a cowboy, but the shrewd face of a businessman who missed nothing. Grant smiled at the scene, then turned his evaluating gaze on him. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural dom. Why haven\u2019t you applied for membership here before?\u201d</p><p>Reid shrugged. \u201cMarried a girl who thought this kind of thing was sick and perverted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you\u2019re no longer married?\u201d He said it like a question, but Reid knew the man already had the answer. The background check to get in the place was more intrusive than a goddamned proctology exam.</p><p>\u201cShe cheated on me with the pastor at her church,\u201d Reid said, his voice flat. \u201cSaid she\u2019d found Jesus. Who knew he was hiding in that dickhead\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Grant smirked. \u201cGlad to see you have a sense of humor about it.\u201d</p><p>Reid glanced back toward the couch and noticed Brynn was watching the two of them intently\u2014probably hoping that she\u2019d put on a sufficient display to put any possible suspicions the club owner might\u2019ve had to rest. \u201cIt was only a matter of time. Neither of us could be what the other needed. It was as much my fault as it was hers.\u201d</p><p>Grant clapped Reid on the back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s what brought you here, but at least now you can indulge in what comes naturally to you. And what obviously comes naturally to her as well.\u201d He nodded at Brynn. \u201cNow, don\u2019t let me hold you up any longer. Enjoy your evening. And make sure to let the staff know if you need any additional equipment in your room. Most requests can be accommodated here.\u201d</p><p>He shook Grant\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Too bad he couldn\u2019t request that Grant deliver his star witness to his doorstep. Now that would be first-class service.</p><p>Although if that happened tonight, Reid\u2019s chance to touch Brynn again would be lost. The second she found out he was there to use her sister for Hank\u2019s appeal, any truce they\u2019d forged over the last few days would go up in flames. Brynn would officially hate him forever.</p><p>Dread settled in his stomach. For the first time since he\u2019d discovered the evidence, he found himself not so jazzed about locating the youngest LeBreck.</p><p>Brynn shivered as Reid sidled up next to her and slipped a hand around her waist. \u201cY\u2019all okay with moving this to private quarters?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, relieved to know they\u2019d at least be alone if she freaked out. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Jace smiled. \u201cLead the way, brother.\u201d</p><p>Reid guided her through the crowd and toward a back door. A noticeable tension rolled off his stance, his jaw steadily clenching and unclenching. She glanced back at Grant and quickly shifted her eyes downward when she saw the owner\u2019s gaze hadn\u2019t left them. She tilted her head toward Reid\u2019s ear. \u201cIs everything okay? Did Grant say something?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her tighter against him. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, sugar. He said you were a born sub. Doesn\u2019t suspect anything.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders drooped in relief. Guess she\u2019d been convincing. Not that she\u2019d had to act. Reid and Jace had brought her past the edge of conscious control. Never had she felt so purely carnal, so worshipped and desired. And there was more to come.</p><p>Her knees wobbled at the thought. She\u2019d managed to avoid a panic attack so far, but she feared the boys weren\u2019t going to leave the toys in the cabin unused. If she could stay focused on the pleasure, on the fact that these two men wouldn\u2019t harm her, maybe she could get past the whole thing altogether. Conquer the panic, the flashbacks, the nightmares.</p><p>The three of them walked in silence through the quiet night. Without the pounding music and flashing lights, their triad suddenly seemed all the more intimate\u2014Reid with his arm around her, Jace on the other side, clasping her hand. A little current of warmth, having nothing to do with sex, moved through her. She bit her lip. Stop it. This wasn\u2019t real. This was an act\u2014a means to an end. When the sun rose three days from now, life would go back to normal. She couldn\u2019t let herself forget that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>They reached the cabin, and Reid released her to insert his key into the door. Jace let her step in front of him and before the door had even clicked shut, Reid yanked her against his solid chest, and Jace closed in behind her, pressing his heat against her back. She had no time to question, think, or second-guess. A fact for which she was grateful.</p><p>Reid\u2019s lips sought hers, and Jace\u2019s mouth feasted on her neck and shoulders. Being sandwiched between the two virile men sent all sentimental feelings draining out of her and desire fired up anew. Dual erections brushed her front and back, and she ground against them.</p> <p>Reid broke from the kiss, his breaths ragged, his cool control fraying. \u201cYou\u2019ve got too much fucking clothes on. Fix that, LeBreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut leave the boots on,\u201d Jace added, a smile in his voice.</p><p>Reid stepped back and Jace joined him in front of her. Both crossed their arms over their chests, waiting, watching. The low lamplight in the room played off the angles in their faces, casting them in shadows, making the two of them look even more foreboding. She hugged herself, rubbing a chill off her arms. \u201cAren\u2019t y\u2019all going to undress, too?\u201d</p><p>The corner of Reid\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cAll in good time, sugar. In fact, maybe we\u2019ll let you do that for us.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze traced over them\u2014the two friends a study in contrast\u2014dark and light, intense and carefree. But all nice to look at. She looked forward to unwrapping each one of them to see what lay beneath their clothes.</p> <p>With shaking hands, she made quick work of unlacing her top and shimmying out of her leather skirt. Her panties hadn\u2019t made it back on\u2014they were probably tucked in some cushion of the couch in the club. She stepped out of the puddle of clothes and stood their stark naked before them, save for the boots. She didn\u2019t know what to do with her hands, lifting them first to cross over her, then dropping them at her sides.</p><p>Jace\u2019s hungry look slid shamelessly over her, and Reid\u2019s fingers flexed as if he were having a hard time not reaching out to touch her. Reid took her hand and pulled her closer to them. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful. Even better than I remember.\u201d</p><p>She knew he had to say something like that so she would feel confident enough to stand there and not dash to cover up. But for some reason, she believed he wasn\u2019t feeding her a line. Her cheeks warmed and she lowered her eyes. \u201cThanks, Reid. I, uh, I mean, sir.\u201d</p><p>He put his finger beneath her chin and tilted her face toward him. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I like the sound of my name on your lips. Feel free to scream it later.\u201d</p><p>A small smile fought to show itself\u2014some things hadn\u2019t changed. The more turned-on he got, the cockier he became. Somehow she found that little glimpse of the boy she used to know comforting. He ticked his head in Jace\u2019s direction. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get us out of these clothes, sugar. It\u2019s getting a little warm in here.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Jace, who gave her a quick wink. \u201cGo for it, doll.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her hands and worked down his white shirt, unbuttoning it until the material gaped open. He helped her work the shirt off, revealing smooth, golden skin stretched over lean muscles. An intricate tribal tattoo covered his left shoulder, snaking down his upper arm. She traced her fingers along the design and let her eyes indulge in him for a moment.</p><p>Reid chuckled from behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t stare too long, Brynn. He\u2019ll start preening.\u201d</p><p>Jace showed Reid the backside of his middle finger, but amusement lit his green eyes. \u201cShe can look... and touch whatever she likes.\u201d</p><p>Brynn bit her lip and spun to face Reid. He\u2019d already unbuttoned his own shirt, so she slid her palms along his broad shoulders and pushed it the rest of the way off. If Jace had the body of a swimmer, Reid was the football player. Strong and solid, arms that could envelop her and block out all thoughts of the outside world.</p><p>She walked her fingers down his chest and the planes of his flat stomach until she reached the smattering of dark hair trailing down to his belt. Remembering what lay beneath sent a little shudder of anticipation through her. She\u2019d never admit it to Reid\u2014she\u2019d rather have bamboo shoved beneath her fingernails\u2014but the sex she\u2019d had with him all those years ago had never been topped. Even when they were that young, the guy knew how to wring out every ounce of pleasure from her.</p><p>His hands rubbed the goose bumps from her arms, and she moved to his belt buckle. Metal scraped metal as she unfastened it and crouched to ease his pants to the floor, leaving her eye level with the bulge in his boxer briefs. Forgetting that she was supposed to ask for permission, she reached out and stroked him through the soft cotton. He groaned and ran a hand over her hair.</p><p>The rustling of Jace getting out his pants sounded behind her, but she kept her eyes on Reid\u2019s face while she slipped his cock free of the material. Her fist wrapped around him. Mmm, suede over steel. As if on instinct, she moved to her knees, the need to taste him coursing through her. She swirled her tongue over the smooth tip, tasting the salt on his skin and the bit of fluid that glistened there.</p><p>He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the rules, sugar, but fuck if I can bring myself to stop you.\u201d</p> <p>Jace tugged at her collar from behind, pulling her lips away from Reid. \u201cLet me help with that, bro. This will be much more comfortable in the bedroom. And I promise we\u2019ll keep that lovely mouth of hers full.\u201d</p><p>Jace stepped in front of her\u2014his own impressive erection jutting out proudly\u2014and in one smooth motion, lifted her up and settled her face down over his shoulder. A sharp smack to her ass made her jump. \u201cThat\u2019s for not having patience, doll. Now you\u2019ve gone and made Reid so hot, he may not be nice enough to wait for you to get off again before we fuck you.\u201d</p><p>To her horror, a whimper of need slipped out of her. Where the hell had her pride gone? She should tell them to go screw themselves, that she\u2019d be just fine without their help. But the throbbing between her legs didn\u2019t believe it. No, her whole body ached for a release that she knew only they could give her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jace carried her to the bedroom, and Reid\u2019s footsteps followed behind. Jace dumped her onto the bed without ceremony, and her eyes widened at the erotic overload of seeing both men standing before her\u2014naked and undeniably turned on. Reid nodded at the wall behind her. \u201cHelp me bind her. Facedown. I want that pretty ass in the air.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of anxiety quivered through her, but she turned to lie on her stomach. She could do this; she would do this. Her rapist, whoever that bastard was, would not continue to hold her hostage. Panic wouldn\u2019t kill her. She squeezed her eyes shut and focused on keeping her breathing even. This is not against my will. I want this\u2014want them. I can stop at any time.</p><p>Chains clinked and supple leather wrapped around each of her wrists. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Breathe. Each man yanked a bit at the bindings to make sure the cuffs were secure.</p><p>\u201cLift your head,\u201d Reid instructed.</p><p>When she did, he moved toward her with a satin mask. She reared back, rattling the metal chains connecting her to the wall and shaking her head. \u201cNo. No blindfold. Please.\u201d</p><p>Reid frowned, his eyebrows drawing together as he stared at her. The fear must\u2019ve been apparent on her face because instead of pushing the issue or telling her she wasn\u2019t in charge, he nodded and set the mask on the side table. \u201cOn your knees, LeBreck. Eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh of relief, she drew her knees beneath her and laid her cheek against the cool comforter. The sound of drawers being opened and rummaged through filled her ears. She hadn\u2019t had time to explore the contents of the dresser when she was in the room before, but she suspected it wasn\u2019t filled with socks and</p><p>T-shirts.</p><p>\u201cI saw her eyeing this one in my store,\u201d Jace said. \u201cIt may make her think twice about disobeying us again.\u201d</p><p>A loud thwack echoed through the quiet room as the leather strips of the flogger striped across her ass. She bucked against the impact, but didn\u2019t have time to catch her breath before another blow rained down on her. Her teeth bit into her lip as she waited for the stinging pain to morph into the burn of pleasure.</p><p>The bed dipped and Reid\u2019s familiar scent moved over her while Jace continued punishing her rear and the backs of her thighs. She moaned as a hot palm slid along her belly.</p><p>\u201cJace is a fucking master with a flogger, but I know you like a little pain, don\u2019t you, Brynn?\u201d His fingers parted her folds and buried inside her needy channel. Her body clenched around him, aching for more. She spread her knees wider and the tails of Jace\u2019s flogger flirted with the crack of her ass. \u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re loving it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Reid pulled his hand back, and she writhed in protest. The strips of leather smacked her pussy and she cried out\u2014the crazy pain/pleasure combination nearly sending her into instant orgasm.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jace said, his voice strained. \u201cI\u2019m usually good at this whole patience thing, but she\u2019s killing me. I\u2019ve been waiting a goddamned decade to share her with you.\u201d</p><p>Reid rose from the bed and smoothed a hand over her burning ass. The crackle of a condom wrapper was the best sound she\u2019d heard all day.</p><p>A finger tapped her cheek. \u201cOpen your eyes and let me under you, doll.\u201d</p><p>She cracked her eyes open to find Jace fisting his cock and staring at her with a hooded gaze. She rose on her elbows and let him settle against the headboard. Her mouth watered at the sight of his thick erection\u2014the tip glossy. Reid\u2019s deep voice rumbled from behind her. \u201cSuck his cock, Brynn. You don\u2019t get to come until we do.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and took Jace into her mouth, pressing her tongue along the vein on the base of his shaft and earning a shudder of pleasure from him. \u201cHoly shit. She may not have to wait long.\u201d</p><p>As she worked her tongue and mouth on Jace, Reid grabbed her hips and pressed his cock against her slick entrance. She canted her body toward him, silently begging. If he didn\u2019t get inside her in the next three seconds, she might drop the sub protocol and start yelling at him. Reid plunged forward, filling and stretching her, and she moaned against Jace.</p><p>Reid begin to pump forward at a steady pace, but Jace, way past slow and easy, grabbed her hair and fucked her mouth\u2014all the while showering her with deliciously dirty endearments. Reid soon sped up to match Jace\u2019s rhythm, and Brynn could do nothing but ride the freight train with them\u2014pushing them all toward mutual oblivion. Knowing she was driving both men to abandon, making the always-in-control alphas lose their shit, only served to ratchet up the intensity of her oncoming release more.</p><p>Her insides melted around Reid, the familiar feel of him almost too much bear. As he continued to rock into her, he reached around to tease her clit, sending contagious need to every molecule in her body. She sucked in deep breaths through her nose, trying to hold off on her orgasm until he gave her the go ahead.</p><p>Jace\u2019s grip tightened against her scalp and he pushed deeper, forcing her to relax her throat. His cock seemed to swell thicker, and with one last strangled growl, hot fluid splashed onto her tongue as he found his release.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d Reid said, increasing his tempo and strumming his fingers along her clit with new urgency. \u201cYou look so fucking hot sucking him dry.\u201d</p><p>Jace scooted back, caressing her hair as she rested her cheek against his thigh, and Reid continued to thrust into her with abandon. Lava flowed through her veins, ready to burst free and send her into the ether.</p><p>Reid\u2019s hand moved from her hip to her sweat-glazed tailbone, then down to the dimple above her buttocks. \u201cHmm, should I let you come or should I take you here first?\u201d</p><p>His finger slid down the crack of her ass and teased her forbidden opening. Horror twined with the physical pleasure of the stimulation. No, not that. She couldn\u2019t handle that. She shook her head, but her voice had left her. The moistened tip of his finger pushed against her muscles and slipped in. Tears pricked her eyes and her breathing turned short and choppy. Her body wanted it, loved the sensation, but her mind had gone on red alert. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His voice soothed as his finger slowly moved back and forth. \u201cMmm, so tight. Can\u2019t imagine how good this would feel around my cock.\u201d</p><p>Her orgasm came hard and fast, but the panic was right on its tail. Her voice scraped against her throat as she called Reid\u2019s name over and over again. Reid, oblivious to the inner battle warring within her, thrust harder and faster, chasing his own release. Her lungs strained for air, but she couldn\u2019t seem to catch a breath. Blackness edged her vision.</p> <p>A sharp ringing began in her ears, and the hands on her suddenly weren\u2019t Reid\u2019s or Jace\u2019s; they were coarse and unrelenting. Unwanted. The scent of sweat and her own fear filled her nostrils, and she was dragged back to a darkened storage room. A stranger invading her.</p><p>No. No. No. Oh, God. Dizziness overwhelmed her, and she struggled for just one tiny breath, but there was no air to be found.</p><p>Jace\u2019s worried voice cut through the end of Reid\u2019s orgasm. \u201cShit, man. Stop. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Reid lids snapped open as he pulled out of Brynn. Her body collapsed in a limp heap on the bed. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cBrynn, sugar, you okay?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond, and fear squeezed his chest. \u201cJesus, check her breathing.\u201d</p> <p>Jace put a hand near her lips. \u201cShe\u2019s breathing. I think\u2014I think she passed out.\u201d</p><p>Reid closed his eyes and blew out a breath. Thank God, she\u2019s okay. He climbed to his feet and laid a hand against her clammy cheek. \u201cWatch her. I\u2019ll go grab a cool rag and some water.\u201d</p><p>Reid returned from the bathroom with the supplies and a robe wrapped around him. He tossed another robe at Jace. \u201cHere, let me get next to her. And get these bindings off her arms.\u201d</p><p>Jace moved out of the way and went to work while Reid gently turned Brynn over and pressed the moist towel against her forehead. \u201cCome on, sugar. Wake up for me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sensed a shift in her when he\u2019d touched her ass, but when she didn\u2019t use her safe word, he\u2019d thought she was just reacting to a new sensation. Maybe he\u2019d hurt her... or scared her. Fuck. Why hadn\u2019t he stopped and checked on her?</p><p>He cradled her head in his lap, and she mumbled something incoherent. An urge to curl her into his arms and kick Jace out rolled through him. He tamped down the ridiculous thought and put the cool cloth to her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flew open on a sharp intake of breath, and terror crossed her features. She jolted upward but he put a hand on her shoulder and eased her back down. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just me. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her pupils readjusting to the light. \u201cReid?\u201d</p><p>He brushed her damp hair from her face. Her skin had taken on the pallor of the white bedsheets. \u201cYeah, babe. I\u2019ve got you. I think you passed out on us.\u201d</p><p>She winced and pressed the heel of her hand to her brow bone.</p><p>Jace sank onto the other side of the bed and tossed a quilt over her. \u201cWhat happened, doll? You all right?\u201d</p><p>Reid helped her sit up a bit and offered her a glass of water. She took a small sip and then shook her head. \u201cI think I may have hyperventilated or something.\u201d</p><p>Jace squeezed Brynn\u2019s hand, an odd expression passing over his face. \u201cDid something trigger that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shot Jace a look of... warning. \u201cI guess you guys are just a lot to handle.\u201d</p> <p>Reid\u2019s jaw tightened and the wan smile she offered the both of them did nothing to alleviate the bitter taste crossing his tongue. \u201cWhat the fuck are you two not telling me?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s eyes shifted away, and Brynn stiffened. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Reid rose from the bed and glared down at the two of them. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a terrible liar, Brynn. Tell me what\u2019s going on. Obviously, your best bud Jace knows.\u201d</p><p>Jace slid off the bed, his frown deep. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to head out and let you two chat.\u201d He leaned over and kissed Brynn\u2019s forehead. \u201cThanks for tonight, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Reid stepped out of the way to let Jace exit, but his gaze never left Brynn, who\u2019d gone even paler. She tucked her knees to her chest and wrapped the blanket around herself, vulnerability rolling off her. He walked over to the bed and perched on the corner, then took a deep breath to make sure his bubbling frustration didn\u2019t come out in his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders rose and fell with a deep sigh of resignation. \u201cI had a panic attack and hyperventilated.\u201d</p><p>His brows knitted. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d expected her to say, but that wasn\u2019t it. \u201cA panic attack over what?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze, taking an interest in an unraveling thread of the quilt. \u201cCertain things, sexual things, trigger them.\u201d</p><p>A creeping discomfort tracked up his spine. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike blindfolds and like...\u201d She continued to worry the string between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnal sex,\u201d he filled in.</p><p>She glanced up, her eyes haunted, and nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Back when they\u2019d been together, he\u2019d touched her there before, and they certainly had used blindfolds. So something had changed. A sick feeling settled in the pit of his stomach. \u201cWhy, Brynn?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me why,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I lied to you back then. I wasn\u2019t seeing someone behind your back,\u201d she said, her voice dead of emotion. \u201cSomeone raped me.\u201d</p><p>At first, he couldn\u2019t make sense of the words she\u2019d uttered\u2014the sheer shock sending his brain into a spin. No cheating? Rape. Brynn. Raped. His reply came out in a roar. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She flinched and shrank in on herself even more. \u201cThe night I broke up with you, I\u2019d just been attacked.\u201d</p><p>He shot up from the bed, his body burning with rage. He needed to punch something\u2014no, someone\u2014the bastard who did this to her. His fists balled, and he forced himself to breathe. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell someone? Call the police? Or for God\u2019s sake, tell me? I went to you that night.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. He threatened me\u2014my family. And I was so confused. He told me you had a real girlfriend, that I was only your whore. And then when I saw your picture in the paper a few days later with Vanessa, I knew he\u2019d told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair and leaned against the dresser. His guts had been torn out the night he and Brynn had broken up. But God, had he been so hurt, so angry that he\u2019d missed the fact that she\u2019d needed help? \u201cJesus, Brynn. You didn\u2019t even let me explain about Vanessa. I would\u2019ve helped you. And I would\u2019ve fucking killed the guy who did it to you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and rubbed her arms through the blanket. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have had the chance. I still have no idea who he was.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, a piercing pain slicing through his skull. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you back then, but I\u2019m listening now. Tell me what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>then</p><p>Brynn thought the blindfold was part of the surprise. Reid had promised something special tonight, but he hadn\u2019t clued her in as to what exactly he had in mind. She smiled as the dark fabric blocked out the low lights of the storage room. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>Lips pressed against the back of her neck. Hot hands caressed her shoulders, her arms. \u201cShh...\u201d</p><p>She shivered beneath the touch. So he was going to be Mr. Serious Dom tonight. Alrighty. She wet her lips. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her forearms with firm fingers and pulled them behind her back. Instead of the usual cloth or rope, something less forgiving circled her wrists\u2014plastic? A quick zipping sound filled the silent room as he yanked on the bindings, tightening them to the point of discomfort. \u201cOuch, hey. Could you loosen those up a bit?\u201d</p><p>With a grunt, he gave another pull, and the zip tie bit into her flesh deeper. She squirmed and tried to turn around, but he gripped her shoulder and held her in place.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on, I\u2019m serious. That hurts. Ruby,\u201d she said, using the word Reid had told her would signal to him something was wrong.</p><p>His chuckle was low and sent a chill through her insides. \u201cIs that the special word you use with him?\u201d</p><p>The unfamiliar whisper made her jolt forward, panic seizing her, but the stranger wrapped an arm around her neck and dragged her against him. A scream ripped from her throat.</p><p>His hand slapped her across the mouth and his whisper turned fierce. \u201cNow, now, no yelling. You can fight all you want, that\u2019ll make it better. But keep that big mouth shut or I\u2019ll find something to shove in it. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tears flooding her eyes. When he released her mouth, words tumbled out of her. \u201cPlease, let me go. My boyfriend\u2019s on the way. He\u2019ll be here any minute. If you go now, I promise I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Brynn. So naive. Your boyfriend won\u2019t be making it. He\u2019s at an event with his real girlfriend, Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>The wind left her lungs. This asshole knew her name? My God, this was someone she knew? The rest of his statement registered, and she shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. We have plans. I\u2019m his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart. Haven\u2019t you realized it yet? You\u2019re just his whore.\u201d The smile in his disguised whisper rang in her ears. \u201cYou think he\u2019s going to parade around trash like you on his arm?\u201d</p><p>The words stung as much as the bindings around her wrists. She couldn\u2019t muster a response.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But even though you\u2019re only temporary, whores like you have a way of fucking up the lives of perfectly good men, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d He pet her head like she was a dog, and her whole body began to shake with terror. \u201cSo after tonight, you\u2019re going to end things with him. Otherwise, this won\u2019t be the last time we meet. Only next time, maybe I\u2019ll take that sweet little sister of yours for a ride instead. I wonder if she likes being treated like a slut as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>An inhuman scream of rage ripped from her lungs, and his hand clamped around her neck with crushing force.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, you stupid bitch, and let\u2019s see how rough you like it.\u201d</p><p>Blackness edged her vision as she fought for breath.</p><p>His other hand moved to the neckline of her blouse and ripped downward, shredding the delicate fabric and her world all in one swift motion.</p><p>Reid tucked the last surprise next to the silver promise ring nestled in the box and smiled. Brynn would probably think he was being high-handed and had lost his mind, but he hoped once she got past that, she\u2019d be excited. He\u2019d agonized over the decision his aunt and uncle had laid at his feet, and he still had a burning ball of guilt in his stomach. But the last few months had been the most amazing of his life, and he couldn\u2019t bear to let the woman responsible flit off to Austin without showing her how serious he was about her. He just hoped against hope that if it worked out between them, that one day his family would accept her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said the words \u201cI love you\u201d to Brynn yet; he\u2019d been too afraid to scare her off, but he\u2019d known them to be true since his trip to Galveston. Tonight, he\u2019d tell her\u2014lay his feelings and his plan out there and see what she thought.</p><p>He checked his watch\u2014fifteen minutes before he was supposed to pick her up at the office. She\u2019d insisted on working late again to squeeze in any last overtime hours she could get. Too bad he couldn\u2019t tell her he already had the apartment she\u2019d been saving up for taken care of. He\u2019d put the deposit down on hers and the one across the hall from it a week ago.</p><p>He tucked the box with the key to that apartment and the ring into his jacket pocket and headed out of the house to his car, feeling lighter than he had in days. But as soon as he rounded the corner, the little zip in his step died. Vanessa Thomas was sitting on his hood, a big smile lighting her face. \u201cOoh, you look nice. But that may be kind of dressy for an outdoor party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His brows drew together, still processing her sudden appearance. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Ness?\u201d</p><p>She hopped off the car and brushed invisible dirt from her white tennis skirt. \u201cYour aunt said you\u2019d go with me to the Stevens\u2019 barbecue tonight. Didn\u2019t she mention it to you? Both she and your uncle are going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, not so much,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really sorry, but I have plans tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her bottom lip out as if it held some magic power to change his mind. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go by myself\u2014how would that look? Lauren Gates is going to be there and you know she\u2019ll never let me here the end of it if I show up without a date.\u201d</p><p>Reid closed his eyes and counted to three. Be nice. He\u2019d been accompanying Vanessa to events over the summer to make his aunt and uncle happy, and she really was a great girl. But she wasn\u2019t Brynn. \u201cNess, I really can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her pout lifted into a coy smile. \u201cCome on. After the party, we can hang out at my place. My parents went to the lake house for a few days, so we\u2019ll have it all to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>He had to stifle a laugh. So, Miss I-Wear-a-True-Love-Waits-Ring was ready to have him over for dessert. Guess true love only waits until the parents are out of town. He shook his head. A few months ago, he would\u2019ve jumped on the opportunity to entertain the pretty debutante for the weekend. But the thought held no appeal anymore.</p> <p>The only person he wanted curled up next to him in his bed was Brynn. His Brynn. Who was going to be pissed if he showed up late for their big date. \u201cWow, I appreciate the offer, but I can\u2019t break this commitment. I\u2019m sorry you came all the way out here.\u201d</p><p>As he stepped past her and hit the unlock button on his keypad, she reached out and grabbed his arm. \u201cHey, wait. My dad dropped me off. I didn\u2019t bring a car.\u201d</p><p>Motherfucker. He glanced at his watch and sighed. The Stevens\u2019 house was at least ten minutes out of the way. \u201cFine, get in, I\u2019ll drop you off on my way.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and lifted on tiptoes to plant a kiss on his cheek. \u201cGreat, and maybe you can just stop in for a minute and say hi.\u201d</p><p>Reid took the turn into Brynn\u2019s driveway on two wheels. Vanessa had insisted he walk her into the party, and she\u2019d roped him into a photo-op for the society section of the newspaper and half a dozen introductions. Then, his aunt and uncle had dragged him into a conversation with the mayor. Now he was a solid hour late for his date with Brynn. He\u2019d stopped by the office to pick her up, but she\u2019d already left. And she wasn\u2019t answering her phone.</p><p>Damn it. He\u2019d wanted tonight to go perfectly and he\u2019d screwed that up. Hopefully, once she saw what he had planned she\u2019d forgive him.</p> <p>He hustled up the sidewalk and knocked on her door, praying that she wasn\u2019t too upset with him, but no one answered. Oh, come on. Her car was in the driveway, so he knew she had to be home. Was she mad enough not to answer the door? She usually wasn\u2019t that easily angered.</p><p>He knocked again, and the door finally cracked open. He opened his mouth to launch into his apology speech, but when he took in Brynn\u2019s state, the words died on his lips.</p><p>Brynn was dressed in gray sweats, her hair damp from a shower, and her eyes bloodshot and puffy.</p><p>\u201cSugar, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d he asked, reaching out for her.</p><p>She shrunk back before he touched her. \u201cI... uh... I\u2019m not feeling very well. I think I may have the flu.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOh, no, that sucks. Is there anything I can do? Obviously, you can\u2019t go out, but do you want me to go pick up some soup and we can watch movies or something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, and he had the impression that she may burst into tears. \u201cNo, but can you come in for a minute? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He tucked his keys in his pocket. \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d</p> <p>She walked back into her living room and he followed, shutting the door behind him. She curled into the chair and tucked her knees to her chest. He had to stop himself from going over to her, picking her up and holding her. He\u2019d never seen her look so miserable.</p><p>He sat on the couch. \u201cLook, before you start, I just want to tell you, I am so sorry for being late. I got hung up and couldn\u2019t get away. And I tried to call, but then I couldn\u2019t reach you. And I feel like a dick.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her face emotionless. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to end this.\u201d</p><p>The words hit him like an anvil to the gut and halted his rambling. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went watery, and she quickly swiped at her face with her sweatshirt-covered hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Reid. But this\u2014us\u2014has to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d His heart began to pound in his ears and panic edged in. Where the hell had this come from? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She looked down, staring at the now damp sleeves of her shirt. \u201cYou knew this had an expiration date. We agreed to have a summer thing. Summer\u2019s over. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>He sat forward on the sofa, hope entering his voice. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to end. That\u2019s what I was going to tell you tonight. There are ways we can work this out. I can go to Austin with you.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up, her reddened eyes wide. \u201cYou want to move?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah, sugar. I want to be with you. Wherever that is.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her tears returning. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Screw the flu. He got off the couch and went to crouch in front of her chair, laying a tentative hand on her knee. \u201cBaby, sure I can. I don\u2019t know what the future holds. But all I know is I don\u2019t want to let you go. Nothing is holding me here, and in Austin, we won\u2019t even have to worry about anyone seeing us. We can just be together\u2014wherever and whenever we want.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and stayed that way for a moment before taking a deep, shaky breath. Her voice came out flat. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else, Reid. I have a boyfriend waiting for me in Austin. This was just supposed to be a fling. I love him.\u201d</p><p>All sounds in the room suddenly seemed painfully loud. The ticking clock above the couch, the used car salesman on TV, the hum of the box fan on the other side of the room. His hand slipped off her knee, and he sank back onto his heels.</p><p>A lump the size of a grapefruit lodged in his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same reason why you didn\u2019t tell me about Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, she\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s not who you were with tonight?\u201d she asked, her voice more sad than angry.</p><p>His stunned silence gave her the answer.</p><p>\u201cHow long would it take for you to get tired of me? To want someone who fits into your life. We come from different worlds. This just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d She rose from the chair and gave him one last lingering look before turning her back to him. \u201cPlease just go. I won\u2019t be returning to work. I wish you the best, Reid.\u201d</p><p>And with that, the only girl he\u2019d ever loved walked out of his life.</p><p>Brynn locked herself in her bedroom and waited until she heard the front door close before crumpling into a ball on the floor, wishing she could shut her eyes and not wake up again. But every time her eyelids closed, the feel of the monster\u2019s hands crawled over her skin, and images of Reid\u2019s brokenhearted face tore through her.</p><p>There was no escape. No safe corner in her mind. Maybe never would be again.</p><p>So she cried and stared blankly at the peeling paint on the baseboards, letting the sobs wrack her abused body well into the night, until she was only a husk of the person she had been a few hours before. Until she felt dead inside.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Brynn nestled deeper into the crook of Reid\u2019s arm, the bed squeaking beneath her, and he ran his palm over her hair. She\u2019d told him everything, dragged out the nasty innards of what had happened to her, and laid it out there unedited.</p><p>He\u2019d listened to every word\u2014shock, sympathy, and anger crossing his face at different intervals. But to his credit, even though she could tell he\u2019d had questions, he\u2019d held his tongue and had let her finish without interruption, as if sensing that if she\u2019d paused, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to get it all out.</p><p>His chest rose and fell under her cheek as he drew in a deep breath and released it. \u201cMy God, Brynn. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d she said, feeling tired, gutted.</p><p>He pressed his lips to the crown of her head, and his voice turned strained. \u201cThis was all my fault. If I hadn\u2019t been late, I could\u2019ve stopped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sitting up so she could face him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. The rape was not your fault. It was that psycho\u2019s fault, whoever he is.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his jaw set. \u201cNo, I could\u2019ve helped. Could\u2019ve been there for you.\u201d</p><p>The guilt in his words tore at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t let you. I almost broke down and called you about a week later. But then I saw the photo in the paper of you and Vanessa at that party, and I figured you were probably better off. It\u2019s not like I would\u2019ve been able to continue the kind of relationship we had. You saw what happened earlier. Blindfolds, being restrained, aggressive guys\u2014it all can set off panic attacks or flashbacks for me now.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me when we got here? I would\u2019ve never made you do all this. We could\u2019ve done the bare minimum to get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about the details of that night just drags me back there, so I didn\u2019t want to open myself up to that again. Plus, I thought coming here could be a cure. Sometimes throwing yourself totally into the fear can fix it.\u201d She looked down at her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of feeling this way, letting it interfere with my life. I wanted to see if I could force myself past it, have a shot at a normal life, a chance at finding a normal relationship.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI feel like such an asshole. I pushed you harder than I ever have. You must\u2019ve been miserable the whole time we\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>She gave a half-smile. \u201cWell, not the whole time. You and Jace made it a bit difficult to focus on anything but the two of you.</p><p>I thought the rip-off-the-Band-Aid method was working, but then\u2014\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI took it too far. I was so wrapped up in my own crap that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to your signals. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know. It was stupid for me to think I could get over it that easily. Clearly, I\u2019m too screwed up for a quick fix. I just hope I can make it through tomorrow night without completely losing it again.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and rubbed her knee. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. You\u2019re not screwed up\u2014you\u2019ve been through hell. The fact that you had the balls to come here in the first place is amazing. If you want to skip tomorrow night, I can go alone\u2014try to track Kelsey down for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. She\u2019s not going to be willing to talk to anyone but me. I\u2019ll figure out a way to get through it. And if the panic takes over, I\u2019ll have you and Jace there to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there for whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity emanating from his blue eyes sent hazy warmth through her. She leaned forward and kissed him lightly on the lips. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With this thumb, he swiped away the lone tear that had slipped past her lids. \u201cThanks for finally trusting me with the truth.\u201d</p><p>Without considering the consequences, she dipped back down, seeking a deeper kiss. She knew it was dangerous, stupid. But after rehashing the rape, she needed to erase the ugliness of the last hour. She didn\u2019t want to think about that night or the daunting task of finding her sister tomorrow or all the reasons why she needed to avoid Reid now. All she wanted to do was bury herself in the feeling she used to get when it was just the two of them\u2014like no problem in the world was too big to tackle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Reid\u2019s eyebrows rose in surprise when her mouth touched his again, but after a second\u2019s pause, he slipped his fingers along the nape of her neck and drew her in closer. His tongue parted her lips, and his other hand drifted to the small of her back. Instead of the frantic need that had colored their earlier encounter, he took a languid pace with his kiss and explored her mouth with heated tenderness, savoring her.</p><p>He eased back against the pillows, lowering her until her breasts pressed into the solid planes of his chest. Her muscles melted against him, and she sank into the moment\u2014relishing his flavor, the feel of his stubble against her face, the scent of fading cologne and man. If she could bottle minutes, she would capture these.</p> <p>Too soon, Reid withdrew and stared up at her with conflicted eyes. He cradled the side of her face. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long night, sugar. How about I go run you a hot bath?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead against his, recognizing a retreat when she saw it. A swift reminder that despite their heartfelt conversation, this situation was only a means to an end and sex. Intimate make-out sessions could lead nowhere good. She rolled off him and stretched, noticing for the first time how her muscles ached. \u201cSounds heavenly.\u201d</p><p>He climbed off the bed and belted his robe, his smile warm, but his stance stiff. \u201cBe back in a few minutes, sugar.\u201d</p><p>True to his word, he returned to the bedroom a little while later and lifted her off the bed. She laughed. \u201cYou were a lot to handle, but I can still walk, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wound me,\u201d he said with mock hurt. \u201cBut I\u2019m carrying you anyway. I\u2019ve put you through a lot tonight, let me take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>He nudged open the bathroom door with his foot and carried her into the lavish bathroom. Instant warmth kissed her skin. He\u2019d lit the candles around the edge of the enormous Jacuzzi tub and the scent of lavender wafted off the curls of steam rising from the water. \u201cWow, now that is what I call drawing a bath.\u201d</p><p>He set her on her feet and pulled off the T-shirt she\u2019d borrowed from him. He smiled down at her, his eyes dark in the flickering candlelight. \u201cGlad you approve.\u201d</p><p>She tugged at the knot in his robe. \u201cYou joining me?\u201d</p><p>He palmed her bare hip and drew her closer. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge right now, babe. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>She yanked the tie harder and his robe fell open, revealing miles of muscle and rugged male beauty. Her hands moved to his chest, her fingertips exploring the lines of his collarbone, his sternum, the cut of his wide shoulders. She pushed off the robe the rest of the way. \u201cI think I don\u2019t want to be alone with my thoughts right now.\u201d</p><p>He caught one of her hands and brought it to his lips, placing a kiss in the center of her palm. \u201cThen I\u2019d be honored to join you.\u201d</p> <p>With the ease of a child picking up a doll, he swept her back into his arms and carried her to the tub to lower her in. The heat enveloped her and her aching muscles, inspiring a long, satisfied sigh. Once he had her safely immersed, he climbed in and settled behind her, letting her recline against his chest.</p><p>She caught their intertwined reflection in the mirrored wall at the foot of the tub. \u201cThe mirror isn\u2019t steaming over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably treat it with something so nothing interferes with the view. They think of everything here.\u201d He kissed her shoulder. \u201cComfortable?\u201d</p><p>She let her hands drift along the strong thighs that framed her. \u201cYou may need to carry me out afterward. I think my muscles have liquefied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d he said, his voice right next to her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you anywhere you want to go.\u201d</p><p>He reached for a sponge on the side of the bathtub and squirted it with vanilla-scented soap. With slow, methodical strokes, he began to wash her neck and shoulders, working the knots of tension from them. Her mind was a twisted mess, but the combination of shear emotional and physical exhaustion and Reid\u2019s skilled hands were swiftly lulling her into a hazy, almost numb state.</p><p>He grazed a finger over the scar that marred the back of her left shoulder, and she momentarily tensed. But when he didn\u2019t ask about it, she relaxed again, closed her eyes, and leaned forward so he could reach her back. \u201cAren\u2019t I supposed to be doing this for you, Master?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but continued washing. \u201cYou can remove that tongue of yours from your cheek, smart-ass. First of all, you\u2019re not my slave. Even if this weekend were real, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m into. And secondly, you\u2019re assuming I don\u2019t get pleasure from taking care of you like this. Believe me, washing your naked body is no hardship.\u201d</p> <p>His hands slid over her rib cage, and she sank back against him while he scrubbed circles over her belly. She mulled over what he\u2019d said for a moment. \u201cWhat do you mean, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re into? I thought the whole slave thing was what this was all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love taking sexual control of a woman\u2014especially one who\u2019s used to being in charge in the rest of her life. Love bringing her to a level of release she didn\u2019t even know she could reach. But I\u2019m not looking to take it outside of that realm or have a partner submit to me twenty-four seven like a lot of the people here. That holds no appeal for me.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip, considering his answer. \u201cSo you\u2019re just looking to have a good time with someone, then go home to your normal life.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cPretty much. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that relationships and this scene don\u2019t mix well for me. But I can\u2019t shut off the desire\u2014it\u2019s part of who I am. So yeah, now that I\u2019m divorced, I\u2019ll probably join a club and keep the play separate from the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>A bitter taste filled her mouth. \u201cAnd keep it a secret from whoever you\u2019re with?\u201d</p><p>His hands paused, and she could feel him bristle beneath her. \u201cNo, despite what you thought happened when we were dating, I don\u2019t cheat. All I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019ve done the marriage and commitment thing, I don\u2019t need to do it again.\u201d</p><p>She swirled her fingers in the bubbles. \u201cAnd you think you can be happy just having random hookups at some club?\u201d</p><p>His shrug sent a ripple through the water. \u201cWorks for Jace.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, not sure why Reid\u2019s plan annoyed her so much. What did she care about how he chose to live his life? Her mind drifted to all the subs she\u2019d passed in the club last night, all the women who had sent envious glances her way. Would one of those women be kneeling at his feet next weekend? The thought made her intestines knot.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s running through that busy mind of yours?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes traveled to the mirror and met his probing blue stare. She quickly shifted her focus to one of the candles on the side of the bathtub, scrabbling to come up with another thought to share besides the one she\u2019d been having. \u201cIt amazes me that people can go into this kind of dynamic with strangers. I mean, for the dom it\u2019s not as much of a risk, you hold the control. But for the sub... there\u2019s so much trust that needs to be there. Even if I wasn\u2019t dealing with my panic attacks, I can\u2019t imagine willingly turning myself over to someone I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled the curve of her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something to enter lightly with strangers. If you ever get the urge to sub again, you can come to whatever club I join. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re well taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not that girl anymore.\u201d Even if she could get past her anxiety, she had no desire to live some clandestine double life. Growing up, she\u2019d expended enough energy hiding her mother\u2019s secrets and feeling ashamed. Never again would she be the subject of hushed neighborhood whispers.</p><p>No, after this weekend, her dalliance with sexual submission was done for good. She would move on and continue searching for the guy who would fit into the vision she had for her future. Nice suburban home, a few kids, maybe a dog\u2014the kind of normal, respectable existence she\u2019d only been able to glimpse from afar growing up.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, then?\u201d he asked, his voice quiet.</p><p>The question hung in the air, taunting her. How could she reconcile the woman she thought herself to be with the one who\u2019d melted under the commands and hands of the man sitting behind her? One who\u2019d let two men tie her up and enjoyed it? She shook her head, a lump lodging in her throat.</p><p>\u201cShh, never mind,\u201d he said, apparently sensing her darkening mood. \u201cNo stress allowed in the bathtub.\u201d</p><p>The sponge moved higher, over her navel, the ripples of her ribs, tickling the underside of her breasts. His movements were gentle, but not tentative\u2014as if he sensed the only way to pull her from her spiraling thoughts was to draw her back into her senses. It was his gift and one of the reasons he\u2019d been so addictive back when they\u2019d dated. He\u2019d always been able to quiet the storm for her, bring her into a place where all she had to do was listen to his commands and feel his touch. A welcome respite from the constant beehive of worries and responsibilities in her mind.</p><p>The mild abrasiveness of the sponge crested the curve of her breast and moved over the distended nipples. Darts of pleasure trekked from the point of contact outward, chasing the tension that had tiptoed into her tendons back into the shadows. She let out a little murmur of appreciation and stretched her leg onto the edge of the tub.</p><p>A rumble of Jacuzzi jets cut through the quiet room, startling her, and fat bubbles broke through the still water. \u201cUh-oh, I must\u2019ve hit a button.\u201d</p><p>He kept his attention on her breasts, dropping the sponge and soaping the swells with his agile hands. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Might as well enjoy all the tub has to offer.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back and arched into his touch. He gave her needy buds a firm pinch and the sensation shot straight to another swelling bud between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cJust lay back and relax, sugar.\u201d His hands moved down until they slid to the outside of her thighs. She offered no resistance as he tucked his palms under her knees and spread her legs wide, positioning her in the direct line of one of the jets.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She jerked back as the warm current of water pulsed against her already sensitive clit, but he kept her in place, holding her as well as any restraints ever could.</p><p>\u201cLet me make up for ruining your pleasure earlier. I promise I won\u2019t let you drown.\u201d He dragged his tongue along her shoulder, lapping up the droplets of water beading there. \u201cMmm, and maybe I won\u2019t let you dry off after the bath. I might just lick you clean instead.\u201d</p><p>She moaned at the image he\u2019d painted and at the relentless throb of water against her. Already, the coils of need inside her were tightening to the breaking point. Her body arched, sending water sloshing out of the tub and onto the tiled floor. She dug her nails into his thighs, trying to keep herself from slipping fully under the water. \u201cReid. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, give in to it. I have you. Just let go, let it all go, and trust that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>The jets were like legions of hot tongues flicking, caressing, and nibbling her most sensitive nerves all at the same time. Tremors coursed through her, sending bigger and bigger waves of pleasure splashing over her, building toward the tsunami she knew was lingering in the distance.</p><p>Reid eased her thighs wider, opening her completely, giving them both a view of her water-slicked nudity in the mirror. He nipped at the back of her neck but kept his eyes focused on the reflection. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful when you let go. Let me watch you come for me.\u201d</p><p>As if his command willed it, the jets shifted to just the right spot and her nerve endings exploded into bright bursts of sparkling pleasure. A hoarse cry ripped from her throat, echoing off the walls in the room, and her body thrashed against him. He held her in place until she was almost at the edge of sanity, then swiftly kicked off the Jacuzzi and released her legs to sink back against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He gathered her closer to him, turning her, and tucked her head under his chin. Her body continued to quiver with aftershocks as he rubbed a gentle hand up and down her back. When she finally stilled, he slipped an arm under her knees. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here and into bed. It\u2019s been a long night.\u201d</p><p>He set her on the closed lid of the toilet and toweled her off with patient attention. Her muscles felt like wet rubber bands, but the buzzing afterglow of her orgasm and the view of the sexy man before her had entertaining other ideas than sleep. Her eyes traveled over Reid\u2019s luscious backside as he bent to grab a T-shirt from his bag. He had slipped on a pair of boxer briefs, but before he had turned, she hadn\u2019t missed the ramrod erection he was sporting.</p> <p>When he spun to face her again, he smirked. \u201cLeBreck, are you checking me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a girl look?</p><p>He laughed as he slipped the shirt over her head. \u201cSure, I give you permission to objectify me at any time.\u201d</p><p>She poked his side. \u201cYou\u2019re an arrogant bastard, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He bent and laid a quick kiss on her lips. \u201cYou love it. Now come on, off to bed with you.\u201d</p> <p>Reid carried Brynn into the bedroom and settled her beneath the covers. She closed her eyes and for the brief moment, he let himself drink in the view. The polished, put-together professional was nowhere to be found. Her makeup had long since worn off and her blond hair was starting to curl where it\u2019d gotten wet. He loved seeing her like this\u2014her only adornment the flushed hue of a woman well satisfied. If she were his, he\u2019d make sure that she went to bed every night with that look.</p><p>He groaned inwardly. There he went again\u2014thinking stupid shit about staking some claim on her. He\u2019d already stuck a toe in dangerous waters, offering to take her on as a sub if she ever wanted to join him at a club. As if she\u2019d ever be open to that after she found out why he was really here.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d recoiled at the idea anyway. And how could he blame her? Brynn didn\u2019t want a guy who could offer her a weekend collar; she wanted one that would offer her a lifetime ring. Deserved it.</p><p>She shifted onto her elbow and peered up at him from under her lashes. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you get a little TLC, too.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was as innocent as a spring morning, but the suggestion in those moss-colored eyes shot straight to his groin. \u201cSugar, it\u2019s almost three in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She nodded toward the now aching bulge in his shorts. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like your friend knows that.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a rueful smile. There\u2019d be nothing he\u2019d like more than to slide in bed next to her and keep her awake until the sun came up, but he knew better. Besides the fact that they needed to be rested for tomorrow, one-on-one sex with Brynn was not an option. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. He can\u2019t help standing at attention anytime you\u2019re around. You\u2019ve already given me more than enough tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. \u201cSince when have you gotten enough?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed the crown of her head. \u201cSince I discovered years ago that you are absolutely insufferable without sleep. I refuse to subject myself or the rest of the resort to that tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her lip out in a mock pout and shifted into a sitting position, bringing her thin T-shirt and the hard points of her nipples into clear view. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He turned away from her and headed toward the closet, trying to think of anything besides how much he wanted to tear the shirt off her, seize those tight little buds with clamps, and test out that spanking bench taunting him at the end of the bed.</p><p>He\u2019d lock her down on all fours, spread her wide so he could enjoy every detail of that smooth pussy, her sweet ass. He\u2019d tease and pinch and nibble until her honey dripped down her thighs\u2014until he knew she was aching just for him. Then he\u2019d take her\u2014utterly and completely\u2014until she was so exhausted that all she\u2019d be able to do when he was done with her would be to curl in his arms and let him hold her while she slept.</p><p>His erection hardened to the point of pain, and he had to stifle a groan. Fuck. He needed space. Air. Something. Before he broke every rule he\u2019d set for himself coming into this thing. He yanked a pillow and extra blanket off the top shelf of the closet and spun to face her.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest, LeBreck,\u201d he said, forcing a casual tone. \u201cWe have another full day ahead of us tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Her attention zeroed in on the items in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rough sleeper. It\u2019ll be best for both of us if I use the sofa bed out front.\u201d He knew the excuse was lame, knew she would see through it. But at the moment, he didn\u2019t care. He needed out of the room. Now.</p><p>A cool mask stole over her features, and he could almost see the mental retreat from the openness they\u2019d shared a few minutes earlier. She leaned over and clicked off the bedside lamp, plunging them into shadows. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to shut the door on your way out.\u201d</p><p>He cringed at the icy tone. He\u2019d hurt her. He\u2019d known it would, but if he stayed, he\u2019d hurt her much worse. So without another word, he stepped out of the bedroom and put a solid wooden door between them\u2014hoping it was strong enough to protect them both.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Brynn sat on the side of the bed with her knees to her chest, staring out the window as the last glimmers of the setting sun peeked through the trees bordering the back of their cabin. She and Reid had wandered to every possible place on the grounds today\u2014smiling, touching, acting like a couple. Convincing everyone within shouting distance that they were for real.</p><p>Almost convincing her.</p><p>She rubbed her burning eyes. Absolute exhaustion had overtaken the two of them late this afternoon, and Reid had suggested they come back to the cabin to shower and rest before the festival. He\u2019d managed to fall asleep on the sofa bed. But, she\u2019d only closed her eyes for a few seconds before uninvited thoughts had crawled into her brain and taken over like ants at a picnic.</p><p>When Reid had shut the door to the bedroom the night before, she\u2019d been left with a feeling she hadn\u2019t experienced in a decade\u2014a hollow, yawning ache deep inside her chest. A feeling of incompleteness. Of wanting. Needing. Forcing her to accept something she\u2019d thought long dead.</p><p>She loved Reid. Probably had always loved him. And no matter how many miles, years, chapters of life she\u2019d put between them, she couldn\u2019t run from the fact that some door within her only accepted Reid\u2019s key. Being with him again had flung that door wide open, yearning for him to step inside and stay awhile.</p><p>Only Reid had no interest in stepping over the threshold. Couldn\u2019t. He needed something she couldn\u2019t give him, and she wanted the kind of life he had no interest in.</p><p>She rested her chin on her knees and rocked, letting the realization that she was going to have to let him go all over again roll over her. She knew, technically, she didn\u2019t even have him this time. But when he\u2019d held her last night, caressed away her fears, it had felt like he was hers and she his\u2014if just for a few moments. A few perfect minutes.</p><p>Now there would be no more. At least not with him.</p><p>She prided herself on being able to tough things out in life, but she couldn\u2019t grit her teeth through this one. After the Bacchanal, there would be no more playacting with Reid. Every time he touched her, whispered her name, commanded her, she fell a little deeper into the hole. If she let herself tumble any further, she\u2019d never be able to climb out. So before the party tonight, she needed to draw the line between them again so they could move forward and coexist. The only time he needed to touch her was at the Bacchanal. Period.</p><p>A light knock on the front door roused her from her thoughts. She stood and wrapped her robe around her. Quietly, she padded down the hallway and peeked into the living room. Reid was still splayed across the sofa bed, the sheets a tangled mess around his legs, and his bare chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Every muscle in her body strained to move forward, to crawl into bed next to him, and bury her face in his neck\u2014absorb his scent, his heat, his being.</p><p>The hole in her chest widened a bit more, and she forced her eyes away from the scene. She hurried to the front door and swung it open. No one was there, but two toga-style costumes were hanging from the hook on the front of the door and two familiar black bags sat on the doorstep. Hallelujah.</p><p>Careful not to make any noise, she grabbed her suitcase and purse and set them inside the door. A small white envelope with her name fell off the top of the larger bag. She slid open the sealed flap and pulled out the card.</p><p>Ms. LeBreck, your master informed us that you have earned the privilege of your things. If you need anything additional, please request it through him.</p><p>\u2014The Ranch Staff</p><p>She rolled her eyes. So Reid could\u2019ve have given her access to her clothes last night. Opportunistic bastard. But even as she thought the words, a smile touched her lips.</p><p>She lifted the costumes off the door hook and laid them over the back of a nearby chair, then closed the door. Reid flipped over to his stomach, providing her with a buffet of delicious skin and sinewy muscles, but seemed to still be in a deep sleep. Not surprising\u2014the man had always slept like the dead.</p><p>She checked the clock over the dining room table. Still an hour before the festivities started. She didn\u2019t want to wake Reid yet since it wasn\u2019t time to go, but she was starting to feel a bit stir- crazy. Maybe she could take a walk toward the vineyards. All the private cabins were along that path and people would inevitably be heading out for the evening. Couldn\u2019t hurt to watch who was coming and going. Maybe she could intercept Kelsey before they even got to the party.</p><p>She headed to the bathroom with her costume, changed into the short, wine-colored toga, and twisted her hair into a knot. Next, she fastened the leather collar that marked her as attached around her neck. The one-shouldered outfit definitely covered more than her ensemble from the night before, but she couldn\u2019t help wondering how long the costume would stay on at an event like this. She\u2019d seen paintings of the bacchanals of Ancient Rome in her college art history class. It wasn\u2019t the fashion that had inspired lewd comments from the guys in the back row.</p><p>She smoothed the fabric with trembling hands and took a deep breath. I will make it through tonight. I\u2019ll talk Kels into coming home with me. Everything\u2019s going to be fine.</p><p>She gave a derisive snort, making a mental note to nix her practice of prescribing positive affirmation to her clients. Clearly, it was bullshit.</p><p>On quiet feet she made her way back through the living room and to the small dining room table. Reid had set a laptop bag next to one of the chairs and had placed his computer and a legal pad on the table. Apparently, she hadn\u2019t been the only one who\u2019d had trouble sleeping the night before. She sat down in the chair and grabbed the pad so she could leave him a note, but frowned when she saw there was no pen in sight. Leaning down, she peered into his unzipped bag to see if one was in there.</p><p>She spotted one in an inner pocket and moved aside a few files to unzip the mesh pouch. But when she shoved aside the last one, the name on the manila folder caught her eye. After casting a quick look at Reid to make sure he was still asleep, she snatched the folder from the bag and laid it on the table next to the laptop.</p><p>Hank Caldwell. The name alone made acid rise in the back of her throat. Her mother\u2019s murderer.</p><p>And Reid\u2019s client.</p><p>Why would he have Hank\u2019s file in his bag? The case had been closed for two years, and the guy had gotten a life sentence\u2014so no parole hearings to worry about. She drummed her fingers along the outside of the folder. She knew she shouldn\u2019t look. Didn\u2019t even know if she wanted to look. What if it contained copies of crime scene photos?</p><p>She\u2019d seen the horrible scene in person and had done her best to block the images from her mind\u2014though they still showed up in her nightmares from time to time. Her mother\u2019s lifeless body, the gunshot wound to the chest, all the blood. So much blood. And the feeling of complete despair that had overtaken her when she\u2019d realized her mother was gone. Taken\u2014right when she\u2019d finally started to work toward a better life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Her mom had hit six months of sobriety, was looking for a new place and a respectable job. Had even saved some money to get a fresh start. And then, wham! Gone forever. All because Hank Caldwell, Kelsey\u2019s druggie boyfriend, had heard about her mother\u2019s savings and needed cash to get that night\u2019s fix. Fucking psychopath.</p><p>And then to add vinegar to Brynn\u2019s open wounds, she\u2019d shown up that first day in court to see Reid and his aunt Roslyn sitting next to the cold-blooded bastard. Defending him.</p> <p>Apparently, Hank\u2019s wealthy family, who had previously disowned him because of his drug use, had jumped in at the last second to lawyer-up their son and pay the Jamisons\u2019 exorbitant legal fees.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand how Reid had stood by that man, touted his innocence, even when she\u2019d begged him to drop the case. Was he really willing to defend anyone if the paycheck was right? She glanced over at him again, having trouble reconciling the guy in the courtroom back then with the man who\u2019d come to the women\u2019s center to do pro bono work. Maybe the experience with Hank had changed him.</p><p>Regardless, she thanked God that he and his aunt had botched the case and lost. She\u2019d never be able to sleep at night if she knew her mother\u2019s murderer was still roaming the streets.</p><p>She shook the memory from her mind and stared down at the folder again. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the crime photos, but the temptation to find out why Reid was carrying the file around</p><p>was too compelling to resist. After a few centering breaths, she lifted the edge of the file and opened it.</p> <p>As she feared, a picture sat on top of the pile of papers, but it wasn\u2019t the crime scene, wasn\u2019t even the killer. Instead, her little sister\u2019s senior yearbook photo stared back at her. Brynn frowned and lifted the black-and-white photocopy, flipping it over to read the writing on the back. Reid\u2019s neat, block lettering filled the page in bulleted notes, but the first line glared like neon in Brynn\u2019s vision: KELSEY LEBRECK. VICTIM\u2019S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER. SCHEDULE INTERVIEW.</p><p>Her fingers gripped the page so hard, it crinkled the paper. She forced herself to read on. Copious notes about Kelsey\u2019s whereabouts in the days leading up to the murder. Her drug dealer contacts at the time and her relationship with Hank. Theories on who could\u2019ve committed the murder and what motive someone may have had. A note that Kelsey had found a list of her mother\u2019s clients that may help with the case. Then, the name J. Kennedy circled with the word killer and a question mark behind it. Finally, at the bottom of the page, the date of his notes.</p><p>Last Sunday.</p><p>Rage ripped through Brynn as she shoved the page aside and looked at the next one. Title: Hank Caldwell Appeal.</p><p>That son of a bitch.</p><p>Reid was working on a way to get that bastard out of prison and hadn\u2019t told her? And he was planning to get Kelsey to help him?</p> <p>Jesus. She put her head in her hands as another disturbing realization hit her. That\u2019s why Reid was here. Not because he\u2019d wanted to help her. He needed to know where her sister was for his case.</p><p>She rose to her feet, almost toppling the dining room chair in the process, and stalked across the room to her bags. Goddamn him for lying to her and making her believe he really cared. Self-serving motherfucker. She slipped on a pair of sandals, barely resisting the urge to ram one right up his conniving ass. But that would wake him up, and she planned to be as far away from possible from him when he woke up.</p><p>The sheets rustled behind her and she froze, holding her breath. When no other sound came, she turned her head and saw that he had shifted his face toward her, but hadn\u2019t awakened. His breath had become shallower, however. She frowned.</p><p>With renewed urgency, she zipped up her suitcase and dug through her purse to find her watch. When she slid the silver Timex over her arm, she cringed. The leather from the night before had abraded her wrist, leaving a ring of sensitive pink skin. She dropped the watch back into her bag, then paused, an idea tiptoeing into her brain. Hmm.</p><p>Quickly, she moved past Reid and returned to the bedroom. She hadn\u2019t had time to explore more than the closet the night before, but she knew the place had to be well stocked. When she opened the armoire that faced the bed, her lips pressed into a determined line. She grabbed what she needed and hurried back to the main room.</p><p>Reid had remained in a stomach down, spread-eagle position. Perfect. With the stealth of a thief, she quietly locked a set of fur-lined cuffs on each of Reid\u2019s wrists, then fastened the matching cuff of each pair to the frame of the bed. She placed the keys that would release them on the kitchen counter, far out of his reach. Then, unable to resist the vindictive impulses running through her and encouraged by the return of his sleep-heavy breathing, she hooked her fingers into the waistband of his boxer shorts and gently slid them off and tossed them across the room. That would assure he\u2019d try to get out on his own before calling for help.</p><p>She glared down at his sleeping form, knowing she should just walk out now, get as much of a head start as possible. But the urge to confront him burned bright within her. He\u2019d tricked her into trusting him, loving him\u2014again. God, how could she have been so freaking stupid? Before she could think better of it, she gave the bed frame a sharp kick, jolting the mattress and Reid. \u201cWake up, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s body jumped in response and the muscles in his back flexed as he automatically tried to turn over, but the metal cuffs clinked against the frame. He jerked his hands back, fighting against the restraints. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p> <p>Brynn stepped around the side of the sofa bed until she was in his range of vision and tossed the Caldwell file onto the bed next to him. Papers slid out of it and scattered along the sheets. \u201cSo is every word that comes out of your mouth a lie or do you just save that for me so you can enjoy fucking me over again and again?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in her direction, his eyes widening when he saw the documents in front of him. \u201cBrynn, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice deadly calm. \u201cDon\u2019t even try. I don\u2019t need to hear more piles of bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, I know, I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t tell you. You wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Wouldn\u2019t have helped you use my sister to free a goddamned murderer?\u201d Her voice was rising, but she couldn\u2019t stop it. She wanted to scream at him, to pummel him for the betrayal, to make him hurt as much as she was right now. \u201cHe killed my mother, Reid. Left her to die alone. What part of that don\u2019t you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank\u2019s not a murderer,\u201d he said, his own voice almost meeting her volume. \u201cI know you want to believe he is. Want to know that the killer is locked up tight and that everyone is safe. But they\u2019ve got the wrong guy. All the new evidence points to someone else. And if I don\u2019t get this conviction overturned, no one is ever going to look for the real murderer. He could be out there hurting other people as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d She wanted to put her hands over her ears so she could block out the image he was painting. None of that could be true. Hank was the one. Had to be. He was the only one who had motive and access. The thought that someone else had done it and was still walking around free... No. No. No. She couldn\u2019t go there. This was simply more of Reid\u2019s bullshit. \u201cYou just can\u2019t let it go because you lost the case. You want him to be innocent, so it must be true. Because God knows the almighty Reid couldn\u2019t be wrong about anything. Couldn\u2019t actually lose a case.\u201d</p><p>His face flooded red. \u201cGoddamn it, this isn\u2019t about my fucking ego!\u201d The restraints scraped against the metal frame as he attempted\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to get out of his prone position. \u201cNow come on and uncuff me. We need to talk about this rationally.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m all out of rational for tonight. Enjoy your evening.\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel and headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBrynn, wait! You can\u2019t leave me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>To hell with it all. She\u2019d find her sister on her own tonight. She didn\u2019t need Reid or anyone else for that matter. She\u2019d taken care of things on her own her whole life, why stop now. She glanced back at Reid, who was pulling at his cuffs again. The room\u2019s phone was within reaching distance if he worked for it, but it would take a while. Perversely, she hoped he had to call someone to find him in this position. She\u2019d love to see how Mr. Big Bad Dominant liked that.</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she turned and walked out of the cabin.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Brynn stepped onto the porch and slammed the door behind her, ignoring Reid\u2019s last plea. Her hand was shaking when she released the knob. Dammit. She needed to get ahold of herself. She sucked in a deep breath, trying to quell the angry tremors coursing through her. Focus on why you\u2019re here.</p><p>She closed her eyes and repeated the mantra in her head until her heartbeat slowed to a semi-normal pace. She didn\u2019t have time to worry about Reid or her broken heart right now. She\u2019d deal with both of them another day. Tonight was about finding Kelsey.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders with renewed resolve and stared out into the night. The air had turned a bit cooler and fog hung low over the dark grounds, giving everything an ethereal feel. If she had been there for different reasons, it would have been the perfect evening to hang out in the rocking chair and sip wine while listening to the sounds of the night come to life. But a normal evening never seemed to be in the cards for her anymore.</p><p>With a sigh, she crossed the wooden slats of the porch and headed down the steps onto the slate path. She looked toward the main complex they had come from the night before. All the windows in the house were lit up and paper lamps lined the winding paths that snaked out from the back of the building. The house was modern rustic\u2014an enormous home constructed with dark logs and Texas stone. Anyone driving by would assume it was the vineyard tycoon\u2019s mansion. Nothing about it even hinted at its real purpose.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself and started down the path in the opposite direction, knowing the other private cabins lay closer to the vineyards. The area got darker the farther away she ventured from the main house. Laughter and music floated on the air from somewhere in the distance, but no one seemed to be in her immediate area. Maybe this hadn\u2019t been such a great spot to watch for her sister.</p><p>She reached the end of the path and the short wooden railing that marked the beginning of the rolling expanse of grapevines. With a sigh, she climbed onto it to sit on the top rung. At least Reid wouldn\u2019t look for her here if he managed to escape.</p><p>Cabins dotted the land around her, but only two had lights on. The other guests must\u2019ve already headed toward dinner and the party, ready for a fun night. Fun\u2014what everyone else was here for.</p><p>She rested her heels on the middle rung of the fence, set her elbows on her thighs, and put her face in her hands, feeling drained and more alone than she had in as long as she could remember. How had everything gone so off course?</p><p>Her mom. Her sister. Reid. Her own life.</p><p>Was the universe bound and determined to take everyone from her? Each time she thought she had something to hold on to, it seemed to slip through her fingers like mist.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given over to self-pity in years, had sworn to herself that no matter what, she would create a safe and happy life for herself, her sister\u2014help other women do the same. But as she sat on the fence inhaling deep gulps of the earthy air and feeling the darkness of the night closing around her, fat tears tracked down her cheeks.</p><p>God, she was losing it.</p><p>The breeze shifted and the steady thudding of footsteps joined in with the rustling of the grape leaves. Her heart stuttered\u2014he couldn\u2019t have escaped that quickly, right? She lifted her head to find an imposing figure heading her way. She could tell from the sauntering gait that it wasn\u2019t Reid, but other than that, she couldn\u2019t make out much else. Great, just what she needed, uninvited company. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she called, hurriedly cleaning the moisture from her face.</p><p>The man closed the distance between them in a few long strides. \u201cWell, hi there, darlin\u2019. What are you doing out here all by yourself?\u201d</p> <p>Brynn gave Grant a once-over. Plaid shirt rolled up his muscular forearms, well-worn jeans and boots, stubble that was a few hours past a five-o\u2019clock shadow\u2014all matching up perfectly with that lazy drawl of his. If she hadn\u2019t learned last night that he owned the place, she would\u2019ve taken him for a cowboy who had wandered off a nearby pasture.</p><p>She cleared her throat, which had clogged with her tears. \u201cUm, I just needed to get away for a minute.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and into a patch of moonlight. His dark eyebrows dipped low as he took in her appearance. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and shook her head. \u201cUm, I\u2019m fine. Just needed a break. I don\u2019t think the whole submissive thing is going to work for me after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, I had the pleasure of watching you with your master and Jace last night. Had you not told me about the fear you\u2019re dealing with, I would\u2019ve never guessed. You take to the role like it\u2019s second nature.\u201d The side of his mouth lifted a tick. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s the sub part of the equation you\u2019re struggling with?\u201d</p> <p>She shifted uncomfortably, his penetrating stare scattering her nerves. No question which side of the power exchange fence he played on. \u201cThings didn\u2019t go well with Reid.\u201d</p><p>His tone turned deadly calm. \u201cDid he break a rule with you? Push you too far? If he did, it\u2019s important for you to tell me. I have no tolerance for that kind of thing here.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cNo, nothing like that. He knows what I\u2019ve been through and would never physically hurt me. We just... clash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, some of the tension in his stance easing. \u201cHe must be quite a master if he\u2019s gotten under your skin this quick. Most doms don\u2019t even crack the surface of a sub\u2019s defenses until well into a relationship.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth at his knowing nod. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to his cabin.\u201d</p><p>His eyes crinkled around the corners. \u201cFair enough. We can always get you another room. But I hope you aren\u2019t going to skip the Bacchanal tonight. We only do it once a year\u2014it\u2019d be a shame for you to miss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still plan on checking it out. Aren\u2019t you going?\u201d She glanced down at his outfit.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have to monitor the party to make sure everything goes all right. If I participate, it usually isn\u2019t until late into the night, and by then, costumes aren\u2019t exactly needed.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated. \u201cI imagine not.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. \u201cCome on. You\u2019ll walk over to the party site with me. They already have the food laid out. Your master\u2019s loss is my gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge me, Brynn. My mama taught me to make sure guests are satisfied. The club has clearly failed in meeting the expectations you had for your stay here, so at least give me the pleasure of putting a good meal in your belly. Our chef Collette makes food so good, I\u2019ve seen even the scariest doms get on their knees to beg her for seconds.\u201d</p><p>She knew he\u2019d just given her a command, not a request, but suddenly she didn\u2019t want to be alone in the dark anymore. Wallowing would solve nothing. Plus, his easy charm made him hard to resist. He was like one of those drinks with the umbrellas\u2014all that sugar disguising the true power swirling in the depths. Not until halfway through the beverage would you realize it was too late, that you\u2019d already been knocked off balance.</p><p>She smirked as he led her back up the path. \u201cI figured the owner of this kind of place would have a harem of beautiful slaves to hand-feed him dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly on Sundays. Can\u2019t let myself get too spoiled, ya know?\u201d</p><p>A snort escaped. \u201cRight. Wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>They took a turn off the main walkway toward the east side of the property, the full moon lighting their surroundings with a silvery glow. Beyond the cabins and expansive vineyards, there was nothing but open land and the low swell of hills along the horizon. Breathtaking and so different from the flat Dallas landscape.</p><p>\u201cHow far from the city are we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour west of Fort Worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Didn\u2019t feel like that long on the way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause Robbie drives a limo like Satan\u2019s on his tail,\u201d he said, gently taking her elbow and guiding her to another turn.</p><p>The music that\u2019d been drifting on the breeze grew louder and a few hundred yards in front of them the sky filled with an orange glow. \u201cLooks like the party started without us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. The night is young.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat increased tempo every step they got closer to the revelry\u2014both in anticipation of seeing her sister and in nervousness about her hair-trigger panic attacks. And God help her when Reid got free and made it down here. She was going to have a seriously irate lawyer on her hands. Hopefully, she could talk to Kels before she had to deal with that.</p><p>The Bacchanal was set up in a large corner of an open pasture. The few trees that dotted the area had been strung with white twinkle lights, and large tiki torches had been placed strategically around the perimeter of the party to provide additional illumination. Some people were already dancing to the rhythmic beat of the music and some were sitting at the small tables that had been placed at the far end of the space, but most were around the long buffet tables that ran along the fence flanking the right side of the field.</p><p>A girl with fiery red hair long enough to cover her bared breasts greeted them with a smile. \u201cWelcome, Master and Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Holly,\u201d Grant said, giving the woman a soft, but chaste kiss on the mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you look tempting, tonight.\u201d</p><p>Holly dipped her head in thanks, then turned to Brynn to place a head wreath made of grapevines on her head. \u201cEnjoy your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Grant said, putting his palm against the small of her back and leading her to the food area. \u201cIf you plan to enjoy the festivities, you need to make sure you\u2019re properly fueled and hydrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a sporting event.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her, his eyes glinting. \u201cOh, darling, this is way more vigorous than any sport.\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile, but her heart had taken up residence in her throat.</p><p>When they reached the food line, Grant handed her a plate and let her go in front of him. Lavish displays of fruit, cheese, and roasted meats filled the tables along with bowls of a creamy orange punch and huge decanters of some aubergine-colored liquid. Half-dressed male and female attendants stood on the other side of the table filling glasses for guests. She pointed at the drinks and looked back at Grant. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbrosia and fresh grape juice.\u201d</p><p>An Adonis-like man clad in only a swath of material low-slung around his hips ladled some of the ambrosia into a cup for her. She thanked him, then smiled at Grant. \u201cBacchus may strike y\u2019all down for having his festival with no wine.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cRules are rules, but we are honoring the harvest. I even have vats of grapes wheeled out later so people can experience crushing them. Wine will be made on these grounds\u2014we just won\u2019t be the ones drinking it.\u201d</p><p>As attendants randomly piled food on her plate, she kept her eyes on everyone around her, scanning faces like she was looking through a line-up book at a police station. Every young blond woman caught her attention. She was seeing Kelsey everywhere and nowhere.</p><p>When they reached the end of the buffet, Grant guided her to one of the tables at the edge of the party and excused himself to go make his rounds. She was relieved to be rid of him and put all her focus on watching every partygoer who arrived. She saw a few familiar faces\u2014two politicians, one of the more popular Dallas Cowboy football players, the weather girl from one of the local TV networks. But no Kelsey. And thankfully, no Reid or Jace.</p><p>As the minutes passed, the number of attendees grew incrementally and soon workers were folding up the tables to make space for all the dancing. She gave up her perch and was quickly sucked into the crowd. Bodies pressed around her and the air grew thicker\u2014the shift in mood palpable. Fun-loving to down and dirty before she had the chance to catch her breath.</p><p>The music increased in volume, and the beat slowed to a more sensual rhythm\u2014one that required writhing instead of bouncing. Men and women brushed along all sides of her body, the crowd dancing as one. She squared her shoulders, determined to keep at the edges of the group so she had an escape route, but the effort was useless. Like a buoy in a churning ocean, her position was controlled by the tide around her instead of her own volition. Soon, she was so deep in the swarm that she\u2019d lost a sense of where she was in the field.</p><p>Then, clothes began to come off.</p><p>All around her, people were shedding their colored togas and moving from dancing to kissing, touching. The man in front of her poured a cup of the dark grape juice over his lover\u2019s breasts and lapped it up as it dripped down her nude body. Brynn\u2019s blood began to rush in her ears\u2014the collective body heat and the press of the crowd testing her hold on her panic switch.</p><p>She moved through the crowd, desperate to find the edge of the mass again, needing air. A sea of faces and voices swirled around her, disorienting her as to which direction was the quickest way out. Her breath started coming in short gasps. Shit. Not now. Please.</p><p>\u201cOoh, look, we have a shy one,\u201d a man said next to her. \u201cHave you lost your master, pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>She whipped her head around to meet his amused brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be bashful, sweetie,\u201d the woman with him offered. She slid her fingers along Brynn\u2019s arm and teasingly tugged the one strap holding her toga up. \u201cJoin the fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Brynn said, batting her hand away.</p><p>Before she realized what was happening, the man hooked a finger in the loop on Brynn\u2019s collar and brought his mouth down on hers in an ambrosia-laced kiss. She fought to pull away but her strength was no match for his. Smooth hands glided over the thin material covering her breasts and she realized the woman had joined in.</p><p>Fear ripped through her, and her knee jerked upward, landing squarely in the man\u2019s crotch. He doubled over, wincing and cursing. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas!\u201d Brynn stepped back but only ran into more people, more exploring hands. Flashes of her rapist\u2019s hands on her pressed against her mind, threatening to unhinge her. She turned frantically in the other direction and shoved her way through the horde using her safe word like a machete in the jungle. \u201cMove! Please. Texas, Texas, Texas!\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the crowd begin to ease back to let her through. She just needed air. Space. By the time she reached a break in the mass of people, her mind was buzzing with terror. Trying not to draw attention to herself, she forced herself to walk at a calm pace until she was outside the ring of firelight. Then, when cloaked in darkness again, she bolted toward a nearby tree and collapsed onto the bench beneath it.</p><p>She leaned forward, her eyes squeezed shut, and tried to breathe past the invisible band that seemed to be tightening around her chest. God, when will this go away? Not everyone is out to hurt you. You\u2019re acting like a fucking lunatic. Stop!</p><p>\u201cNot your kind of a party, huh?\u201d</p><p>She jolted upright, and a hand clamped over her mouth from behind.</p><p>\u201cShh. Don\u2019t want to disturb anyone\u2019s good time.\u201d</p><p>She screamed beneath the grip and attempted to jerk out of his grasp, but the muffled struggle was just a whisper compared to the thumping music coming from the party.</p><p>\u201cBetter calm down and listen. I have what you want. And she\u2019s safe, for now. But if you don\u2019t cooperate, I guarantee she won\u2019t stay that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She stilled, her blood running cold.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Good girl.\u201d He ran his other hand over her bared shoulder, the scar. \u201cSo, have you missed me?\u201d</p> <p>TWENTY</p><p>Jace bent at the waist, hands on knees, and wheezed with yet another fit of laughter.</p><p>Reid gritted his teeth. \u201cAre you done yet, asshole? Because I could use a little help here.\u201d</p><p>Reid had tried unsuccessfully to free himself from the cuffs Brynn had secured him with. But all he had to show for it was a whole lot of sweat and a bent sofa bed frame. Jace had been his last resort before calling staff. Now, he wondered if staff may have been a better option.</p><p>Jace coughed, trying to get a hold on his laughter. \u201cDude, I\u2019m sorry. But this is funny as shit. At least she only cuffed you and didn\u2019t stick a plug in your ass or something. What the hell did you do to inspire this?\u201d</p> <p>Reid laid his head on the pillow and stared at the scattered papers in front of him. \u201cShe went through my bag. Saw that I\u2019m working on an appeal for the guy who\u2019s in jail for her mother\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s tone turned serious. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d</p><p>Reid craned his neck and shot him a lethal glare.</p><p>Jace raised his palms. \u201cOkay, okay. Not my business. Let me look for the keys.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes of searching, Jace found what he was looking for and released Reid from the bed. Reid wrapped the sheet around his waist and rubbed his reddened wrists. \u201cI seriously fucked up this time, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s obvious.\u201d Jace straddled one of the dining room chairs and frowned. \u201cWhat haven\u2019t you told me?\u201d</p> <p>Reid sighed, then spilled the whole story. He hadn\u2019t told Jace from the start about the appeal because he knew his friend would\u2019ve never agreed to get him into the club under those pretenses, but he needed to come clean now.</p><p>Jace stayed silent a full minute after Reid stopped speaking, his expression neutral as he processed the information. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t come here to help Brynn and win her back like you told me? You came because you needed to know where your star witness was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d Reid scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know anymore. Most of it was because I needed to know where Kelsey was and, I won\u2019t lie, part of me wanted revenge on Brynn for hurting me all those years ago\u2014I couldn\u2019t wait to remind her what she\u2019d walked away from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>Reid sighed. \u201cBut the other part of me couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her submitting to someone else. Couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to touch her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re so gone on her, you can\u2019t even see straight.\u201d</p><p>Reid recoiled. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Jace smirked, the simple gesture cutting through all the bullshit Reid had been telling himself.</p> <p>Reid closed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>His friend\u2019s smile turned sympathetic. \u201cCome on, get dressed and we\u2019ll go find your girl.\u201d</p><p>Reid had never seen so many naked bodies in one place. The Bacchanal had only started an hour ago, but the guests hadn\u2019t wasted any time getting down to business. Some were dancing, others were sloshing around naked in a large vat, crushing grapes, and the rest were in the grass, fucking in full view. The scent of earth and sex permeated the air, mixing with the sounds of carnal indulgence.</p><p>The decadent scene was the stuff of fantasies, but for Reid it was more nightmare than dream at the moment. Finding Brynn in the mass of people was going to be a challenge\u2014especially when she didn\u2019t want to be found.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re missing quite the party,\u201d Jace said as Reid scanned the crowd for Brynn.</p><p>\u201cDo you see her anywhere?\u201d</p><p>His friend frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to be able to pick her out with all this going on. But Grant\u2019s over there by the food. I\u2019ll go ask him if he\u2019s seen her. That guy doesn\u2019t miss much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I\u2019m not going to get anywhere with this method.\u201d</p><p>Grant smiled at the two of them as they walked up. Unlike everyone else, he was clothed in his usual jeans and plaid shirt. Reid didn\u2019t know him very well, but based on his interaction so far, he sensed the man didn\u2019t let his guard down very much even at his own resort.</p><p>\u201cEvening, fellas. Decided to join the fun?\u201d he asked, sipping on some orange-colored drink.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m looking for Brynn,\u201d Reid said, keeping his eyes on the crowd. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured she\u2019d be back with you by now,\u201d Grant said, drawing Reid\u2019s attention back to the man in front of him. \u201cI found her sitting by herself on the far side of the property earlier\u2014pretty pissed at you I might add. I got her to walk over here with me, but then she left not long after. I thought she was on her way to find you to work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d Reid blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did she leave?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cWas she by herself?\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201c\u2019Bout half an hour or so, I\u2019d guess. And yeah, she was alone.\u201d He looked back and forth between the two of them, his brow furrowing. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Jace clapped a hand on Reid\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine. Reid\u2019s just gone and ticked off his woman. Nothing new. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make her way back to the cabin at some point. Let us know if you run across her before we do, though, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d</p><p>Reid was ready to head out on his search again, but the way Grant was looking at him gave him pause. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He sipped his drink and frowned. \u201cI know it\u2019s none of my business, but you need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou push a girl like Brynn too hard and she\u2019ll run like a frightened rabbit. She needs a dom who can draw out her submission without crushing whatever\u2019s so fragile inside her.\u201d</p><p>Reid bristled\u2014who the hell did this guy think he was? The Dr. Phil of BDSM? \u201cLook, I appreciate your concern, but you don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Grant\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cYou run a place like this long enough, and you learn how to read people. I\u2019m only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Reid nodded, his throat tightening, and turned on his heel to head away from the party. He didn\u2019t have time to be psychoanalyzed.</p><p>Jace followed behind. \u201cAny thoughts on where she might\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fucking clue. I guess we can check each of our cabins first. She doesn\u2019t have a car, so she couldn\u2019t have gone too far.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Reid\u2019s cabin came into view, his phone vibrated against his leg. He halted his step and yanked the cell from his pocket. Unknown number.</p><p>\u201cHold up, Jace.\u201d Reid put the phone to his ear. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Silence for a few seconds then: \u201cReid?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders sank with relief. \u201cBrynn, look, we need to talk. I\u2019m sorry about everything. I know I should\u2019ve told you. I was wrong. Just please, give me a chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid, stop,\u201d she said, her voice shaking a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Was that... road noise in the background? \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home. I\u2014I, uh, called a cab. I couldn\u2019t find Kelsey. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s at the resort after all, so I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called a cab?\u201d He started pacing, and Jace stepped out of his path. \u201cWhat the hell, Brynn? You know I would\u2019ve driven you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? I don\u2019t want to be around you right now. And I don\u2019t exactly have ruby slippers to click my way home. So yeah, a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Reid.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he yelled to no one in general.</p><p>Jace winced. \u201cShe bailed?\u201d</p><p>Reid kicked a nearby shrub, sending leaves flying. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way home. Called a goddamned cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. That sucks,\u201d Jace said, wisely keeping his distance. \u201cMaybe she just needs a little space to cool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew space. The minute Brynn gets back into her little world, she\u2019s going to talk herself out of everything that happened this weekend. She\u2019ll put me back in that little I-hate-you box she keeps me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never catch up with her.\u201d</p><p>Reid cocked an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, why are you giving me that look?\u201d</p><p>Reid flashed his teeth. \u201cNo, not in my car.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cNo way, you\u2019re out of your fucking mind. Only my hands touch the steering wheel of my baby. I\u2019ve seen the dings on your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou either give me the keys or come with me,\u201d Reid said, staring his friend down.</p><p>Jace sighed and pulled his keys out of his pocket. \u201cCome on, but I\u2019m driving and if my car ends up with so much as a scratch, I\u2019m posting the cell phone pictures I took of you tonight on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take pictures.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled. \u201cNever underestimate my penchant for blackmail.\u201d</p><p>The purr of the engine filled the car as Jace\u2019s Dodge Viper devoured the open highway in front of them. Reid punched Brynn\u2019s number into his phone again, hoping his persistence or at least her annoyance would make her pick up the phone. But all he got was the same voice mail greeting he\u2019d heard the last three times. He hung up without leaving a message and barely resisted the urge to bang the phone into pieces against the dashboard. \u201cWe should\u2019ve caught up to her by now.\u201d</p><p>Jace had been driving like a Nascar champion since they\u2019d left The Ranch, but so far, they\u2019d only passed a handful of cars on the pitch-black road\u2014and no cab. His friend frowned, but didn\u2019t take his eyes off the highway. \u201cMaybe they stopped at a gas station or something and we passed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two stations we\u2019ve passed so far looked empty. Maybe you just need to go faster.\u201d</p><p>Jace shot him a you-gotta-be-fucking-kidding-me look. \u201cAny faster and we\u2019re going to break the sound barrier. I\u2019m trying to get you to Brynn with all our limbs still intact.\u201d</p><p>Reid gave a derisive snort and stared at the taillights of the black SUV they were gaining on. Jace cut into the left lane and glanced over as they passed the vehicle. \u201cHuh. Looks like we aren\u2019t the only ones skipping the Bacchanal tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Reid turned to look over his shoulder, but the Escalade was quickly becoming a black dot in the distance, the large vehicle no match for the high-powered sports car.</p><p>Jace shrugged. \u201cThat was Davis Ackerman. He\u2019s a member at the club.\u201d</p><p>Reid grimaced. \u201cSeriously? Women actually sleep with that dirtbag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Jace said, his tone wary. \u201cBut Grant has had to work hard to find him matches. Davis\u2019s proclivities are pretty fucked up from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Reid smirked. \u201cLet me guess, he\u2019s into extreme humiliation? He always excelled at doing that at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than that,\u201d Jace said as he passed another vehicle. \u201cHe wants the pain sluts\u2014girls who claim they don\u2019t have limits. A few weeks ago, Grant had to call in a medic because Davis had bitten a girl\u2019s neck so hard, it had gushed blood. He\u2019s been warned twice about biting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>\u201cYeah, the guy\u2019s in his own zip code. I figure it\u2019s only a matter of time before he gets kicked out. He ordered a whole shitload of stuff from me a few weeks ago under a fake name, so I assume he\u2019s setting up his own private playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Glad to know he\u2019s running part of our city government.\u201d</p><p>Jace became quiet again, apparently lost in his own thoughts, and Reid tapped his fingers on the armrest as he stared out the window into the night. Jace would slow when they passed gas stations and rest stops, but after another thirty minutes, they still hadn\u2019t spotted a cab.</p> <p>Reid shifted restlessly in his seat, something tugging at his brain. He\u2019d gotten a weird vibe on the phone with Brynn. More than just her anger, something else. But he hadn\u2019t been able to pinpoint what had bothered him. He played the conversation over again in his head. What had she said? I don\u2019t have ruby slippers. Strange statement.</p><p>He closed his eyes and leaned his head against the headrest, going over the words again and again, turning and rearranging them. Then, like numbers in a combination lock, they finally clicked into place\u2014one word standing out among the others. All the breath left his lungs. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Jace shot him a wary look. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He pressed the heels of his hands to his brows, his head instantly starting to pound. \u201cShe used her old safe word and I didn\u2019t catch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the phone. She used the word, trying to tell me something.\u201d His frustration over not being able to find her now turned to cold fear. He looked at Jace. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s in trouble?\u201d</p><p>He gave Reid a sidelong glance. \u201cI think you\u2019re getting paranoid and reading too much into things. She\u2019s just pissed at you, man.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. She used the word specifically. She emphasized it. I was just too shocked over her leaving to catch it. And why would she leave so suddenly\u2014give up on finding her sister so easily?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s face reflected Reid\u2019s worry. \u201cBut she was at The Ranch\u2014it\u2019s not like the dude who\u2019s after her sister could just pop in. How could she get into any trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I don\u2019t know. Maybe someone called her, lured her out. Maybe this drug dealer guy has some contact inside The Ranch.\u201d He blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cShe could be fucking anywhere. All I know is that she was in a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Turn around or keep going?\u201d</p> <p>Reid stared straight ahead, wracking his brain. Had she said anything else in the phone call that contained a clue? Had anyone at The Ranch seemed like they were paying particular attention to Brynn? A whisper of something danced at the edge of his awareness.</p><p>He thought back over the previous night, about each moment he\u2019d spent with Brynn\u2014making love to her, touching her, kissing every inch of bare skin. The conversation they\u2019d had in the tub. Thought about how he\u2019d bathed her, soaped her back, ran his fingers along her spine and over the faint circular birthmark that graced the line of her shoulder blade.</p><p>An icy stillness moved over him as he pictured that last moment, the mark on her skin. It hadn\u2019t quite been a circle, more like two crescents not fully joined together. And had that been there when they\u2019d dated before? No, not that he remembered.</p><p>When he\u2019d touched it during the bath, Brynn had tensed ever so slightly\u2014like she\u2019d momentarily held her breath. He\u2019d thought maybe she was reacting because she was self-conscious about the birthmark, but...</p><p>A nauseating realization gripped his gut.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not a birthmark.</p><p>A bite mark.</p> <p>Reid gripped the door handle as murderous rage ripped through him, his whole body shaking with the need to maim and dismember. \u201cTurn the car around.\u201d</p><p>Jace gave him a quick glance. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn the goddamned car around, Jace,\u201d Reid said through clenched teeth. \u201cI know who has her. Jesus Christ. That sick fuck is the one who raped her.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed a bit as Jace turned to him with knitted brows. \u201cWhat? Who? The drug dealer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ackerman. Brynn has a bite scar on her back. She was working for him when she was attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d Jace\u2019s expression hardened, and he eased off the gas pedal so that their U-turn didn\u2019t send the vehicle into a roll.</p><p>Anger flared up so fierce inside him, Reid was sure he\u2019d breathe fire if given the chance. That monster had his girl. She was alone in her worst nightmare. God, please let me get to her in time. And Davis had better start praying, \u2019cause Reid was ready to send him straight to his fucking maker once he got Brynn away from him.</p><p>That psychopath had traumatized and ripped Brynn apart. Had destroyed the relationship he and Brynn had been building. How different would both of their lives be if Reid had gotten the chance to give her the ring that day? That fucker had stolen everything. Reid cracked his knuckles. \u201cIf he hurt a hair on her head...\u201d</p><p>Jace shot him a look of warning. \u201cTake a breath. You can\u2019t kill him, dude. You don\u2019t even know if it was him for sure or if he even has Brynn right now. You of all people should know circumstantial evidence can be dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>Reid knew that, but something deep in his bones told him he was on the mark with this one. \u201cI won\u2019t kill him. But if he is the one who has Brynn, I\u2019m going to see if the asshole likes receiving pain as much as he likes dishing it out.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Sweat soaked through Brynn\u2019s toga as Davis Ackerman continued down whatever road they were on. He\u2019d wrapped bungee cords beneath her breasts and around her legs, securing her to the seat, then had cuffed her wrists and blindfolded her.</p><p>Brynn breathed through the panic. She was with her rapist. She\u2019d known the minute he\u2019d whispered to her in the voice from her nightmares. But why did he have her sister? Was he associated with the drug dealer who wanted Kelsey? It didn\u2019t make sense. Davis was a respected councilman for God\u2019s sake. She cleared her throat and tried to force calm into her voice. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOh, so now you\u2019re going to make conversation? Last night you didn\u2019t even bother to say hi.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to speak. I was with a dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw your little performance with your two old friends last night,\u201d he said, disgust dripping from his tone. \u201cI guess some things never change. You\u2019re still going after the smarmy pretty boys and still willing to spread your legs at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled as if she\u2019d been slapped, and her response tumbled out before she could stop herself. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound chilling her blood. \u201cI know how easy it was to tie you up and fuck you before you even realized I wasn\u2019t one of your lovers. Maybe I\u2019ll make you say my name this time so you don\u2019t forget who\u2019s inside you.\u201d</p><p>The world tilted beneath her feet. Nausea shuddered through her and fingers of panic squeezed around her windpipe as she sucked in sharp, quick breaths. She wouldn\u2019t survive his touch again.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMaybe we can do a three-way. I\u2019ve always fantasized about sisters.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey. Her sister\u2019s name broke through the haze of spiraling fear in her brain. Kels needed her. Brynn couldn\u2019t let herself slip into the anxiety attack or pass out from hyperventilation. Her sister would be left alone with the monster in the front seat.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath through her nose and held it for a moment before breathing out through her mouth. In... one, two, three... Out... one, two, three. She focused on centering herself, clearing her head. The only chance she had of protecting her sister and herself was if she could wrangle in her emotions.</p><p>The SUV made a hard left turn, throwing her weight to the right, and then the sound of crunching gravel filled her ears. She\u2019d lost track of how long they\u2019d been riding, but she knew it hadn\u2019t been long enough to reach the city yet. Shit. Where the hell was he taking her?</p><p>A few bumpy minutes later, the vehicle pulled to a halt, and Davis shut off the engine. \u201cThings will go much easier for you if you cooperate, so I don\u2019t suggest you try anything heroic. And don\u2019t bother screaming when we get out. There\u2019s no one around to hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from us?\u201d Brynn bit out.</p><p>\u201cFrom Kelsey? A little information. From you?\u201d He paused and she could almost hear the smile in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what mood strikes me.\u201d</p><p>Doors opened and the car dipped twice. Then, the air shifted. Hot breath hit her cheek. \u201cMmm, you still smell the same. Like fear. You know all that adrenaline rushing through you right now can actually enhance a sexual experience. Add in a little pain and it will send you right over the edge.\u201d</p><p>She reeled backward in her seat, bile rising to the back of her throat. \u201cGet away from me, you fucking psycho.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNow, no need to be crude. Although, I expect no less from you. I know from experience you\u2019re no lady.\u201d</p><p>His steel grip wrapped around her upper arm, and he jerked her to her feet. \u201cAnd I expect from this point on, you call me master.\u201d</p><p>Over my dead body. But she swallowed back the words before they slipped out. At this rate, that might be exactly what he had in mind.</p><p>He hauled her out of the car, and she fell forward, her knees and elbows landing hard on the pebbles. She clenched her teeth through the sting, refusing to give him the satisfaction of hearing her cry out in pain.</p><p>He grabbed the chain between her cuffs and yanked. \u201cGet up and walk.\u201d</p><p>He led her from the humid night air into an air-conditioned space. Thick carpet silenced their footfalls as he shut a door behind him.</p><p>He guided her another few steps, then untied her blindfold. Brynn blinked as her eyes adjusted and was surprised to find herself in a brightly lit kitchen. A darkened flight of stairs stretched down through a door in front of her. Davis grasped the back of her neck. \u201cDown the steps. Try to stay on your feet this time.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a hateful glare and moved forward when he nudged her. Slowly, she descended the stairs, her heart sinking as the fluorescent light disappeared behind her and the contents of the basement came into view. No workout room or rec area for Davis Ackerman. Nope. Instead, a full-scale BDSM playground\u2014his very own personal dungeon\u2014spread out before her. A St. Andrew\u2019s cross, benches, a wall full of hooks with various tools she couldn\u2019t identify.</p><p>But the shock of that paled in comparison to the surprise that greeted her as she hit the bottom step.</p><p>They weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Roslyn Jamison gave her a disdainful look as she casually held a gun at her side. \u201cOh, hurray, the gang\u2019s all here.\u201d</p><p>Brynn stared at her, trying to connect the dots between the man behind her and the woman in front of her. But none of it lined up. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t leave things alone, could you? I should\u2019ve known. You\u2019ve been a complication since the day you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She waved the gun dismissively.</p><p>But Brynn couldn\u2019t draw her eyes away from her\u2014her presence too unbelievable to process. The petite woman looked like she was dressed for a political convention instead of a kidnapping. A navy blue, perfectly tailored pantsuit with matching low heels. 1950s-style white gloves. Even a bun with nary a hair out of place. The contrast with the BDSM equipment in the background was almost laughable.</p><p>But Brynn\u2019s attention was diverted when a light sniffling sound came from her right. She whirled around to find Kelsey, tied to a chair, face swollen from crying and ball gag in her mouth. Brynn lurched in that direction. \u201cKels!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Davis grasped her arm. \u201cNot so fast, sweetheart. We need to take care of business before we get to have happy reunion time.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s gaze met hers, her terror palpable. Roslyn stalked over to the chair and unsnapped the gag, but when her sister tried to talk only wretched sobs escaped.</p> <p>\u201cKels, shh, I\u2019m here. It\u2019s going to be okay. We\u2019ll figure this out. Shh...\u201d Brynn knew the words were empty, but they tumbled out anyway.</p><p>Her sister shook her head frantically, her eyes wild. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay. She\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Brynn frowned. \u201cKels, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Roslyn\u2019s tone turned sharp. \u201cStop the blabbering.\u201d</p><p>Her sister inhaled a ragged breath and met Brynn\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe killed Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn\u2019s knees went weak beneath her, and Davis began a slow, measured clap.</p><p>\u201cYou know it only took her three days to figure out the connection. And who said strippers were dumb?\u201d He gave his winning, politician smile.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Davis.\u201d Roslyn tucked the gun in her waistband.</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Brynn asked, her thoughts whirling like her brain had been thrown into a blender. She shook her head vehemently, unable to believe what her sister had just said. \u201cNo, Hank killed Mom. All the evidence was there. The fingerprints, the stolen money.\u201d</p><p>Tears freely dripped from Kelsey\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo, B. I told you. He was messed up, but he wasn\u2019t a killer. All the evidence was circumstantial. You knew that.\u201d</p><p>Brynn squeezed her eyes shut, the news too shocking for her mind to assimilate.</p> <p>Reid had been right?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roslyn agreed, her tone smug. \u201cCircumstantial evidence the idiot prosecutor had no idea how to present. I never thought it would be so difficult to throw a case. But luckily Hank didn\u2019t have the best record. No jury has sympathy for a pathetic junkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brynn asked, the question sounding more like a plea. \u201cWhy would you kill her?\u201d</p><p>Roslyn pressed her lips together, impatience coloring her seemingly ageless features. \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t know when to quit. My husband paid her fairly for years to keep quiet about you, but when he threw his hat in the governor\u2019s race, she saw a bigger meal ticket. Patrick was going to give her whatever she wanted\u2014he\u2019s always been soft when it came to you and that bitch\u2014but I wasn\u2019t going to put up with her blackmail anymore. Getting knocked up by one of your customers doesn\u2019t mean you get a salary for life.\u201d</p><p>Brynn blinked, dumbfounded. She thought of the man who\u2019d given her a job out of the blue all those years ago\u2014when she\u2019d needed it most. The way he\u2019d always offered her overtime. \u201cPatrick\u2019s my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, how do you think you landed that receptionist job? His stupid decision to hire you almost sent Reid down the exact same path he had gone. Men are so weak.\u201d She shook her head, her tone full of disgust. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stand by and watch my sister\u2019s only son make the same mistakes. If I hadn\u2019t had Davis fix that situation, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have ruined Reid\u2019s future before it even got started.\u201d</p><p>Brynn swayed on her feet.</p><p>The rape had been planned?</p> <p>Holy God. She and her sister weren\u2019t getting out of here. These people had long fallen off the sanity train. She cut a look at Davis. \u201cWhy would you help her?\u201d</p><p>Davis shrugged as if the question were unimportant.</p><p>Roslyn smiled, the effect chilling. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the first of Davis\u2019s problematic dalliances. Let\u2019s just say if the world knew of all the girls he\u2019d unleashed his little weakness on, he would\u2019ve never made it to where he has. Lucky for him, I\u2019m good at keeping secrets if the favor is returned.\u201d</p><p>Brynn inhaled deep breaths through her nose, trying to fight off the urge to vomit on the shiny tiled floor.</p><p>Roslyn stalked around Kelsey\u2019s chair, then laid her hands on the back of it. \u201cNow, we were hoping not to involve you, but Kelsey here has been rather uncooperative. We know she has evidence incriminating a J. Kennedy as the murderer, and I can\u2019t have anyone figuring out that your mother used to call Davis and I John and Jackie when we met with her, now can I?\u201d</p><p>Her sister bit her lip. \u201cI told you where I put the evidence.\u201d</p><p>Roslyn grabbed a handful of Kelsey\u2019s hair and yanked backward. Kelsey\u2019s hands automatically flew up, but her bindings prevented her from being able to defend herself.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you that I went there and it\u2019s not where you said,\u201d Roslyn said, her voice smooth. \u201cWhich is why Davis brought Brynn over to inspire some honesty out of you.\u201d</p><p>The loud crack of a whip echoed through the basement as Davis brought it down on Brynn\u2019s back, the thin material of her toga doing little to soften the bite. She crumpled to the floor and groaned.</p><p>\u201cBrynn!\u201d her sister screamed and tried to launch forward, but Roslyn held fast to her hair.</p><p>Brynn clenched her jaw, trying to think through the haze of pain. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kels. I appreciate you trying to protect me all this time, but we just need to tell them. The evidence is at my house. She sent it to me to keep safe.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s lips parted, but Brynn sent her a warning glare.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Roslyn asked, twisting Kelsey\u2019s locks around her fist.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Kelsey said, frantically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what the names in the logbook meant, and I thought Brynn might be able to help. But I didn\u2019t tell you \u2019cause I didn\u2019t want you to hurt her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you take us there, I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d Brynn said, hoping she sounded convincing. She knew that Davis and Roslyn had no intention of letting them go, since they\u2019d already revealed too much. But maybe if she could get on her own turf, she and her sister would have a shot. If nothing else, she could punch in the emergency code into her security system to activate the silent alarm feature. Maybe the cops could get there before Roslyn discovered there was no evidence to be had.</p><p>Roslyn smiled, the expression holding no warmth. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to get to your own house where you know every nook and cranny. No, you\u2019ll tell us where it is, and I\u2019ll take Kelsey there with me. You can stay here with Davis until I have the evidence secured.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s stomach twisted into a pretzel for her own fate, but a little flame of hope flickered for her sister. She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s in the back of my closet in a box. But you\u2019re going to need my alarm code to get in the house.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s face was filled with question marks, but Brynn mustered up her therapist mask to hide her emotions. Roslyn evaluated her with shrewd eyes, no doubt searching for any chink in Brynn\u2019s facade. After a few agonizing moments, the woman gave a curt nod and released her grip on her sister.</p><p>\u201cI hope for both your sakes, you\u2019re not lying to me. If I discover this is a wild-goose chase, your sister will pay the price. I have a hefty overdose of heroin with her name on it. They say relapse is a bitch\u2014can kill you by accident so easily.\u201d</p><p>No. Please, God. Let the alarm code work in time. If the plan failed, they were both dead.</p><p>Roslyn pointed a finger at Brynn, but looked at Davis. \u201cKeep her restrained until I call you.\u201d</p><p>Davis\u2019s thin lips spread into a smile as he idly toyed with the whip, winding it around his fingers. \u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Reid leaned his head against the headrest and groaned. \u201cWhere the hell did he go?\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed and pulled over onto the dirt shoulder, a cloud of dust engulfing the car. \u201cWe should\u2019ve met up with him by now. This is where we saw him the first time, and I know he never passed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve turned off somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Jace crooked his thumb. \u201cThere\u2019s a small lake area a couple of miles up the road. I think there are a few vacation homes and rentals out there. That\u2019s the only way he could\u2019ve gone. There\u2019s really nothing else on this stretch of road except cow pastures.\u201d</p><p>The crush of pressure around Reid\u2019s chest tightened. Brynn. Isolated with that whack job. \u201cDo you remember where he wanted the stuff he ordered from you delivered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my assistant handled that part. But I\u2019d bet my left nut that he didn\u2019t get any of it sent to that fancy house in Highland Park where he lives with his wife. He wouldn\u2019t have had to use a fake name if he\u2019d done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check it out, then.\u201d</p><p>Jace swung the car back onto the highway and a few minutes later, turned onto a narrow, tree-lined road. They followed the winding gravel path, squinting through the darkness at the well-kept houses tucked behind the foliage. As they passed the homes, the car\u2019s headlights illuminated each labeled mailbox. The fifth box they passed had Kennedy spelled out in gold letters.</p><p>\u201cDing, ding, ding. We have a winner,\u201d Jace said, his tone grim. \u201cThat\u2019s the name he uses to make his orders.\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to stop spinning as Reid stared at the mailbox. \u201cLike the president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, arrogant fucker, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jace pulled around the next bend in the road and parked out of view.</p><p>Reid barely heard him over the pounding of his heart. He wet his lips. \u201cJace, do you still keep a gun in the car?\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head. \u201cOh, hell no. You\u2019re not going in there with a weapon. You\u2019ll end up spending the rest of your life in an orange jumpsuit.\u201d</p><p>Reid pinned him with a stare. \u201cThe new evidence I found on Brynn\u2019s mother\u2019s case points to someone with the last name Kennedy as the murderer.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might have more than a rapist out for a repeat performance. Brynn\u2019s sister was the one who originally had the new evidence.\u201d</p><p>Jace looked toward the house, creases of concern framing his mouth. \u201cYou think he\u2019s got both of the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to find out,\u201d Reid said, his voice resolute, but his insides twisting with worry. Davis had a jump of time on them. What if he\u2019d done something to Brynn or Kelsey already? No. He pushed the thought out of his mind. He would not be too late for Brynn this time. If this bastard had her, Reid would do whatever it took to get to her and protect her. \u201cGive me your gun. I won\u2019t use it unless I need to.\u201d</p><p>With a deep frown, Jace leaned over, popped open the glove compartment, and handed him the Smith &amp; Wesson.</p><p>Reid checked the safety, then tucked it in the back of his waistband, hiding it beneath his loose T-shirt. \u201cCall the police. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me come in with you. Keep the numbers on our side. Or, why don\u2019t we wait for the cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to waste any more time\u2014every minute could count. And I need you to stay out here to make sure at least one of us can help if something goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jace sank back against his seat and ran his hands over his face. \u201cFifteen minutes. If whatever Podunk police force isn\u2019t here by then, I\u2019m coming in after your ass.\u201d</p><p>Reid gave a quick nod and pushed open the car door to climb out. After double-checking the gun was secured, he quickly made his way toward the house. He had never shot anything besides a paper target at a shooting range\u2014he\u2019d always been too much of an animal lover to even join Patrick on his biannual hunting trips. But Reid knew if Davis had hurt either one of the women, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to shoot the fucker right in the heart. Or maybe tear him limb from limb with his bare hands. A gunshot might be too humane.</p><p>He stared at the door for a moment, not sure if he should try to sneak in. This was Texas\u2014people tended to shoot first, ask questions later. If he had the wrong house, he\u2019d get shot regardless of if Davis was on the other side or not. Better to make sure he was on the right track first. Knowing Davis he\u2019d probably be arrogant enough to answer the door, pretend everything was fine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>He rapped on the heavy oak door as icy calm overtook him.</p><p>A minute passed and he thought he heard shuffling on the other side, but the door didn\u2019t open. The chickenshit was going to ignore him? Oh, hell no. He pounded on the door with the side of his fist, the wood rattling beneath it. \u201cOpen up, Ackerman. We need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>So much for subtlety.</p><p>When no answer came, he reached for the handle in frustration and jiggled it. The lever handle gave easily and the lock clicked. He gave the door a tentative push and it creaked open, revealing a darkened living room of whitewashed furniture. Moonlight streamed in from the wall of windows at the back of the room\u2014the lake glinting a few yards beyond the small backyard. Reid slipped his hand behind him, wrapping his fingers around the handle of the gun. He took a cautious step forward, the carpet absorbing the noise.</p><p>He paused in the entryway, tuning his ears to each nuance of sound around him\u2014the breeze rustling the bushes outside, the hum of a refrigerator in the nearby kitchen, the click of the air-conditioning shutting off. The ordinary soundtrack of an empty house. But the hair on his arms was standing on end. Despite all the normalcy, something was off.</p><p>He closed the door behind him with a gentle snick, shutting out the outdoor noises, and listened more closely. There it was. Underneath all those mundane hums and clicks, a muffled sound that started then stopped in an irregular pattern. He eased the gun from his waistband and moved toward the kitchen with silent steps.</p><p>The unfamiliar sound grew a shade louder. He scanned the kitchen, quickly determining it was empty, then approached the only closed door in the room. He pressed his ear against the door and strained to hear what lay beyond. The sound he\u2019d been following increased in volume and hit him straight in the chest. A soft groan. Human and undeniably female.</p> <p>All caution flew from his brain, and he grabbed at the handle with his free hand. The door eased open and exposed a shadowed flight of stairs. Basements weren\u2019t normal in Texas, and Reid could think of only one reason why Davis would have a house built with one\u2014to conceal his dirty secrets.</p><p>The pitiful sound of whimpering increased, and Reid had to force himself not to rumble down the stairs like a charging bull. Keeping the gun poised in front of him and clinging to the shadows, he eased down the steps. When he reached the point where the shaft of light from the basement angled too wide for him to stay hidden, he crouched down to peek around the wall blocking his view.</p><p>His heart jumped into his throat. Brynn\u2014naked and hanging upside down on a St. Andrew\u2019s cross. She\u2019d been blindfolded and ball-gagged, but her choked sobs and moans made it past the blockage. Angry welts striped her torso, breasts, and thighs, and blood seeped from the lashes as her body heaved with her panicked breaths.</p><p>Rage whipped through him like a gale force wind. After a quick scan to make sure no one else was in the room, he hustled toward Brynn. She tensed and turned silent, apparently sensing she was no longer alone.</p><p>He tucked the gun in his waistband. \u201cBrynn, sugar, it\u2019s Reid. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>A strangled cry escaped from her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you off this thing,\u201d he said, reaching for the blindfold first, knowing that scared her as much as anything.</p><p>When he pulled the material from her, her bloodshot eyes were wide and swollen from crying. Unintelligible noises emanated from behind her gag, but he wanted to get her freed before anything else. He searched for the mechanism to turn the bondage wheel that the cross was attached to right-side up. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d</p><p>He hoped Davis had taken off when he\u2019d realized he\u2019d been caught, but Reid knew he could still be in the house. They needed to get the hell out of here. Fast.</p><p>He found the device and cranked the wheel. The thing groaned and squeaked as he slowly spun Brynn right-side up. Damn, could the thing be any louder? Might as well have a bullhorn announcing his location. He threw a glance over his shoulder, verifying they were still alone.</p><p>Once he\u2019d gotten her fully upright, he went to work on the straps securing her wrists. She shook her head frantically and tried to speak. He frowned. \u201cSugar, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019m going to get you out of here. Just try to breathe. I\u2019ll get the gag off you in one sec.\u201d</p><p>His big fingers fought with the intricate fastenings, and he cursed under his breath. He should\u2019ve brought Jace in; he could\u2019ve worked the equipment with his eyes closed. Finally, one of the straps came free. Brynn grabbed at her mouth, yanking the ball out of it, as he went to work on the next binding.</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d she whispered, her voice raw.</p><p>He kept his eyes focused on the task at hand. \u201cWhat, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBehind you.\u201d</p><p>Reid whirled around, and Davis stepped off the bottom stair, a pistol trained on Reid\u2019s chest. \u201cOh, look. Company. How lovely.\u201d</p><p>Reid shifted to the side to stand between Brynn and Davis\u2019s steady hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late. I had to take care of your friend out there. Can\u2019t have him interrupting the party,\u201d Davis said, his tone sickeningly calm.</p><p>The words hit Reid like one of the bullets in Davis\u2019s gun. Jace.</p><p>The councilman walked toward the two of them with deliberate steps and a satisfied smile. \u201cStep away from my slave, Reid. I don\u2019t plan on sharing her like you do.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s teeth ground together, the urge to murder this man a living, breathing thing inside him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you touch her.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cRoslyn always worried this girl would be your downfall. After all the trouble she\u2019s gone through to keep you two apart, she\u2019ll be so disappointed to see she\u2019s failed.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s focus stuttered at the mention of his aunt\u2019s name. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Davis gave a put-upon sigh. \u201cBlackmail, dirty pictures, letting me have my fun with Brynn. I told her you were a lost cause, but she had these ridiculous notions that you could actually make something of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Reid stared at gun. All the puzzle pieces were crashing through his brain like jagged pieces of shrapnel, ripping through the fabric of his reality, but he couldn\u2019t lose sight of the situation at hand. He raised his eyes to meet Davis\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking lunatic.\u201d</p><p>His voice turned colder. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you one last time to step aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and cocked the pistol. \u201cSuit yourself. It\u2019s not going to be much of a matchup. In man versus gun, gun usually wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Brynn said, her hand touching the small of Reid\u2019s back. \u201cListen to him, Reid. Let him have me.\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s back stiffened beneath her fingertips as she made the suggestion, but she prayed he would listen. Davis wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill him. She\u2019d seen the crazy in the councilman\u2019s eyes as he was tying her up. The man had no soul.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Reid said, his voice strained. \u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to. Please, Reid. Listen to what he says and maybe he\u2019ll let us go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to let us\u2014\u201d</p><p>She slipped the gun from his waistband and pressed the butt of it into his back, hoping he could feel what she was doing. \u201cPlease. Move aside like he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, my pretty slave wants me to touch her. Now get the fuck out of the way, and maybe I\u2019ll let you watch.\u201d</p><p>Reid glanced over his shoulder, giving her a pointed glace, and mouthed the word \u201cone.\u201d She nodded, counting the next numbers in her head.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>In one swift motion, he took a wide step to the left. Automatically, Davis\u2019s gaze and pistol followed the movement, giving Brynn the beat of time she needed to aim. When Davis\u2019s attention returned to her, the pompous smile wilted. Without hesitation, she pulled the trigger of Reid\u2019s gun, shooting the man of her nightmares squarely in the chest.</p><p>But the deafening sound of the shot seemed to stutter as the gun recoiled in her hands\u2014two bangs, not one. She looked down at her weapon, confused. Only when she heard the dueling groans of agony did she realize her shot hadn\u2019t been the only one fired. Horror ratcheted through her as she lifted her gaze to find two crumpled and bloodied men on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brynn yelled, and jolted forward, but the waist and ankle straps held her fast to the cross. \u201cReid!\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes as she set the gun aside and frantically unfastened the bindings. Low moans came from Reid, giving her hope she still had time to help him. She couldn\u2019t lose him\u2014wouldn\u2019t. Davis had taken so much from her; she refused to allow him to take any more.</p><p>She freed herself and raced to Reid. Blood covered the entire left side of his shirt and the hand he had clamped over the wound. She couldn\u2019t tell if he\u2019d been shot in the chest or shoulder. She brushed a hand over his ashen cheek. \u201cReid, can you hear me, baby? I\u2019m going to go find a phone. Can you try to stay awake for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pocket,\u201d he said through a grimace of pain.</p><p>She patted his pockets, then dove in when she felt the cell phone.</p><p>She hoped her rushed words to the police conveyed the situation clearly enough. They assured her help was on the way and that they\u2019d send someone to her house to find her sister and Roslyn. They wanted her to stay on the line, but she couldn\u2019t focus on the 911 operator. She needed to keep Reid conscious.</p><p>She stepped around Davis and the pool of blood spreading beneath him. Her stomach threatened to heave. She\u2019d killed someone. Granted, he\u2019d deserved it, but she knew she\u2019d be seeing this scene replayed in her mind for a long time.</p><p>Dragging her focus away from the macabre sight, she hurried to the far wall and grabbed a stack of clean towels off a shelf. She wrapped one around herself, then brought the rest to Reid\u2019s side. Gingerly, she lifted his hand away from his shirt and placed a towel against his wound, applying pressure. His bloodied hand settled on top of hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I... lied to you,\u201d he said, sounding like each word was a monumental effort. \u201cBut need you to know, everything between us... was real. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she soothed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. I\u2019ll save your ass-kicking for then.\u201d</p><p>A choked sound that could\u2019ve been an attempt at a laugh escaped him, causing him to wince. \u201cLook forward to it.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet and anxiety clawed at her as his breath turned shallower, but she couldn\u2019t let Reid sense her fear. She channeled every ounce of her remaining strength into her voice. \u201cYou stay with me, Reid. I don\u2019t care how bad it hurts. You\u2019re not allowed to go to sleep. You understand?\u201d</p><p>His lips quivered into a hint of a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she said, keeping her tone firm. His commands had always cleared her mind, sharpened her focus, and she hoped to God it would work the same way for him right now. \u201cI\u2019m done losing the people I care about. You don\u2019t have permission to leave.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved into a full grin, even as his skin took on a sickly shade of gray. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>But right as the paramedics thundered down the stairs, the grip of his hand on top of hers went slack and the smile faded from his face.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Brynn shifted in the hospital\u2019s vinyl-covered chair, pulling her knees to her chest and setting her chin on them. The change in position relieved some of the pressure on the healing welts striping her back, but irritated the ones on her front side. No matter. She\u2019d survive.</p><p>The monitors at the nurses\u2019 station continued their steady beat, lulling her into a near catatonic state. She hadn\u2019t slept in days. Couldn\u2019t. Reid\u2019s surgery had gone well even though he\u2019d lost a lot of blood, and the doctor had said he should make a full recovery. But watching Reid lie in bed for two days\u2014only waking up for brief, drug-induced moments\u2014had her on edge. She needed to hear from the man himself that he was okay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>She closed her eyes, the insides of her lids feeling like steel wool scraping against them. The scene in the basement kept playing over and over in her mind. All the things she could\u2019ve done differently. How if she had just stayed and talked to Reid instead of running away to the party, everything could\u2019ve been avoided.</p><p>Running. Always running. It\u2019s what she did best.</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d The nurse\u2019s hand on her shoulder made Brynn jump. The older woman smiled down at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>Brynn dropped her feet to the floor and shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Just waiting for visiting hours to start.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the door. \u201cYou\u2019re all set. Doctor just finished with him. You can go in now.\u201d</p><p>Wiping the bleariness from her eyes, she stood and thanked the woman, then moved past her and through Reid\u2019s door. She had expected to see the same scene from the previous two days\u2014darkened room, beeping machines, and a pale, sleeping Reid.</p><p>But instead, she was greeted with a lopsided grin and a gravelly voice. \u201cHey, sugar.\u201d</p> <p>Her heavy heart buoyed in her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d He shifted higher on the angled bed, wincing</p><p>a bit. \u201cHow come every time you get near a weapon I end up in pain?\u201d</p><p>Awake and sarcastic. She wanted to drop to her knees and thank the heavens. \u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019re always standing too close to the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, some of the humor leaving his face. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>She headed toward the visitor\u2019s chair, but he patted the side of the bed instead. She sat on the edge near his feet, trying her best not to jostle him any. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged with his good shoulder. \u201cLike I\u2019ve been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Stupid question.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cI\u2019m okay, I think. Doc said the bullet missed all the important stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d She wondered if the doctor had told him how close to hitting his heart it had been. Her breath left her thinking about the scant inches, the sliver of a miracle that had saved him.</p><p>Concerned eyes scanned her head to waist. \u201cAnd you? Are you... okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe welts are healing.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, as if trying to find the answer to his next question on her face. \u201cDid he\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, cutting him off before he could say the words. \u201cHe was going to, after he finished the beating, but you got there before he had the chance.\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his right hand and squeezed. \u201cThank you. You didn\u2019t just save me from that, you saved my life.\u201d</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201cThe nurse said Jace is all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace\u2019s fine. Davis knocked him out, but he only had a concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kelsey?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands and sighed. \u201cThe police intercepted Roslyn and got Kelsey to safety, but she\u2019s been through a lot. Davis posed as the dom who was supposed to be training her and brought her to his cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, The Ranch assumed Kels was a no-show, but Davis had her on-site for three days\u2014fooled her into his bed. She figured out he was lying when he started asking questions about the evidence. When she tried to escape, he hauled her off to stay with Roslyn at the lake house and came back to pursue me for the information instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, is she going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>She twisted the ring on her right hand over and over. \u201cKelsey\u2019s tough. Right now she says she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s even willing to cooperate with the police on both this case and the one with the dealer. But I think when she slows down, all this is going to hit her pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad to be alive at this point.\u201d</p><p>Reid released a long breath. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be too late again\u2014that I\u2019d lost you for good.\u201d</p><p>She fought against the lump forming in her throat. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d lost him forever, too. The moment the second gun had gone off had been one of the worst of her life. \u201cNope. You still have to put up with me every day at work.\u201d</p><p>His fingers laced with hers. \u201cWhat if I want to put up with you for more than that?\u201d</p><p>She stared at their locked hands, the simple connection both warming her and bringing sadness all at once. Her mouth twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re pumped full of pain meds and not thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he said, the firmness in his voice making her meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been up since four this morning doing nothing but thinking. I\u2019m sorry I deceived you about why I was at The Ranch. I needed your sister for the appeal, but I won\u2019t lie, I also wanted to knock you down a few notches. Get back at you. It was an asshole thing to do. But Brynn, as soon as you kissed me back at the initiation, it\u2019s like I was right where I needed to be. Everything that happened after that was a hundred percent real, at least for me.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip, considering him. \u201cFor me, too.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened around hers. \u201cThen give me another shot to get it right.\u201d</p><p>Her heart picked up speed, urging her to grab on to what he was suggesting. But she knew better. Nothing had changed since their conversation in the bathtub. \u201cWe want different things, Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and extracted her hand from his. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t be what you need.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her body as if remembering the scars beneath, and she had the urge to cover herself with her arms. \u201cYou are what I need, Brynn. I know you\u2019ve been through hell and it\u2019s going to take time to work through that. But let me be there with you while you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I never work through it, Reid?\u201d she said, her voice hardening. \u201cWhat if every time you touch me, I can\u2019t help but think of all the horrid things he did to me?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019ll just give up being who you are if I can\u2019t handle it? Isn\u2019t that why you got divorced?\u201d</p><p>His jaw flexed. \u201cI got divorced because I didn\u2019t love her like I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, the unexpected words halting all her thought processes.</p><p>He captured her wrist and forced her to scoot up the bed, then reached to cup her cheek. \u201cMy world cracked open when I thought I might never see you again. Give us another shot, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She blinked back the tears that welled in her eyes. \u201cReid...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am who I am. You\u2019re the one who tried to teach me that all those years ago. And if you\u2019re looking for a guy who\u2019s always going to be polite and gentle and politically correct, I\u2019m not him. But you have to ask yourself\u2014is that what you want? I know you\u2019re scared. But I would never hurt you. Don\u2019t let what that bastard did change who you are.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze, staring hard at the seam on the sheets. \u201cI\u2019m not the girl you used to know, Reid. Things do change whether we want them to or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who was the girl with me at The Ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the guy who said he was done with relationships?\u201d</p><p>He released a frustrated breath. \u201cA guy who was too afraid to admit he had fallen in love.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to keep it from trembling. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot. Trauma like this can mess with your head\u2014make you think you want things you may not actually want. We\u2019re both too emotional right now to make big decisions.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger under her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t give me the therapist speak, Brynn. Sure, shit like this can screw with your mind, but it also can bring things into laser-sharp focus, make you realize what\u2019s really important. Can you look me in the eye and tell me you don\u2019t love me back? That you don\u2019t feel more alive when we\u2019re together? Because that\u2019s what you do for me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, the duct tape holding together her fractured emotions threatening to bust apart. \u201cI can\u2019t... do this right now.\u201d</p><p>She moved to get off the bed, but he grabbed her arm, his grip firm and his eyes blazing with determination. \u201cYou will not run from me, Brynn. Not again. You look at me and tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, staring at his hand on her, then looked him dead in the eye and said the only thing she knew would free them both. \u201cTexas.\u201d</p><p>The hurt that crossed his face ripped her guts out, but she pasted on her stoic therapist mask\u2014the only thing that saved her from falling to her knees in a broken heap of emotion. The sights and sounds of the rooms seemed to grind to slow motion, and the fight left Reid\u2019s body. His hand slipped from her arm and he nodded.</p><p>Without another word, she rose off the bed and walked out the room, the tears falling as soon as she shut the door behind her.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Reid glanced up as Jace pulled open the sliding glass doors and sauntered onto Reid\u2019s backyard deck like he owned the place. \u201cYou know, knocking before you come into somebody\u2019s house is usually customary.\u201d</p><p>Jace grinned and handed Reid a beer. \u201cI forgot. That head injury has made my memory shit.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cRight. Is that what you\u2019re telling the girls you date when you forget their names?\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed and sank into the lawn chair next to him. \u201cThe benefits of being hit in the head are vast. Although, it won\u2019t impress women nearly as much as surviving a gunshot wound to save a damsel in distress.\u201d</p><p>Reid closed the file he\u2019d been working on and took a sip of beer. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d have to leave out the part about her saving my ass right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>He stared off in the direction of the setting sun, frowning. \u201cNo. Not since the hospital.\u201d</p><p>And it was killing him. Brynn had been through her worst nightmare, and knowing she was facing all those demons alone kept him awake at night.</p><p>But she\u2019d walked away. Didn\u2019t love him enough to try. Some things he couldn\u2019t command. No matter how much he wanted to.</p><p>Jace considered him, his normal humor gone from his face. \u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI told her I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she used her safe word.\u201d</p><p>Jace winced. \u201cFucking brutal.\u201d</p><p>Reid ran a hand over the back of his neck, wiping the sweat that had gathered there. \u201cShe\u2019s terrified, man. That sadistic asshole fucked with her head, and now she\u2019s convinced being with someone like me will rehash that terror every time I touch her. She was so close to pushing past her fear when we were at The Ranch, and now she\u2019s scrambling backward.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s tone hardened. \u201cMakes me wish we could bring that fucker Davis back from the dead, just so we could have the pleasure of killing him ourselves. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d He swigged his beer. \u201cAnd this giving her space thing is driving me nuts. I wake up every damn day ready to pound on her door, throw her over my shoulder, and cuff her to me until she gives me another chance.\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shot his friend a don\u2019t-be-a-stupid-asshole glare.</p><p>Jace leaned forward, his forearms braced against his thighs. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying you actually kidnap her. But, whether Brynn wants it or not, she responds to submission\u2014to you. She was so scared when I was getting her ready at The Ranch. I thought for sure she\u2019d bail before the word \u2018go,\u2019 but as soon as she was with you, she relaxed and, unless she\u2019s the best actress ever, enjoyed it. You need to remind her how it can be with someone who\u2019s there for her pleasure not pain. Chase away the ugly associations she has about it by giving her a taste of your dominance again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Reid shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll just run farther away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. And she can\u2019t run too far\u2014you\u2019ll be back in the office with her on Monday.\u201d</p> <p>Reid gave a noncommittal grunt. He hadn\u2019t told Jace, but he\u2019d be looking for a new place to move his office to on Monday. No way would he be able to see Brynn every day knowing he couldn\u2019t have her. Masochism was not his kink.</p><p>Jace set his bottle down, his expression brightening. \u201cAll right, enough of this, I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d</p><p>Reid shot him a wary look. \u201cDangerous words coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. We\u2019re not doing anyone any good sitting here having a fuck-my-life conversation. And it\u2019s time for you to stop doing the hermit thing.\u201d</p><p>Reid tilted his bottle back. \u201cI think the hermit lifestyle suits me. I\u2019d look good with a beard.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Three weeks of house arrest is long enough. It\u2019s Friday night, your shoulder sling is off\u2014we should go do something.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cI have a friend whose band is playing tonight. Why don\u2019t we grab a burger, then go to their show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a roommate you can drag to these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe department switched Andre to the night shift. Plus, he hates hard rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jace hopped from his chair. \u201cI\u2019m changing that from a request to an order. You owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Reid cocked an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re ordering me around? That head injury really did do some damage.\u201d</p> <p>He crooked a thumb toward the house. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a douche. Go get showered and changed. I\u2019ve seen homeless people who look better than you.\u201d</p><p>Reid flipped him off, but rose from his chair. Maybe Jace was right. He\u2019d done nothing but work on Hank\u2019s case and worry about Brynn since he\u2019d come home from the hospital. Maybe getting out of the house would help his sour mood. He headed into the house, Jace hot on his heels. He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help myself to the rest of your beer supply.\u201d</p><p>Reid walked into the nightclub already itching to leave. After three weeks of holing up in his quiet house, the blinking lights and heavy rock beat overloaded his senses. He pulled at the sleeve of his black T-shirt, the snug fit irritating the healing bullet wound. Jace clapped him on his good shoulder. \u201cCome on, there\u2019s a table over there, next to the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>Super. Just what he wanted to watch all night\u2014happy couples having vertical sex.</p><p>He followed Jace, sank into one of the modern leather chairs, and prepared to brood. As soon as he could wrangle a waitress, he ordered a stiff drink and started his mental clock. One hour, and then he was leaving. His indebtedness to Jace only went so far.</p><p>Once the drinks arrived and he had sufficiently drained his and ordered another, he leaned toward Jace. \u201cWho do you know in the band?\u201d</p><p>Jace put his hand up to his ear to hear him over the thumping music. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head toward the stage at the female-led rock band. \u201cHow do you know the band?\u201d</p><p>The corner of Jace\u2019s mouth tipped into a wry smile, and he pointed over Reid\u2019s shoulder with his straw. \u201cI don\u2019t. But she does.\u201d</p><p>Reid craned his neck in that direction and froze. Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cShe calls me every day to check on your recovery, you know,\u201d Jace said. \u201cI may have asked her what her plans were for the night.\u201d</p><p>Reid gripped his drink so hard he was surprised the glass didn\u2019t splinter. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you, man. You have no right to interfere.\u201d</p><p>Jace shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t do anything. Enjoy a few drinks and watch that dude take your girl onto the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>Reid whirled around again to see Brynn take some yahoo\u2019s hand and rise from her seat. He couldn\u2019t see her face, but the short hem of her snug black dress taunted him, the sweet skin of her thighs and calves beckoning him to touch, taste, and devour.</p><p>But before the fantasies started weaving in his head, the guy\u2019s hand slid onto the base of Brynn\u2019s spine. Possessive. Presumptuous. Something dark and primal snapped inside Reid. He surged upward, no longer able to hear the music over the blood rushing in his ears.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Brynn tried to muster a smile for the guy, Mark or Mitch something, who\u2019d asked her to dance, but she knew she was failing miserably. She could think of fifty other places she\u2019d rather be than here at this stupid club, but she\u2019d promised Melody she\u2019d go out with her this weekend to see her new boyfriend\u2019s band. She knew Mel was worried about her and was trying to get her mind off everything, but beyond a lobotomy, she doubted anything was going to accomplish that.</p><p>Luckily, the crowded dance floor and loud music saved her from having to make small talk. She moved along with the throng, sweaty bodies bouncing around her on all sides. Mitch/Mark kept a palm on her hip and a pelvis grinding in her direction, the playful spark of interest firing behind his rimless glasses.</p><p>She closed her eyes, not having the energy to feign interest back, and turned herself over to the hypnotic pulsing of the bass and the small buzz she\u2019d gotten from her two glasses of wine. Thump. Thump. Thump. Her muscles moved in time, but her mind drifted, her thoughts going to the same place they always went these days.</p><p>Warmth oozed over her skin as the hands on her hips suddenly became broader, stronger. The amorphous body heat against her back more defined, solid. Tossing her head back, she leaned into the steely wall, inhaling the scent burned into her olfactory glands. Mmm.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to open her eyes, wasn\u2019t ready for the fantasy to slip away.</p><p>\u201cThink this jerk-off can make you come apart like I do?\u201d asked the deep, familiar voice.</p><p>She startled at the words, her lids flying open. Her dance partner had been absorbed into the crowd and now large, familiar hands gripped her waist from behind. Her movements stuttered off the beat, and her knees almost went out from under her.</p><p>His lips brushed against the back of her neck. \u201cYou know what it fucking does to me to see some other guy touch what\u2019s mine without my consent?\u201d</p><p>What was Reid doing here? She had used her safe word, had walked away. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing this. But she couldn\u2019t make herself form a protest. Instead, she tilted her neck to the side, providing him better access, her body acting on its own volition.</p><p>The brush of lips became a scrape of teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Give in to it.\u201d</p><p>The hand on her waist drew her closer, bringing her ass against the hard ridge in his pants. She let out a little gasp, molten heat flooding her sex. \u201cReid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel how much I miss you, sugar,\u201d he said, his voice like warm milk on a cold night. \u201cHave you missed me?</p><p>His palm slid down, cupping her vee and making her arch against him. \u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>The words came out before she had time to evaluate their consequences. She bit her lip hard as her clit swelled beneath the pressure of his hand. The music continued to thump and people pressed around them, concealing his blatant touch. He worked his hand against her with a slow, methodical rhythm, the lacy material of her underwear sliding against her sensitive skin.</p><p>His other hand moved to her ribs, his thumb idly caressing the underside of her breast. Her nipples pebbled against her bra, the buds aching for Reid to yank down the neckline of her dress and take one into his mouth. She sagged against him, and his fingers drifted higher, grazing over her left breast. She bucked with the combination of sensations. Fuck. She was going to come right here on the dance floor and he hadn\u2019t even touched her bare skin.</p><p>He chuckled against her hair. \u201cNot yet, sugar. Not here.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself not to beg for release.</p><p>\u201cThe song is about to end. When it does, you tell Melody you\u2019ll be back in a little while. Walk out to the parking lot. My car is in the back corner of the lot. You meet me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d she said, her breath catching, the word more a plea than anything else.</p><p>\u201cNo safe words tonight. You\u2019re either by the car when I get there or you\u2019re not. I call the shots after that.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, his hard tone making her belly tighten and her clit ache. Shit. What was he planning to do to her?</p><p>The song came to a cymbal-crashing conclusion, and Reid released her. When she spun around, his blue eyes blazed over her. He caught her wrist and brought it to his mouth for a light nip. \u201cYour call, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and strode away, his confident swagger and drool-worthy body drawing the attention of every woman he passed on the way back to his table. He didn\u2019t grace any of them with a glance and didn\u2019t look back to see if Brynn was following his instructions.</p><p>On jelly legs, she made her way back to her table. Melody looked up at her, her eyes widening. \u201cGood lord, girl, are you okay? You\u2019re all flushed. Maybe you should sit.\u201d</p><p>Brynn shook her head. \u201cI need some air. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Mel moved to stand up. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brynn said, maybe a bit too abruptly because Mel raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss Terrence\u2019s next song. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Her friend sank back into her seat. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and before she could think too hard about what she was about to do, headed toward the exit door.</p><p>The air outside had cooled and grown heavy since she\u2019d arrived, and the low rumble of thunder promised a rare summer storm. Besides the tap of her strappy heels along the pavement, the lot was quiet, the headlining band enough to draw even the smokers inside. She kept a brisk pace, and her senses tuned to her surroundings. The club was in a good neighborhood, but the parking lot was dark and she was seeing monsters in every shadow these days.</p><p>Reid\u2019s sleek SUV loomed in the farthest corner of the lot next to an ancient looking oak tree, but there was no sign of the man himself. She paused a few steps from the vehicle, her heart hammering against her ribs. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t do this. What if she panicked again and didn\u2019t even have a safe word to escape? What if the nightmares she\u2019d had every night since the day in Davis\u2019s basement claimed her and Reid didn\u2019t stop?</p><p>Reid stepped out from behind the SUV and leaned a hip against the grille. Her crossed his arms over his chest and pinned her with his stare. \u201cYou\u2019ve got four steps of free will left, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the small expanse of space between them and swallowed hard. His very presence soothed something jagged inside her. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk about us.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cWhat I have in mind doesn\u2019t require conversation, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted to the large erection pushing against his jeans, and her muscles tightened in anticipation of how it would feel to have him inside her again. Shit. This was a bad idea. So bad.</p><p>But God, she wanted him.</p><p>She locked her gaze with his and took a breath.</p><p>One. Two. Three. Four. She crossed the last few steps, not stopping until she stood within inches of his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said, pushing off the car and straightening to his full, intimidating height.</p><p>She moistened her lips. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slow smile. \u201cWho said we were going anywhere?\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, he hooked an arm around her waist, and his lips claimed hers. Hungry and hot, his tongue possessed her mouth\u2014pure, animal need flowing from every pore in his body and into hers. Gone was the sweet, loving guy from the hospital. In his place was Reid\u2019s dark side personified. The side he had tried to ignore when they were in their twenties. Dominant. Powerful. Carnal.</p><p>She should\u2019ve been scared, and she expected the panic and flashbacks to slam into her. But instead, her entire being jumped to life and every nerve swirled into a pool of trembling want low in her belly. This man wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He would own her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>And hell if she didn\u2019t want anything more in that moment.</p><p>She curled her fingers into his T-shirt as he pressed her against the front of the car, the residual heat from the engine warming her back. His hands traced up her waist, over her rib cage, and then cupped her breasts. She tilted her head back, her moan chasing a clap of thunder.</p> <p>His forefingers glided up and hooked her spaghetti straps, then yanked them down along with the top of dress and the cups of her strapless bra. Her breasts tumbled out, the nipples already tight and needy when they hit the night air. She gasped as his hot breath slid along her bared skin. \u201cSomeone could see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He circled an areola with his fingertip, the touch sending electric sparks straight to her center. \u201cAnd I bet you\u2019re dripping just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the nipple between his thumb and forefinger hard enough for her to writhe. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced yourself you\u2019re a good girl. The social worker in the conservative suits who teaches women about empowerment. But underneath all that, good doesn\u2019t get you off, does it?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, unable to hold his probing stare.</p> <p>\u201cLie down.\u201d He grabbed her waist and lifted her to sit on the hood, then pushed her shoulders until she was lying down, her back heating against the warm metal. He smoothed his hands up the outside of her thighs and slowly pushed the hem of her clingy dress up to her hips, revealing her panties.</p><p>The sky roared again, and rain began to hit her exposed skin in fat droplets, cool kisses against her breasts and face. Reid grabbed the edge of her underwear and yanked, the thin material ripping immediately. \u201cLet\u2019s see how right I am, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed in anticipation of his touch, and he planted a palm against her pelvis, securing her to the hood. His free hand traveled up her inner thigh until his fingers found her wet heat. Losing her last grip on control, she mewled at the contact.</p><p>He let out a low, satisfied groan. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful how wet you get for me, sugar. How badly you want me to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>She widened her legs, inviting him, begging him. She\u2019d deal with what this all meant later. Right now she needed him inside her. Two fingers surrounded her clit and massaged. She pressed the back of her head into the hood, her breath rapid.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared, sugar?\u201d he asked, a hint of gentleness entering his tone.</p> <p>The answer was automatic. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he soothed. \u201cBecause I would never hurt you, Brynn. You\u2019re safe with me. I\u2019ll never push you further than I know you can go.\u201d</p><p>Tears mixed with the rain that splashed onto her cheeks, the truth of his words resonating over her. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, the relief in his voice evident. \u201cNow come for me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He slid two fingers inside her throbbing channel and kept a thumb against her hot button, working her with swift confidence. Thunder rumbled in the sky, matching the lightning flashing through her veins. She squirmed against the car, but he gave her no reprieve. One hand remained splayed over her navel, the other against her pussy. No time to think or worry, just feel. Within seconds, every nerve in her body coiled into a tense, yearning mass, bringing her focus to that single, unbearably beautiful ache in her core\u2014that exquisite moment right before release.</p><p>\u201cLet go, love. Let it all go.\u201d</p><p>On his command, her body tipped over the edge of control, ripping a primal groan from her chest. Her body clamped down on his fingers, and her pelvis arched against his hand. \u201cOh, God. Reid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p> <p>His words both soothed and heightened her senses as she crested the wave of orgasm, his skillful touch wringing out every ounce of pleasure as the rain continued to pound against her.</p><p>When the contractions finally quieted, he eased his fingers from her and draped his chest over her form, shielding her from the now full-fledged thunderstorm. He laid a soft kiss against her brow. \u201cGood night, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her languid muscles stiffened beneath him. \u201cWhere are you going? I thought we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is as far as I\u2019m taking you tonight. I won\u2019t go any further until you tell me what you want. Who you want.\u201d</p><p>His clear blue eyes stared into hers, and she knew he wasn\u2019t asking what and who she wanted in this moment. But for every moment. Her voice came out in a choked whisper. \u201cReid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, standing up and easing her to her feet. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide anything tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rivulets of water dripped off his jawline, and his black T-shirt clung to every line of muscle as he helped her set her dress to rights. Unable to resist touching him, she pushed the wet hair off his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile played around the corner of his mouth, and he nodded at her saturated dress. \u201cSaid the pot to the kettle.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the remaining strap of her dress and slid it over her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not so good at giving up, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you a long time ago it takes me a while to get a point.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets and cocked his head toward the club. \u201cCome on, beautiful. Let\u2019s get you to dry land.\u201d</p><p>She stepped to his side and offered him her hand. Without a word, he threaded his fingers with hers and they walked back to the club, only the sound of the pattering rain between them.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>All weekend. No phone call. No visit. And then today, she\u2019d called in sick for work.</p><p>He\u2019d blown it.</p><p>Reid slammed his shower door shut with his foot, then kicked it for final measure. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought he\u2019d broken through, thought he\u2019d reminded Brynn how good they were together. But apparently his take-no-prisoners seduction had backfired. He\u2019d given her the full face of his dominance, taken away her safe word option, tried to show her that what they had was stronger than the darkness Davis left behind. But apparently it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>He scrubbed the towel through his damp hair, and then wrapped it around his waist. Maybe he had pushed too hard. Maybe he should\u2019ve taken the slow and gentle approach, shown her that he was capable of being just as tender with her as he was tough.</p><p>He reached for a fresh bandage for his shoulder and all of his supplies toppled off the edge of the sink and onto the floor. He let another string of choice words fly as the bottle of rubbing alcohol landed on its side and sent the strong-smelling liquid flooding over his tile.</p><p>Was everything going to fight him? With a sigh, he got to his knees and cleaned up the mess. Great, now his bathroom was going to smell like the hospital ward he wanted to forget. After tossing the soiled towel in the hamper, he finished bandaging his shoulder, and finally headed into the bedroom.</p><p>But he only had one foot on the carpet before he ground to a halt.</p><p>Sitting in the middle of his bed with her legs tucked under her, was Brynn. Naked, save for the red necktie fastened over her eyes and the small, flat box she held in her hands.</p><p>She gave a hesitant smile, apparently sensing his presence. \u201cYou all right? Sounded like a Quentin Tarantino movie in there.\u201d</p><p>The longing that assaulted him sucked all the air from the room and almost brought him to his knees. But he didn\u2019t dare move. \u201cBrynn, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving you my answer.\u201d</p><p>The golden lamplight of the room gilded every curve of her nudity, making her appear both goddess-like and vulnerably human all at the same time. He gripped the edge of the doorframe. The urge to touch her, hold her... claim her overwhelming him. But the soft glow couldn\u2019t conceal the faint pink of the healing whip marks\u2014a glaring reminder of the deeper, more pervasive scars that lay beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar.\u201d He walked to the bed, sat next to her, and untied the blindfold, barely resisting the instinct to pull her into his lap and cradle her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it this way. I love you. I only want another chance. I don\u2019t need you to push yourself into this part before you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, adjusting to the light, then held out the box. \u201cI am ready.\u201d</p><p>He took the gift from her, her words not lining up in his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a rueful smile. \u201cYou were right about what you said in the hospital. I\u2019m always giving you lectures about being true to who you are. That very first night when we made love all those years ago, I told you I wouldn\u2019t be with you if you were going to deny your nature. And then I spent the next ten years denying mine.\u201d</p><p>His heart seemed to pause mid-beat, and his fingers tightened around the box.</p><p>\u201cEver since the rape, I\u2019ve tried to block the submissive part of myself. Not only because of the fear, but because of what I thought it said about me. Davis told me that night that I\u2019d better get used to what he was doing because I was a born whore. That no decent woman would enjoy a man tying her up and hitting her.\u201d She looked down at her hands. \u201cAnd part of me knew he was trying to be cruel, to humiliate me, but another part of me believed him.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cThat fucking bastard.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cMy career is teaching women to value themselves, to take pride in who they are, and to live the life they want. I thought what that meant for me was striving for some idealistic image I created in my head when I was a kid. But it\u2019s not. I\u2019m proud of the person I\u2019ve become. I\u2019m good at what I do, have great friends, and have made a nice life for myself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and pushed a wisp of hair from her face.</p><p>She lifted her eyes to him. \u201cBut I\u2019m also a girl who gets all wobbly-kneed when her man demands to fuck her in a parking lot in the storming rain. And I\u2019m not going to be ashamed of that either.\u201d</p><p>Her words and the memory it brought forth jolted through his nervous system like a shot of adrenaline. His cock flexed beneath the towel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done worrying about what other people think. And I\u2019m done letting what Davis did define me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her scars. \u201cAnd the panic attacks, the flashbacks?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment, a small crease forming between her brows. \u201cI think what scared me the most was losing control\u2014being hurt again. But I realized the other night when I went to you without a safe word that submission is not about loss of control, it\u2019s about trust. And I trust you.\u201d She took a deep breath, but her gaze didn\u2019t waver from his. \u201cI love you. Always have.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, absorbing her words, letting the fear that had gripped his insides for the last few weeks melt away. She loved him back. Thank you, God. As long as he had that, everything else could be worked out.</p><p>He reached out and traced one of the scars that striped her sternum, the gentle caress making goose bumps rise on her pale skin. \u201cI love you, too, sugar. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so hardheaded and not giving up on me,\u201d she said, her voice catching a bit and her green eyes going shiny. \u201cNow, open that damn box before I get all weepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to cry\u2014the moment was too sweet to mar with tears\u2014so he pulled the ribbon on the box and lifted the lid. Inside, a sterling silver circle, its only adornment a simple O-ring hanging from it.</p><p>To the rest of the world, a pretty necklace.</p><p>To him\u2014everything.</p><p>A wide grin spread across his face, the joy within him so strong, he was sure he could bleed sunshine.</p><p>She put her hands out to him, wrists up, just as she had that first night they\u2019d made love. \u201cMake me yours, Reid Jamison.\u201d</p><p>Brynn shivered as Reid\u2019s heated gaze caressed her naked form, heightening her awareness of every lonely inch between them. He lifted her wrists to his mouth and kissed each one. \u201cI think it may take more than a collar for me to stake my claim.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>Sharp tingles raced up her arms, her body craving him like it craved food and water. \u201cGuess it\u2019s a good thing I sent Jace on his merry way after he let me in, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing.\u201d He grabbed her hips and lifted her to straddle his towel-clad lap, his hard length brushing the terry cloth against her sensitive skin. \u201cBecause you\u2019re mine now. And I don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine. Not with another person.\u201d He touched his lips to the pink line that striped the top of her breast. \u201cAnd not with ugly memories. All we need is you and me.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled through unshed tears as he hooked the collar around her neck and ran a finger over the hollow of her throat. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face and kissed her eyelids, then her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead against his and let her hands glide down his chest, which was still dewy from his shower. \u201cI will if you don\u2019t stop torturing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She traced a circle around his flat nipple. \u201cHow am I supposed to sit here and be submissive when you look so fucking hot?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, a big and hearty sound that seemed to lighten the air around them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work on your patience.\u201d</p><p>She rocked once against his lap, stroking herself along his erection. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>The blue of his eyes darkened with lust, possessiveness. \u201cTell me now if you have any lines you don\u2019t want me to cross yet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. No more fear. Only anticipation. And love. \u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me, sir. I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>He gave her butt a lightning-quick smack. \u201cGet on your back, LeBreck. Hands gripping the slats of the headboard.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, she climbed off him and followed his instructions. He rose from the bed and then disappeared into his walk-in closet, leaving her wondering what the heck he was up to. When he emerged, he had a fistful of neckties and had dropped the towel. Knowing that she may soon be blindfolded, she took the chance to devour him with her eyes. No matter how many times she saw him naked, the sight of his hard angles and smooth muscles never failed to steal her breath and light up her insides.</p> <p>Her focus traveled down the planes of his torso to the vee of his pelvis, honing in on the evidence of his arousal. She wet her lips, the memory of his taste alighting on her tongue. The desire to please him, to bring pleasure to the man she loved\u2014her master\u2014bloomed in her like a living thing. Never had she suspected that accepting her submissive role with him would feel so freeing, so undeniably right. It was as if her soul had been out of alignment, and Reid smoothed all the chinks.</p><p>He gave a dark chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at me like I\u2019m your next meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you are.\u201d</p><p>His fist wrapped around his cock, and he stroked his thumb across the head, catching the bit of liquid glistening there. \u201cYou love seeing how hard you make me, don\u2019t you? How crazy you can drive me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pressed her thighs together, her own liquid heat surging in response.</p><p>He stepped next to the bed and ran his damp thumb across her lips. Automatically, she sucked the pad of it into her mouth, closing her eyes and savoring his undeniably masculine flavor. When he took his hand away, she lifted her lashes to find him staring</p><p>at her with a heady combination of tender love and unrepentant sexual hunger. \u201cGive me your wrists.\u201d</p><p>She complied and he knotted the end of a tie to one. Gently, he set her arm back on the bed, then ran his palm along the outside of her thigh. Her sex throbbed in response, and she shifted her legs in an attempt to provide some pressure to her aching clit. He gave her thigh a playful swat.</p> <p>\u201cNow, now, no cheating.\u201d He cupped the underside of her knee and drew her leg up. \u201cI want you open to me. I\u2019m going to enjoy that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her head back against the sheets and took deep breaths, trying to focus on anything but the unbearable ache between her legs. She\u2019d longed all these weeks for his touch, his whispered commands, the feel of his mouth on her and his arms around her. The tryst in the parking lot had only whetted her appetite. She didn\u2019t know how much longer she could take it. Maybe Melody\u2019s theory of spontaneous combustion due to sexual frustration had some merit.</p><p>\u201cKeep your arms where they are.\u201d He grabbed the other end of the tie attached to her wrist and looped the soft silk around her upper thigh, securing the two together. With one tug, the binding drew her thigh up toward her arm. He quickly trussed the other half of her body in the same manner, leaving her thighs spread wide for his perusal. Deliciously cool air licked at her damp skin as he climbed onto the bed and kneeled in front of her. A hot finger traced along the sensitive juncture between her leg and pelvis, and she shuddered from the subtle contact.</p><p>\u201cLook how swollen and wet you are for me, sugar. I bet you would come from the littlest bit of pressure on your clit, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her words coming out in a breathy rush. \u201cPlease, touch me.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head between her thighs and she tilted her hips, begging for his mouth. For agonizing seconds, he held his lips millimeters from her skin, breathing her in, his hot exhales dancing over the needy nerves. \u201cYou have permission to come, love. I plan to draw plenty more out of you before the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>He ran the flat of his tongue over her sex in one long, languid lick, and she nearly jumped out of her skin\u2014the sudden sensation overloading her desperate nerve endings. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her to inhale another breath. Bracing his hands on the backs of her thighs to keep her still, he brought his lips and tongue over her slick tissues and made love to her with his mouth. Licking, nibbling, and suckling in a sensual dance that had her screaming his name in orgasm long before he deemed it time to grant her mercy.</p><p>When he finally raised his head, her throat felt raw and her body trembled, but still she needed. Wanted. She tried to reach out for him, but the ties prevented it, and a frustrated whimper escaped. He brushed the dampened hair from her forehead, his gaze intense. \u201cReady for me, sugar?\u201d</p><p>She let out a relieved sigh. \u201cSo ready.\u201d</p><p>He pulled at the knots in the bindings, releasing her legs, then reached over to the bedside table to grab one of the condoms he had laid on top of it, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you need a minute?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, trying to fight past the scratchiness. \u201cNo condom. I\u2019m on the pill. I don\u2019t want anything between us.\u201d</p><p>His worried expression softened into one of heavy-lidded wanting, and he leaned down to kiss her, his lips still shiny with her own juices. She sucked his bottom lip into her mouth, eliciting a hoarse groan from him, and his body melted over hers. He smelled of soap and sex and Reid\u2014a heady opiate that made her drunk with desire. She wrapped her legs around his hips and twined her fingers in his hair, the simple pleasure of exploring his mouth and feeling his bare skin against hers a luxury.</p><p>Reid\u2019s large palms spanned her hips, gripping hard and positioning her, his controlled demeanor fraying in the heat of their kiss. She arched against him and the smooth head of his shaft nudged her opening. She spread her thighs wider, her body begging for him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need a written invitation. With a strangled groan, he thrust forward, his cock sliding to the hilt and filling her to delicious capacity. She sighed beneath him.</p><p>His forehead pressed against hers, his breathing labored as he held himself still inside her. \u201cHow do you expect me to maintain dominance when you completely unravel me, sugar?\u201d</p><p>She looked up through her lashes at him. \u201cFuck me into submission, sir?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled into a rapacious grin. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>He tangled his fingers in her hair and began to move, his eyes not leaving hers. He wasn\u2019t gentle or slow\u2014a fact for which she was eternally grateful. Instead, he drove into her with barely restrained violence. Fucking her. Marking her. Claiming her as his.</p><p>And driving her out of her ever-loving mind.</p><p>Her thighs tightened around his waist, and sweat glazed both their bodies. She wouldn\u2019t hold out long. The rising swell of sensation hovered at the edge of her perception, ready to engulf her. She dug her nails into his biceps and clung to the last vestiges of her control, trying to wait for his permission to let go. But just as she thought she would fall apart, he slid out of her, leaving her aching and half insane.</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but he halted her.</p><p>\u201cOn your hands and knees, Brynn. Now.\u201d</p><p>The steel in his tone went straight to her core, her arousal climbing higher than she thought possible. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>On shaking limbs, she rolled onto her belly and got into position.</p><p>He gave her a low hum of approval and ran a hand over her bottom, sending her thighs trembling in response. \u201cSpread your knees and tilt up for me. I want all of you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, knowing what he was going to do. A few weeks ago, the thought would have sent her into a spiral of terror. She\u2019d never given herself to anyone in that way. It had only been taken. Stolen.</p><p>But now she wanted nothing more than for Reid to have her there, to chase away every last hint of darkness within her and replace it with the shining light of their love. She had reclaimed her life and now she would reclaim her body. This gift was hers to give.</p><p>She widened her knees and opened herself to him. His palms slid along her waist, and he planted a kiss at the base of her spine. Then, his hand dipped in front of her, finding her swollen clit. She jerked, the simple touch sending sparks through her, and she pressed her forehead into the sheets. His voice soothed as his hand worked her. \u201cWhat do you want, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Her body rocked against his hand, needing more of him, all of him. Everywhere. Her words came out in short pants. \u201cTake me, Reid. All of me.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his chest draped over her back as he brushed her ear with his lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to go easy, but you need to tell me if anything is too much.\u201d</p><p>He shifted away from her for a moment and dug in the bedside drawer. His hot palms caressed her ass, easing any remaining nerves before he smoothed cool gel over the sensitive opening. She shivered, the chill of the lubricant and the sharp snap of pleasure from his touch a luscious combination.</p><p>\u201cYou look so fucking sexy all spread and waiting for me,\u201d he said as he eased a well-lubricated finger past the tight ring of muscle and his other hand continued to work her clit.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Her hands gripped the sheets, the intense sensation instantly pushing her closer to orgasm. \u201cThat\u2019s... oh, wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come yet, love,\u201d he said, gently pushing a second finger in, readying her. \u201cNot until I get a chance to bury myself inside this sweet little ass.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed beneath his pleasurable assault, using all of her strength not to give in to the seductive call of release. \u201cPlease, Reid. Now.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and shifted behind her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Sweat dripped down her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you do, just please, I need more. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Swiftly, he removed his fingers, and added more lubrication to her and then to himself. As his other hand stroked her pussy, he placed the tip of his cock against her snug opening. \u201cOkay, beautiful. Push out while I ease in. It will help.\u201d</p><p>She followed his directive, and the blunt head strained against the tight muscles. Oh, God. She wanted him inside her so badly, but her body seemed to be fighting against it.</p><p>\u201cRelax, sugar. Focus on letting me in.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she tried to relax the resistant muscles and pushed back against him. With a deep groan from him and a sharp cry from her, he slipped past the resistance and sent her into a dizzying space of sensual awareness. Every molecule of her existence seemed to light up with edgy pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Roni Loren</p><p>His leg muscles tensed and quivered against the backs of her thighs as he held himself still inside her. \u201cChrist, you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d she begged, rocking backward. \u201cI can\u2019t...

But language had stopped making sense. All that was left was overwhelming awareness and rocketing pleasure. Salty tears and sweat touched her lips, and her nails grappled for a grip on the mattress as she raced toward oblivion. A desperate plea scraped across her vocal cords. \u201cReid!\u201d</p><p>With a growl for her to come, Reid\u2019s pace turned urgent, and he sunk his teeth into the fleshy curve of her shoulder, putting his own brand over the one that monster had left. Her sensory system went into overload, and a scream that didn\u2019t even sound human rattled her throat. Her orgasm exploded behind her eyelids in a thousand bits of pulsing light.</p><p>Reid\u2019s voice joined the primal chorus as his own climax overtook him, releasing his liquid heat deep within her. Marking her as his.</p><p>Utterly and completely his.</p> <p>After the room turned quiet and their heartbeats slowed, Reid eased off the bed and lifted her boneless body into his arms. She knew she should probably say something. Thank you. I love you. You fucking rock. Something. But she was too drained to even part her lips. Instead, she just let her head rest against his good shoulder as he carried her in to the bathroom and set her on the bench in the shower.</p><p>He turned on the water and climbed in with her, letting the warm water soothe their abused senses. With quiet tenderness he soaped her, washed her hair, and wiped off her tear-streaked makeup. \u201cYou okay, sugar?\u201d</p><p>She mustered a lazy smile. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d He tugged on one of her wet locks.</p><p>She laced her fingers with his and kissed his soapy knuckles. \u201cNo, this is.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p> <p>Brynn found a parking spot across the street from the Jamison mansion and shut off the engine, her Honda as out of place in the neighborhood as she was. \u201cWell, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Reid smirked at her from the passenger seat. \u201cYeah, I noticed. What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d She took one last lingering look at the papers on her dashboard, still not believing the words, then climbed out of the car.</p><p>She removed her sunglasses and set them on top of her head, turning her attention to the estate. Not much had changed since she\u2019d visited ten years ago. It was still as breathtaking as she remembered.</p><p>And now it was hers\u2014well, half hers.</p><p>Patrick Jamison had never been a father to her and never would be. But what he did know how to do was throw money at situations to alleviate his guilt. When he\u2019d found out about what Roslyn and Davis had done, he\u2019d signed over the house to Brynn and Reid as an I\u2019m sorry and had taken off to his beach condo to escape the glare of the media. So now, here she was, part owner of a house that probably cost more than she\u2019d ever make in a lifetime of social work.</p><p>The plantation-style home didn\u2019t have the proverbial white-picket fence, but in all other respects, it was the kind of house Brynn had dreamed of growing up in. All her life, she\u2019d imagined that behind those manicured gardens laid equally manicured families. Families who ate dinner together, parents who loved each other and worked at normal jobs, kids who didn\u2019t have to wonder if their mother would make it home at night.</p><p>She\u2019d sworn to herself that one day, she\u2019d create one of those perfect families, create normalcy. Ensure happiness through putting all the right puzzle pieces in place. Now she had the house to do it in. But after the events of the last few weeks, she\u2019d realized it was all an illusion. There were no perfect families. No Leave-It-To-Beaver households. Behind the pretty columns and rosebushes of the Jamison house had lived a cheating husband and a cold-blooded killer. Deadly secrets covered with the shiny wrapping paper of wealth.</p> <p>She uncurled her fist and stared at the house key in her palm.</p><p>The dream she\u2019d sought all her life had been a false one. She could walk into that beautiful home, fill it with pretty things and find a polite husband who played by the rules. Meet lovely neighbors, attend their lovely parties, play with their lovely children. Be on the other side of envy for a change.</p><p>And be completely, out-of-her-mind miserable.</p><p>She tossed the key to Reid as he came around from the passenger side. \u201cWhat the hell are we going to do with this thing?\u201d</p><p>Reid chuckled. \u201cNot your style, huh?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the hood of the car, eyeballing the ridiculous garden statues. \u201cHardly. What about you? I know you\u2019re used to living the high life, Prince Jamison.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen enough of this house to last me a few lifetimes. And I don\u2019t want all this. I\u2019m a simple man with simple tastes.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Reid was a lot of things, but simple would never make the list. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d He stopped in front of her and placed his hands on the car, caging her in. \u201cAll I need in a home is a big-screen TV, comfortable furniture, and a beautiful woman\u2014preferably you, preferably naked\u2014to keep me company.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIs that right? So if I suggested we sell this gaudy thing and buy a house a third its size in a neighborhood without a gate, you\u2019d be cool with that?\u201d</p><p>He gave her lips a playful nip. \u201cHave we established if you\u2019re naked in said smaller house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re there, I\u2019m sold either way.\u201d He pushed off from the car and stepped back with a smile. \u201cPlus, think of all the money we\u2019ll have left over. We\u2019re going to be able to throw a killer party.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe should probably build the house before planning a housewarming party, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be celebrating a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would the party be for then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the most traditional guy ever, but I\u2019m not moving in with you until you make an honest man out of me.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe collar isn\u2019t enough for me, sugar.\u201d He dug in his jacket pocket and sank to one knee, sucking all the wind from her chest. \u201cI want it all with you. Marriage. Kids. Forever.\u201d</p><p>She blinked hard, trying to assure herself that the man before her was real.</p><p>He held out a small black box and flipped it open, revealing</p><p>a simple but stunning diamond ring. \u201cWill you have me, Brynn LeBreck?\u201d</p><p>She gripped the car behind her, her legs threatening to collapse beneath her, and tears filled her eyes. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, trying to find her voice. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head and kissed her hands. \u201cThank God, I\u2019d hate to have to cuff you and drag you down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the tears catching in her throat, and ran her fingers along the back of his neck. \u201cYou know, this is the first time I\u2019ve had you on your knees for me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, his blue eyes glittering in the afternoon sun, and gave her a soft smile. \u201cHaven\u2019t you figured it out yet? I\u2019ve always been on my knees for you, love.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
