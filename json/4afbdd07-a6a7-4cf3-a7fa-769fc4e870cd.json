He couldn\u2019t stand attending events where everyone drank too much, laughed too loud and tried far too hard to impress each other.</p><p>Derek knew he was what women considered a real catch. Hell, a stupid magazine had done a write up on Seattle\u2019s most eligible bachelors and placed his picture as number one. He\u2019d been furious and tried to have himself taken out of the article but his attorney had spouted some crap about freedom of speech. Since the article, he was being approached by even more materialistic females.</p><p>The magazine listed his net worth as equal to Bill Gates. They\u2019d also said he was tall, dark and handsome. He stood over six feet, with broad shoulders and muscles that rippled throughout his entire body. He hated gyms but he ran every morning and sometime in the evenings too. He\u2019d discovered at a young age running was a great form of relieving his stress.</p> <p>He knew the second best way to relieve stress was to take a woman to bed. The minute he was done with her, he walked away, though. There were many women who tried to get him to stay but no one held his interest longer than it took him to button up his pants.</p><p>After his heart had been shattered by Jasmine, he wasn\u2019t interested in any other woman. He figured once he got his revenge, he\u2019d think about settling down.</p><p>A woman breezed by him wearing entirely too much perfume and he snapped back to reality. He sighed as he grabbed a glass of wine from a passing waiter.</p><p>These parties were all about who had the most to offer. The women were on the prowl and the men were fishing. He wasn\u2019t interested. If he wanted a woman, he could have one at any time. He wasn\u2019t interested in superficial, wanna-be socialites.</p><p>He watched as a couple of ladies passed by, dripping in diamonds and low cut gowns. They were trying to catch his eye and normally he\u2019d make their day by flirting a little, giving them the impression they stood a chance but today wasn\u2019t that day. He had a raging headache and he was pissed he\u2019d been summoned.</p> <p>\u201cThere you are, boy. What are you doing hiding in the corner?\u201d Daniel Titan, his father, walked up and questioned him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering why I\u2019m here when I\u2019d rather be home with a scotch and my feet up,\u201d Derek replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because you received a request from your father. I have some things to discuss with you later,\u201d Daniel said in his no nonsense voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd it couldn\u2019t wait until later?\u201d Derek questioned.</p><p>\u201cOh live it up a little. You\u2019re always so busy adding a few more million to your bank account you don\u2019t stop to smell the roses,\u201d his father admonished him.</p><p>\u201cI live it up plenty, hell I was in Milan last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were in Milan on business, that doesn\u2019t count,\u201d his dad told him, a bit exasperated.</p><p>\u201cFor me, the ideal time is mixing business with pleasure,\u201d Derek told his father, with a waggle of his brows. Both men relaxed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Dad I do have a headache. What\u2019s so important it couldn\u2019t wait until morning?\u201d Derek asked. Once Derek had made his first million he\u2019d moved his father to the city and Daniel was the Chief Financial Officer of his huge corporation. His father was brilliant and had helped the company grow further. His dad may have had several hard times while Derek was growing up but he was essential to Derek\u2019s company now.</p><p>\u201cDavid Freeman\u2019s here tonight and he\u2019s talking to some people, trying to get investors,\u201d Daniel answered him. Derek was on instant alert. He searched the room, spotting his enemy. He was the one who\u2019d made him the cut throat business man he\u2019d turned into.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far too late for him. By tomorrow morning his company will be mine, no matter what he tries tonight,\u201d Derek said with a sneer.</p><p>As Derek watched David, a beautiful woman approached him, stepping up on her tip toes to kiss him on the cheek. David didn\u2019t even bother to turn and acknowledge her, which she didn\u2019t seem to notice. The man noticed nothing around him if it didn\u2019t have dollar signs on it, not even his stunning daughter. Derek\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits. He hadn\u2019t seen Jasmine for ten years and those years had been very good to her.</p><p>Her dress was skin tight on top, dipping low in both the front and back. Her curves were even more pronounced now that her body had matured. She had dark hair, which was swept up in a classic bun, with tendrils floating around her delicate face. Her dark brown eyes had once mesmerized him. They had a hypnotic quality, with their deceiving innocence shining through and the thick, dark lashes surrounding them.</p><p>He was angry at the tightening in his gut at just the sight of her. She\u2019d nearly destroyed him and yet he still wanted her. His full revenge included her though, so he\u2019d have her in his bed again and then she\u2019d be begging him not to leave.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. He won\u2019t make any progress tonight and tomorrow\u2019s a busy day for me. I appreciate you calling, though,\u201d Derek said. He then turned away and walked out of the room, without once looking behind him.</p><p>Jasmine spotted Derek across the room and her insides went up in flames. She narrowed her eyes in anger at the man as he walked around like he owned the place. She knew the kinder, gentler side of him but that boy was long gone. He may have never really existed beyond her imagination.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the boy who had taken her virginity and promised her forever. She thought back to that summer so many years ago. She\u2019d waited at the abandoned church all day hoping something had happened to make him run late. When the sun had faded from the sky she\u2019d finally had to admit he wasn\u2019t coming. It had all been lies.</p><p>She watched him now, as he turned and walked from the room. He was by far the sexiest man in the room, with his custom tuxedo and piercing blue eyes. He had a delectable body, even though he sat in an office all day. Her heart fluttered, remembering those long summer nights of running her hands and tongue down those hard muscles.</p><p>She had no idea her world was about to flip upside down. She was soon to learn the man she thought of as her hero, her father, wasn\u2019t who she really thought he was. This would truly be her last night of innocence. When morning came, nothing would ever be the same again.</p><p>As Derek disappeared around the corner, she couldn\u2019t help but think back to the summer ten years before. It had been a time when she\u2019d really believed in fairytales and magic.</p><p>She\u2019d grown up very wealthy in the small town outside of Seattle Washington. Her father owned a multi-million dollar company and she\u2019d always had more than most people could ever hope to.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen their home in the small town, she\u2019d thought so she could live in a nicer area. She\u2019d later learn he\u2019d really chosen to live there so he could be the big man on campus. He liked lording his wealth over all those around him but she didn\u2019t know any of that then. She\u2019d been young and na\u00efve. She\u2019d learn in the next few months how much her father had kept from her.</p><p>Her mother died during childbirth so she\u2019d never known her. Her father never remarried, though he dated a lot of women. None of them really acknowledged her presence so she didn\u2019t get attached to any of them. Sometimes, she thought it would be nice to have a woman help her pick out a dress or teach her how to do her hair. The staff was great and always spoiled her a bit, which irritated her father.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Derek in school from the time she was young but she really got to know him the summer before her senior year in high school. He\u2019d been from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks. His family was dirt poor but he was always determined to make a success out of his own life and turn things around. He ended up helping her with her math and soon they were inseparable. She\u2019d loved his hunger and motivation and the way he never talked down about anyone. She thought he was every one of her fairytales come to life.</p><p>She found she was spending every waking moment with him. When her father found out she was dating a boy from the poor side of town he\u2019d been furious and demanded her to end the relationship. It was the first time in her life her father told her she couldn\u2019t have something she wanted. It also was the first time she\u2019d defied him.</p><p>She\u2019d been stubborn, putting her foot down and continued to see Derek behind her father\u2019s back. She loved that he seemed to like her for her and not her money. He wouldn\u2019t let her spend money on him, ever. He worked hard for a construction company, which would frustrate her at times, because she wanted him to be with her and not at a job.</p><p>He\u2019d just laugh but always made it up to her on the weekend. That last weekend they\u2019d been together they snuck off and went camping in the woods. She\u2019d made love to him for the first time. It was the most magical experience she\u2019d ever had. He proposed marriage to her that night and she said yes. They were going to meet at the old abandoned church on the outside of town on Sunday and run away together. He\u2019d been saving all his money and was heading to the city to make something of himself.</p><p>She\u2019d gone home, after being gone all night and her father had been spitting he was so angry with her. She\u2019d told him she was of legal age and could do what she wanted. She told her father she loved Derek and she was going to marry him. Her father had seemed to accept her decision, because he\u2019d become eerily calm and kissed her on the cheek. That was a rare thing as he wasn\u2019t normally a man to openly show affection.</p><p>He said she was right and he was proud of her for making adult decisions. He then asked if he could help with anything. She\u2019d been so happy her dad accepted her decision she told him everything.</p><p>The next day she ended up being late to the church, because she had a few errands her dad had asked her to do for him. She knew she had the rest of her life with Derek so she could wait a couple of hours to run away with him. She knew he\u2019d wait for her. She was confident in their relationship.</p><p>She got to the church and was surprised he wasn\u2019t there but figured he\u2019d gotten busy like her. She waited and then waited some more. She sat there all afternoon until she finally accepted he wasn\u2019t coming as the sun started to set in the sky.</p><p>She\u2019d dragged herself home, crying the entire way. When she walked into the house and her father saw her, he\u2019d taken her into his arms and asked her what was wrong. She\u2019d cried against him and finally told him Derek hadn\u2019t shown up.</p><p>He continued to stroke her back and tell her everything was okay. He\u2019d explained to her he never trusted the boy and that\u2019s why he\u2019d been so overprotective. She never suspected her father had anything to do with Derek not arriving.</p><p>Derek left the hotel and was thinking back to that summer as well but his memories were far different from those of Jasmine\u2019s. He had so much bitterness about that day but if he really thought back to it that\u2019s what shaped him into the man he was now.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen head over heels for the girl. He\u2019d never thought he was worthy of dating someone as amazing as her but he was determined to make himself so. When he ended up helping her with her school work and found a connection together, he was unable to stay away from her.</p><p>He thought she was so different from the other kids who had money. Her family was the richest in town and her father reveled in that fact. He walked around in his custom made suits and drove his expensive cars. Hell, the man\u2019s house was a showpiece so all the people lower than him could worship at his doorstep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he and Jasmine made love for the first time and he\u2019d realized she\u2019d given him her most sacred gift, he was overwhelmed. He proposed right away and decided to run away with her, to do the right thing.</p><p>He planned on heading to the city and making something of himself so he could continue to give her all the things she was used to. He wanted to make sure she never went without anything. He wanted to place her on a throne and spoil her rotten. He\u2019d do or give her anything she wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d shown up at the church full of na\u00efve teenager dreams and one bag. When he heard approaching steps he\u2019d turned in anticipation. His heart sunk at the sight of her father. The man approached with a sympathetic smile plastered on his face.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m sorry but Jasmine asked me to come and speak with you,\u201d David had stated. Derek didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d send her father. \u201cJasmine said she couldn\u2019t face you but she didn\u2019t want to leave here. I have some cash here to help you on your way. She said you planned to go to the city and I want to help you get there,\u201d he said with that same smile on his face.</p> <p>Derek felt like his world was falling out underneath him. The man pulled out an envelope loaded with hundred dollar bills. He held it out towards Derek. David was trying to pay him off. It was as if he was saying, thanks for entertaining my daughter but your services are no longer needed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money,\u201d Derek spat at him. David continued holding the envelope out, like he couldn\u2019t believe the kid from the wrong side of town wouldn\u2019t jump at having that much cash.</p><p>\u201cJasmine was hoping this would appease your feelings and help you get on with your life,\u201d David had the gall to say.</p><p>\u201cTell Jasmine no thank you,\u201d Derek growled at him and then turned and walked away. He never looked back. He\u2019d been pissed when David had offered to pay him off but when he found out it was Jasmine\u2019s idea he saw red.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how wrong he\u2019d been about her. The thing that made him even angrier was the grief coursing through him at knowing he wouldn\u2019t see her again. As he walked back towards his childhood home he vowed someday he\u2019d have her begging him to take her back and then he\u2019d be the one to walk away.</p> <p>He\u2019d made his way home, told his father goodbye and then left for the city. He worked night and day until he purchased his first company. He was excellent at his job. He found companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy, bought them and divided them up, making huge sums of money. His first takeover had led to many, many more. He was now worth far more than Jasmine ever had been and he was about to exact his revenge.</p><p>He downed a scotch and then went to bed. His day was a full one tomorrow and he wanted to be well rested for what was to come. He\u2019d finally have Jasmine at his mercy, when her daddy no longer had any money left.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Derek sat back at his desk, with a huge Cheshire cat grin on his face. The papers were all signed and now he was the owner of The Freeman Corporation. He felt unbelievably good. He had taken it right out from under David, without the man even being aware of what was going on.</p><p>David knew his company was in trouble but he didn\u2019t know about the hostile take-over. Derek\u2019s victory felt so much better, knowing David had walked into his former offices today only to be met by Derek\u2019s security.</p><p>He\u2019d been tempted to be there, sitting in the man\u2019s chair, just so he could see his reaction. He\u2019d barely been able to stop himself but he had plenty of time to gloat. He turned around and stared out the huge windows of his office, looking down at the thriving city of Seattle. He always felt good when he acquired a new company but this one was different. This one was the pinnacle of everything he\u2019d been working for over the past ten years.</p> <p>Derek heard commotion outside his office and turned around to find the man in question had barged in through his doorway. Derek\u2019s secretary came chasing after him. \u201cSir, you can\u2019t go in there,\u201d she was trying to say, her voice and eyes panicked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Lana, I can handle this,\u201d he told her. She apologized and stood there, not knowing what to do. \u201cYou can call security, I have a feeling Mr. Freeman will need to be escorted from the building once we are done talking,\u201d he finished. The smile never left his face. This confrontation was coming far quicker than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cYou piece of crap!\u201d David yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, David,\u201d Derek said, never losing his cool.</p><p>\u201cI was getting things straightened out and then you swoop in and steal my company out from under me,\u201d the man continued to yell. He was so angry, his head was completely red and he could barely speak. The angrier David got, the calmer Derek felt.</p><p>\u201cI guess you should\u2019ve run your business a bit more above ground and not left it vulnerable to a takeover,\u201d Derek said. David looked like he wanted to jump across the room and strangle him. Derek looked over the man, who had seemed so much larger than life when he was still a teenager. The man now looked shrunken and old. It was satisfying.</p><p>\u201cI ran my business successfully, for over forty years, you pompous piece of trash. You may have the rest of the world fooled but I know where you come from and I know who you really are,\u201d David spat at him.</p><p>Derek was losing some of his calm. He narrowed his eyes on the man who had changed his life. He knew David was trying to get a reaction from him but he refused to bite.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike you, David, I kept a protective, watchful eye on my business. I may have started out on the wrong side of town, as you like to point out but I made choices to change my life and now you\u2019re the one who will have nothing,\u201d he said, with a mocking smile.</p><p>David actually lunged at him, as the security guards stepped into the room. Derek held his hand up, to stop them from grabbing the man. He wanted him to try and throw a punch. Derek was normally not a violent man but it would be his total joy to knock David across his pathetic jaw.</p><p>David saw the look in Derek\u2019s eyes and quickly backed down. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the last you\u2019ll hear from me,\u201d he said, still not leaving.</p><p>\u201cSecurity please escort Mr. Freeman from my building. Let the front desk know he\u2019s no longer welcome to step foot on the premises,\u201d he finished. He then turned his back on him, as if he didn\u2019t matter in the least to him.</p><p>\u201cI will get you back for this, just you wait,\u201d David yelled, as the men dragged him away. Derek continued to smile as he sat back down and once again looked over the papers that gave him ownership of the Freeman Corporation.</p><p>Derek pressed his buzzer, \u201cLana can you please pull up the full employee list for The Freeman Corporation and the financial documents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir, I will have the information to you within a few minutes,\u201d she replied, as efficient as always. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d been so lucky to find her but if she ever retired he\u2019d have a hell of a time replacing her.</p><p>She brought the information to him and he got to work. He hadn\u2019t done his normal homework when acquiring the corporation. He normally knew the business inside and out before he took it over. He simply hadn\u2019t cared with this one. He was buying it up no matter what. He didn\u2019t even care if the buy ended up costing him millions; he had the money to spare. This was about his pride and nothing more.</p><p>As he studied the papers over the afternoon, he was surprised to find there were some legitimate reasons to keep the company as it was, instead of splitting it up like he normally would do. If David had run things how he was supposed to, the corporation would\u2019ve never gone into jeopardy of being taken over. The man was more of an idiot than Derek had originally thought.</p><p>He\u2019d have to think about what he was going to do with this one. If he decided to leave it in tact, the first thing to go would be the name. Derek wouldn\u2019t leave that man\u2019s name attached to any aspect of the business.</p><p>The Corporation was a major producer of medical equipment. They actually made a quality product but had a horrible marketing department. If the right people were brought in, he may decide to keep the company together.</p><p>As he studied through the papers over the next several days, he discovered David had embezzled millions of dollars. That was one of the reasons the company was in such a weak state. He\u2019d leave the legal department to look further into it. He wouldn\u2019t mind if the man ended up in prison. It would just be icing on the cake.</p><p>The minute David had placed the corporation on the stock market; he had investors to be accountable too. Since David had been stealing from those investors for years, they were going to want answers. He smiled some more as he thought about David\u2019s life continuing to go down the drain.</p><p>He left all the staff at their jobs for now but had memos sent out notifying them they were going to have to defend their jobs. He normally left all of that to his staff but since this operation was personal to him he\u2019d be conducting many of those interviews, himself.</p><p>Derek had a couple of trusted associates coming with him and he was like a kid on Christmas morning. It was time to go to his new corporation and do some investigating. He\u2019d made the decision to keep the company as it was but there would be a lot of people losing their jobs and a lot of new hires. It would take months to get it all straightened out.</p><p>He was getting ready to leave, when his father walked into the office. \u201cWhere are you off to, son?\u201d his dad asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to the new company today. I have to eliminate some staff and get the HR set up to hire new employees,\u201d he answered as he headed towards the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, since I\u2019m a great judge of character,\u201d he said, as he climbed in the elevator with him.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. I could use an extra person I trust,\u201d Derek answered. He knew his father had a soft heart but he was also a shrewd business man and would know who could be trusted to stay on and who was far too loyal to David to be trusted.</p><p>\u201cSon, I know this has been your dream since that dirt bag hurt you but you need to remember most of these employees didn\u2019t even know David Freeman. They\u2019re just like you or I, trying to make a living,\u201d his father reasoned.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right, but I know. Most of the executive positions will be replaced. I simply can\u2019t trust people who worked closest with David. I\u2019m not worried about any of the factory workers. My staff will make sure all of their background checks pass but other than that I\u2019ll leave them alone, well not completely leave them alone,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d his dad asked, with confusion.</p><p>\u201cDavid was by far underpaying the factory workers, while padding the executives\u2019 pockets. They are barely making minimum wage,\u201d Derek said with anger. \u201cI\u2019m going to raise their pay and offer bonuses for high work production and early completion of projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so successful son, you actually care about the core of the company,\u201d his father praised him. Derek knew what it was like to barely be able to survive and didn\u2019t like that feeling. He always treated his employees\u2019 well. He had a very low turnover rate. Once people came to work for one of his corporations, they didn\u2019t leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe bastard didn\u2019t even offer health insurance for his factory workers. It really is no wonder he was losing everything,\u201d Derek continued to rage.</p><p>\u201cWell just remember these people are scared about their jobs and don\u2019t know you\u2019re different. It would be a really good idea if the first thing you do is call a meeting and reassure them,\u201d Daniel said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, again. I wasn\u2019t planning on doing that but I\u2019ll call a meeting first thing tomorrow. I want to spend today looking around and then eliminating some of the dead weight,\u201d Derek told him.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan, son,\u201d Daniel offered, as he slapped Derek on the back.</p> <p>They rode to the new office in silence. Derek was immensely satisfied to see the crew working on the new sign out front. The old one was down and the new sign was going up with his corporate name on it. Each time he saw that, his heart skipped a beat with pride.</p><p>He knew he had to take apart most of the corporations he bought up. He made far too much money not to split them apart, plus some of the companies were unfixable. He did love to keep the good ones together though, turning them back around. He could provide so many jobs for people and the feeling of success, as he fixed them, was what drove him.</p><p>Derek walked into the building, surrounded by his best team members and his father. He knew they made an intimidating sight and he enjoyed the looks on the staff members faces as they walked down the hallway.</p><p>They approached security. That had been the first change he\u2019d made. He always put in his own security team, immediately. He didn\u2019t want the previous owners stepping foot back in the buildings after he took them over.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Titan, it\u2019s good to see you,\u201d the guard greeted them.</p> <p>\u201cHello Tim, how are things going here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything has been mellow the last few days. Mr. Freeman tried to come in the day after the take-over but was escorted out and hasn\u2019t been back since,\u201d the man reported.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had new badges created and no one enters without one of them. All employees who are kept will receive their badge before they leave today. There will be a lot of people let go and I don\u2019t need them sneaking back in and causing trouble. I also want several security personnel up on the twenty-fifth floor to escort people down as they\u2019re let go. Today, unfortunately isn\u2019t going to be a pleasant one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem Mr. Titan, I will send them up right away,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your new badge and some for your men. Some workers will be in over the next few days setting up key pads for all the elevators and exits. Here\u2019s the list of men who will be here doing the work. These men and only these men are allowed in. If their company tries to send over replacements call me and I\u2019ll let you know if they\u2019re approved or not,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cOkay boss,\u201d Tim replied, then set to work making phone calls.</p> <p>Derek spent the first part of the morning exploring the huge building. The most time was spent down on the bottom floors, assessing the factory and its workers. They were eyeing him with trepidation and he knew his father was right; he needed to speak with them soon. The work was going slow and he noticed obvious mistakes being made. He knew a lot of that had to do with their lack of enthusiasm for underpaid work and part of it had to do with the fact they were so unsure of their futures.</p><p>He decided to call a meeting right away. It wasn\u2019t the employees\u2019 fault that the previous owner was a horrible man. Derek knew their attitudes would change, once they knew the changes he was making.</p><p>He spoke to his men, who went in search of the foreman on each floor. It only took about thirty minutes and he had all the factory workers assembled. He looked out at the massive crowd. There were about five-hundred faces looking up at him with fear. The job market was already terrible and all the people were in fear of joining the ranks of the unemployed.</p><p>He stood at the make-shift podium and grabbed the microphone. \u201cMy name is Derek Titan and I\u2019m the new owner of this corporation. First, I want to assure you all we\u2019re keeping this company open,\u201d he started. He heard several people release the breaths they were holding. He also saw many in the crowd visibly relax.</p><p>\u201cThere will be some changes made but I think you\u2019ll like what we have in mind. It will benefit every one of you. I\u2019ve looked through the financial records and you\u2019ve been woefully underpaid and not offered benefits. You\u2019ll receive a ten percent wage increase and offered health insurance. By the end of the day you\u2019ll receive paperwork showing the changes. You\u2019ll have to go through a background check to continue working here but you\u2019ll see things are going to be much better,\u201d he continued talking.</p><p>He was now seeing smiles in the audience and some with their mouths gaped open. He had to fight his own smile from spreading across his face. He needed to appear confident and in charge. He couldn\u2019t appear to be a friend. The boss had to be respected, not necessarily liked.</p><p>\u201cIf you work hard for me and meet production deadlines you'll be rewarded. I want to turn this company around, into what it should be. You make quality products here, so let\u2019s be a quality company as well. I want investors to walk through these stations and see happy employee\u2019s, doing an above quality job. The better you do, the more bonuses you'll get. We will be setting up some HR representatives down here in the offices and bringing each of you in over the next few days to sign paperwork. This is a new corporation and if you do choose to leave we'll offer you a severance package. If you have any questions, please wait until you\u2019re called in so we can move things along quickly,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cPlease return to work and your foremen will be calling you in over the next few days. I need all the supervisors to please meet me over here,\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>He explained what they'd be doing in more detail to the supervisors, then made his way up to the executive offices. There weren\u2019t many people around. He saw a few secretaries, who glanced wearily at him as he passed but not many others.</p><p>He walked up to David Freeman\u2019s old office and sighed with delight. As he stepped through the doorway, he felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. The furniture had already been replaced. He hadn\u2019t wanted to sit in the same seat or use the same desk as that man. He hadn\u2019t touched the other offices but this one would be his when he was working there and it needed to be comfortable.</p><p>He sat down in his chair and turned it toward the windows. The office wasn\u2019t as nice as the one back at his main office but it would do. He\u2019d already had a complete overhaul done on it so there was brand new cherry wood floors and expensive furniture. He had priceless pieces of art hung on the walls and a top of the line computer system. He liked surrounding himself with the finer things in life.</p><p>He enjoyed the view from the huge windows and his few minutes of peace, before he had to continue his day. It was going to be a very long one and he knew he\u2019d be lucky to get out of there before midnight. People were never happy to be fired and he had a lot of people to let go. He sighed, as he turned back to the computer and started looking through files.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jasmine walked into the familiar building, having to fight back her tears. There were men outside, working on placing a new sign. It was more proof the company no longer belonged to her father. She\u2019d been trying to reach him for days, to ask him what had happened. He hadn\u2019t even told her the company was in jeopardy of being taken over.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t answering his phone, or returning her calls. She\u2019d been to his place several times and was told he wasn\u2019t there. She tried again that morning but wasn\u2019t able to get past the gates and found a real estate sign on his front lawn.</p><p>Jasmine was trying to understand what was going on and why her father wouldn\u2019t speak to her. She knew the new owner of the company was scheduled to be there that day and she was determined to get some answers. She\u2019d worked so hard throughout the years and had some day hoped to own the company she cared so much about, but those dreams were now gone.</p><p>She would\u2019ve walked out the doors when the take-over had occurred but she didn\u2019t only have herself to think about. Her anger drained a little bit as she thought about her beautiful son. He looked so much like his father it made her heart ache sometimes with missing the man. She had to remind herself his father wasn\u2019t the same man he used to be.</p><p>She started to pass the security desk, when she was stopped. \u201cSorry Ms. Freeman but we have some new procedures now, can you step over here?\u201d the new guard said to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Tim?\u201d she asked, perplexed. She actually liked the man. In a stressful situation, he\u2019d been kind and helpful. He didn\u2019t try to bully people, like some of the old guards had done. She\u2019d came close to filing a sexual harassment case on the last head of security but her father had talked her out of it, saying it would look bad for the company. She\u2019d made sure to never be left alone in the building with the previous guard though because she hadn\u2019t trusted him.</p><p>\u201cWe have a new security system being implemented,\u201d he told her. He then looked through his computer screen until he found her name. He typed some things in the boxes and then handed her a new badge. \u201cThis is just a temporary one. The boss is doing a bunch of cuts and when everything is done, the remaining employee\u2019s will be issued permanent badges,\u201d he finished, looking sorry. She had a bad feeling she was one being let go. She had to suppress the tears one more time.</p><p>She got on the elevator and took a fortifying breath. If she was going down, she was certainly going to do it fighting, she thought with determination. This new boss sounded like a real piece of work.</p><p>She was currently the head of Personnel and loved her job. She loved working with people on a daily basis. She\u2019d hired most of the factory workers and was more scared for them than anyone else. She fought her father many times to give them better wages and benefits but he had treated her like a child telling her she didn\u2019t know how to successfully run a business.</p><p>That was a bit ironic now considering he\u2019d lost his business. Why wouldn\u2019t he talk to her and explain what was going on?</p><p>Jasmine walked into her office, to find several strangers there, looking through her computer and files. \u201cWhat is going on in here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d an extremely attractive blonde asked her in a snotty voice.</p><p>\u201cI happen to be the Human Resources director and this is my office. Who the heck are you?\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Amy and we're the current HR team, working on who will be staying or going. The president asked us to escort you to his offices immediately, once you returned,\u201d the snide woman said.</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure to see the man,\u201d Jasmine spat, as she turned on her heels. She\u2019d give the man a piece of her mind. It was rude to have people going through her stuff without consulting her first. She figured she was getting fired anyway, so she\u2019d say what she wanted to.</p><p>She knew the floor well and stormed towards her father\u2019s old office figuring the man would choose it for his own. After all, it was the largest in the building and the guy seemed to have some serious power control issues. Amy was running behind her, trying to catch up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stalked past the secretary, who gave a surprised expression, then looked confused. Jasmine didn\u2019t even bother knocking. She threw open the door and stalked towards the desk. The man was sitting with his back to her but she didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d hear her just fine.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell do you think you are, sending a bunch of strangers into my office to go through my files? I would\u2019ve been more than happy to show them anything they\u2019d asked for but the way you\u2019re running things is a complete invasion of privacy to both me and the employees,\u201d she shouted. She rarely raised her voice but she was so angry, she couldn\u2019t control herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Titan. She returned from lunch and then stalked out of the offices before I could stop her,\u201d Amy said a bit breathlessly. Jasmine\u2019s whole world seemed to come to a standstill as the woman said his name. He slowly turned in his chair and their eyes connected.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe, as she realized the man who had turned her world upside down again, was none other than her ex-lover. Her knees would no longer hold her up and she sank down into the chair, which was thankfully positioned behind her. They stared at one another as the seconds ticked by.</p> <p>\u201cThank you Amy, you can leave us now,\u201d was all he said, in his cold, controlled voice he had developed.</p><p>\u201cBut sir, you said you wanted one of us in here as you let people go...\u201d she began protesting.</p><p>\u201cI said leave,\u201d he told the woman. She looked at him with surprise and then glared at Jasmine, before heading out the door, which she slammed behind her. Jasmine could see the woman thought of Derek as more than her boss.</p><p>Jasmine wouldn\u2019t put it past him to be sleeping with his employee\u2019s. He was loaded now and apparently thought he could do anything he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you worked here. I guess I should have spent more time studying the personnel file,\u201d he finally said to her. He\u2019d figured the princess hadn\u2019t worked a day in her life. He was sure she didn\u2019t really work here either but more likely played at the office all day while collecting a huge paycheck. That was all over for her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d she asked him. She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d want to destroy her father. Derek had been the one to walk away, why would he possibly come back into her life in such a horrible way?</p><p>\u201cIt was a good deal,\u201d he answered her with his cold eyes. She felt her anger rising again at his dismissive attitude. He really was a cold hearted bastard. They sat, staring at one another. She refused to be the one to break the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat position do you hold here?\u201d he asked her with a smirk as if he couldn\u2019t imagine she\u2019d know how to work. His tone infuriated her even further.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the head of personnel and I do a great job at it,\u201d she said between clinched teeth. He didn\u2019t say anything as he pulled her file up on his computer. He sat there, going through the file for a full ten minutes, while she sat in the chair fuming.</p><p>\u201cYou have worked here for six years it seems. I\u2019m surprised you went to college,\u201d he said with a derisive look at her.</p><p>\u201cI graduated at the top of my class and I\u2019m excellent in my position. If you fire me, I will sue you for wrongful termination,\u201d she spit out at him.</p> <p>Derek smiled at her words. His initial thought was to fire her but the idea of being her boss seemed far more appealing to him. He\u2019d control her paycheck, which meant he controlled her life, because her dad wouldn\u2019t be able to bale her out, anymore. The man was bankrupt and just about as poor now as Derek had been as a child.</p><p>Derek looked through her file some more and was surprised by how low her salary was. If she\u2019d been working at the same position in his main company, he would\u2019ve been paying her almost double what she made here. Her father was a selfish man, even with his own daughter, it seemed. Derek didn\u2019t realize why that surprised him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll soon find I don\u2019t take well to being threatened, Ms. Freeman. I\u2019m not firing you today but you\u2019ll only remain on the staff for now on a trial basis. If you don\u2019t work to my far stricter standards then you\u2019ll be let go,\u201d he said as he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>She wanted to stand up and slap him across his smug face. She had never in her life been so angry. How could he look at her so coldly? How could he have turned into this cruel hearted man? She was so grateful she\u2019d never told him about her son, because she was sure he would\u2019ve tried to acquire him the same way he acquired his businesses.</p><p>\u201cI do my job very well. I will expect to be treated like any other employee here. I also don\u2019t want to speak with you anymore,\u201d she said as she stood up to leave. She needed to find a bathroom quickly, where she could break down in private.</p><p>Before she\u2019d taken more than a few steps he grabbed her arm and she was suddenly standing there, far too close to him. She cursed her traitorous body wanting to lean up against him. His smell was invading her senses, making the heat pool up in her core. No, no, no, she shouted at herself. She refused to let him affect her.</p><p>\u201cIt would be hard to treat you like any other employee since you\u2019re the only one here I\u2019ve sunk deep inside while you cried out my name,\u201d he whispered to her, bringing his lips only centimeters from her own. \u201cAnd I hate to tell you this but as head of personnel you\u2019ll be working very closely with me as we have a lot of jobs to replace over the next few weeks. If you can\u2019t handle the position please feel free to walk out now,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Derek was supposed to be getting to her but was angry by his own body\u2019s betrayal. The second he touched her arm lightening shot through his fingertips, straight to his groin. Her smell, which was so much more delicate than most women, surrounded him. He wanted to pull her into his arms and take her immediately on his new desk.</p> <p>He was trying to play with her and instead he was the one who was getting burned. If it weren\u2019t for her eyes widening in desire or the fact her breathing was getting shallow he would\u2019ve completely lost it. Seeing her desire for him was giving him back some strength. He\u2019d have her again but it would be on his terms and he\u2019d be the one to walk away, leaving her wanting more.</p><p>It took every ounce of his control but he stepped back and casually propped himself on the edge of his desk. It would look like she hadn\u2019t affected him at all. He was great at putting on masks.</p><p>She had her hands clenched at her sides as she got herself under control. His lips turned up at the corners in a mocking smile as he waited her out.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, what happened in the past is long over. I haven\u2019t thought about you since the last day we were together. Had you not brought it up, I would\u2019ve completely forgotten we even had sex,\u201d she lied to him. She got some pleasure as his smile was wiped off his face and his eyes narrowed at her.</p><p>\u201cSecondly, I can handle anything. If we need to work together I can stand being around you. I just prefer not to since you disgust me,\u201d she spat as she made her exit. She raced down the hallway and into the ladies room, where she emptied her lunch. She sat on the floor for several minutes as she regained her composure. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to be able to handle working for the man who\u2019d broken her heart so badly she\u2019d been afraid to get involved in other relationships.</p><p>She\u2019d try and work for him as long as she could, while she started searching for other work but she couldn\u2019t go without a paycheck. She had her son to think about. She gathered herself together and then walked proudly back into her old office. Amy looked up to glare at her. She glared right back. She had zero tolerance for the jealous woman.</p><p>\u201cIf you would please move, I need to get to my desk,\u201d she said, proud of the authority in her voice.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t fire you?\u201d Amy asked in shock, before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cHe has no reason to fire me, I\u2019m excellent at my job,\u201d Jasmine replied. Amy stalked out of the room, Jasmine assumed, to find out if she was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI need to gather a bunch of things together to go over with Mr. Titan, can I please have some privacy?\u201d she asked the people in the room, with steal in her voice. She may have been asking but if they refused to leave, then she\u2019d no longer ask, she\u2019d demand. This was still her office and she wanted it to herself.</p><p>The other two people left without a word. She was assuming they were running to the boss to find out if she could kick them out. She simply didn\u2019t care. She had nothing to hide but didn\u2019t feel she had to share her space with a bunch of strangers.</p><p>Derek sat back down at his desk after Jasmine departed. He was angry with her but far angrier with himself. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d let her get to him. The whole point of his revenge was to affect her, not the opposite way around.</p><p>He was incredibly pleased to find out she worked for the company. He\u2019d simply been planning on cutting off her cash supply by breaking her father. He would\u2019ve been to the offices sooner had he known she was an employee. He should\u2019ve done more research so he could\u2019ve been prepared to see her that afternoon. Things were going so much better than he had hoped. He\u2019d been expecting her to show up at his door, begging him to give her father some mercy.</p><p>Instead he had her working under him. That thought made his groin tighten once again. He really wanted her under him again. He wouldn\u2019t take her until he was more under control, though. The whole point was to teach her a lesson for walking out on him, not falling for her all over again.</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair in frustration at how easily she got to him. There was a knock at his door and then Amy walked in. He didn\u2019t like her personally but she was a shark when it came to business and a good addition to his staff.</p><p>She sauntered over to him, not quite able to control the fury in her eyes. \u201cI thought we were going to be discussing everyone in the executive office who was going to remain on staff or be let go,\u201d she said in her most seductive voice. It did nothing for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about Ms. Freeman,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMs. Freeman?\u201d she asked in surprise. \u201cIs she related to the previous owner?\u201d she finished, losing some of her normally cool composure.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s his daughter and I\u2019m letting her keep her position for now,\u201d he said in a voice that brooked no room for argument.</p><p>Amy stared at him, somewhat perplexed and more than a little angry. He could tell she was trying to figure out exactly what his and Jasmine\u2019s relationship was. He didn\u2019t have any desire to fill her in on his personal life. It was none of her business.</p><p>\u201cAre you keeping her as some sort of power strategy?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he answered nonchalantly. The answer seemed to satisfy her. She once again put on her seductive persona. He sighed, as he thought he was most likely going to have to let her go. She was getting far too confident and starting to push boundaries.</p><p>She sidled closer to him. \u201cDo you want to get some lunch, I\u2019m starving. Or I could order in and we could eat here while discussing some more strategies,\u201d she suggested as she sat on the edge of his desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Normally, he would\u2019ve been turned on by the sight of a sexy lady propped up on the edge of his desk, deliberately showing off her uncovered thighs. He\u2019d never been attracted to Amy, though. She wasn\u2019t his type, in the least. He liked a far less power hungry type of person in his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and the other\u2019s go out to lunch? I have a lot to get done before we start bringing people in. Besides, I will be going over some records with Ms. Freeman in a while,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed again at the mention of Jasmine, and cemented his decision of letting her go. He wasn\u2019t going to tolerate a jealous woman in his offices, especially when she had nothing to be jealous about.</p><p>There was another knock on the door and then his two most trusted employees stepped in, looking a bit frazzled. They weren\u2019t easily shaken, so he was concerned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked them.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Freeman basically kicked us out of her office and we weren\u2019t sure of what you wanted us to do so thought it smarter to talk to you than cause a scene,\u201d Greg said.</p><p>\u201cI see, well you did the right thing. Ms. Freeman and I will be talking but for now go have some lunch and we will get things worked out this afternoon,\u201d Derek said. He needed a break. It was always difficult when you had to fire people, especially when the takeover was a complete surprise to all those involved. He never enjoyed this part of his job. This company was his exception though and the ones who got fired were having it done because they deserved it.</p><p>The two men left before he could change his mind. Amy lingered for a moment and then followed them out the door. He called his head office and spoke to personnel there. He had them arrange a severance package for Amy and would have her employment ended before the day was out. Once she got back from lunch he\u2019d send her over there. He hated when things got messy. He had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to go quietly, which was too bad.</p><p>He ordered some food to be delivered and then walked over to Jasmine\u2019s office. He stood at her door and watched her for a while. She was engrossed in what she was doing and didn\u2019t notice him standing there for several minutes. When she finally looked up and their eyes collided it was like he was being punched in the gut again. He really hoped that went away soon.</p><p>\u201cHave you gathered together the files?\u201d he asked her, proud his voice carried the cold note to it that had made so many people tremble in their boots.</p> <p>\u201cYes, everything is together but it would be easier to do it here. There\u2019s a lot and it will take several trips to get it to your office,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI prefer my office. We have a large table we can lay everything out on, plus that\u2019s where we will be calling people in,\u201d he said, expecting her to cave to his wishes. She blew her breath out in frustration before standing up.</p><p>\u201cFine, we can do it your way but I\u2019m not breaking my back to lug all these boxes over there,\u201d she told him and then walked out the door with the stature of a queen, expecting her servants to follow behind her.</p><p>Before Derek could stop himself, he felt a smile tug across his features. She was definitely hot when she was angry and she\u2019d been angry since she had walked into his office. He was now looking forward to the incredibly drawn out afternoon.</p><p>Derek grabbed several of the security guards to transport the boxes to his office. By the time they got everything over, his lunch arrived. He ordered plenty of food and offered some to Jasmine, which she refused. He smiled at her stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cCan we please get started, I can\u2019t stay late tonight,\u201d she said to him.</p> <p>He was instantly irritated she was trying to assert her authority. He decided it was time to put her in her place. She was no longer the daughter of the boss. She needed to understand that quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou need to realize during a restructuring of a company this size there will be many nights of overtime. I expect you to put in the hours needed to make this place a success, if you expect to keep your job,\u201d he told her, with no room for mercy.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped and he was surprised to not feel joy at her defeat. He couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him. He wanted to destroy her, so why was his little victory not pounding through his veins?</p><p>She pulled out the first file and they went through it. He had two different piles on the table. There was a stack with records of the employees he was letting go, with no chance at keeping their jobs. The other was a stack of files where the employees would at least get the chance to interview with him. If he liked what they had to say, they\u2019d keep their positions. If the interview didn\u2019t go well they\u2019d be let go.</p><p>Amy and his men got back and he sent her to the main offices. She huffed as she went out the doors. He didn\u2019t miss the look she shot at Jasmine. It just reinforced his decision to let her go.</p><p>He sent his men into the conference room next door, with a handful so they could start calling in employees to be let go. He could hear the yelling through his walls as some of those employees, very vocally, expressed their outrage.</p><p>It was six in the evening when Jasmine looked up wearily. \u201cI really need to get home. I have something I have to do tonight,\u201d she said to him. His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits as he wondered what it was she had to get to. Was she late for a date? He knew it was none of his business but he\u2019d decided he wanted her again and he didn\u2019t want another man interfering.</p><p>\u201cWe can work on this more tomorrow. I can already see it will take us all week,\u201d he said to her. He was going to find an excuse to go to her place within the next couple of days to find out why she was in such a hurry to leave the office.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered, like it was choking her to say the kind words. She quickly left, needing to get far away as quickly as possible. Derek was exhausted himself and decided to call it a night.</p><p>He walked out of the building, which was pretty much empty, except for the security staff. He drove home, wanting the night to get over with so he could be with her again. He tried to convince himself it was for his revenge but the more time he spent with her the more the line faded.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jasmine rushed in the door of the school gym. She hadn\u2019t even had time to run home and change. Her son was in the fourth grade and very proud to be on the wrestling team. He had a match that started twenty minutes ago and she was praying she hadn\u2019t missed it. She hated missing any events in his life.</p><p>She ran through the doors and found where the kids were sitting. She walked over to him and wanted to give him a kiss but knew that would embarrass him in front of all his friends.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t miss you wresting, did I?\u201d she asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo Mom, I\u2019m up next,\u201d he said with a shrug. He was trying to act like it didn\u2019t matter but she could see the relief in his eyes she was there.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m sorry I got here so late but there was some extra work to be done at the office,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom,\u201d he told her in his far too understanding voice. He was such a good boy. She couldn\u2019t imagine her life without him in it. She walked over to the bleachers and sat down. When it was her son\u2019s turn to wrestle, she cheered him on and clapped the loudest in the crowd when he won.</p><p>He ran up to her and gave her a rare public hug afterwards, forgetting for a minute he was too old to give his mother public affection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d she exclaimed to her son.</p><p>\u201cThanks Mom, I have to go back over with the team now,\u201d he said, as he practically danced back over towards his teammates. She\u2019d love to go back to being a kid, carefree and excited so easily. Her stomach clenched as she thought about the excitement that rushed through her body when Derek had stood so close to her.</p><p>She pushed those thoughts out of her head. She was with her son now and wouldn\u2019t think of Derek. She had to put up with him in the office but he wasn\u2019t allowed to invade her private time. She sighed, as she realized how hard it was going to be to keep the man out of her thoughts when she had to work with him all day.</p><p>Age had been far too good to the man. His boyish muscles had matured and when he'd taken off his suit jacket, exposing his wide shoulders and large biceps, she had to fight drooling. She'd once known his body as intimately as she knew her own and she missed the feel of his hands on her. She hadn\u2019t had any man\u2019s hands on her in far too long.</p><p>Maybe it was time to start dating again. She\u2019d been asked out by Jacob\u2019s wrestling coach and put him off. Maybe she should just accept the invitation. She\u2019d think about it and not do something rash because her hormones were in an uproar.</p><p>The match ended shortly and she and Jacob headed to the car. \u201cHow would you like to go to dinner tonight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes! Can we have pizza?\u201d he pleaded with her. The kid could eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner if she let him.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect,\u201d she replied and headed to the local parlor. She gave him a bunch of quarters for video games and then sat watching him from the table. They soon ate and then headed home. Both were exhausted from their busy day and quickly went to bed.</p><p>The next morning, Jasmine rode the elevator up to her floor, trying to ignore the butterflies in her stomach. She was hoping Derek would have other things to do that day and not want to spend the entire time with her in the office again. She didn\u2019t know how many days in a row she could stand being with him all day long, before she exploded.</p><p>The man smelled far too good for a stuffy executive and when she was with him, she couldn\u2019t get the images of herself wrapped in his arms, out of her head. She had to remind herself not only had he walked away from her, after stealing her innocence but then he had come back to take over her father\u2019s company as well. He was heartless and she\u2019d be much better off remembering that.</p><p>She could in no way allow him to know about her son. He cared only for himself and anything he deemed his, he\u2019d take mercilessly.</p><p>She sat down at her desk and no more than five minutes later, her buzzer was ringing. She picked up, already knowing who was on the other line. \u201cWhen did you get in, I have been trying to get ahold of you for an hour,\u201d Derek\u2019s voice snapped over the line.</p><p>\u201cI got here a few minutes ago and I\u2019m twenty minutes early, as it is,\u201d she said with frustration.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, we need to go through the rest of the files,\u201d he commanded and then hung up.</p><p>She wearily got to her feet and walked to his office. The secretary wasn\u2019t even there and she had passed many empty offices along the way. He really was changing everything about the building. All those familiar faces were going to be gone. She didn\u2019t particularly like any of the people who were getting fired but it was still nice to have familiar faces around her. There was some comfort in it.</p><p>Jasmine walked in the door and Derek had to make sure his features remained void. She was stunning in her green skirt suit. It matched her eyes to perfection. She once again had her hair up in the unflattering bun, which he wanted to yank out, but her face was stunning. She wore hardly any make-up, being she was one of the few women who simply didn\u2019t need it.</p><p>She sat down at the table and he sat next to her. Her light scent drifted over to him and he could feel his pulse start to race and his pants start to get far too tight. He\u2019d have to take her far sooner than he planned just to get her out of his system. Then he could get his libido back to normal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew he was affecting her just as much as she was affecting him. He could see her chest rising faster as her breathing deepened. He could even see her pulse speed up through the delicate skin of her neck. He was going to test his limits of control that day.</p><p>He scooted far closer to her than was needed. He could see she wanted to move away but her stubborn attitude refused to allow her to show any weakness. Their shoulders were brushing together as he leaned in to look at the file she currently had opened in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo what have you been doing the last ten years?\u201d he asked her. For once in his life he had zero interest in the business in front of him that needed to be done.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business, it has nothing to do with my job,\u201d she snapped and tried to pull his attention back to the file. \u201cThis is Anthony, he works in accounting. I have spoken to him on a few occasions and even went to my father because it looked to me like he was into some unethical business practices but my father said it was fine. I would personally not trust him,\u201d she finished, as she pushed the folder closer to him.</p> <p>Bringing up her father was as good as throwing cold water in his face. His libido was put on hold as he took the file. He looked through the exceptionally detailed folder and then added the man to the fire pile. They continued to go through the files one by one and they mostly agreed on who deserved a chance to stay but every once in a while they came to an impasse.</p><p>She would argue for some person to stay but she\u2019d lose. Once he set his mind on something, it was difficult to change it.</p><p>She pulled forward another file and made her case for the man to stay employed. He looked through and decided to let him go. He tossed the file into the termination pile and she snatched it back out. \u201cI really think you need to interview Henry. He\u2019s a good man and does exceptional work. You don\u2019t even know him, so you can give him the courtesy of at least speaking with him, before you end his employment,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Derek raised his eyes at her outburst. She\u2019d argued for a few people but hadn\u2019t been so emphatic about it. He wondered who this Henry was and if he was possibly her reason for having to leave yesterday. He moved him over to the interview pile, just because he wanted to see who the competition was.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said although it came out through clenched teeth and didn\u2019t sound like a \u2018thank you\u2019 at all. It sounded more like she wanted to call him a few names.</p> <p>\u201cI need some lunch, let\u2019s go out,\u201d he said, suddenly needing to get out of the offices for a while.</p><p>\u201cI will eat in,\u201d she said, completely shutting him down. He didn\u2019t like to be refused, which she was better off learning now.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a business lunch so you\u2019ll accompany me,\u201d he demanded. He grabbed his jacket and walked to the door, holding it open for her to exit. If looks could kill, he would\u2019ve been melted right on the spot.</p><p>She jerkily got up and followed him out. He could practically see the steam rising from her ears. He was amused by her attitude and surprised by that amusement. He wasn\u2019t used to being so openly disobeyed but he liked that she was unafraid to challenge him.</p><p>He drove them to a diner he enjoyed several times a week. The staff knew him well and led them to a private table in the back of the restaurant. He liked the place for its privacy when he needed to talk to a client, or take a date out. He used it for many different purposes. He was a person that didn\u2019t mess with a good thing once he found it.</p><p>Jasmine narrowed her eyes further as she looked around at the intimate restaurant. It was the middle of the afternoon and there were candles burning on the tables. She glared some more at his back as she followed him to the table in the corner.</p> <p>If he really thought he was going to try to seduce her, he had another thing coming. The hostess sat them down and then asked what they would like to drink. He ordered an iced tea. Normally Jasmine didn\u2019t drink alcohol, especially in the middle of her work day but she had the feeling she was going to need a glass, if she was going to make it through the rest of the day without snapping at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a glass of red wine,\u201d she said with a smile. He raised his brows at her but didn\u2019t say anything. She was testing her limits. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019d fire her for having a glass of wine at a lunch he\u2019d forced her to accompany him on.</p><p>Their appetizers came out and Jasmine found she was starving. The food was excellent and it disappeared quickly. Derek chuckled as she looked at his plate. She always had enjoyed good foods, good wine and great sex. His groin tightened once again.</p><p>The rest of their meal came out and they ate comfortably. She let her defenses down and chatted with him as the wine loosened her tongue and the food sated her stomach.</p><p>She excused herself to go to the restroom and was adjusting her hair when Amy approached her from behind. The woman didn\u2019t look happy at all.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re getting very cozy with the boss,\u201d the woman snarled. Jasmine had no idea she\u2019d been fired. She just now realized she hadn\u2019t seen her in the offices all morning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business lunch, not that it\u2019s any of your business,\u201d Jasmine said and then made to go around her.</p><p>\u201cIt looked a lot cozier than a business lunch. I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable with him if I were you. He likes to add notches to his bed post but he gets bored quickly and then tosses you out even faster,\u201d Amy said with anger.</p> <p>Jasmine stared at her as she realized what the woman was saying. She was one of his cast offs. She was horrified to have her thoughts turned into reality.</p><p>\u201cI see the light is dawning. Yes, we\u2019ve been intimate a long time. I\u2019m actually expecting him to propose marriage at any moment but it seems he wants to sow some more oats before settling down,\u201d Amy said with a smug look on her face.</p><p>\u201cHow could you want to be with a man who won\u2019t be faithful to you?\u201d Amy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe can have his flings now, because once he puts that ring on my finger, he will be mine and will no longer have any desire to find whores,\u201d she said as if she really didn\u2019t care and then looked at Jasmine, implying she was one of those whores. She walked out of the bathroom, leaving Jasmine staring after her.</p><p>Jasmine took a few more minutes, before finally walking back to the table. Derek was looking at her with curiosity. She realized she\u2019d been gone for a while. She didn\u2019t say anything to him, she just gathered her jacket and started heading for the door. She didn\u2019t offer to cover her portion of lunch. He\u2019d insisted she come with him, so he could pay for the overpriced meal.</p><p>Derek paid for their lunch and then met her out at the front curb. He couldn\u2019t figure out what had changed from the time she\u2019d left the table, to the time she came back from the bathroom. She\u2019d been starting to relax around him before she\u2019d left.</p><p>He was actually glad she was back on guard. It was too easy to forget who she was when she was being charming.</p><p>They rode silently back to the office and the elevator was filled with tension as the numbers slowly crawled up to the top floor. He heard her actually let out a sigh of relief when the doors opened. She jumped out like the hounds of hell were after her. He enjoyed the sway of her hips as he followed her along the hallway to his office.</p><p>The room was unusually warm and his mouth started watering when she slipped her jacket off, revealing a silky tank style blouse. It dipped in the front, to show a small amount of cleavage, increasing his desire to see more. It hugged her generous curves and showed her small waist off to perfection. Without the suit jacket on, he could see the curve of her hips, which the skirt enhanced. She\u2019d grown curvier with age and now had a woman\u2019s body, instead of the slim figure of a teenager.</p><p>His mouth went dry, as he fought not to grab ahold of her and feel how those curves fit within his hands. Her breasts used to fit perfectly in his hands. He could tell now they would spill out of his palms. His pants were once again far too tight. He quickly sat down, so she wouldn\u2019t see his reaction to her.</p><p>She picked up another file, getting right back to work. \u201cI need a break from looking at those folders. Let\u2019s go ahead and do some interviews,\u201d he told her. \u201cMove over here to my desk and grab a notebook. I want you to jot some things down. We will start with your good friend, Henry,\u201d he said with a grimace. He wanted to interview the man and then throw him out on his butt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me, after all, you\u2019re the boss,\u201d she said with a bit too much sugar dripping from her tone. He narrowed his eyes as he looked her over. He didn\u2019t like being mocked; he was really tempted to show her a lesson or two about messing with him.</p><p>He called Henry and told him to report to the office immediately. Jasmine glared at him as he hung up. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to be so rude all of the time,\u201d she mumbled. He let it go because there was a knock at the door. The man was quick, maybe because he wasn\u2019t doing any work.</p><p>\u201cHello Mr. Titan, I\u2019m Henry Andrews,\u201d the man said, as he walked forward, with his hand out. Derek shook it and then narrowed his eyes. The man was in his late thirties and what women would consider good looking. His job was slipping through his fingers and the poor guy had no clue.</p><p>\u201cJasmine, I was wondering where you have been?\u201d he said when he spotted her. He walked over to her and kissed her on the cheek. Derek was starting to see red again. He could care less what the guy had to say, he was going to be fired. It took all his strength not to physically throw the man out and tell him never to step foot on the premises again. He had to do things correctly though, or his legal department would be all over him.</p><p>\u201cAs you know Henry, we\u2019re cutting many of the employees here. There\u2019s always a lot of turnover when a company is taken over. You have a few minutes to tell me what it is you do here and defend your job,\u201d Derek said in his coldest voice.</p><p>He could feel Jasmine glaring holes through him. He knew he was being even more cruel than normal but he instantly disliked the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat Derek meant to say is we\u2019re reviewing all the files of the employees and know you\u2019re a valuable member of the team. Can you talk about your work?\u201d she said, far nicer than he had.</p><p>Derek wanted to shout at her, that wasn\u2019t what I meant at all but then he\u2019d sound like a child throwing a tantrum. He sat down in his chair and pointed his cold eyes directly at Henry, who was either clueless to his aggression, or just pretending not to notice.</p><p>Henry started talking about his position in the Marketing department. He listed his projects and the various things he currently had in the works. He laid out things he had wanted to implement for months but had been ignored. Derek was getting in a worse mood, when he found that the man really knew what he was talking about and would actually make a strong asset to the company.</p><p>He placed his portfolio on the desk and Derek glanced through the organized notes. David had been holding Henry back and he figured the only reason Henry had stuck around was to be near Jasmine, because his talents were being wasted. As much as he wanted to throw the man out, he needed to have a cool head first.</p><p>He\u2019d never once let a woman get between him and the bottom line and Henry could definitely help add to the bottom line. He never showed the man any of the thoughts going through his mind but he stood up to thank him for coming in and then sent him away. \u201cWe will let you know our decision by tomorrow,\u201d he said, reverting to the corporation we, instead of I. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as Henry left the room, Jasmine turned on him. She stalked towards him and there was fire in her eyes. He was unbelievably aroused by the picture she made. \u201cHow dare you act like a horses ass, you pompous, corporate drone!\u201d she shouted at him.</p><p>She was less than a foot away, as she stared him down, with anger pouring off of her. He\u2019d seen her angry before but he expected steam to start coming out of her ears at any moment. His own anger was rising to the surface. How dare she talk to him like that?</p><p>He pressed the button down on his phone. \u201cI want zero interruptions into this room. I don\u2019t care if the place is on fire,\u201d he growled into the intercom.</p><p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d came the reply and then the connection went dead.</p> <p>He started stalking towards her. She seemed to realize her predicament, because she began to retreat fast. Her temper evaporated, as her eyes rounded. He must have looked a little more frightening than he thought but his cool had left and his anger was boiling over.</p><p>She was the one who left him because he was poor. She was the one who thought she was still miss high and mighty. She kept trying to rub in his face he\u2019d been replaced by her boyfriend. He couldn\u2019t even think, he was so mad.</p><p>He backed her up until her legs hit the table. She stood pressed up against the hard surface. There was no escape. Her breath quickened, making her breasts rise and fall faster against his chest. Her cheeks were flushed, her lips were swollen from her nervously chewing on them.</p><p>Her eyes were still rounded in fear. If it had only been fear, he may have been able to pull out of his anger but he also saw some excitement in their depths. She still wanted him but she was fighting herself, as much as she was fighting him. He needed her now!</p><p>He felt a low growl rumble from his throat. He closed the small gap between them, crushing his lips onto hers. He grabbed her neck to pull her closer, pushing his tongue against her lips, demanding entrance.</p> <p>She reached her hand up to push him away but instead she ended up gripping his shirt. She couldn\u2019t stop her own body\u2019s betrayal. She was on fire as his lips turned from almost abusive to seductive. He accessed her mouth and then tangled his tongue with hers.</p><p>She could feel the heat pooling in her core as he deepened the kiss and pulled her so close to him she didn\u2019t know where her body ended and his began. Her hands slipped up behind his neck and she found herself pulling him closer.</p><p>He groaned, as she tangled her tongue with his. She couldn\u2019t get close enough. She pressed her aching core against his arousal and was surprised to find out the groan she heard was her own voice.</p><p>He suddenly grabbed her hips and sat her on the table, moving so he could fit between her thighs. Her silky skirt slid out of the way and then he was pulling her forward. The table was the perfect height, so he fit against her in the most intimate way possible. He ground his erection against her core, needing the clothing to be out of the way.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think beyond anything but his need. He was hungry and only she could satisfy him. He broke the kiss long enough to trail his lips down her neck. He whisked the shirt off of her in seconds and then gasped in pleasure at the scrap of lace, which was barely covering her incredibly luscious breasts. They were spilling out of the material, begging for his touch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t disappoint her. He unlatched her bra and then cupped the glorious weight in his hands as he brought his head down to take her hardened, dusky pink nipple into his mouth. He sucked the pink bud deep inside his mouth and felt his erection jump as she groaned out her pleasure. The noises of ecstasy were quickly pushing him to completion. He couldn\u2019t think, hell he could barely stand there.</p> <p>He moved his head to lavish her other nipple and then brought his lips back up to hers, no longer being able to keep from kissing her. As he continued to kiss her with years of pent up passion he undid his pants and then ripped her scrap of panties away. She groaned as he pressed up against her moist opening.</p><p>He reached down with his hand to feel if she was ready for him. She was wet, hot and tight and he couldn\u2019t wait one second longer. He removed his hand and with one quick thrust, pushed himself deep within her core.</p><p>He groaned in complete ecstasy, as his shaft was gripped by her tight folds. He wasn\u2019t going to last long. He continued to kiss her, as he grabbed her hips and thrust deeply in and out. She was crying out in pleasure, as he pushed his long length deep inside her body. She was surrounding him with her tight heat and it was the most pleasurable thing he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>He\u2019d never had such intense or pleasurable sex in his life. She\u2019d been a girl before, she was all woman now. She yelled out and then he felt her tight heat start gripping him in convulsions. Her entire body started shaking and that was all it took to send him over the edge. He groaned as he shot his release deep inside her.</p><p>His body continued shaking as he kept them connected until the very last spasm ran through their bodies. He reluctantly pulled back and then stared down at her. She was flushed, sitting there on the table, with her beautiful breasts exposed and her mouth swollen from his kisses.</p><p>Her normally perfect hair was pulled free of the bun and with her flushed cheeks, she was the most gorgeous creature he\u2019d ever seen before. She looked like she\u2019d just been devoured, which made him want to start all over again.</p><p>He was getting ready to kiss her, already feeling at a loss without her touch. Her expression changed from one of complete satisfaction, to horror at what she\u2019d done. He knew the moment was over and now was the time for consequences.</p><p>She reached her hand up and slapped him hard across the face before he knew what was happening. He was shocked from the sting of it. He brought his hand up to his cheek, feeling the heat. He smiled a bit at the strength she\u2019d exhibited. He\u2019d never had a woman give that reaction after sex. They were usually purring with their content. He knew he was a great lover.</p> <p>He quickly took a step back, because smiling had been the wrong thing to do. She was furious. \u201cSorry about that Jasmine but you can\u2019t blame the whole thing on me, you didn\u2019t say anything to stop me,\u201d he said to her, with his normally cocky voice back in play.</p><p>He was feeling anything but calm but there was no way he\u2019d show that. If he thought one time was going to be enough to wash her from his system, he\u2019d been very wrong. It would take being with her for a while before he was able to finally let her go. Just the thought of entering her tight heat again was raising his blood pressure, among other things.</p><p>Jasmine glared at him and then gathered up her clothing. She looked down at her torn panties with horror and then walked into his private bathroom and shut the door with a resounding click. She didn\u2019t slam it in a fit of rage as so many women would\u2019ve done. The click seemed to make much more of a statement. She didn\u2019t reappear for a while. Derek was grateful for the time to gather himself together.</p><p>When Jasmine finally came out of the bathroom, her face was a mask. No one would be able to tell she\u2019d just come apart in his arms. She was almost as good as him at wearing a mask.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said to him, in the most professional voice she could muster. He looked at her words as a challenge and he never had been able to resist a challenge.</p><p>He said nothing to her. He was surprised she didn\u2019t go stomping out of the office like so many women would\u2019ve done, cursing him, or trying to yell sexual harassment. He was impressed. She sat down at the table and started going through the files again.</p><p>He called the secretary and had some drinks brought in and then had her leave the door open. He didn\u2019t trust himself to be all alone, locked up in the office with her for the rest of the afternoon. He was having a hell of a time knowing she was right there, with nothing on underneath that skirt to keep him from touching her again.</p><p>They spent the rest of the day calling people into the office for interviews. He wasn\u2019t real pleased to find she was correct about most of the people who came in. Those she\u2019d fought to save were smart and knew how to do their jobs. The only one he was really struggling with letting go was Henry.</p><p>At five on the dot Henry poked his head in the door. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to interrupt but I forgot to tell you Gina wanted to invite you over this weekend for some candle party thing she\u2019s throwing,\u201d he said to Jasmine. She laughed her first real laugh since Derek had stepped back into her life.</p><p>\u201cTell her I would love to come. Can I bring anything?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe also told me to tell you not to bring a thing. She made sure I enforced that since you always go out of your way to make your own parties amazing. She said it\u2019s her turn to pamper you a bit,\u201d he added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay I get it, tell her I can\u2019t wait and I\u2019ll see you both this weekend,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cNo way am I staying with all you ladies. No offense but I\u2019m taking off for the day with the guys to do some shooting,\u201d he said. He then turned and left the room. Derek felt a little bit stupid of his jealousy now, considering the guy was obviously married.</p><p>At least he wouldn\u2019t have to fire him. He thought he may even wrangle an invitation to go shooting with them, just so he could swing by the house and check up on Jasmine. She stood up and gathered her Jacket.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t done yet,\u201d he said automatically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done. I have something to do tonight. It\u2019s my normal quitting time and all the other employees are leaving. There\u2019s nothing that will not hold over until tomorrow. Fire me if you want, I don\u2019t even care anymore,\u201d she said with defiance. She didn\u2019t wait for his response; she just marched out of the room.</p><p>He sat there, a little stunned and a little turned on. He wasn\u2019t used to being defied, ever. He was both impressed and irritated. He wasn\u2019t sure which emotion was stronger. He decided to call it a day and gathered his stuff to head out.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he reached his vehicle he realized he hadn\u2019t used protection. He couldn\u2019t believe how stupid that had been. He never forgot to use protection, it was just one of those rules he was emphatic about. He was sure he had nothing to worry about but he\u2019d keep an eye on her over the next few months. He guessed her job was safe for at least that long.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Derek got home and found his cousin sitting in his den with a drink in his hand and a smile on his face. He was immensely pleased to see the man. They were closer than any brothers could possibly be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to talk to the doorman again about keeping the riff raff out of here,\u201d Derek said, not meaning one word of it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean, it seems like they will let any old bum in off the street nowadays. There\u2019s no more home security,\u201d Drew replied.</p><p>\u201cAt least we agree,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Cuz?\u201d Drew asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great Drew, and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell since I found your hundred year old scotch, I\u2019m feeling pretty good,\u201d Drew said, with an impish smile on his face as he held up the expensive bottle, which had considerably less liquid in it.</p><p>\u201cOkay if you\u2019re going to drink my best stuff, then the least you can do is pour me a glass,\u201d Derek said, as he shed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem. How\u2019s the corporate take-over world treating you?\u201d Drew asked, as he handed him the glass.</p><p>\u201cI finally got my company,\u201d Derek said with a genuine smile. He didn\u2019t have to explain what that company was. Drew had grown up with him. He\u2019d been there when Jasmine left him and he\u2019d been there by his side as he plotted his revenge.</p><p>Drew was from the same area he was and had been just as determined to get out. It had always been him, Drew and their other cousin Ryan. Their fathers were all brothers so they shared the same last name. Ryan\u2019s parents had died in a horrible auto accident when he was ten years old and he\u2019d moved in with Drew, next door to Derek. The three boys had been inseparable.</p><p>They\u2019d all left at twenty years old and made successes of their lives. They stayed in touch, as much as their work would allow and sometimes Derek really hated the distance that divided them.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s beyond great Derek, how did it all happen?\u201d Drew asked with genuine interest.</p><p>\u201cDavid was a very poor business man and all I had to do was bide my time and wait him out. He finally made one too many mistakes, leaving the doors wide open for me to come in and take over. It has felt great but I thought I would somehow feel more, like some completion or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just growing up and getting revenge isn\u2019t as important as it once used to be for you. What are you going to do with this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to keep it intact. The product is actually top quality and there are over five hundred factory employees who would lose their jobs if I divided it up. I think they will do a spectacular job once they are getting paid what they really should,\u201d Derek answered.</p><p>\u201cTurning soft hearted on me, huh? What happened to my cold hearted snake-of-a-cousin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess like you said, I\u2019ve grown up and can think beyond myself once in a while,\u201d Derek said, a bit uncomfortable with the praise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell your secrets to the world. They can all think you're still a jackal,\u201d he said and then punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cOkay enough about me, it\u2019s been too long since we last talked, tell me what you\u2019ve been up to,\u201d Derek demanded.</p><p>\u201cI just got back from Spain. We opened up another resort. You have got to come stay there, she\u2019s a beauty,\u201d Drew said. He pulled out a folder and Derek looked through the pictures. It was certainly an impressive resort, with all the bells and whistles.</p><p>\u201cIt has three Olympic sized pools, a full use spa, a couple top of the line workout rooms and so much more. It\u2019s a ladies paradise and a man\u2019s dream. I should get an award for this place,\u201d Drew said enthusiastically.</p><p>Derek decided he\u2019d take a vacation there, once he finished with the employee situation. He\u2019d seen the beginning phases of this new resort and hadn\u2019t realized it had been so long since he\u2019d spoken to his cousin.</p> <p>Derek was used to staying in some nice spots but for the last five years he stayed at his cousin\u2019s places whenever he could. He liked to review the service for Drew, since he wasn\u2019t able to be in every place at once but he genuinely liked the resorts as well. They were top of the line and he got better service than he would at any regular hotel.</p><p>He\u2019d been able to stay at them without them knowing who he was at first and get an honest review to his cousin but his name was just too big now and the employee\u2019s knew him the moment he walked through the doors. It didn\u2019t matter, the service was exceptional, whether they knew who he was or not.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my favorite one, so far. You know, it\u2019s a hard life traveling to all these exotic places,\u201d Drew sighed. He couldn\u2019t contain the huge grin that split his face apart. The boys had never been out of the state of Washington until they hit their twenties, so the massive amount of travel they did now was almost incomprehensible.</p><p>\u201cI seriously need to allow myself more vacations. Now that I\u2019ve acquired Freeman Industries I can slow down a bit,\u201d Derek said. He was only thirty years old but had experienced so much in his life he felt far older.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I see a few gray hairs in there,\u201d Drew goaded him.</p><p>\u201cI may be a few months older than you but I can still kick your ass,\u201d Derek said not meaning a word off it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really scared. Let\u2019s get out of here. I need a greasy burger and a beer. This scotch is okay but sometimes a cold bottle of bud is the only thing that hits the spot,\u201d he said, before he emptied his glass.</p><p>\u201cSounds great to me, Drew. Work has been stressful. It will be nice to go to a grease joint,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>Derek quickly ran up the stairs and changed into some jeans and a t-shirt. He slapped on his favorite, worn baseball cap. He smiled as he looked in the mirror. The people he dealt with in the corporate world wouldn\u2019t even recognize him in his off time clothing. He liked it that way. It reminded him of his roots.</p><p>Luckily, he never ran into any of them in his favorite grease joint, which happened to be a country music bar that played some of the best undiscovered talent around. He\u2019d even helped a few of the bands, without their knowledge, by sending in their music to some of his connections.</p><p>The boys jumped into Drew\u2019s big Ford Pick-up truck and headed out. The bar was about an hour\u2019s drive, when there wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic. During rush hour it could take several hours. Luckily the traffic wasn\u2019t bad and they were sitting at a table in no time at all.</p><p>They each ordered burgers, fries and beer, then sat back to listen to the band play. This was one of the few places he knew of that played live music, seven days a week and it was always good.</p><p>He felt himself relaxing. He managed to push his stress away and enjoy the conversation with his cousin. The day was turning out to be one of the best he\u2019d had in too long to remember.</p><p>He was sitting back, digesting his food and sipping on his beer, when his cousin interrupted his semi-comatose state.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Jasmine yet?\u201d Drew asked. Derek started chocking on the sip of beer he\u2019d just taken. Drew pounded his back, while he struggled to get his breath back. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a yes,\u201d Drew surmised.</p><p>\u201cShe works for the corporation,\u201d Derek finally managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, how\u2019s that working out? Have you fired her yet?\u201d he asked. Drew knew Derek wanted revenge from the girl who\u2019d broken his heart.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t fired her yet. I want her to regret her decision of throwing me out, before I toss her on her butt,\u201d he said. The thought of tossing her out was less and less appealing to him. His cousin raised his brows, as he studied Derek.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Drew said, as he pasted a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Derek demanded to know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re falling for the girl again, instead of the other way around,\u201d Drew goaded him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Derek snapped. He was angry, more with himself than Drew, because he thought there may be some truth to his words.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s been ten years and people can change,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget what she did to me,\u201d Derek said to both Drew and himself.</p><p>\u201cAll joking aside, you\u2019re a smart guy. Go with your gut and you\u2019ll know what to do,\u201d Drew told him. One of the reasons Derek loved Drew so much was because even though the world saw him as one big playboy who couldn\u2019t take anything seriously he was actually highly intelligent and the most caring man he knew. He liked to project an image of himself as the carefree guy but both Derek and Ryan knew better. They were allowed to see a side of Drew no one else got to. \u201cBesides, Cuz, I always thought Jasmine was a real catch and the two of you were meant to be together. Maybe fate is stepping in for the two of you, finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay enough of this emotional crap. Let\u2019s get out of here, head back to my place and drink way too much,\u201d Derek said. Drew agreed with him. They paid the bill, leaving the waitress a very generous tip and then headed out to the truck for the long drive back.</p><p>If people could see the cousins in their off time, they\u2019d have no idea how much they were worth. They liked to wear old clothes, which were about comfort verses style and they liked the dive bars far more than the five star restaurants. They\u2019d vowed to never forget where they came from and in ten years-time they had been true to that vow.</p><p>Derek quickly mellowed out as they made the commute home. He knew his cousin meant well and wasn\u2019t trying to get a reaction but it made him think too much about what his intentions really were towards Jasmine. She was the one that got away and he hoped he was strong enough this time around to not let her break him.</p><p>He knew he was certainly more mature but he seemed to revert right back to his childhood when he looked into those sea green eyes of hers. She had a way of knocking his feet right out from under him. He\u2019d harden himself back up by the time he returned to the office.</p><p>Hell, for that matter, he was only needed there for a few more days, before he could be sure the operation would be overseen by his competent staff. He could monitor the company from his main office and not have to see Jasmine much. That didn\u2019t sound appealing. Damn, he was going to have to put some distance between them.</p><p>He decided he\u2019d do that once he got her out of his system for the last time. He needed to take her to bed a couple more times and then he\u2019d lose interest. He always lost interest once the chase was over.</p><p>He smiled to himself thinking he\u2019d figured the whole thing out. He wasn\u2019t in love with her still; he was just enjoying the chase.</p><p>Jasmine arrived at the school just in time to pick up Jacob. He came running down the hallway and gave her a big hug. She loved the rare moments when he let himself go and allowed her to hold him.</p><p>\u201cHow was your practice?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt was really cool, I pinned Timmy in like three seconds,\u201d he muttered excitedly.</p><p>\u201cGood job, Little Man. Did you get up and give him a handshake afterwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Mom,\u201d he said with a roll of his eyes. She loved that she\u2019d taught her son well enough that being polite was second nature to him. She hated when men, or women for that matter, gloated their victories. She\u2019d taught her son having good sportsmanship was just as important as winning the game.</p><p>A few of his coaches had told her how impressed they were with him. They\u2019d told her he was unusually respectful of his teammates and his coaches. She\u2019d beamed with pride. She was a typical mother and thought her child could do no wrong but when someone confirmed that she floated on a cloud.</p><p>\u201cTimmy asked if I could stay the night on Friday, he has a birthday party and they\u2019re going to Skate World,\u201d he asked her, with excitement pouring out of him.</p><p>\u201cI will talk to Timmy\u2019s mom and make sure it\u2019s okay but I don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom, you\u2019re the best,\u201d he said with one of his smiles that transformed his face into looking so much like his father, actually hurting her gut. The older Jacob got, the more he looked like Derek. She prayed they never met, because the resemblance was far too great to be passed aside as a coincidence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It really didn\u2019t help that Jacob liked his hair cut a certain way now, which was almost the mirror image of Derek\u2019s hair-cut. She shook off her thoughts and ruffled her son\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stepped outside and Jacob\u2019s coach approached them. \u201cHow are you doing, Jasmine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. And how are you, Chuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing great. Jacob forgot to grab one of these fliers. We have a tournament on Saturday starting at two,\u201d he said, as he handed her a piece of paper.</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds like fun. Is there anything I can bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always know I can count on you,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cWould it be too much to ask you to bring a main course for lunch? I have some people bringing drinks and fruit but no one signed up for a main course. You can do sandwiches if you want but I know you like to get all fancy,\u201d he said, with a flirty smile.</p><p>She was well known for her creative dishes and that\u2019s most likely why no one else had signed up for the spot.</p><p>\u201cYou know me well,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cOf course, I will make something good. I have to make sure these boys get plenty of nourishment.\u201d She could see he was trying to work up the courage to ask her out again and after her afternoon with Derek she had no desire for that date. She made her excuses and hurried off.</p><p>She really liked Chuck. He was a phenomenal coach but she wasn\u2019t attracted to him. It was really too bad because he was such a great guy. She may have to get over herself and go on the date.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re going to have a very busy weekend,\u201d she said to Jacob as they drove toward home.</p><p>\u201cI know. I can\u2019t wait for the party. Trevor said he was having an ice cream cake,\u201d Jacob said, practically bouncing in his seat.</p><p>\u201cJust remember you\u2019re wrestling the next day so if you eat too much junk food you\u2019ll get sick at your meet and throw up all over your opponents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be so cool,\u201d he exclaimed. Jasmine shook her head, really not understanding boys sometimes. She realized she had to let some things go.</p><p>\u201cOkay, remember I warned you when you\u2019re feeling sick come Saturday morning,\u201d she said with her mom\u2019s knowing grin. Jacob rolled his eyes but remained silent.</p><p>They arrived home and she made them both a good dinner and then tossed him a ball in the back yard. She loved when the weather cooperated and she could spend time outdoors with her son. Even though Seattle was a terrific city, sometimes the rain was a bit much.</p> <p>She needed to save up some funds and take Jacob on a vacation in the winter, to get away from the dark skies. It got to be too much at times and she\u2019d find herself starting to get slightly depressed. That wasn\u2019t fair to Jacob or her.</p><p>She tossed the ball with him until they couldn\u2019t see anymore and then finally headed in so he could take a shower and get ready for bed. She was dreading going into the office the next day but she\u2019d do with her head held high.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Jasmine walked through those doors once again and slowly made her way toward the elevator. She considered taking the stairs, just to delay the inevitable but she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to breathe by the time she hit the twenty-fifth floor.</p><p>At least it was Friday. She could make it through one more day. The last couple had been filled with unbelievable sexual tension, for her at least. She didn\u2019t think Derek had thought about their time on his table since he\u2019d pulled up his pants. He barely even looked at her. She was trying to convince herself that was a good thing.</p><p>She lectured herself all the way to the top of the building. She could get through one more day. They were down to their last few files and then he\u2019d most likely return to the head office and she could relax.</p><p>The bell on the elevator rang, which made her jump. The door\u2019s opened and she walked out like she was on the green mile, walking her final steps to the execution room. She didn\u2019t even bother going into her office. She knew the second she sat down, Derek would buzz her and demand she get to his office.</p><p>The strap of her bag slipped down her shoulder and her hands were full of coffee, so she could do nothing about it. She stepped into Derek\u2019s office and sighed. Of course he was there, ahead of her. The man never slept late, or showed up even two minutes past seven in the morning.</p> <p>She was used to being the first one to work but it was impossible with him around. She couldn\u2019t leave any earlier, since she had to get her son sent off to school. She set the extra coffee cup down in front of him and then took her place in front of the much smaller pile of personnel folders.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek muttered, as he grabbed the cup, without so much as looking up. She had only brought him one, because the other day she\u2019d come in with a large Carmel macchiato and he\u2019d thrown down a fifty and told her to bring him one too, since she was stopping anyway.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t bothered to ask her if it would be inconvenient, hadn\u2019t bothered to ask period, he had just assumed she\u2019d do it for him. It hadn\u2019t been a battle worth fighting, so she just picked him up the coffee. It wasn\u2019t like she had to go out of her way. Besides, he was now paying for hers too and the morning boosts weren\u2019t cheap.</p><p>She seriously would live off the coffees and nothing else, if she could get away with it. She had done that a couple different days and by the end, she was shaking all over but her house had gotten incredibly clean.</p><p>\u201cWe have a couple more interviews to do today, with the last of the previous employee\u2019s. I want you to go through the applications that have come in over the week and weed through them. Find the best candidates and schedule them for next week to come in for interviews. We need to get those positions filled as soon as possible,\u201d Derek said, as he finally looked up.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, when he looked up, she was busy staring at his body in inappropriate places. His brows rose and she couldn\u2019t stop the deep flush that stained her cheeks. She turned away from him, praying he\u2019d just pretend it hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>She needed to get out of his office, because every time she looked at the table, she pictured herself sitting there with him between her thighs. She nodded her head and then pretended to be engrossed with the file in front of her.</p><p>Derek could feel himself tightening the second Jasmine walked into the room. No matter how subtle her scent was, he could pick it out, even if she was in a room surrounded by over scented socialites. He\u2019d grown to crave her scent and wanted to bury his head in her shoulder and just draw the smell of her in. He wanted to bury himself in many other areas of her body as well.</p><p>When he looked up to see her eyes on the very body part he wanted to sink into her It took all of his many years of tightly reined in control not to grab her and have a repeat performance like the one earlier in the week. He found himself actually gripping the desk to keep from walking to her.</p><p>They called in the last four employees and only kept one of them on. The last interview wasn\u2019t going well. \u201cI appreciate your years of service with the former Freeman Corporation but Titan industries has a different vision of the future and I don\u2019t think we will make a good fit together,\u201d Derek said, calmly and professionally.</p><p>\u201cYou sorry bastard, you come in here with your corporate take-over and replace most of the people without even blinking. You\u2019ll get what is coming to you,\u201d the man shouted. He was so angry, there was spit flying out of his mouth. He stood up like he was going to come over and deck Derek. Derek stood up to his full height and narrowed his gaze at the man.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re nice and cozy with the enemy, Jasmine. Your father would be so disappointed in you but that\u2019s nothing new, he\u2019s always been disappointed. He only allowed you to keep the job here because he was too embarrassed to have you out in the work force, sullying his good name. You have never done anything right. He\u2019s complained many times about you and your bastard son,\u201d the man continued shouting.</p><p>The second he turned on Jasmine, Derek lost his cool. He was going to deck the man and damn the consequences. He was walking over to do just that when the guy spoke his last line. Derek\u2019s head whipped towards Jasmine with shock, as he realized she had a son. He had no idea. There was nothing in her files. He wanted to know how old the kid was and if she was involved with the father. He was far more interested than he should be. He felt like he\u2019d been kicked in the gut.</p><p>His temper exploded again when he saw her face, though. She was as white as a ghost and looked like she was going to pass out. \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d she whispered, sounding like she was going to break apart at any moment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s said that and so much more. He can barely tolerate you. You\u2019re so unbelievably na\u00efve,\u201d he spat and took a step towards her.</p><p>Derek broke out of his trance and grabbed the man by his shirt. He physically lifted the man off his feet and then tossed him towards the door, where the man tripped and fell to the ground. \u201cGet out of my building, now. If you set foot in here again or anywhere near Jasmine, charges will be filed,\u201d Derek growled. He looked like a feral animal.</p><p>Jasmine looked from him to the ex-employee and then back again. She was in shock and frightened, all at the same time. \u201cSecurity,\u201d Derek yelled, which made her jump. Within two seconds two large men came in and didn\u2019t have to be told a word. They took one look at the man and hauled him to his feet pulling him out of the office.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he was screaming, as they continued to drag him away.</p><p>Derek walked over to Jasmine and pulled her into his arms. She resisted for a moment and then buried her head in his shoulder as the sobs started racking her body. She threw her arms around him and sobbed for a while. He normally couldn\u2019t stand hysterical women but there was so much pain radiating from her, he couldn\u2019t do anything but comfort her.</p><p>The man said some really hateful things and Derek was sure her father had said them all. She was getting a taste of what a horrible man he was. Derek had to guard himself though, because she may have seemed to change from the woman she was ten years ago but she had once tossed him out, without a look back.</p><p>She was finally getting herself under control and seemed to realize she was wrapped in his arms. She pulled back and looked up at him with red rimmed eyes and tear stained cheeks. He was about to bring his hand up and wipe the tears away, when she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she hiccupped at him. She then pulled away and headed into the bathroom. She didn\u2019t come out for a while. It gave him time to go to his computer. He had to do some research on her, to find out what he could about her life. He wanted to know if she\u2019d been married when her son was born and if she was currently married. He needed to know what was going on in her life.</p><p>He knew it was going to take a while but he\u2019d find the information he wanted. Jasmine finally walked out of the bathroom, looking much more composed.</p><p>\u201cDerek, we\u2019ve finished with all the interviews today and I can easily take my lap top home and go through the applications. I haven\u2019t had a personal day in years and would really like to take one now. I wouldn\u2019t normally ask but I would appreciate it if you would let me head out early today,\u201d she asked, with her shoulders back and her head held high. She was expecting to have to argue with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat will be fine. Just have those names ready for me Monday morning,\u201d he said, barely taking the time to look at her.</p><p>Jasmine grabbed her things and rushed out the door. She swung by her office and put together what she\u2019d need over the weekend and was out to her car within fifteen minutes.</p><p>Jasmine walked in the door of her home and calmly set her belongings down. She called her father\u2019s number and waited for the voice mail to beep. \u201cDad, this is Jasmine and this will be my last call to you. Andy got fired today and said some things to me. If you said them then you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about and you don\u2019t even need to bother to call me back, because I will not want to speak to you again. If you didn\u2019t say these vicious things, then you need to call me and explain why Andy would say you did. If I don\u2019t hear from you tonight, then I guess that\u2019s my answer,\u201d she spoke unemotionally and hung up.</p><p>She let herself have a hard cry, hoping to hear from her father. She\u2019d always thought he was a hero and the reality of her recent discoveries wasn\u2019t pleasant. She was being crushed with the whole take-over business. Learning her father wasn\u2019t who she always thought he was seemed unbearable.</p> <p>The phone rang a couple hours later and she was reluctant to pick it up. She squared her shoulders and lifted the handle, quietly saying hello.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your father,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s going on? You haven\u2019t called me. You just disappeared and now I\u2019m hearing all this information that can\u2019t possibly be true,\u201d she said, trying to keep her tone normal. Her father hated displays of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019ve gotten cozy with the new boss,\u201d he spat at her, ignoring her questions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make the best of a bad situation,\u201d she said, shocked by his coldness.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you were always good at adapting, weren\u2019t you?\u201d he said. He continued before she was able to say anything. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave me a message telling me not to call you. If I want to call, I damn well will. I\u2019ve put up with you for years but I\u2019m done now. It\u2019s because of you that I\u2019ve lost everything. You\u2019re bastard of a boyfriend felt he had to take everything away and now you\u2019re all cushy with him once more. I see where your loyalties lie,\u201d he ranted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all cozy with him, Dad. I just need the job. I have a son to support,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always just full of excuses, just like when you were a child. I\u2019m done coddling you. If you can get that man to back the hell off me, then you can call me. Otherwise you can stay out of my life,\u201d he shouted. The phone went dead. Jasmine stared at the beeping receiver not understanding what just happened.</p><p>She had no more tears left in her. She had to pull herself together for her son\u2019s sake. She went to the bathroom and washed her face. She looked in the mirror and vowed she\u2019d never get taken advantage of or be abused again.</p><p>Derek had all calls held and sat at his desk looking up information. He soon found that Jasmine had never been married. She didn\u2019t even appear to have been in a serious relationship. It took him a while to find information on her son though, because he was thinking he\u2019d be a toddler.</p><p>When he realized how old the boy was his world seemed to stop spinning. He was doing some major math in his head and no matter which way he looked at it, the date of his birth coincided with the time he\u2019d been with her. He knew she\u2019d been a virgin when they slept together and he couldn\u2019t imagine she\u2019d jumped from his bed into another man\u2019s within a couple of weeks-time.</p> <p>It was possible but very unlikely. He had no idea how many hours he sat there trying to figure everything out. If he was a father, why would she not tell him? Why wouldn\u2019t she have come after him for child support? He was a very wealthy man and she could\u2019ve tried to exploit that.</p><p>He\u2019d been working with her for a week and she hadn\u2019t said a word about her son. The only explanation seemed to be that he wasn\u2019t the father. But he didn\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t try to pass the kid off as his. She knew the time frame would work and she could\u2019ve thought he wouldn\u2019t demand a DNA test.</p><p>He needed to get some answers and there was no way in hell he was waiting until Monday morning. He decided he was going to her house right then. He looked up her address and was shocked by the neighborhood. It wasn\u2019t the poorest district but certainly not what she was used to. Hell, her father still lived in a mansion; well he did until he was forced to place it on the market.</p><p>She lived in a lower middle class neighborhood and the house had about as much square footage as his bedroom. He didn\u2019t get it. He glanced at the clock and was frustrated to realize it was close to midnight. He\u2019d been sitting at his computer all day and night. He\u2019d have to wait until the morning before going over there. It was going to be a long, sleepless night.</p><p>He walked out to his car and couldn\u2019t help himself from driving in the direction of her place. He had to see if it was really in the type of neighborhood he\u2019d looked up. It took him about thirty minutes to reach her neighborhood and it was exactly as he'd pictured.</p><p>He slowed his car, as he looked at the house numbers, until he spotted her place. It was a nice house. No one could say she lived in the slums but he was so used to luxury condos and high-rises, that he almost forgot what working class neighborhoods looked like.</p><p>The place was a pale blue color, with white trim. He glanced at the well maintained lawn, which was due to be mowed, and the many flowers planted around and the white picket fence. She lives in suburbia, he thought, with an almost hysterical laugh.</p><p>He\u2019d dreamed of living in a place like that when he\u2019d been growing up. He and his cousins would go walking through the neighborhoods, picking out which house they would own and exactly what cars would be parked in the driveway. His dreams had strayed a long way from that time.</p> <p>He now lived on the top floor of a huge complex, with no yard in sight. He sat in his car, wistfully thinking it would be nice to have a yard. Her place was far too small for his tastes but the idea of a yard was greatly appealing. If the boy really did turn out to be his, he\u2019d start looking for property to build a nice house on. Hell, even if the boy didn\u2019t turn out to be his, he was going to start looking. It was time to have some land and maybe a few horses and other animals roaming around.</p><p>He kept fighting with himself. He wanted to pound on her door and demand answers from her. He wasn\u2019t a patient man and he needed to know if he had a son. If it were true he\u2019d already lost over nine years of the boy\u2019s life and he wasn\u2019t willing to lose one minute more.</p><p>He debated with himself for a few minutes and then decided there was no use causing a scene in the middle of the night. He moved to start the car, when there was a knock at his window. He normally wasn\u2019t a jumpy person but his heart jumped, as he turned to see the bright end of a flashlight.</p><p>He rolled his window down to see who was interrupting him in the middle of the night. He almost hoped it was a robber so he could have an excuse to pound his frustrations out on someone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing parked out here son?\u201d a stern voice asked him. Derek had to suppress the smile that wanted to rise to his lips. Only in this type of area would an officer approach and call him son.</p><p>\u201cSorry officer, I got lost and was looking at my blackberry to figure out how to get turned around,\u201d the lie rolled off his lips.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your license and registration. You can shut the motor off while I check things out,\u201d the officer said, suspiciously. Derek had to admit he did look suspicious, sitting in front of the home, in the family neighborhood. For all the officer knew, he was some robber, or stalker. He was a little uncomfortable, considering he was actually stalking Jasmine right then.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Derek said, as he passed his information through the window. The officer looked at him again and then sidled back to his car. Derek was grateful the lights weren\u2019t flashing. He was praying Jasmine was asleep in her house and would never know of this.</p><p>Derek was still angry with her but he didn\u2019t need a confrontation in the middle of the night, with an officer as a witness and all the neighbors\u2019 porch lights flashing on.</p><p>The officer was gone about ten minutes, enough to make him squirm a bit, like he was back in high school and had just stolen the mayor\u2019s car, or something. What was wrong with him? He had nothing to worry about; he was a successful and respected business man.</p><p>\u201cLooks like everything checks out. Can I give you any directions?\u201d the officer asked, as he silently approached the window once more and shined his far too bright light inside the vehicle once more.</p><p>\u201cNo sir, I have it all figured out,\u201d Derek said, just wanting to get on his way.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I will wait here while you get going,\u201d he said, almost like a threat. It was definitely time for him to get going. He\u2019d be back in the morning and hoped like hell there had was a shift change because he was sure if the same officer came by he was going to be a lot more suspicious.</p><p>Derek drove off and soon hit the main roads. He was wide awake and not thrilled to walk into his empty place. He lay down and hoped he could at least manage to get a few hours of sleep.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Jasmine woke up to the sound of pounding coming from somewhere. She wasn\u2019t ever a morning person but the insistent pounding was putting her in a far worse mood than she normally woke up in.</p><p>She climbed out of her bed and stumbled down the stairs, not bothering to put on a robe to cover up her old t-shirt and short boxers. If the person was rude enough to wake her up early on a Saturday, then whoever it was could deal with her bedtime apparel.</p><p>She knew her hair would be frightening and her eyes still only half slits. Perhaps she\u2019d scare the unwanted visitor enough to never call so early again. She yanked open the door, \u201cWhat do you want at this ungodly hour?\u201d she snapped before looking up.</p><p>She gasped at the sight of Derek standing on her front porch. He didn\u2019t look too happy. She had no clue what he could possibly be doing on her front doorstep at any time, much less so early on a Saturday.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you greet all your guests?\u201d he asked, with a mocking smile.</p><p>\u201cNumber one, you\u2019re not my guest and number two, most people are smart enough not to show up at my doorstep at the break of dawn, on a weekend,\u201d she snapped back at him, not even caring she was being rude.</p><p>She inhaled the scent of coffee and her eyes widened as she sought out the wonderful aroma. He was holding two large cups and she was fighting with herself on whether to shut the door in his face, or make a grab for the cup. She was awake now and she wanted that coffee badly.</p><p>Derek had to fight the smile from coming across his features at the pure look of lust that came into her eyes as she spotted the coffee he was holding. He\u2019d made a last minute decision to swing by and grab it. Even after only a week of working with her, he already knew she wasn\u2019t a happy person until she\u2019d downed her first cup. He\u2019d learned to wait to speak to her until she was at least half-way through the mug.</p><p>He held it out as a peace offering, forgetting for a moment he was there to demand answers from her. She greedily grabbed the cup and took a large sip with a sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt the sigh all the way down to his toes. Damn she could go from almost frightening to downright exotic in a split second. He wanted that look on her face as he slipped deep inside her body. His pants were getting far too tight, the more his thoughts strayed.</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks for the coffee, now go away and come back at a descent hour,\u201d she said and began shutting the door in his face. He was so shocked at being dismissed so completely he almost allowed her to slam the door. At the last second he put his foot in the door, stopping her progress. He looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he almost growled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it can wait until Monday morning. I brought my work home and will have everything ready for you,\u201d she said with exasperation. She thought he was there about work. Well, he reasoned with himself, what else would she think he was there for?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in Jasmine. We\u2019re going to talk,\u201d he said in his most authoritative voice. That tone had made more than one person back down and tremble. She merely shrugged at him as if she could care less.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Derek, hurry up then, so I can lie back down. What time is it anyway?\u201d she asked. She then turned towards her clock and gasped in outrage as she turned back on him. \u201cIt\u2019s freaking six thirty in the morning,\u201d she yelled, as if she couldn\u2019t possibly believe he\u2019d dare to approach her so early. \u201cOn my day off,\u201d she continued.</p><p>She was now steadily walking towards him, with a look so full of fury, he actually found himself retreating a step. When he realized what he\u2019d done, he stood still, not ever being willing to cede ground.</p><p>She got within inches of his face and poked her finger hard into his chest. \u201cThis had better be a life or death matter,\u201d she growled at him. He was so unbelievably turned on he forgot about why he was there or why they needed to talk.</p><p>He grabbed her cup, which made her gasp again in fury and then set both of them on a nearby table. He then grabbed her in his arms and kissed her with all the pent up desire he\u2019d been holding in the entire week.</p><p>She punched him in the chest for about two seconds and then her body went limp in surrender. He was only planning on kissing her, to show her he was the one in control but once his lips were connected with hers, he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself. His hands ran down her back, to grip her luscious behind and pull her up tight against his aroused body.</p><p>She gasped in his mouth, as her body connected with his and she felt the arousal pressed into her core. She threw her arms around his neck and held on tightly, as he devoured her mouth with his. His hand continued to grip her tightly, lifting her completely off the ground and he turned them so her back was pressed up against the wall. He ground his hips against her, trying to relieve the intense pressure in his pants.</p><p>He wanted her and if she came to her senses and told him to stop he may die right there on the spot. He was tangling his tongue with hers as his hands massaged her beautiful behind. She was so unbelievably curved in all the right places. Her backside was a perfect fit in his large hands. He squeezed a little tighter and she let out a growl of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your room?\u201d he asked her, before once again kissing her senseless. She lifted her arm and pointed down the hallway, without ever speaking. He took that as a yes from her and started heading in that direction, with her wrapped around his waist.</p><p>He reached an open doorway and could smell her scent drifting out to him. He knew it was her room. He strode through the doorway and lay her down on the bed. He stripped his clothing away and then pressed down into her, connecting their lips once more, before either of them could realize they were making a mistake.</p><p>He broke contact with her only long enough to pull the shirt over her head and yank the shorts off. He threw them, not caring where they landed. He was finally stretched out against her fully, skin to skin. He knew his body was so on fire that he was most likely burning her. He couldn\u2019t stop touching her. His hands roved from her beautiful breasts, down her thighs and back up again.</p><p>He finally stopped kissing her, only to trail his lips down the smooth column of her throat. He licked along the pulse point, feeling his own skip a beat, as he realized how quickly hers was pounding. She\u2019d been passionate when they were young; she was downright exotic as an adult. He reacquainted himself with all her curves, appreciating the maturing her body had done.</p><p>He brought his mouth down the mounds of her breasts and sucked in the tightened nipple. She arched her back as he continued to massage the aching nipple, reaching down to hold his head close to her body. He nipped at the swollen bud and then licked over the spot, making another moan escape her body.</p><p>He switched to the other side, giving her other breast equal attention, before continuing his journey down her body. He wanted to explore every single inch of her he\u2019d missed out on over the last ten years.</p><p>He reached her stomach and ran his tongue over the satin skin. When he got lower, towards her core, he discovered a few little scars, which only added to her sexiness. She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever made love to. He could barely keep himself from exploding all over her bed, as he continued his journey to her core.</p><p>He finally reached her sweet womanhood and flicked his tongue over the swollen pink flesh. She was so unbelievably beautiful. The taste of her made his erection pulse painfully, with his desire to sink into her tight opening.</p><p>He flicked his tongue out and kissed her in the most intimate way a man can kiss a woman, until she was writhing underneath him and moaning out his name. He slipped his fingers inside and discovered she was more than ready for him. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He crawled quickly up her body and then locked his lips back with hers.</p><p>She greedily took everything she could from him. She was rubbing her hands all over his bulging muscles as she squirmed to bring them closer. \u201cPlease Derek,\u201d she cried out, when he still hadn\u2019t united them.</p><p>He spread her legs apart and then rubbed his engorged member along her folds. The heat from her was making his head light. She was so wet and hot, he couldn\u2019t play any longer. He grabbed her hips and thrust deep inside her in one quick motion. She cried out, as he filled her up with his full length.</p> <p>He paused for a moment, so he could try and control himself. He wouldn\u2019t be able to give her pleasure if he didn\u2019t get himself under control. She wiggled her hips in need and he couldn\u2019t take anymore. He started thrusting hard, in and out of her, while holding her hips tightly in his hands.</p><p>Their tongues continued to mimic their lovemaking, tangling and thrusting into one another\u2019s mouths, as they both groaned out their intense pleasure. He began thrusting into her harder and faster, as he felt the exquisite pleasure shooting through his body. He felt her own body tensing, as she reached higher, towards her release.</p><p>She gasped out loud and her mouth opened wide, releasing him. She threw her head back into the bed and cried out as her body started convulsing around him. She gripped him tightly, deep within her womb and he almost lost consciousness as he felt his release shoot deep inside of her tight body. It felt like lightening shooting through him, as his erection continued to pump within her core.</p><p>She was still gripping him tightly in spasms and he drained every ounce of himself inside her. It was the most intense orgasm he\u2019d ever felt in his life. His energy had been depleted and he fell against her sweat slickened body. They were both breathing in deep gasps of air.</p><p>He realized he had to be crushing her and turned their bodies so he was holding her tightly against him, side by side. They were still connected in the most intimate way a man and woman could be and he couldn\u2019t find the will power to pull them apart. She wiggled, seeming to try and get even closer to him, as if she couldn\u2019t let him go either.</p><p>They lay there for several minutes, until their breathing slowed down and the intenseness of their lovemaking began to dim. He knew the moment she realized what she\u2019d done again, because her lax body stiffened and she began to push him away.</p><p>He reluctantly let her go and was sorry to feel the connection broken, as she pulled free from his body. He somehow felt empty and he couldn\u2019t understand it. He\u2019d never before wanted to stay connected to a woman. He\u2019d always been the first one to crawl out of bed and leave before she could possibly want to do the after sex cuddling.</p><p>He realized Jasmine was truly the only woman he\u2019d made love to, instead of just bedding. He\u2019d never understood the difference until that moment.</p><p>Jasmine was staring at him with wide eyes, filled with shock. She quickly grabbed her sheet and covered herself up and he felt more disappointment. He enjoyed looking at her curvy body and wanted to continue to explore her.</p><p>\u201cI...I...d...don\u2019t know why that keeps happening,\u201d she sputtered to him, as her cheeks filled with color.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have undeniable chemistry,\u201d he said, with his trademark, cocky smile. He was feeling pretty good at that moment. He hadn\u2019t planned on starting his day out ravishing her but he could think of far worse things he could\u2019ve been doing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep with strangers,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not strangers Jasmine, so don\u2019t try that crap on me. You were a virgin the first time I took you and from the feel of your body, you haven\u2019t taken too many more lovers,\u201d he said, with far too much confidence. He was laying there in all his naked glory and her eyes strayed to his still half aroused body part. She quickly snapped her gaze back to his face and then her eyes narrowed as his grin became full-fledged.</p><p>She reached out her hand and slapped him hard once again before he had time to react. His smile was wiped away and he pounced on her before she could scramble away. The sheet slipped down and her body was barely covered as he held her down with his own body, which was becoming, once again, fully aroused.</p><p>\u201cI allowed you to slap me once, it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he growled, before locking his lips with hers. She tightened her own together and glared at him. He smiled and then licked the swollen bottom lip before pulling it into his mouth and gently nipping it. She gasped, as the fire started building in her stomach again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out how he turned all her rational thoughts to jelly with barely a touch. She was already losing her battle to distance herself from him. He ran his tongue over hers again, as he held her hands up high above her head. She slowly opened to him and when he inserted his tongue back into her mouth she wiggled in pleasure. He was slowly making love to her with only his tongue and it was completely erotic.</p><p>Her stomach was clenching, as her desire woke fully back up. He held her hands together with both of his and then moved the sheet from her body as he ran his other hand down all her curves. She was soon begging him to love her again.</p><p>\u201cSay you want me,\u201d he growled, with his impressive manhood pressed up against her opening. Her body was on fire and she wanted him deep within her but she didn\u2019t want to utter those words of surrender. She shook her head no.</p><p>He continued to stroke her with his tongue and then inserted his fingers deep inside her moist heat. \u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered in her ear, sending a shiver of delight down her spine. She couldn\u2019t fight him anymore. She wanted him more than she wanted air. \u201cI want you. Please,\u201d she finally begged him. He removed his fingers and then slowly pushed back inside her. Where they were frantic and wild only moments before, he was now gentle and loving, pushing slowly in and out of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her body was quivering with need, as he moved his impressive length in and out of her body, while continuing to kiss her lips, neck and breasts. She wanted more, she needed more. She was on the edge of a cliff and only he could push her over.</p><p>She grabbed his hips and thrust up against him, groaning as the full width of him settled against her. \u201cPlease Derek, faster, I need...\u201d she gasped. His eyes dilated at her gasped words and he gave them both the pleasure they needed and picked up his speed until they were once again crying out in ecstasy. He flipped them over when they were done and held her close in his arms not willing to let her go.</p><p>She seemed to know she\u2019d lost the battle and curled up in his arms. He was so depleted; he couldn\u2019t even open his eyes. He pulled the covers up over them and fell asleep feeling better than he ever had in his life. He\u2019d deal with the real world soon enough, was his last thought as he drifted into a deep sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m home,\u201d Jacob\u2019s voice shouted, waking Jasmine from her deep sleep. She heard his running footsteps and then saw him peak in her door. \u201cYeah she is here Mrs. Winters, thanks for the ride,\u201d Jacob said and then she heard the front door close.</p><p>\u201cHi Jacob,\u201d she said to her son groggily and then glanced at the clock. She was shocked to see it was past eleven. She felt a stirring next to her and became instantly alert. She\u2019d thought the whole thing had been a dream for a moment.</p><p>Her son\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Derek. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jacob asked. Jasmine must have looked completely horrified. Her son had never once seen her in bed with a man. She had not been with another man since Derek. She looked at him and found his full attention was on her son. She may as well have not even existed.</p><p>She wanted to jump from the bed and hide Jacob from Derek\u2019s knowing eyes but it was too late. She didn\u2019t know how she could get out of this. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d made love to him, not only once but twice and then actually fallen asleep in his arms, when her son would be returning. It was just plain stupid. Her mind was scrambling to figure out how to explain her nine year old son.</p><p>Derek continued to look at the boy, which was like looking at a picture of himself from his childhood. Derek had zero doubts the boy was his.</p> <p>He had all kinds of emotions, competing at once, inside of him. Foremost, there was joy he had a son there was extreme anger Jasmine had kept his son from him. He was confused, because he had just had the best love making of his life and yet he wanted to strangle the mother of his child. He didn\u2019t know which emotion to embrace first. He realized his son had asked him who he was and he also realized Jasmine was sitting there like a deer caught in an oncoming car\u2019s headlights.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your dad,\u201d he said. He heard Jasmine\u2019s intake of breath and didn\u2019t even bother to look over at her. He was too afraid he may give in to his urge to strangle her. He knew he wouldn\u2019t really do that but he was pretty infuriated with her right then.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jacob asked him skeptically. His face contorted into such a mirror image of his own he wanted to shout for joy. He was meeting his son. He wanted to jump from the bed and pull him into his arms but he was still completely naked underneath the protection of the bedding. He knew the only reason Jasmine was still in the bed was for the same reason.</p><p>\u201cI really am,\u201d Derek said, having to fight the emotions trying to break free.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re my dad, then what did you say to my mom every night before you had to leave?\u201d the boy asked and Derek knew he was being tested. Derek hadn\u2019t thought about those words in many years and yet he\u2019d never forget them.</p><p>He took a deep breath and uttered the words he hadn\u2019t said since the night before he was to meet Jasmine and run away, \u201cSweet dreams my princess, I will rescue you from the tower in the morning light,\u201d he said, with a slight scratch to his throat.</p> <p>He heard Jasmine gasp again and then felt her body shake slightly. He glanced over at her and saw the tears falling from her eyes. He then grunted as Jacob jumped on the bed and threw his arms around him. He felt stunned as he held his son in his arms for the first time. He was awed and amazed by the little man. He wrapped him up tightly and held his little body against his own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dad,\u201d the boy said in awe. He lifted his hands up to touch Derek\u2019s face, as if he was trying to figure out for sure, if he was real. \u201cMom said you had to go away for business but she told me one day you'd come back and you did, you really came back,\u201d Jacob said, as a tear slipped from his eye. Derek felt like his heart had just burst in his chest. Jasmine was now sobbing next to them on the bed.</p><p>She watched as father and son embraced and her world felt like it was coming apart. She had been so wrong to not tell Derek about Jacob the minute she saw him. She could see the love practically flowing from him.</p><p>She\u2019d told her son all about Derek and how he\u2019d seemed like her prince in shining armor. She\u2019d never told her son any of her heartbreak, like how she\u2019d waited for him in futile at that little broken down church. She had wanted her son to think his father would move heaven and earth to be with him.</p><p>Jacob was talking a million miles a minute, as he asked a ton of questions and Derek patiently answered each one. They continued to cling to each other and Jasmine felt like an intruder. She would\u2019ve gotten up, to give them some time together but was trapped underneath the covers. She scooted over but her bed wasn\u2019t that big and Derek was a large guy. No matter how much she scooted, they were still touching.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to come to my wrestling match?\u201d Jacob asked, with hope shining in his eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, we can skip it,\u201d he said, although he loved to wrestle and had never missed a meet. It broke her heart how much her young man wanted to please his father.</p><p>\u201cNothing would make me happier than to watch you wrestle,\u201d Derek said and he meant it. He had missed nine years already and wouldn\u2019t miss one more minute.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really fun. Just ask Mom. She never misses my games. She always yells too loud but coach says it\u2019s okay cause she\u2019s just really proud of me,\u201d he said, as if he couldn\u2019t understand women. \u201cI kinda like it, though,\u201d he whispered to Derek, thinking she wouldn\u2019t be able to hear. She had to fight the smile back.</p> <p>\u201cCan you go to the kitchen for a minute so your mom and I can get ready to go?\u201d Derek asked him. Jasmine was relieved. She needed to get out of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t leave?\u201d Jacob asked, looking on the verge of tears.</p><p>Derek grabbed him close again. \u201cI promise you I will never leave again,\u201d he said and then glared at Jasmine over Jacob\u2019s shoulder. A shiver ran down her spine from the look. He wasn\u2019t happy with her. She stiffened up her back and glared back. She wasn\u2019t the one who walked out on him. How dare he look at her that way!</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right out here,\u201d Jacob said, almost like a threat, in case Derek decided to disappear on him.</p><p>He slowly left the room, closing the door behind him. As soon as he left, Jasmine grabbed the sheet and jumped from the bed. She ran into the bathroom and locked the door. She needed a few minutes to gather herself before she had to face him. She leaned against the sink and took some deep breaths. A few seconds later Derek was on the outside of the door.</p><p>\u201cYou can either open this door, or I will break it down, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d he said, in a deadly calm voice. She decided not to test him.</p><p>He was standing there in nothing but his pants and the man looked far too sexy after just climbing out of bed. She said nothing to him for a few moments, not knowing how to begin this conversation. She decided to go on the offensive.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to blurt that out to him. What if you\u2019re not his father?\u201d she said and then took a step back at the fury in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try and play games with me, Jasmine. It\u2019s more than obvious he\u2019s mine and you have already robbed nine years of his life from me. You won\u2019t take anything else, do I make myself clear?\u201d he growled at her, as he backed her into the corner.</p><p>She went from offensive to defensive in a matter of seconds. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t yours, I just said you should have asked me first, instead of blurting it out like that,\u201d she said, a bit shakily.</p><p>\u201cSo you could come up with some more lies? I don\u2019t think so, Jasmine. Get yourself together. I\u2019m going to spend the day with my son and I don\u2019t want him to know I want to hurt his mother,\u201d he snapped at her, before turning to leave.</p><p>Derek walked out of the bedroom and had to fight the tears from stinging his eyes, as he saw his son sitting by the front door. His son was so afraid he\u2019d leave him again, he was guarding the door. He\u2019d prove to the boy he\u2019d never leave again. They wouldn\u2019t spend one more night apart. He\u2019d figure out what he was going to do about Jasmine later.</p><p>He took Jacob into the kitchen and fixed him breakfast. Father and son sat, eating their first meal together and getting to know one another.</p><p>Jasmine slid down to the floor after Derek stormed out. She sat there, sobbing into her hands and feeling sorry for herself. How had her life changed so much in only a week\u2019s time? She finally got up and climbed into the shower. She stood there until the water turned cold and then reluctantly climbed out, shivering. She had goose bumps all over her body.</p><p>She pulled on thick sweat pants and a sweatshirt, threw her hair in a ponytail and didn\u2019t bother with make-up. She had little energy to even care about her looks, even though she was going out in public. She was simply too frightened about what would happen next.</p><p>She stepped into the kitchen to the sound of her son\u2019s laughter. She smiled at him and then kissed him on the head. \u201cOh Mom,\u201d he grumbled and then rolled his eyes at Derek. Jasmine held her breath, because if Derek said that his mom kissing him was gross, her son would never let her do it again. He was already hero worshiping the man.</p><p>Derek surprised her, by grabbing her around the waist, which knocked her off balance, so she tumbled into his lap. He kissed her squarely on the lips and then released her just as quickly. She was feeling light headed as she stood back up. Even angry with the man, he still made her feel things no one else ever had.</p><p>\u201cJacob, we never complain when a beautiful lady wants to kiss us,\u201d he said to her son and then wiggled his eye brows at him. Jacob giggled and Jasmine\u2019s heart swelled. Derek had said exactly the right thing.</p><p>\u201cYuck, Dad,\u201d Jacob said with more giggles and then went back to scarfing down his breakfast. He looked up every few seconds to stare at Derek, as if to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to disappear on him.</p><p>\u201cI need to make lunch for the boys,\u201d Jasmine murmured and then set to work making a large pot of homemade soup and fresh bread. The smells coming from the kitchen were making Derek\u2019s stomach growl. Whatever she was making smelled delicious.</p><p>\u201cCoach says mom makes the best lunches ever and that\u2019s why they always want her to make the food for our tournaments,\u201d Jacob said with pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf it tastes as good as it smells, I can understand why your coach says that,\u201d Derek agreed. Jasmine felt a little bit of pride role through her. She enjoyed cooking for her son, heck she enjoyed cooking for anyone who appreciated it.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, Mom, or we\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Jacob called to her an hour later. She was getting the soup put into the insulated bag. She had several things to drag out to the car and was feeling flustered, since she\u2019d overslept and was officially running late.</p><p>\u201cLet me grab those for you,\u201d Derek said, making her jump. She wasn\u2019t used to having someone there to help her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered, relinquishing a few of the bags.</p> <p>\u201cWe can take my car,\u201d Derek commanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jacob said and then gasped as he saw the shiny black car sitting at the curb. \u201cIs that your car?\u201d he asked in awe.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Derek answered smugly. Jasmine just rolled her eyes at the rapture the two boys were sharing as they both admired the far too expensive Porsche.</p><p>\u201cMy friends are going to think I\u2019m so cool,\u201d Jacob said, as he was bouncing in place at just the thought of riding in the fancy sports car.</p><p>\u201cWant to take the top down?\u201d Derek asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jacob shouted and then giggled as Derek pressed a button and the top started slowly moving back. Jasmine wasn\u2019t thrilled to climb into the small vehicle. She much preferred her sturdy mini-van.</p><p>Jacob climbed in the back seat and buckled up. It was a good thing he was still small because he barely fit back there. No way could an adult squeeze in the back. She reluctantly climbed into the passenger side and when Derek soon sat down in the driver\u2019s seat, she was grateful the top was down. The little car was making her feel claustrophobic and Derek was way too close for her already frayed nerves to handle.</p><p>Derek threw the car into gear and then gunned down the street, picking up speed quickly. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in that big of a hurry,\u201d she gasped in fear, as she held on tightly to the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d Jacob groaned. \u201cGo faster,\u201d he egged Derek on. Derek gave him a huge smile in the rearview mirror and then jumped on the freeway gunning the engine. They shot past cars like they were standing still. Jacob was full of laughter, as his hair blew back in the wind and they flew down the freeway.</p><p>Jasmine would never admit it to either of the guys but she was getting a thrill out of the ride herself, after her initial fear fell away. He was a skilled driver and whipped around the lanes of traffic smoothly, making it seem like they were flying.</p><p>They reached their exit and had to slow down. \u201cWe have to do this again,\u201d Jacob shouted from the back seat. Jasmine silently agreed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go on a long ride after the wrestling meet and then go have dinner,\u201d Derek promised him. Jasmine didn\u2019t appreciate how he was just assuming they didn\u2019t already have plans. She would\u2019ve said something but didn\u2019t want to fight in front of her son.</p><p>They pulled up to the school and Jacob grabbed ahold of Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, Dad, I want you to meet my coach,\u201d he said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cLet me help your mom carry the food in and then I can meet him,\u201d he answered with never-ending patience. She was impressed how well he was doing with her hyper nine year old son. A lot of parent\u2019s couldn\u2019t handle their children, after having years to adjust and he seemed to be falling right into parenthood. She\u2019d see how he acted in a week, or even a month. That would be the true test.</p><p>They walked into the gym, like a million other families. Jacob had his small hand clasped in Derek\u2019s and she walked on his other side. To the rest of the world they would seem like the perfect, suburban family. She knew the truth though. She knew the confrontation was coming and she was trying to prepare herself for it.</p><p>Derek barely had time to set the food down at the concession area, before Jacob dragged him off. He was so proud to show his father off to his coach and all his friends. She watched as he proudly crossed the room and ran to Chuck.</p><p>Chuck looked up at them with surprise and then she watched as his brow wrinkled, before he quickly managed to paste a smile on his face and shake Derek\u2019s hand. She knew he had to be wondering what was going on between them, as she\u2019d never mentioned Jacob\u2019s father before.</p><p>Jacob must\u2019ve insisted Derek sit with him in the players section, not willing to let his dad leave his side, because she saw Derek, businessman tycoon, kneel down and sit on the Matts. She would've caught flies if they were around - her mouth was so wide open. She quickly shut it and got the food all ready for the boys.</p><p>\u201cWho is that complete hunk of man meat with your son?\u201d one of the very single mothers said, as she edged up. \u201cPlease tell me he\u2019s your long lost brother and single,\u201d the woman continued. Jasmine felt instant jealousy, as she stared at the gorgeous woman, who unlike her, was dressed in a skin tight outfit, with her hair and make-up done to perfection.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know how to describe Derek. They weren\u2019t a couple and hadn\u2019t been for ten years. He was the father of her child and he\u2019d made love to her so hotly she was surprised her sheets hadn\u2019t gone up in flames but she didn\u2019t have any rights to him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Jacob\u2019s father,\u201d she simply said. She didn\u2019t know what else to add to that.</p><p>\u201cYummy, you haven\u2019t mentioned Jacob\u2019s father before. Does he live out of town?\u201d the woman asked, with too much interest.</p><p>\u201cWe just lost touch for some years but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to want to be away from Jacob anymore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d the woman said and then snaked over to her son, who just happened to be close to Derek. Jasmine watched as the woman had the nerve to actually pretend to trip and fall into Derek. She couldn\u2019t believe he fell for that, as he held his arms out to catch her. Then to top it off, she sat inappropriately close to him.</p><p>Jasmine could feel her anger escalating as the two of them sat and chatted like long lost friends. She wondered what the heck they found so amusing, as they laughed together. She told herself it was none of her business if he flirted with some trampy soccer mom. Hell, he could marry her and be one big happy family for all she cared, as long as the man left her and Jacob alone.</p><p>She knew she sounded like a jealous ex-spouse, even in her own head but he wasn\u2019t even trying to hide his flirting with another woman when she was standing in the same room. It was worse, considering he had ravished her body only a few short hours ago. The man was a cad and she was better off without him.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s Jacob\u2019s father, huh?\u201d Chuck, said as he came up to the table. Jasmine was hurt and angry and needed to feel good about herself, so she poured it on a little too thickly, with poor Chuck.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s been gone a long time and wants to reconnect with Jacob,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t want everyone there to know all her business and that Derek had only found out he was a father that day.</p><p>\u201cJacob seems pretty happy about it,\u201d he said, as they both glanced over at Jacob. Derek was looking directly at her and he didn\u2019t seem to be laughing anymore. Maybe it bothered him a bit to have to sit and watch her flirt, she thought a bit cattily.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jacob is really excited about it,\u201d she said and then found herself giggling, as she touched his arm. What was wrong with her? She was now acting like the vixen mother, who had her hands all over Derek. She needed to get a grip on herself.</p><p>Chuck\u2019s eyes widened at her touch and he moved a bit closer. He really was a good looking guy. He was about the same height and weight as Derek, though not quite as muscled. She knew a lot of the moms had crushes on him and had been flirting with him, in hopes of a date but he had seemed fixated on her for a while. She had simply not been interested.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing later tonight?\u201d he asked and she could see the wheels turning in his head. He was asking her out again, encouraged by her flirting. Damn, she really hadn\u2019t thought about that. Before she could answer him, not knowing what she was going to say, Derek appeared and cut the conversation short.</p><p>\u201cSorry Chuck we are going to be in the city tonight,\u201d Derek said, as he wrapped an arm around her, letting Chuck and every other man in the room know she wasn\u2019t available. She didn\u2019t get what he was doing, as they weren\u2019t a couple and he\u2019d been practically drooling in the other woman\u2019s lap, not two seconds ago.</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just thinking about having a pizza party for the boys to celebrate the end of their season,\u201d he said, quickly covering up. She was impressed with him; he must\u2019ve planned a back-up in case she turned him down again. She really felt badly. She shouldn\u2019t have let her temper get away from her and used him to appease her own feelings.</p><p>\u201cWe should think about that next weekend, I can order trophies for the boys, if you give me a list of their names,\u201d Derek said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cThat would be very generous of you,\u201d Chuck said with sincerity, if not a bit of jealousy.</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure. I've missed out on far too much of my son\u2019s life and I plan on making up for that now by not spending another minute without him,\u201d Derek said, making it very clear that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, well I better get back over there and coach the boys,\u201d he said, as he rushed off. He knew that Jasmine was off limits and was making his quick escape. She wanted to say something to Derek about his high handed behavior but wouldn\u2019t give the nosy parents the satisfaction of a public fight.</p><p>Derek leaned down and kissed her intimately, before letting her go. He was marking his territory for everyone there to see. She knew it was a Tarzan thing to do but she was still slightly light on her feet as he made his way back over to Jacob. She finally realized she was staring and turned away, only to notice almost every pair of eyes in the building on her. She felt her cheeks grow warm as the blush took over her features.</p><p>She really had to quit forgetting there was a world of people around her every time the man touched her. She busied herself with the food, only stopping when it was Jacob\u2019s turn to wrestle. She was no longer the loudest fan in the audience, she thought, as she heard Derek encouraging Jacob throughout his match.</p><p>After Jacob won, he ran over to his dad, who lifted him up, spinning him around in a huge hug. Her heart tugged as he raced to her next and let her kiss him on the cheek and congratulate him. She loved him so deeply that there was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to make his life better, even if it meant putting up with her insufferable ex.</p><p>The meet ended and all the boys rushed to her table to scoop up the food. She was pleased with all the oohs and aahs as the boys gulped down the food like it was their last meal. It didn\u2019t take long for every scrap to be consumed.</p><p>She always stayed to help with the clean-up and it took them about an hour before they were able to leave. Most of the parents had gone home already but she noticed Ms. Flirty mom was still hanging around, along with a few other single ladies.</p><p>They all walked out the door together, some of the women being far to flirtatious, in her opinion, with a man who was claiming to be taken. She figured they guessed if there wasn\u2019t a ring on her hand, he was still fair game. Heck, she thought, some of them wouldn\u2019t have cared if she did have a ring on. She was seeing a whole new side to the single parents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they approached his car, the mothers eyes widened even further and she could almost see the money signs cha ching in their heads. Vultures, she thought, really irritated. Chuck spotted the car and hung his head a little, thinking he was way out of his league and he took off more quickly than normal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you all later,\u201d Jasmine said, as she climbed in the vehicle. She just wanted to get away from the women, she\u2019d once thought were her friends. She guessed friendship had a limit and that limit was the impressive Derek Titan.</p><p>\u201cThanks for all the help ladies. I guess I need to study up on wrestling so I know better what my son is doing,\u201d Derek said with a wink. Jasmine looked over at him with a shocked expression crossing her features. He was encouraging the money hungry women. She couldn\u2019t even figure out who he was. He winked at her and then ripped out of the parking lot to the sound of the ladies giggling and yelling their goodbyes. Good riddance! She thought.</p><p>Jasmine was still incredibly irritated with Derek several hours later as they made their way back to her house and he parked in her driveway. The Porsche looked way out of place next to her used mini-van. It was just another example to show how very different their lives had become.</p> <p>She was the one who\u2019d grown up the richest kid in town, while he\u2019d been poor and worked for every dollar he made. Now the tables were turned and not only was he a billionaire but she was the one barely getting by. She didn\u2019t mind that so much but with his new status, also came that arrogance and distance she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>They slowly climbed from his car and walked into the house. Jacob could barely keep his eyes open but he was fighting his exhaustion. She knew her son was afraid to go to sleep and then wake up to find his father gone.</p><p>To take the man away from her son now would be cruel, since he had a taste of being with his father. She wished she could go back to the morning and have been able to resist his charms long enough to get him out of the house so she could think. She didn\u2019t want her son to be hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for bed baby, you can take your shower in the morning,\u201d she said to her son, as she led him towards his room.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not tired, Mom,\u201d he said, before a huge yawn overtook his features.</p> <p>\u201cI would say that yawn says you\u2019re pretty tired,\u201d she gently told him, still leading him towards his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWill you still be here tomorrow?\u201d Jacob asked Derek, with big sad eyes.</p><p>\u201cI promise you when you wake up in the morning I\u2019ll be right here,\u201d Derek said, as he bent down and lifted Jacob up into his arms like he weighed nothing. Jasmine had a hard time carrying him around now. He\u2019d just gotten so big. He\u2019d outgrow her in a few more years. She didn\u2019t know where the time went.</p><p>\u201cWill you read me my story tonight?\u201d Jacob asked him and Jasmine was a bit jealous. Story time had always been theirs alone and she didn\u2019t want to share it.</p><p>\u201cI would love to,\u201d Derek replied.</p><p>\u201cYou come too, Mom,\u201d Jacob said, with another sleepy yawn.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Honey,\u201d she replied fondly.</p><p>The three of them went to Jacob\u2019s room. It was filled with his favorite toys and posters of Spiderman all over the walls. He\u2019d been infatuated with Spiderman for about a year and had every poster and action figure she\u2019d been able to find.</p><p>\u201cI really like your room,\u201d Derek told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks Dad. Mom and me look for new stuff all the time,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun,\u201d Derek said. \u201cWhat story do you want to hear?\u201d he asked, as he looked over at the bookcase, which was overflowing with every book imaginable.</p><p>\u201cYou can pick, I like them all,\u201d he said, as Jasmine helped him find his pajamas. He quickly changed and crawled into bed, sitting against the headboard. Jasmine leaned next to him while Derek chose a book.</p><p>He found a superhero book and read the story, inserting villain\u2019s voices. When he tried to imitate a damsel in distress, both Jacob and Jasmine burst out laughing at his very poor portrayal of a woman. \u201cHey, I thought that was pretty good,\u201d he said, with a smile. He finished the story and Jasmine tucked the covers up under Jacob\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cGood night love, I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d she said and turned to leave father and son alone for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you say, Mom,\u201d he told her and waited expectantly. She glanced at Derek self-consciously and then to her son, who was waiting.</p><p>\u201cGood night my young prince, may the dawning day bring you adventures, treasures and so much more,\u201d she whispered to him and then quickly left the room. She\u2019d spoken the same words to him from the time he was a baby. It was one of her ways of giving him a piece of the romantic side of his father. She was very close to tears, since Derek was there but no longer her prince charming.</p><p>He followed her into the living room a few minutes later and they stood there staring at each other. She knew it was time for the confrontation. She was just not ready for it.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cWhy would you keep him from me?\u201d Derek demanded of her, his eyes filled with fury. What was worse than that though is the pain she saw under that anger. She\u2019d hurt him without meaning to. What did he expect of her though? He had walked out on her, when she was ready to give him her whole life.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep him from you on purpose, at first. I had no idea where you were and then by the time I knew how to find you, it was simply too late. He was already walking and talking and we were fine. The years just kept falling away,\u201d she said, in a voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son Jasmine,\u201d he was almost shouting. \u201cWere you going to tell me once we started working together?\u201d he asked. She said nothing but the look she gave him was all the answer he needed. \u201cI see,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He began pacing the small room and she felt like a mouse in the path of a viper. She knew he was going to strike but she didn\u2019t know when, where, or how. She was terrified and didn\u2019t want to make the situation any worse than it was, so she waited him out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so angry with you, I can\u2019t even think. I can\u2019t believe you could sit there with me each day, knowing it was one more day I didn\u2019t get with my son. I can\u2019t believe you would have sex with me and still feel no desire to tell me about him. How can you be this cold?\u201d he spat at her.</p><p>\u201cI...you...I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, as she threw her hands in the air. He was turning everything on her. He wasn\u2019t taking any accountability for his own actions. She knew he was angry and frustrated but he had to admit he was the one who had walked away.</p><p>\u201cDid you know you were pregnant that last night, when we made all the plans?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know until at least a month later,\u201d she answered. She really didn\u2019t see it would\u2019ve made any difference anyway. Why would he have stuck around for a baby, when he wouldn\u2019t stick around for her?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t spend another day without him,\u201d he told her with menace. She knew that it was coming down to that.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to fight me for him?\u201d she asked, barely able to hold the sobs in. She was so close to breaking down and crying all over his feet. Her knees would no longer support her so she plopped down on the couch. She couldn\u2019t even look at him anymore, she was hurting so badly.</p><p>He silently stood there in the room. She couldn\u2019t look up at him, as she was fearful of the look in his eyes. His silence seemed to be the answer to her question. She knew he was going to fight her for Jacob. She had nine years of being his mother and had done the best possible job she could but he had the money for the best attorneys and if he took her to court he\u2019d probably win.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help her case that Jacob was so needy of a father, he\u2019d bonded with him instantly. The courts always interviewed the kids. They\u2019d ask him if he wanted to be with his father or his mother and in her child\u2019s innocence, he\u2019d tell them he wanted to be with both his parents.</p><p>They\u2019d look at what each parent could provide and he\u2019d win hands down. She\u2019d fight him the entire way but she\u2019d just be fighting the inevitable. She felt defeated and devastated.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take you to court Jasmine but not because I give a damn what it would do to you. You don\u2019t deserve my consideration. I won\u2019t do it, because I won\u2019t hurt my son by pulling him away from his mother, who he obviously loves,\u201d he finally said. Jasmine felt a ray of hope. She could share her son. He may not like only being with his father on weekends but they could work it out.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said gratefully.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t finished speaking,\u201d he said in a tone that had her snapping her head up to look at him. \u201cI said I won\u2019t take Jacob from you but I also told you I won\u2019t spend another day without him,\u201d he said and waited for his words to sink in.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s eyes widened, as she realized what he was saying. \u201cYou want us to live together?\u201d she said in shock.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t dishonor my son by just living with his mother. I will not allow the other kids to pick on him because his mother is a mistress,\u201d he said with venom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cCome on Jasmine, you\u2019re smarter than this,\u201d he sneered at her. She continued to look up at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he said. Jasmine gasped, as she stared open-mouthed at him. He had just asked her to marry him, no scratch that he\u2019d just told her she was going to marry him. She didn\u2019t even know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t want to get married,\u201d she finally managed to stutter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very obvious from your actions ten years ago but this isn\u2019t about you, or even about me, this is about Jacob and what is best for him, so you\u2019ll marry me because it\u2019s what\u2019s best for our son,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t shouting or sneering anymore, he was deadly calm and seemed almost defeated, which was worse for her, because it made it all seem so much more real. She also didn\u2019t understand his little comment about ten years ago, considering he was the one who left her but she was so tired of arguing.</p><p>\u201cThere should be another more reasonable solution other than marriage. We can work out a visitation schedule,\u201d she tried one last chance to fix the situation that was quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other solution, I told you I want to be with my son every single day. I don\u2019t want to just visit him every other weekend and on alternative holidays. I\u2019ve already lost half of his childhood, I won\u2019t lose anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan we at least take a few days to think about things and talk some more, this is all so new and we are both emotional?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cJasmine it\u2019s either this or else,\u201d he said, leaving the veiled threat unsaid.</p><p>\u201cI guess it makes sense,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you feel that way but don\u2019t think that there won\u2019t be an iron clad prenuptial agreement. When our son turns eighteen and goes off to college, our sham of a marriage will end and then we can be free of each other. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ll leave you with something and just think, while we\u2019re married you get to live in the way you\u2019re so accustomed to. I may not have been good enough for you ten years ago but I\u2019m worth far more than your father ever was now,\u201d he snarled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your money or what you can give me; I\u2019m not the one wanting to get married. I think we could find another solution,\u201d she snapped and let out a sigh of frustration. She was getting far angrier the more he lashed out at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, where\u2019s the guest room?\u201d he asked, as he rubbed his hand through his hair for the hundredth time. She showed him the room and then dragged herself off to her own, feeling defeated and more drained than she ever had in her life.</p><p>Jasmine figured she\u2019d climb into bed and lay there awake all night. She was grateful when her heavy eyes closed and she felt oblivion overtaking her.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jacob yelled, as he came skidding into her room at the crack of dawn. Her first thought was, why did she keep getting woken so horribly early and then panic started to overcome her at the look of complete devastation on her child\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Jacob said as tears started streaming down his face and he crawled in the bed next to her to sob on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay baby, he\u2019s here, he\u2019s just in the other room, he hasn\u2019t left,\u201d she said, as one of her own tears escaped. She hated to see her son in pain for any reason but the unbearable heartbreak of him thinking his father was gone was the most horrible thing she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cHey bud, are you okay?\u201d Derek said, as he stepped into the room and saw Jacob sobbing in her arms. He looked up and the tears stopped instantly, as a huge grin overtook his face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave,\u201d Jacob exclaimed, as he jumped from the bed and threw his arms around his father. Derek picked him up and sat down on her bed. She scrambled up into a sitting position and pulled her legs up to her chest, hugging them tightly. Derek looked over at her with an expression that seemed to say, I told you there was no other answer. She knew he was right.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you then?\u201d Jacob asked, as he looked from his father to his mother.</p> <p>\u201cI was sleeping in the other room, bud,\u201d Derek said as if that would satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cBut mom and dad\u2019s sleep together. Maryanne says when her mom and dad stopped sleeping in the same bed they stopped being married and then her dad found a new person that Maryanne has to call mom even though she doesn\u2019t like her. She says she has to have two houses and doesn\u2019t get to be with her mom and dad together anymore,\u201d he said in the longest speech she\u2019d ever heard him give. Then his tears started to fall again as he thought about it.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I aren\u2019t going to live in separate houses Jacob. We figured things out last night and decided neither of us could stand to be away from you. We will stay together and be a real family,\u201d Derek said and tried to get his son to stop crying.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d Jacob asked with a hiccup.</p><p>\u201cI promise you that. As a matter of fact you can be my best man when we get married,\u201d Derek added.</p><p>\u201cReally? Do I get to wear a tux...tux...Oh I can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re called,\u201d Jacob said and blew his breath out with frustration.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a tuxedo and if that\u2019s what you want to wear then that\u2019s what we will wear. We will have matching tuxes,\u201d Derek promised.</p><p>\u201cAnd will mom get to wear her princess dress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf she wants,\u201d Derek replied.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t need to wear a princess dress. We\u2019re just having a small wedding and I would look silly wearing a big poufy dress,\u201d she said. She was actually really disappointed to settle for a justice of the peace wedding. She\u2019d always dreamed of her wedding day looking like a fairy tale. She\u2019d learned the hard way long ago, fairy tales didn\u2019t always come true, though.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom...hold on,\u201d he interrupted himself, then jumped from the bed and ran out of the room. Jasmine looked at Derek and shrugged her shoulders. She didn\u2019t know what he was up too.</p><p>Jacob came running back into the room and she saw the familiar book about two seconds too late. She made a grab for it but Jacob had already crawled back onto Derek\u2019s lap and opened the cover. Jasmine could feel her face flushing as Derek looked at a book that basically told him her dreams.</p><p>\u201cJacob, your dad doesn\u2019t want to look at that,\u201d she said as she tried to grab the book again.</p><p>\u201cYou do, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jacob said as he looked up at Derek.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said. He\u2019d agree with anything Jacob asked. The kid could probably get a brand new motorcycle from him if he just asked. She\u2019d have to talk about that with him. Instead of arguing, she sat back and glared at Derek as he gave her a look with his brows raised.</p><p>\u201cSee, Dad, this is the dress mom wants to wear. She said when she got married it would be like a fairy tale book and she\u2019d be the princess marrying her prince and I got to be the young prince. She said she was going to one day find a frog and give him a kiss and then he\u2019d become her prince and rescue her from the castle. I guess that means you\u2019re the frog,\u201d Jacob said and then broke out in giggles.</p><p>Derek looked through the pages of the book and felt like he was somehow intruding into her thoughts. She had pictures and notes of everything she wanted for her dream wedding. He got to the back of the book and raised his brows at her one more time, as there were pictures of what she wanted to wear on the honeymoon. She had excellent taste and his mouth watered as he pictured her in a few of the outfits.</p><p>\u201cSee, she has to have a fairy tale princess wedding. She made me listen to a ton of those girlie princess books. She told me it was to teach me how to be the perfect prince for my own princess. I don\u2019t like girls but mom says that will change. I really think she\u2019s wrong cause girls have coodies. It\u2019s okay if dads like girls though,\u201d he said as if he was bestowing his greatest wisdom.</p><p>\u201cWe will give your mom the fairy tale wedding then. You can help me to make sure everything is right, can\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. Jacob\u2019s eyes widened in awe as his father bestowed that honor on him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jacob said with his most serious expression.</p><p>\u201cGood then, that\u2019s all settled. Do you want some breakfast?\u201d Derek asked, as he tucked the book under his arm.</p><p>\u201cI can take that,\u201d Jasmine said and held out her hand. Derek ignored her and walked out of the room with her book, leaving her alone, irritated and feeling a bit left out.</p><p>She was tempted to crawl back down under the covers and fall asleep again but she knew she was far too stressed to even close her eyes.</p><p>She threw the blankets back, like a child having a tantrum and stomped into the bathroom. She decided she didn\u2019t like men very much right then. She took her time in the shower and then finally decided to face the day and walked out to the kitchen with her head held high.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cI know you really like your house but it\u2019s simply too small. I\u2019m going to contact an agent today and set up some appointments. I did a cursory look last night and there are some really great places on the market I\u2019d like to see. I\u2019d prefer to build my own place but it takes too much time and I want us to get settled as soon as possible,\u201d Derek said, as they were sharing a picnic in the park.</p><p>Jacob was playing soccer with some other kids, leaving them alone together for the first time that day. Her whole body tensed at his words. She liked her home. She knew it was small but she\u2019d been paying for it all on her own and she didn\u2019t want to give it up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sell my place,\u201d she said, while crossing her arms and glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sell it. You can rent it out if you want or just let it sit empty. I can hire a cleaning crew to come in once a week to make sure it doesn\u2019t get moldy or damaged,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a choice?\u201d she snapped at him. She knew the place was too small and she knew they would be more comfortable with extra space but her world was being uprooted and she felt like she had no control over anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy Jasmine; I\u2019m trying to do the right thing for my son. How does me wanting to watch him grow make me the enemy?\u201d he asked her with exasperation.</p><p>When he worded it like that she felt like the bad guy. It wasn\u2019t fair he was twisting things around. She was going to have to get over her feelings of betrayal over him walking away from her, or the next nine years of her life were going to seem like forever.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m being difficult but you have to realize Jacob and I have been fine for the past nine years and it\u2019s hard to change,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cCan we call a truce for now, for the sake of our son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good to me,\u201d she answered, wanting some peace.</p><p>Derek made a few calls while Jacob was playing and within the hour he had appointments at six different locations. She was amazed at the speed the man was able to get things done.</p><p>Jacob came running up to them and dove into the food. All his playing made him very hungry.</p><p>\u201cHey buddy, want to go look at some houses?\u201d Derek asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob asked, with no interest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find a bigger place to live so you have more room to play,\u201d Derek told him. Jacob was very interested after that. He couldn\u2019t wait to leave the park and look at houses. The first few they went to left Jasmine in awe. She\u2019d grown up in the biggest house of her town and she thought it was fancy but it didn\u2019t compare to the places they were looking at now.</p><p>Each house had electronic gates, requiring a key pad to even enter the driveway. The homes were enormous and she was afraid she\u2019d lose Jacob if they moved into one of them. She was making sure he didn\u2019t leave her sight as they toured each one. She didn\u2019t know what Derek was looking for but the places weren\u2019t holding his interest. She was actually grateful for that. She was hoping the other places were scaled down a bit.</p><p>Each time they left one of the places the real estate agent seemed disappointed but Jasmine was impressed with how well she covered that. Jasmine was sure the woman was going to make a killing off of the commission if Derek purchased one of the homes, as their price tag was in the millions.</p><p>The forth house they went to had a similar gated drive and was just as big as the others but seemed a bit different to her. It didn\u2019t seem as cold, like the people who lived there, were perhaps more real. It was a colonial style that had a huge three story entranceway that was done in white rock. The door was big enough to drive a truck through, she thought, as they entered.</p><p>\u201cThis home is only three years old and was built to entertain. The man and his wife had it custom built but he has to go back overseas for a few years and they decided to go ahead and sell because he\u2019s not sure where they will be when they come back. I know his wife is saddened to leave this spectacular home,\u201d the agent began.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much to offer, as you can see from just walking in the front doors. Some key features of the home is the property contains twenty useable acres, a full sized tennis court, a full size outdoor and indoor basketball court, along with both outdoor and indoor pools. Apparently the sellers had teenage kids who also built a paintball course on the south end of the property but if you\u2019d like that to be taken out it would be an easy task,\u201d she said as she eyed Jacob, thinking he might like that feature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nice open room back this way, which can easily be used for conferences, dances, or whatever form of entertainment you would like. It features this beautiful chandelier from Italy they had made specifically for the home,\u201d she continued talking as they walked from room to room. Jasmine was thinking the chandelier was probably worth more than her house.</p><p>\u201cThere are separate living quarters above the garage that many people like to use for either guests or for relatives to live in. It has its own separate entrance for privacy,\u201d she said as she looked at Derek. Jasmine could feel her face heating with anger as she realized she was listing a secret place he could go to for an affair as a selling point. She no longer liked the real estate agent at all and glared at her back as they continued.</p><p>\u201cAlong this hallway are several bedrooms, suitable for children or visitors. Jacob can explore if he\u2019d like but please don\u2019t touch the owners items,\u201d she added as he dashed down the hallway. \u201cThrough this set of doorways is the master suite. You step through here and you have a sitting room, with another door leading into the master bedroom. It features two full size walk in closets, with beautiful cabinets in them. The master bathroom has a Jacuzzi tub, separate walk in shower and steam shower, as well as a sauna. The room has its own private balcony with a gas fireplace, both in the room and on the covered balcony. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s so much more I\u2019m leaving out but if you\u2019re interested I can give you the full listing, which has everything on it,\u201d she droned on.</p><p>The woman did know when to talk and when to be quiet though, because she stepped out of the room and let them take their time looking around. Jasmine hated to admit it but she was impressed. The home was palatial but it had a lot of touches that made it feel more like a home than a hotel and she liked it more than any of the others. She just wished it wasn\u2019t quite so large.</p> <p>\u201cMom, my room is so cool. It has a huge closet, that\u2019s as big as my old bedroom and I found a secret doorway that led somewhere. It was dark and I didn\u2019t have my flashlight, so I couldn\u2019t go in but I really like it mom. I could get so many more posters cause the walls are way tall,\u201d Jacob said as he came running into the room completely out of breath and beyond excited. Derek took one look at Jacob\u2019s face and she could see he had made his decision.</p><p>\u201cThis is the one I want,\u201d Derek said as he turned towards the real estate agent, who was practically drooling on his shoes. Her face lit up with total joy, as she pulled out a stack of papers for him to fill out. Jasmine was sure the woman was glad she\u2019d decided to take a last minute call on her weekend.</p><p>Derek filled in the necessary information, while the agent talked animatedly to Jasmine and Jacob. The woman probably couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there and go celebrate.</p><p>\u201cTell the sellers I will give them a hundred thousand dollars over their asking price if they can be out within a week. I will also pay all closing cost and pay for professional movers to take their things anywhere they wish. They won\u2019t have to pack a single thing; it can be done for them in one day. I want their answer by nine tomorrow morning and I want it in writing. If they can\u2019t meet those terms I will find another place,\u201d Derek told the woman, whose eyes had widened. Jasmine was sure she wasn\u2019t used to dealing with clients like him. She also knew as much as he liked the house, if his terms weren\u2019t met, he\u2019d walk away. She was sure that\u2019s what made him such a fierce businessman. Once he decided on a course of action, he stuck with it, even if that meant he may not always get what he originally wanted.</p><p>\u201cI will let them know but I\u2019m not sure if all the necessary inspections and escrow can get everything done in that amount of time,\u201d she said, afraid she was going to lose the huge commission.</p> <p>\u201cI will speak to my people and there won\u2019t be a problem getting the necessary stuff done. I will be paying cash for this house, so there will be no financing issues. If the sellers agree to my offer, I can have this place ready to close in three days maximum. I was being polite offering them a week to move,\u201d he said, in his authoritative voice. The man had a way of speaking that made people want to jump to do his bidding. He was just so powerful; there was no other word to describe it.</p><p>If he would\u2019ve lived in the past, he would\u2019ve been one of the Gods people idolized, as he wouldn\u2019t have settled for anything less. A shiver ran down her spine as she realized she was going to be marrying him. She\u2019d have to always remember who she was and not fade away behind his shadow. She also had to admit he was incredibly masculine when he asserted his unflinching authority.</p><p>\u201cOkay Mr. Titan, I have all the necessary paperwork to get this started. I will get ahold of the selling agent and hopefully the sellers, this afternoon. I will notify you as soon as they have given a response but I know they have been eager to sell, so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d she said, looking more like the confident agent she had appeared to be when they\u2019d met her a few hours before. She really was trying to maintain her professionalism, which couldn\u2019t have been easy around Derek.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it and will be waiting,\u201d he said as if waiting wasn\u2019t something that was easy for him. They parted ways and headed back towards Jasmine\u2019s home.</p><p>As they pulled up in front of her house, it looked smaller than it ever had to her. She squared her shoulders as she walked in the door. It may be able to fit into the living room of the other home but she\u2019d made it a great place for her and Trevor and there was nothing wrong with it.</p><p>Derek came up behind her and laid his hand on her shoulder. \u201cJasmine I\u2019m really not trying to put your home down, I just do a lot of business from home and need more space. Jacob will also need added security once the press realizes he\u2019s my son. I have a lot of friends and even more enemies. When you take over companies for a living, you make a lot of enemies. I won\u2019t let something happen to my son because some disgruntled person decides to hurt me through my child,\u201d he said, trying to reason with her.</p> <p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d Jasmine said. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, so she went off to her room to be alone for a while.</p><p>The real estate agent called a couple of hours later and was practically giggling as she explained the sellers agreed to his offer. She said she could meet him anywhere he liked the next day to get all the paperwork filled out.</p><p>Derek made an appointment for her to meet them at the offices and Jasmine\u2019s head was practically spinning with how quickly things were moving. It was a Sunday afternoon and Derek had inspections arranged for the following day and escrow scheduled for Friday. They would receive the keys to the house before the following weekend.</p><p>Jacob was squealing in delight at having his own swimming pool, among many other things. He called his best friends up and told them all about it and asked Derek if he could have a party so they could all see his new room. Derek, of course said yes but at least he Jacob to wait a couple of weeks so they could get settled in first.</p><p>Derek offered to have a moving company box up her things and she put her foot down. She didn\u2019t want a stranger to go through her belongings. He actually had the gall to roll his eyes at her. She knew he was thinking she didn\u2019t have anything that they would want but that wasn\u2019t the point. Her things were personal to her and she didn\u2019t want it tainted by a bunch of strangers putting their fingers all over it.</p><p>She knew most of her furniture would end up being donated and that was fine with her. The things she wanted to keep she was keeping and there was nothing he was going to do to stop her.</p><p>The next morning Jacob came rushing back into her room first thing in the morning. She was starting to get used to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and dad sleep in the same room? I thought when moms and dads were married, they wanted to be together?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYour dad and I have been apart for a long time, that\u2019s all,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean he won\u2019t stay?\u201d he asked with his big scared eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo Jacob, I\u2019m not going anywhere, your mom just has too girly of a room, and too small of a bed for your big dad. We\u2019ll share a room in the new house,\u201d Derek said, as he walked in to join them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like how he kept walking into her room, as if he had every right to. Once again she wasn\u2019t going to argue in front of her son, though.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad,\u201d Jacob said, as if everything the man said was gold.</p><p>They all got ready together and Derek insisted on taking his car in the morning. He told her it was ridiculous to take two vehicles. She once again just went with it, since Jacob was so excited to be taken to school by both of his parents.</p><p>\u201cI need to go by my place and gather a few things, since there won\u2019t be time tonight before we have to pick Jacob up,\u201d he told her.</p><p>They pulled up to the luxurious condo complex, which even had a security guard at the front door. Jasmine was ever intimidated by the amount of money Derek had. She missed the boy who used to wear second hand jeans and always had a smile on his face. This new man was so much more cynical of the world around him and took for granted things that the young teenager would have been awed by.</p><p>They walked into his huge condo and though it was nice, it was so cold. There was only one picture in the entire place and it was a much younger version of him with his arms slung around his two cousins. She remembered them well from when they were teenagers. They\u2019d always been able to make her laugh. She smiled at the fond memories.</p><p>\u201cHow are your cousins doing?\u201d she asked him. She imagined they were doing as good as him, because the three had been almost inseparable and there was no way he wouldn\u2019t share his success with them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing great. I just saw Drew the other day and Ryan is off in some other country right now. We all need to get together, it\u2019s been too long,\u201d he said, letting his guard down for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThey always made me laugh,\u201d she said with a fond smile, still looking at the photograph.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re great guys,\u201d he agreed. He packed up some clothing and then led her back down the elevator. They went out to the garage and instead of getting back in the Porsche; he walked up to an SUV. She was a bit jealous as he unlocked it and opened the back end to put his things in. It was a really nice vehicle. She didn\u2019t understand why the man needed two expensive cars when it was just him.</p><p>\u201cI figure we should switch vehicles. The sports car is fun but this has far more room for Jacob,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you mind driving. I have some work I could do on the commute,\u201d he asked, as he tossed the keys to her. He asked but he expected the answer to be yes. She wanted to drive it really badly though, so she didn\u2019t complain. She stepped inside the luxurious interior and noticed there were hardly any miles on it at all.</p><p>\u201cYou must have gotten this pretty recently,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI had it delivered yesterday. I figured we would need it for Jacob and my office manager said this was rated at the top for safety,\u201d he said as if it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cYou purchased a vehicle without even looking at it?\u201d she asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI trust my staff,\u201d he simply said and then buried his head in his lap top. Jasmine just shook her head at how truly different the man was. Money did not concern him anymore at all but when he was a teenager he had talked so much of his dreams and what he planned to do with his life. Times really changed, she thought sadly.</p><p>They arrived at the office and spent the first couple hours going over the applications Jasmine had pre-screened. Derek then had her spend the next couple of hours setting up interviews for the rest of the week. He said he wanted to get things settled quickly, so the company could do as well as it should\u2019ve been doing all along. His statement was offensive but she let it go. She actually agreed with him on a lot of things. Her father had hired some questionable people and the company had been run into the ground.</p><p>The end of the day arrived before she knew it and for once Derek didn\u2019t complain when it was time to leave. It seemed he liked having a son and was eager to pick him up.</p><p>\u201cDerek, when Jacob isn\u2019t doing sports, he gets out of school earlier. I was able to take some of my work home with me before, so I didn\u2019t have to put him in day care. I know you run business differently but I really do work well from home and would like to continue doing that,\u201d she asked him, afraid he was going to go off on her about her not being the owner\u2019s daughter anymore and being entitled to special favors.</p> <p>\u201cYou can quit all together if you would like, of course our son comes first and there\u2019s no need for you to work,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to quit. I enjoy working and I want to make my own money. Just because you have more than any one person needs, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d ever be comfortable spending it. If you don\u2019t want me to work here, then I can begin searching for other work,\u201d she said stubbornly, with her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted to fire you, I just offered for you to be able to spend more time with our son. He will be grown before you know it and I don\u2019t want you filled with regrets,\u201d he said, exasperated. She decided not to respond, because she felt a tightening in her chest at the thought. She really would like to be able to go to the school more often. She\u2019d always been slightly jealous of those room moms helping at the school during the week with their kids. She spent plenty of time with her son and was there for all of his special events but Derek was right that she was also missing out on a lot.</p><p>Jacob came running outside of the school as they pulled up and looked around with an eager expression on his face. He looked right past the SUV, so she stepped outside and called to him. He walked over, with his brows puckered, disappointed the Porsche wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>They stopped by a moving company and loaded the SUV with a bunch of boxes, picked up some take-out and headed toward her house. Jacob helped his dad carry in all the empty boxes and the two men went into her son\u2019s room to begin the massive job of packing his belongings.</p> <p>She stood in the doorway and watched silently for several minutes, enjoying the sound of both of their laughter. They had bonded so closely in only a few short days. She was grateful she\u2019d told her son about his father and he had a great image of the man because he really was a terrific dad. They paused in their packing and Derek tackled Jacob on the bed and tickled him until tears were falling from his eyes, he was laughing so hard.</p><p>Jasmine reluctantly walked away from the room and headed into the kitchen. She put together several boxes and started deciding what she\u2019d keep and what she\u2019d donate. She knew a lot of her things wouldn\u2019t fit in with the new home, so the donation pile seemed to get bigger, while her packed boxes weren\u2019t taking up much room.</p><p>Derek came out every once in a while and hauled her packed boxes out to the garage, where he was making a nice pile. He\u2019d talked her into letting a moving company at least come in and transport the items. She was actually relieved about that as she hated the actual moving portion. She didn\u2019t mind the packing at all, as it was an adventure, discovering items she\u2019d forgotten she even owned.</p><p>There were certain things she wasn\u2019t willing to part with, such as her thousands of books and her mother\u2019s antique china but there were many items she let go of with no qualms. By the end of the night she was exhausted and had barely made a dent in her small home.</p><p>\u201cDerek, there\u2019s no way I will finish all of this in time if I\u2019m working all day. I\u2019m going to need to take the rest of the week off to get it done in time,\u201d she told him, as she sat down on the couch, completely exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing. We really just have a bunch of interviews this week anyway. Take it off and get everything done. I will help you when I get back. Don\u2019t even worry about Jacob, I will stop and pick him up on my way home from work,\u201d he said, sounding just as tired as her. It was really nice to have him there to help with Jacob; she wasn\u2019t used to that at all.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, before crawling off to her room to fall into an exhausted sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The week flew by quickly. Jasmine made incredible progress with her packing and had the local charity stop by twice because the items were piling up and filling her living room. It was a little sad to watch her items slowly being depleted and her home becoming so empty but she felt good getting it all done.</p><p>On Friday morning Derek was signing the final papers and the movers were coming to pick up her things at noon. She woke up with both a feeling of excitement and sadness. She found herself looking forward to moving to the new place. It was all a little bit exciting. The previous owners were already vacated and Derek had sent in the cleaning crew yesterday, so all that was left was getting the keys and moving in.</p><p>Derek went to the office and called her a couple hours later, letting her know all the papers were signed and they were clear to move. He\u2019d be there in an hour to help her with the final things she needed done.</p><p>Jasmine slowly walked around her once homey place and couldn\u2019t stop the tears that streaked down her cheeks. This home had been her and Jacob\u2019s first sense of real security. She had been so proud when she signed her name on those papers and knew the place was hers and no one could take it from her and now she was walking away from it. She felt like she was abandoning her safe house.</p><p>Now everything was in boxes, or gone and she was off to a new adventure. She wiped the tears away and decided she was going to sell it. The thought of returning to this home all by herself was too depressing to even contemplate. She\u2019d walk through the rooms and see Jacob in every corner and now she\u2019d also picture Derek\u2019s massive presence there too. It would break her heart a little when someone else occupied it but at least then it would be loved and new memories could be created.</p><p>She\u2019d tell Derek to make the calls, since he was so good at it. Knowing Derek, it would be sold in a matter of days. The man just had a way of making things happen much faster than the average person could ever accomplish.</p> <p>She composed her features just in time, because Derek stepped through the doors and took a look around. \u201cI guess there really isn\u2019t anything left to do but wait for the movers. I brought some lunch so let\u2019s eat and I will call the company and have them get here early,\u201d he said.</p><p>The moving company showed up about thirty minutes after his call. She was surprised they didn\u2019t just teleport and land on her steps, while he was still on the phone with them.</p><p>The men were professionals and she didn\u2019t have to say or do anything. They had her house loaded into the truck within an hour and were on the road toward the mansion where Derek had someone waiting to let them in. Derek was waiting for her, as she looked around the completely empty house, with a sense of total awe. She looked in every cupboard twice just to make sure she hadn\u2019t forgotten a single item and to draw out her last time in her home for a few more minutes.</p><p>She had to give Derek credit because he didn\u2019t say a word as she drug her feet. He even stepped outside to give her a few more minutes alone. One last tear slipped from her eye and then she squared her shoulders, wiped her face and walked out the front door, shutting it firmly behind her as she said goodbye to her old life.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Derek asked her, as they walked towards their vehicles. It was a rare and tender moment and almost started her tears right back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just a little harder than I thought it would be saying goodbye to this house. I know it\u2019s not much but it has been home for almost nine years,\u201d she said with a little sniffle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great place and you kept it beautiful,\u201d he said a bit awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cThanks Derek, I appreciate it, although I know you don\u2019t really like it,\u201d she said with a slight role of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can always have movers come and bring it to the property if you want. There\u2019s plenty of room,\u201d he said to her. She looked at him, with her mouth hanging open, in astonishment. She could tell he was completely serious. If she asked him, he\u2019d actually pay the ridiculous price to have her home moved, just to make her stop crying.</p><p>She started to giggle at the thought, it was so ridiculous. They only moved houses when they were of historic value, they didn\u2019t move a typical home, just because the person was attached. She laughed even harder when she really thought about how much money the guy spent in a single day. She was sure it was more than she spent in an entire year.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the laugh Derek, I\u2019m feeling so much better now,\u201d she said and then on complete impulse threw her arms around his neck and gave him a hug. She hadn\u2019t initiated contact with him once since they\u2019d reunited. He stiffened for a moment in shock and then wrapped his arms around her, pulling her in tightly.</p><p>She needed the comfort and couldn\u2019t pull back. Derek rubbed along her back and even though he was the reason her life was changing so drastically his comforting hands were making her feel better. She\u2019d later think about the irony of the situation. It was kind of amusing.</p><p>His rubbing stopped being comforting and he started pulling her closer to him as his hand roamed lower with each pass. Her breathing deepened, as his touch started to send fire down her body. He brought one hand up to her chin, lifting her face up. Before she had time to blink, he brought his lips down to hers in a gentle kiss. If he\u2019d been urgent, like he normally was, she may have been able to resist him but with this gentle side of him, she had no chance.</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck and leaned closer to him as he deepened the kiss, making her stomach quiver with need. She wrapped her arms around his neck, enjoying the feel of being held and the taste of his mouth, as he slipped inside. She couldn\u2019t seem to get close enough.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were leaving,\u201d a voice said, bringing her back to reality. Jasmine pulled back from Derek, who looked a little shaken up and turned towards the sound, to find her elderly neighbor standing a few feet from her. Either the woman was oblivious to the embrace she was just in, or didn\u2019t care but she seemed unconcerned she\u2019d interrupted the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYes Mary, it\u2019s all happened so fast that I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about it,\u201d Jasmine told her neighbor, feeling a little guilty about moving without saying goodbye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll sure miss you and precious little Jacob,\u201d the woman murmured.</p><p>\u201cI will miss you too and your wonderful peanut butter cookies,\u201d Jasmine said with a little hitch in her voice. She walked over and gave her neighbor a hug and then said her goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can follow me,\u201d Derek said, as he climbed into his vehicle. She climbed in her own reliable van, which sadly didn\u2019t hold any appeal to her anymore after driving his luxury SUV and followed him out of the driveway. She looked into her rearview mirror until her home fell out of view. She let out a deep sigh and knew her life would be forever changed.</p><p>They pulled up to the new house and Derek entered the code for the gate to open. She drove the long driveway behind him, taking in everything. She\u2019d only been there the one time and so she looked at the place with new eyes, trying to drink it all in.</p> <p>The home was certainly a show piece, with its immaculately manicured lawns. There was a surprising lack of flowers and she vowed to change that as soon as possible but the fountain in the center of the driveway added a nice showpiece, which was both comforting and homey at the same time. She could grow to love the home, that is, if she could figure out how to get from one end to the other.</p><p>She had to park in the driveway, as there were two huge moving vans backed up to the massive garage. There were several men hauling things from the back of the trucks and trudging into the house. Derek and her walked in and the place looked different with the walls all barren and the furniture gone. There were a few pieces of his furniture from the condo but his old place had been much smaller and they were going to have to buy more pieces to fill the place up.</p><p>The house looked better to her though, with all the previous owners\u2019 things out. She could now picture her own belongings filling up the spaces. The more she walked around the empty home, the better she was beginning to feel. She was actually excited to use the swimming pool. It wouldn\u2019t be available for use until the next day, because Derek had brought people in to perform a special cleaning on it, though it had looked spotless to her before. He\u2019d said he wanted to make sure, since his son would be swimming in it. She couldn\u2019t argue with him.</p><p>It only took the movers a few hours to get the trucks unloaded and then they were in the huge place, alone for the first time. She headed straight for the kitchen, excited more for that room, than any other and started to unpack boxes.</p><p>Derek had tried to convince her to let the movers unpack but part of the excitement of moving was to find her treasures and place them where she wanted. She didn\u2019t want the strangers to do it, besides she\u2019d never be able to find anything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pick up Jacob, we\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he told her and she glanced at the clock. She had no idea it had gotten so late.</p><p>\u201cI can go with you,\u201d she offered reluctantly. She really didn\u2019t want to stop what she was doing. By the smile on his face, he could tell.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and continue what you\u2019re doing. It looks like you\u2019re enjoying yourself,\u201d he said and turned to head out.</p><p>\u201cOh look, there are Lazy Susan\u2019s in all the corner cabinets,\u201d she suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThey\u2019re made of really nice wood, too,\u201d she added like a child who\u2019d just discovered a brand new toy.</p><p>Derek looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. The woman wasn\u2019t impressed with the ten million dollar mansion itself but was giddy when she discovered little turning shelves. He just couldn\u2019t understand her. He walked out the door, as she continued to explore all the crevices of the kitchen. He was actually warmed by her love of the smaller things and was trying to fight the tugging on his heart.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen so hard for her when he was a teenager, because even though she was the wealthiest kid in town, she\u2019d never lorded it over anyone, unlike her father. She\u2019d always preferred a pair of worn in jeans and a t-shirt over the latest styles. She\u2019d seemed far more like him than the other snobby kids.</p> <p>It seemed not much had changed, if he looked at her home, vehicle and possessions. She owned nice things but nothing screamed extravagance. As a matter of fact, her son had far more items in his small space than she did. It was very obvious she loved and spoiled Jacob. He knew how much salary she made as well and it was ridiculously low for what she did. Her own father hadn\u2019t given her a raise the entire time she\u2019d been there. He\u2019d assumed that was all just on the books and her dad was supplementing her on the side but from the way she lived, he no longer believed that.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t the cold person he\u2019d thought her to be when she sent her dad to say her goodbyes. Maybe there was another reason the whole thing had happened. He was determined to find out what those reasons were, even if it broke the semi-truce they\u2019d started to share together.</p><p>He reached the school and Jacob was out on the curb and jumped into the vehicle, barely before he had it stopped. He was talking a million miles a minute and couldn\u2019t contain his excitement to go to the new house.</p><p>He was asking if all his things had arrived yet and if the pool was ready to swim in. He wanted to know if Derek had gotten him a basketball and if they could buy a new puppy. Derek answered every question he could but he didn\u2019t know if Jacob even heard him, because he\u2019d fire another one off before he\u2019d even finished speaking.</p><p>He found himself grinning widely as he enjoyed the enthusiasm pouring out of his son. At least he had made one of the pair happy with his purchase. He had a feeling Jasmine was going to become just as attached to the home though, if her excitement over the kitchen was any indication.</p><p>He barely got parked in the garage, before Jacob jumped from the vehicle and ran through the door. He heard him yelling a greeting to his mother, before he heard his footsteps fading away as he ran up the stairs. It was amazing the kid remembered how to get around.</p><p>\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t get lost,\u201d Jasmine said with some concern, as she stared at the tornado of energy her son had just left behind.</p><p>\u201cWell then we could play Marco polo,\u201d Derek answered with a laugh. She looked at him for a moment and then caved in and let the amusement take over as she laughed with him. \u201cI will make sure he found his room and then see what I can do to get the place straightened up,\u201d he said as he disappeared. Jasmine didn\u2019t see either of the boys for a couple hours, as they all got lost in their different projects.</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cWell look who\u2019s coming up in the world,\u201d Drew said into the speaker, as he waited for the gate to be opened.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me, I thought I was hiding,\u201d Derek replied. He\u2019d been wondering who was buzzing him.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s always easy to find my prey,\u201d Drew replied.</p><p>\u201cHey open up this gate before I climb over it and kick your sorry butt,\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice spoke into the microphone.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck did you bring him for?\u201d Derek said, as he pushed in the combo for the gate to open. He walked out the front door and waited for his cousins to exit the truck.</p><p>\u201cNice place, got an extra room?\u201d Ryan said, as he came up the stairs and slapped Derek on the back.</p><p>\u201cSure, I do need to hire a gardener,\u201d Derek replied, which earned him another punch.</p><p>\u201cHeck someone is growing up to be a real boy, you got the house, the kid and soon a wife, whatever happened to our vows of being bachelor\u2019s forever,\u201d Drew said as he made himself comfortable and walked through the doors.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I don\u2019t think you have enough room,\u201d Ryan called out, with a low whistle, as he took the place in.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Ryan, your net worth is equal, if not more than mine,\u201d Derek replied with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell yeah it\u2019s more than yours, because I haven\u2019t spent it all for one house,\u201d the man replied with an evil grin. He knew the money hadn\u2019t even dipped into what Derek had.</p><p>They made their way out towards the back and the sound of Jacob splashing in the water. He spotted the two men and his eyes filled with curiosity. Derek considered them both more like his brothers and introduced them to Jacob as his uncles. Jacob was ecstatic to find he had uncles, since his mom was an only child and he had little family.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have extra trunks, because I\u2019m getting in that water one way or the other and I don\u2019t want to make you look bad in front of your fianc\u00e9 by showing her how lacking you are,\u201d Drew said with a waggle of his eyebrows.</p><p>This time Derek punched him in the arm and then directed him to the changing area next to the pool, that was already stacked with extra suits. His two cousins changed quickly and soon the four boys were having a splashing war that had Jacob giggling uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cSo where is Jasmine, I haven\u2019t seen her in forever?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cShe had to go pick up some groceries so we could eat. Jacob, here, is a bottomless pit. Apparently he doesn\u2019t like grocery shopping though,\u201d Derek said fondly. He hated to go food shopping himself. He couldn\u2019t wait to get a staff hired to take care of it all.</p><p>They played in the pool a while longer and then finally dragged themselves out, with reluctance. They got changed and then helped Derek get things unpacked. There was a floor to ceiling library Jasmine had about cried over. He wanted to surprise her, by getting all her books loaded up onto it. The room was pretty great, with a wood fireplace and a huge window with a seat in it. They were going to spend the week shopping for furniture to fill this room, along with many others.</p><p>With his cousins there helping him, they had the library and living room unpacked in no time. They even managed to get most of the artwork hung on the walls. He looked around, feeling pretty good about their progress.</p><p>They\u2019d just sat down, when he heard the garage door open. He stood up to help Jasmine carry in the groceries and Drew and Ryan followed him.</p><p>When they stepped out into the garage Jasmine saw them and her entire face lit up. \u201cDrew, Ryan it\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d she said, as she ran towards them and threw her arms around one and then the other.</p><p>\u201cJasmine you\u2019re looking more gorgeous than possible. Are you sure you want to stay with this bum, I think I can convince him the kid\u2019s mine and we can run away together,\u201d Drew offered her with an evil grin towards his cousin.</p><p>\u201cDrew I have so missed your sense of humor. You have to tell me everything you\u2019ve been up to for the last ten years. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a trail of heartbroken women in your wake,\u201d she said with a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah Drew is just a barrel of laughs,\u201d Derek said, not loving that Jasmine was so open and easy with Drew and so withdrawn from him.</p><p>The guys grabbed groceries and set them on the counter so she could get it put away. They sat on the counters so they could continue talking to her while she put items where they belonged and then begin making dinner.</p><p>Soon spectacular smells were surrounding all the men and she had to push them out of the kitchen, because they wouldn\u2019t quit picking at things. \u201cYou guys go play for a while and I will let you know when everything is ready,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cWe may wither away and it will all be your fault,\u201d Ryan said before jumping down and exiting the kitchen. She finished her salad and had the casserole in the oven, so she decided to go work on the library. She was really anxious to get it all put together. She couldn\u2019t wait until the day the shelves were filled from top to bottom. It would take many years but part of the fun was adding new additions to it each week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked in the room and gasped. The guys had unpacked everything and it looked so good. They\u2019d even put proper books together. She only found a few were out of place. She walked back into the living room, where they were sitting and gave Derek a huge hug, which surprised him.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for putting all the books up, I know it must\u2019ve been a bit of a pain, since I have so many of them,\u201d she gushed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I wanted you to start feeling at home. I know this house is a little intimidating,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt was very sweet of you,\u201d she said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHey we helped to, where\u2019s our hugs,\u201d Ryan said with a wicked grin. She went over and hugged both him and Drew. Derek glared at his cousins, as they held on a little bit too long to be appropriate. He knew his cousins would never actually try and take his woman but he also knew the men liked to raise his blood pressure and they were doing a fine job.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to go shopping at all the used book stores and fill those shelves up,\u201d she said eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI bet you have them filled up within a week and then will have us over here building you more shelves,\u201d Drew said. Jasmine had always been an avid reader in school. She never went anywhere without at least one book in her bag, for just in case she ended up stuck somewhere. If she had a book, she had a constant form of entertainment.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get one of those super cushiony couches so I can go in there and fall asleep with a good book,\u201d she said a bit dreamily.</p><p>\u201cOh Cuz, it looks like you\u2019re getting replaced by a good couch and some book hero,\u201d Ryan teased him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re both about to be booted out without dinner,\u201d Derek threatened them. They knew he was all talk and they didn\u2019t look the least bit concerned.</p><p>The timer on the oven went off and the men immediately headed for the dining room. Luckily Derek had a huge table already and there was plenty of room for all of them. She had the men carry the dishes to the table and then watched in amazement, as everything she made disappeared in no time at all.</p><p>\u201cThis is good, Mom,\u201d Jacob said. The men quickly agreed with him, in between bites. She felt pretty great, because the kitchen was a dream to cook in and her company had enjoyed her meal.</p><p>\u201cSeriously you should open a restaurant,\u201d Drew told her.</p><p>\u201cI would never want to do that, because then it would be work and no longer a joy and right now I love to cook, especially when it\u2019s for people who like it,\u201d she answered him.</p><p>\u201cWell I can come over every night, so you have an audience,\u201d Ryan offered.</p> <p>\u201cAnytime you want,\u201d she said, meaning it. She really did care about both of Derek\u2019s cousins and was so glad to have them in her life again. It was like everything had come full circle. Maybe it was time to let the past go and focus on the here and now. Derek was an amazing father and he was being good to her.</p><p>She had to be careful with her heart though, because he\u2019d already told her they would only be together long enough for their son to grow up. If she got too attached, it would destroy her when she was kicked from her home and her life.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d Drew said, after they finished off their dessert. Jasmine looked at Derek, because they\u2019d never discussed a time frame.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get settled into the house first so I think in about a month. That would give you enough time right, Jasmine?\u201d Derek asked, putting all the pressure on her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d she answered him, feeling a bit of her panic come back.</p><p>\u201cWell then it\u2019s settled. We will get married four weeks from today. A Saturday is always a good one to do it on right?\u201d he asked her once again.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine but honestly it doesn\u2019t need to be anything fancy. We can just go to the justice of the peace or something. Jacob could still wear a tuxedo there,\u201d she pleaded. She didn\u2019t need to keep adding more memories that would hurt all the more when things were completely over.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get married like that. This is your wedding. You\u2019ll want pictures and cake and of course your guests all want food,\u201d Drew said, which surprised her. He was the known playboy and he was talking about a wedding. It didn\u2019t seem to fit.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re having a real wedding,\u201d Derek said and then almost glared at her; like he was offended she\u2019d even mentioned doing it any other way.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to make things simpler,\u201d she said guiltily.</p><p>\u201cWe better head out, I\u2019m leaving for a business trip tomorrow,\u201d Drew said, as he stood up. \u201cThank you for the amazing meal Jasmine, I can\u2019t wait to get back for some more,\u201d he told her and then bent down to kiss her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much, everything was great. It was awesome to meet you young man and we will be back to teach you some more bad habits,\u201d Ryan added and gave Jacob a hug.</p><p>Derek walked them to the door and then the house suddenly seemed so much emptier without them in it. They had a way of bringing life wherever they were. She figured some things never changed.</p><p>They were all tired and took Jacob to his room. They both took turns reading him his story and then left the room. Jasmine had been so tired the night before she\u2019d fallen asleep with Jacob while she read him a story. She realized she had no idea where she was supposed to sleep.</p><p>She stepped out into the hallway and was unsure which direction to go. \u201cProblems?\u201d Derek asked, not making things easier on her.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know which room I\u2019m sleeping in. I\u2019ve been so busy, I haven\u2019t even had time to explore where everything has been placed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew where the master bedroom was,\u201d he said as he continued to stare at her. She looked at him like a deer in a headlight. She wasn\u2019t ready to fall back into bed with him but they\u2019d been getting along and she didn\u2019t want the truce to end. She didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Derek grabbed her by the arms and kissed her mindlessly, as he molded their bodies together. He had her breathing heavily and her mind a complete blank. She could so easily cave into her own needs and his as well.</p><p>He let her go just as suddenly as he had grabbed her and glared down at her. \u201cI have never had to force a woman to be with me and I\u2019m not forcing you. You take the master room and I will take one of the guest rooms, for now. You\u2019ll beg me to join you soon, though,\u201d he said with an arrogance that had her teeth grinding together.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d she stormed and then walked away from him and shut the door in his face. Derek thought about going after her for about a minute, before he realized that would just end up with them in bed again, with nothing solved.</p><p>He could bide his time for a little while longer but if she didn\u2019t come to him soon then he\u2019d implode. He strode to the far end of the hall and walked into the only other room with a bed in it. He jumped in the shower and froze his erection away, before climbing into her small bed. He laid there for hours, picturing her in his huge four poster, king sized bed, which made him hard and miserable again. It didn\u2019t help at all with her scent seeming to be soaked into the bed and surrounding him. He groaned as he tossed and turned.</p><p>They had to come to an understanding before too long, or he wasn\u2019t going to make it. His body just couldn\u2019t take the pain.</p><p>Jasmine slept unbelievably well. She felt a tiny bit of guilt over taking Derek\u2019s bed but what a bed it was. It was huge and comfortable and the sheets and covers were soft and silky. She had laid down, thinking she\u2019d be awake for hours but the next thing she knew it was morning. She stretched out her arms and realized she had no aches anywhere. She was thinking she should\u2019ve bought a bed like this years ago.</p><p>She took a long shower in the master bathroom and was delighted when four different heads all applied varying amounts of pressure over her body. She stayed in there for about an hour and the hot water never ran out. She couldn\u2019t wait to try out the deep tub with the jets.</p><p>Jasmine came down the stairs to find Jacob and Derek sitting at the table, eating some cereal. Jacob was his usual talkative self, sputtering about his new room and how he couldn\u2019t wait to have his friends over. She smiled to see her son so happy and excited.</p><p>Derek looked up at her and she almost gasped out loud at how rumpled he looked. He had dark circles under his eyes, like he hadn\u2019t slept at all and his clothing was even wrinkled. She didn\u2019t know what to say, considering she\u2019d slept better than she ever had in his comfortable bed, while he looked like he had tossed and turned the entire night.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she finally said, almost singing the words, she felt so good. Derek said nothing; it was more of a grumble. She had to fight the laughter. He was even gorgeous grumpy, rumpled and snarling.</p><p>She cleaned up their breakfast mess, enjoying the high tech appliances in the kitchen. She wanted to get more groceries so she could do a bunch of baking. She couldn\u2019t wait to smell the sweetness of pumpkin bread scenting the house.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave soon, I want to go to the furniture store, so we can fill up this place,\u201d Derek finally said. He was on his second cup of coffee and seemed to be looking a little bit more alert.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun,\u201d Jasmine said. She really wasn\u2019t all that interested in furniture shopping. She\u2019d rather get groceries or books but she didn\u2019t think it was a good time to mention that, not in his current mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go change, it looks like you\u2019re ready so give me about a half hour and we\u2019ll take off,\u201d he said, as he practically stomped out of the kitchen.</p><p>Derek came down the stairs, still with dark circles but looking as gorgeous as ever in what he considered as his casual clothes. He was wearing dark slacks and a white button down shirt. He looked unbelievably good and it took everything in her not to run her hands up his body.</p><p>Jasmine and Jacob followed him out to the SUV and soon they were off towards town. He pulled the car off the road and parked near a huge furniture store. The building had to be at least three stories high. She got out and started to follow them towards the doors, when she spotted a second hand book store a few doors down. It was huge and calling her name.</p><p>\u201cCan I meet you guys in the furniture store?\u201d she asked. He raised his brows in question. \u201cThere\u2019s a book store over there I want to check out. I should only be a few minutes,\u201d she almost pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to buy used books. I can buy you whatever you want, new,\u201d he said, perplexed that she\u2019d want to buy second hand books.</p><p>\u201cOh no, there are treasures in there, Derek. You can find autographed copies and discontinued books. You can find original covers and ancient copies. It\u2019s a total treasure hunt in a used book store,\u201d she explained to him, with genuine excitement pouring out of her.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want too...\u201d he said, like he couldn\u2019t imagine the excitement.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Go ahead and pick out whatever you want for the house. Just leave the library for last please. Oh and please don\u2019t get anything that is black, or any brown fabric and I really don\u2019t like leather because makes you sweaty when you sit on it. Other than that I don\u2019t care how we furnish,\u201d she said in one breath. She really wanted to get to that store. Derek nodded to her and she turned and rushed through the book store\u2019s doors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Derek watched her as she disappeared and then looked at Jacob like she was crazy. \u201cMom always gets like that when she finds a new book store. She will be in there all day. I usually try and find a book to read in one of their comfy chairs, cause I know it will take forever. She always feels bad about how long she\u2019s taking though, cause she buys me a big ice cream sundae afterwards,\u201d Jacob said, trying to decide if it was worth it to follow his mom.</p><p>\u201cI will take you out for ice cream and you won\u2019t have to sit in the bookstore all day,\u201d Derek said, as if reading his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jacob said, clearly making his choice and following his dad into the huge furniture store. \u201cCan I have a new bed? I know my bed is good but I\u2019ve had it forever and I really want to get a bunk bed so my friends have somewhere to sleep,\u201d Jacob pleaded with him.</p><p>\u201cYou can have all new furniture for your room. You\u2019re a big boy and it\u2019s time you got a desk and new dresser and other things that fit you better,\u201d Derek said, not able to deny his son a single thing. \u201cLet\u2019s go get your stuff picked out first,\u201d he finished and grabbed Jacob\u2019s hand.</p> <p>Derek was starting to feel better as he watched Jacob\u2019s excitement over his new things. The kid was so enthusiastic and excited about everything and Derek was humbled by Jacob\u2019s appreciation of everything he got.</p><p>Derek realized Jasmine hadn\u2019t spoiled him in a bad way. Jacob was a good boy in so many ways. He was appreciative of things and always polite to everyone around him. He was so unlike other children and he was really starting to realize Jasmine wasn\u2019t the materialistic person he\u2019d once thought she was.</p><p>Her choice in furniture was another example of who she was. She didn\u2019t want the exquisite leather showpiece furniture. She wanted something that was comfortable for her and her guests. She didn\u2019t care about what people saw when they walked into the room, she cared they were comfortable. She was going to be a breath of fresh air, in a world of corporate sharks.</p><p>They soon had the furniture ordered for every room in the house except the library and Derek realized three hours had passed and he still hadn\u2019t seen Jasmine. \u201cHave you seen your mom yet?\u201d Derek asked Jacob.</p><p>\u201cI told you. She forgot how much time has gone by, like she always does,\u201d Jacob said, with a role of his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find her,\u201d Derek said with a slight smile. It was kind of endearing she got so lost with her books.</p><p>They walked into the bookstore and found Jasmine at the checkout counter and there were about four overflowing bags at her feet and two more on the counter. He looked from her to the bags and back again. She spotted them as the cashier ran her credit card.</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry it took so long, I lost track of time but they were having a great sale and there are just so many books here,\u201d she explained quickly and then looked from her bags to them with a guilty expression.</p><p>\u201cWe better start hauling these out to the car,\u201d Derek said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know I spent too much and I\u2019m sorry but those empty shelves need to be filled and they had such a great sale,\u201d she said, following him with two of her own bags. He was going to have to make another trip.</p><p>He was really curious about what her idea of too much money was. \u201cHow much did this all cost you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Her face turned red and he was thinking she spent several thousand dollars. He really didn\u2019t care. \u201cTwo hundred and twenty dollars,\u201d she mumbled. He could barely here her and asked her to repeat herself. When she did, he stopped and stared at her. She was feeling guilty about spending two hundred dollars on books.</p><p>He started laughing, quietly at first and then it just kept building up until he was doubled over, he was laughing so hard. He was trying to stop and couldn\u2019t. His stomach was hurting, he was shaking so much. It took him about five minutes to get himself under control enough to speak and by that time Jasmine was glaring daggers at him and Jacob was smiling like he enjoyed the sound.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what you find so amusing,\u201d she snapped at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re standing there with a guilty expression on your face from spending two hundred dollars on books. Seriously Jasmine, one of the stools we bought today cost twice that amount,\u201d he said, still chuckling.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever,\u201d she huffed and then headed towards the furniture store. She was glad he wasn\u2019t trying to guilt her over the purchase but he didn\u2019t need to laugh at her. Her father had always told her she wasted her money on books. He couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d want to read all that nonsense, as he\u2019d put it. She loved to sink into her fantasy worlds and she didn\u2019t care what anyone had to say about it.</p><p>Derek and Jacob quickly caught up with her and although Derek was no longer openly laughing, she could still see the sparkle in his eyes and knew he was fighting it. She finally smiled, realizing that it was a little silly of her to be so uptight. She relaxed and then had a good time finding her furniture.</p><p>She had to like the fabric, first of all, and tested the different couches by touch. When she found a material she liked, she\u2019d sit on it and see how comfortable it was. She must have done that with a hundred couches before she found the one she was searching for. The other furniture was easier to find and soon they were done.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what strings Derek was able to pull but they were delivering everything the next day. She couldn\u2019t wait to get the library all set up.</p> <p>By the time they got back home the three of them were dragging their feet. It had been a busy day but a very successful one. Jasmine was kind of bummed to have to return to work the next morning. She was enjoying putting her new home together and didn\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Over the next several weeks the tension between Jasmine and Derek was escalating. He continued to let her have the master bedroom on her own but she was finding it was very lonely in the huge room by herself. She was afraid he may end up winning once again and she was going to beg him to join her.</p><p>They\u2019d been planning the wedding together but for the most part he was doing everything. Her dress was being made for her and she had several fittings. She was in love with it and actually really excited for the finished product. She didn\u2019t know how Derek had managed to get it done but the designer was making the dress almost identical to the picture she had. Jasmine had taken pieces from several different photos of dresses she liked and pieced it together. The designer was phenomenal and she couldn\u2019t wait to wear it.</p><p>She and Derek started taking separate vehicles to the offices, as he was spending his time between the main office and his newest take-over. As the new people got hired and into place, he was only coming in about one day a week. He was also getting back to the house later and later. Jacob was beginning to complain to him.</p><p>He told Jacob he promised to be home more once he was done working on a new business deal but Jasmine thought there was a lot more to it than that. She thought she\u2019d be happy about not having to see him so much but she\u2019d gotten used to him being around and now that he was disappearing she felt abandoned in her huge home.</p><p>She tried to make the best of the situation and entertained Jacob as much as possible. He had his sleepover and about ten boys came and spent the night. They were in love with the swimming pool and basketball court and couldn\u2019t figure out which to do first.</p><p>They went from activity to activity until they were exhausted and crashed in the den, watching scary movies and filling up on junk food.</p><p>Jasmine continued to keep busy with her son and the wedding and soon almost an entire month had passed. Her wedding was coming up in a few more days and she was terrified. She\u2019d barely spoken to Derek since they had moved in and she noticed she\u2019d actually seek him out and find reasons to be in the same room. He didn\u2019t seem to feel the same way. It was breaking her heart all over again.</p><p>It seemed to be the same story as when she was only an eighteen year old girl. He\u2019d gotten what he wanted, so he didn\u2019t want to be around her anymore. She was starting to really panic about the whole situation. She was already getting dependent on him once again and she knew Jacob was and she didn\u2019t know if she was going to be able to pick up the pieces this time if he left them.</p><p>Jasmine was sitting in the library reading, which wasn\u2019t unusual. Jacob was at a sleepover and Derek was at the office, late once again. The buzzer sounded alerting her someone wanted in the gate.</p><p>She knew it couldn\u2019t be Drew or Ryan, as they had the code but she couldn\u2019t figure out who else would be there so late in the evening. She got up and answered the ringing.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked, still feeling a little silly speaking into a box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Amy. I have some materials for Derek,\u201d said the sexy female voice.</p><p>Jasmine couldn\u2019t understand why Derek would ever let one of his ex-girlfriends come to her house but she figured he didn\u2019t care if he threw the woman in her face. She opened the gate and just hoped she was in and out quickly.</p><p>Jasmine met her at the door, because she wanted the visit ended soon. The woman looked like every man\u2019s fantasy come to life in her incredibly short skirt, skin tight blouse and heels making her legs look like they were endless. She had red nails to match her red lipstick and Jasmine felt a bit intimidated, as she was standing there in her sweats, without make-up and her hair thrown back in a very messy bun.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing this over. I\u2019ll give them to Derek as soon as he gets home,\u201d Jasmine said, as she held out her hand to take the items.</p><p>\u201cOh, he hasn\u2019t made it back yet?\u201d the woman said, as if she knew exactly why he wasn\u2019t there. Jasmine narrowed her eyes, no longer even pretending to be friendly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be home anytime,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m meeting him here. We do have a lot of business to take care of, so I\u2019m sure you can find something else to do,\u201d she suggested in a manner that implied her and Derek had a lot more to do than business. Jasmine\u2019s first instinct was to toss the woman out on her doorstep, with her fist but she was a better person than that.</p><p>\u201cFine, you can wait in the den,\u201d Jasmine said through gritted teeth. She decided if he was going to bring his tramps into the house this wouldn\u2019t work. She was going to give him a piece of her mind later.</p><p>She lay down in the library to wait for him to come home and sleep finally overtook her. When she woke it was three in the morning. She sat up quickly and looked out the window. She was relieved to see Amy\u2019s car was gone but still angry he\u2019d asked the woman to her house. There were just some boundaries you didn\u2019t cross.</p><p>She climbed up the stairs and went to his room. He wasn\u2019t in there, so instead of searching the house from top to bottom, she decided to get some sleep and then confront him in the morning.</p><p>She quickly undressed and climbed beneath the covers. She felt a movement and was startled to find Derek in her bed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she snapped, as she tried to jump from the bed. She was far too angry with him to do anything.</p><p>\u201cI got sick of waiting for you to come to me and I\u2019m tired of your bed,\u201d he said, as he snaked his arm out to grab her before she could move away. When he realized she was completely naked, he groaned in pleasure and then she felt his lips connect with hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The second he started kissing her, she could feel her own body\u2019s response. She attempted one more time to pull away but he simply increased the pressure of his mouth while his hands started rubbing over her curves.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t been together in a month and she was just as hungry as he was. She gave up the fight and wrapped her hands around his head to pull him closer to her. She was burning and needed him to take it away. She forgot all about her worries and just let her body\u2019s desire take over.</p><p>Derek kept his mouth locked on hers, thrusting his tongue in and around her mouth. She could feel the heat pooling in her core. He was pressed to her side and she could feel his engorged arousal pressed against her hip. Her need was overwhelming, wanting him inside her.</p><p>He moved his lips down her neck and licked along her pounding pulse, making her body squirm beneath him. His hands were rubbing slowly up and down her body and when he brushed over her hardened nipple, her back arched off the bed, desiring so much more.</p><p>He finally moved down the mounds of her breasts and kissed all around the spot she needed him to touch. His tongue ran around the outer layers of her throbbing nipples and she tried to twist in his direction, so he\u2019d take the bud into his mouth.</p><p>He finally did as her body was asking him too and sucked the tightened bud into his mouth, causing a ripple of lightening to shoot all the way to her core. She could feel the heat pooling and getting ready for his erection to push inside her.</p><p>He massaged her breasts with his hands while he sucked and licked the swollen buds. She continued to wiggle underneath him, until he finally moved down her stomach and then she couldn\u2019t stop the shacking that was overtaking her body. He moved down her smooth surface and finally reached the throbbing core of her body.</p><p>As his tongue swiped out to caress her folds, she could feel the pressure building inside her. He sucked her sensitive nub into his mouth and she jerked with the powerful orgasm that washed through her. She continued to shake as the ripples washed through her over and over again. He slowly kissed his way up her body, not missing a single spot.</p><p>When he brought his lips back down to hers in a gentle caress, she felt like she could float away on a cloud. It was magical in its intensity. He continued to kiss her mouth and face and her body began to heat up again.</p><p>She boldly flipped him over on his back, to return some of the pleasure she had just received. She ran her tongue down his masculine throat. She loved the slightly salty taste of his body.</p><p>She continued down over his hard pecs, loving the feel of his muscles quivering underneath her tongue. His body was so incredible and she loved the texture of his smooth, hard skin. She moved down his stomach and traced the slight line of hair below his belly button. His hips jerked as she continued lower on his body.</p><p>She finally reached his engorged staff and held it within her hand, rubbing it through her fingers. She circled the head and then licked the fluid that dripped out. His hips jerked off the bed in pleasure, as a moan escaped his lips.</p><p>Jasmine finally lowered her head over the hard shaft and took him deep within her mouth. He groaned as she lowered her head up and down his member, while stroking it up and down with her hand. She enjoyed the silky smooth skin inside her mouth and continued moving up and down, faster as his moans of pleasure egged her on.</p><p>He stiffened up and then grabbed her head to pull it away, \u201cthis is going to end far too fast if you keep doing that,\u201d he growled. He pulled her up his body and she straddled his hips. They had never made love with her on top before and she was nervous sitting there, with his eyes roaming all over her body. She felt a sense of power though and it was incredibly erotic.</p><p>He guided his throbbing shaft towards her entrance and then she slowly slid down on top of him. As her body lowered, she felt the pressure building and her body\u2019s natural instincts took over. She started moving up and down his erection, as her body smoothed the way. She was so hot and moist and he slid easily in and out of her.</p><p>She could feel herself start to shake as the orgasm built back up inside her. He lifted his hands up to knead her breasts, as they swayed with each movement she made. He rubbed her nipples between his fingers, slightly pinching them, before smoothing his hands back over the peaks. She could feel the tug all the way down, deep inside her.</p><p>He moved one hand and started rubbing her throbbing nub in a tight circle, building the pressure up even more. She began moving quickly, as her body was tightening. She threw her head back and braced her hands on the bed. Both their bodies were quivering, as she continued the up and down motion.</p><p>She thrust down hard and then started shaking uncontrollably as the orgasm rocked through her entire body. She could feel the fire shooting down her legs, as wave after wave of intense pleasure shot through her. She lost all energy, as she slumped forward across his chest. Both their bodies were covered in a fine glaze of sweat and she was sliding against his hard chest, making her sensitive nipples quiver.</p><p>He grabbed her hips, to steady her and thrust up and down her still shaking body until he tensed and cried out as he shot his release deep within her womb. He continued to move a few more times to draw out the pleasure and then was still as she lay sprawled atop of him.</p><p>His hands ran up and down her back, smoothing over her butt, making her still sensitive body shake with the pleasure from his touch. He stroked her hair, as they both enjoyed the aftermath of their lovemaking. He finally turned her head and kissed her gently making her fall even more in love with him than she ever had been before.</p><p>She finally shifted off of him, breaking the connection of their bodies. She didn\u2019t know what to do and was going to get up but he refused to release her. He kept stroking her hair, neck and back, turning her whole body to jelly.</p><p>Their breathing finally got under control and they lay there in a comfortable silence. She was starting to drift off to sleep when he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have not only opened the gates to Amy but allowed her in our home?\u201d he asked her. His voice wasn\u2019t filled with anger just disbelief she would\u2019ve done such a thing. She looked up at him in shock. He didn\u2019t seem happy at all that she\u2019d let the woman in. Maybe Amy had lied about their business meeting.</p> <p>\u201cShe told me she had business papers for you and you had a meeting scheduled. She actually made it sound like the two of you were still lovers, which I was going to talk to you about but you kind of distracted me,\u201d she said, barely above a whisper. She really didn\u2019t want him to confirm he was lovers with another woman, especially after making love to her so passionately. It was hard for her to imagine he could be with her like this and then go be with another woman.</p><p>He stared at her for a few moments, seeming to be in shock. \u201cI have never slept with that woman, as a matter of fact she was starting to push the boundaries of her employment and I fired her over a month ago and haven\u2019t seen her since. I was quite shocked to walk into my den to find her sitting there, half naked. I quickly escorted her off the premises,\u201d he said, in a voice that left no doubt he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt was very obvious she came here tonight to make a play for me, which I understood in her demented mind but what was plaguing me is that I couldn\u2019t figure out why you would\u2019ve let her in. I guess I never mentioned she was no longer an employee and why would you have thought we were lovers?\u201d he questioned her.</p><p>\u201cThat day we were having lunch together, she was in the bathroom and told me that not only were you lovers but that she was expecting you to propose marriage to her at any time. I thought you really wanted to be with her but found out you had a son and were doing the right thing by him. It\u2019s really bothered me because I can\u2019t sleep with you while you\u2019re having sex with other women. I know we aren\u2019t getting married out of love but I don\u2019t want either of us taking other lovers if we share the same bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>She had turned away from him, because she didn\u2019t want him to see the pain in her eyes. She didn\u2019t want him to know the truth of how much she really cared. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for her to ask him not to take on mistresses. There were a number of reasons besides love she\u2019d make that request.</p><p>\u201cI want to share a bed with you Derek, if we\u2019re going to be faithful to each other,\u201d she finally gained the courage to say. It was very hard for her to do, since the last time she\u2019d opened up her heart to him, he had walked away without a backwards glance.</p><p>Derek flipped her over onto her back again and covered her body with his. She was surprised, when his fully engorged erection was at her entrance, begging to enter. He gently spread her legs open and slipped inside her still wet heat.</p><p>She instantly felt the pressure start to build, as he very slowly pushed in and out of her. She was starting to lose all thoughts, including what they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to be with any other woman when I\u2019m with you. I haven\u2019t slept with another since you stepped back into my life and I guarantee you I won\u2019t. You\u2019re mine now,\u201d he growled, before locking his lips back down on hers.</p><p>Jasmine felt a sense of peace, along with the building pressure of her body, as he continued to stroke her with his hands and body. They made love several more times that night, like there was no way either of them could get enough of each other. She\u2019d be very tired over the next week.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>It was her wedding day and Jasmine was having a difficult time breathing. She\u2019d been plucked, waxed, ironed and every other unimaginable pampering so much she didn\u2019t recognize the person who stared back in the mirror.</p><p>She turned around in a slow circle to see herself. The dress was everything she could\u2019ve ever imagined and so much more. It had layer upon layer of silk and lace that cascaded down her body. The top was fitted and made her seem like a true princess. Derek had even purchased her a tiara, that she was more than a little suspicious, contained real diamonds on it. She hadn\u2019t let it out of her sight for a moment.</p><p>She had to admit to herself, the crew he\u2019d hired had done a spectacular job, because she looked really nice. She sighed as she stood in the waiting area. He\u2019d been very secretive about where the actual wedding was taking place and she was in a huge tent with partitions in it. She was going to be picked up at any moment, to be taken to the site.</p><p>\u201cMs. Freeman your carriage is here,\u201d one of the people said to her. She stepped outside and felt tears fill her eyes, as she saw the horse drawn carriage. It was something right out of Cinderella and it was absolutely perfect. There were four white horses pulling it and a doorman wearing an old fashioned tuxedo, holding open the door. Derek really had thought of everything to make the wedding a true fairytale and she was speechless.</p><p>She glided to the carriage on the soft carpet laid out to the door. One of the attendants was holding the train of her dress up, so that it wouldn\u2019t drag on the ground. The doorman helped her inside and then a couple of people straightened out her dress.</p><p>Soon the carriage started forward and she looked out the open windows, wondering what could possibly come next. She hadn\u2019t seen Jacob all day and couldn\u2019t wait to see what he looked like in his little tuxedo. He\u2019d been so excited about the whole event. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They turned a corner and then she saw where they were going and her breath hitched in her chest. Why would he do this? She knew he was angry with her for keeping his son from him but why would he go to so much trouble to give her the fairytale wedding she\u2019d always wanted and then chose the one spot that spelled complete heartbreak for her.</p><p>As they pulled up in front of the little church she\u2019d been left standing alone at she noticed he\u2019d been busy. The little building, which had once been condemned, was now completely remodeled. It was the same church and looked like it must have when it was originally built but it was now completely fixed up and had flowers decorating the stairs, leading up inside of it.</p><p>She refused to leave the carriage. The doorman stood there, looking slightly panicked, as the bride refused to exit. She felt a tear slip down her face and didn\u2019t care if her make-up was most likely ruined. She didn\u2019t care about any of it. All she cared about was that even on her wedding day Derek felt he must punish her for some unknown reason.</p><p>She told the carriage driver to take her away and he looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. She knew he\u2019d been hired by Derek and there was no way he was leaving with the bride still in the carriage but she had to try. She saw the doors open and then Daniel was descending the stairs. She\u2019d always loved Derek\u2019s father and though she would\u2019ve normally been happy to see the man, today wasn\u2019t one of those days.</p> <p>He came up to the doors and saw her silently crying. He said nothing for a few moments as he stood there and then silently handed her a handkerchief for her to wipe her face on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Jasmine?\u201d he asked, with what sounded like true concern.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he want to hurt me so much? I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d pick this place for our wedding. This is the place he left me standing on my own. Is he even in there, or has this all been one big joke to him?\u201d she blurted out, not even caring it was his father she was speaking to.</p><p>Daniel\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, as she spoke to him but he only said he\u2019d be back. He spoke softly to the driver and then patted her hand and walked back into the church. The carriage was suddenly moving once again and Jasmine was surprised but very happy as he pulled around a corner. He didn\u2019t move far but at least she wasn\u2019t in view of the one place holding so much heartbreak.</p><p>She was trying to decide whether or not she should walk away in her huge dress or just sit there until the driver decided they could leave. Then, the door opened again and Derek slid in beside her. He looked at her face in confusion as her tears silently fell.</p> <p>\u201cMy father said I needed to talk to you, so here I am. We have a deal Jasmine and I hope you\u2019re smart enough to remember that. I\u2019ve done everything possible to make this the wedding you wanted,\u201d he told her, in an almost cynical voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you choose this spot?\u201d she questioned him, as some fresh tears escaped. He stared at her another moment before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI thought this place was very fitting, after all it\u2019s the spot you sent your father to buy me out of your life. I thought it was ironic to marry in the place where you let me know I wasn\u2019t good enough for you,\u201d he almost spat.</p><p>It was now Jasmine\u2019s turn to stare open mouthed at him. She didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. He was the one who had left her, not the other way around. Her tears dried up in her confusion and she barely noticed when he grabbed the napkin and cleaned her face up.</p><p>\u201cYou left me, not the other way around,\u201d she barely whispered to him. \u201cWhy would you say my father paid you off? Why are you saying any of this? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she cried. Being in this spot was making it all new and fresh. The pain from that day still haunted her, especially when she looked into her son\u2019s face.</p><p>They both looked into one another\u2019s eyes as they tried to figure out what the other was talking about.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about that day?\u201d he finally asked her. He was starting to have a really bad feeling in his gut.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want me to humiliate myself still?\u201d she questioned him. She couldn\u2019t believe he was so horrible that he\u2019d get enjoyment out of her pain.</p><p>\u201cPlease just tell me everything that happened after we said goodbye that night?\u201d he asked her and the change in his tone alerted her that something was wrong. He didn\u2019t sound condemning or accusatory. He sounded as if he really wanted to know what she\u2019d done, so she began to relive the worst day of her life.</p><p>She told him how she had gone home and told her dad everything and that he\u2019d been supportive. She told him how she\u2019d gone to the church and waited until the sun sunk from the sky. She explained she\u2019d never been more devastated in her life and when she found out a while later she carried his child the pain had been two-fold. It was horrible. She was crying once more by the end of her talking.</p><p>Derek said nothing, as she told him the truth of that morning. He had no doubts what she said was true. He now understood it had been her father all along and the man had succeeded at breaking them up. Her father was truly a horrible man, because he must\u2019ve known the child she carried was his and yet he still hadn\u2019t tried to fix things. The man deserved everything that had happened to him in the last couple of months and so much more.</p><p>Derek finally took her chin in his hands and lifted her sad eyes up to meet his. She looked so heartbroken and it killed him to know he was responsible for her pain. She hadn\u2019t left him, he realized and his heart was bursting with joy. He loved her even more than he did when they were still young and naive.</p><p>He loved the woman she was, both now and then and he couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d wasted so much time and he\u2019d purposely tried to hurt her. He felt at an all-time low and vowed to make it up to her the rest of their lives.</p><p>He said nothing as he continued to gaze down into her beautiful, sad eyes. He slowly lowered his head and captured her lips with his. The kiss was gentle and filled with the love that was overflowing from him. He kissed her for several minutes, before trailing his lips across her cheeks, to kiss away the tears and then he lowered his head to gently nip the smooth silk of her throat.</p> <p>She was no longer crying, as he continued to gently kiss her all over her mouth, face and neck. He didn\u2019t pull her close against him, as he didn\u2019t want to hurt her beautiful gown but his gentle touch showed her so much love it was indescribable.</p><p>He reluctantly pulled away from her and once again looked into her eyes. \u201cJasmine, I have so much to apologize for, so very much,\u201d he started. \u201cI was there at the church that morning. I was there early because I couldn\u2019t wait to run away with you,\u201d he said and her eyes were rounding in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYour father showed up. He told me you didn\u2019t want to be with me any longer and he offered me a lot of money to start my new life. I actually believed the man. I was so angry with him and extremely angry with you. I thought you\u2019d flung me aside, like a piece of trash and I vowed to have my revenge from that point on,\u201d he said, with regret in his voice. He didn\u2019t give her a chance to speak as he continued.</p><p>\u201cI was hurting so bad and that thought of revenge was what motivated me but when I saw you again, I realized I still loved you. I lied to even myself and said I just wanted to take you to bed and then leave you, like you\u2019d left me but that wasn\u2019t true either. That first time we were together again, after so many years, knocked me off my feet. Every time I touch you, it\u2019s never enough. It\u2019s so much more than sex. It\u2019s because I love you even more today than I did ten years ago. Please tell me you\u2019ll forgive me and this wedding can be a real marriage,\u201d he pled with her.</p><p>Jasmine listened to him, with hope starting to fill her heart. By the time he was finished speaking, her chest was so full she didn\u2019t understand how her heart wasn\u2019t beating right through. She was saddened to realize all the years they\u2019d wasted but she realized none of that mattered anymore because he loved her and she truly loved him and they could be a real family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Derek. I really thought you had just walked away from me all those years ago. I never once suspected my father but I should\u2019ve. He\u2019s not a good man and over the last few months I have really come to realize that. I\u2019m sorry he cost you half of our child\u2019s life. I should have tried harder to find you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He brought his lips back down to hers and kissed her with so much hunger and love, that she was tempted to skip out on the wedding and tell the driver to take them back home. As if he could read her thoughts he quickly pulled back and still not trusting himself jumped out of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far too tempting, woman. We have a wedding to get to,\u201d he said, with a brilliant smile. He spoke to the driver and then jogged back towards the church. This time when the carriage pulled up in front of the carpet, she was more than ready to step from its doors. The doorman looked more than relieved when she took his hand and stepped down on the carpet.</p><p>The driver must not have been taking any chances, because as soon as she was clear of the carriage, he drove away to go park. She giggled a bit at the speed in which he left.</p><p>She stood on the wide carpet and could feel her nerves overtaking her. She didn\u2019t have any bridesmaids, nor someone to walk her down the aisle and she suddenly felt so lonely. She could now understand why the bride always walked down on her father\u2019s arm. It was so she wouldn\u2019t fall over, or run the other way. The thought of that long walk was intimidating when you were all on your own.</p><p>She saw the doors open, just as the attendants got her dress all situated. Daniel was once again walking down the steps and coming towards her. \u201cI\u2019m coming this time, I promise,\u201d she told him, with her first real smile of the day. He leaned down and kissed her on the cheek. She was filled with warmth from the easy acceptance of this wonderful man.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any fears of you running away, Beautiful,\u201d he started. \u201cI wanted to offer my services to you. I know your own father couldn\u2019t be here today so I thought you might like an arm to lean on,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>Jasmine was so filled with love for this amazing man. He knew her father wasn\u2019t there because he didn\u2019t want to be there, not because he couldn\u2019t be but he made sure to word his sentence in a way that wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He was also standing in to be the kind of dad her own should have been. Her eyes once again filled up, causing the attendants around her to groan.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t start crying again young lady, or we\u2019ll never get you to that alter,\u201d he said, with a gentle laugh and suspiciously bright eyes himself.</p><p>\u201cIt would be my honor to have you walk me down the aisle,\u201d she finally managed to get past the lump in her throat.</p><p>Their arms intertwined and slowly they made their way to the front of the church. The double doors were opened and Jasmine was left speechless by what she saw inside. There were thousands of twinkling lights strung throughout and the scent of roses wafted in the air from the hundreds of arrangements placed everywhere.</p><p>The small church was packed from front to back, with guests who were all standing and turned towards her. She had to fight the tears to not fall once again. She looked down the aisle, strewn with rose petals, to Derek who looked so handsome standing at the front and Jacob by his side. Drew and Ryan were standing in the spot where bridesmaids would normally be so that her side didn\u2019t look so empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The men were a stunning sight, all dressed in old fashioned tuxedo\u2019s with tails and white shirts. They were all truly breathtaking. Jacob was smiling at her as she slowly made her way down the aisle and he looked like it was taking everything in him not to run up and hug her. She felt the same way.</p><p>When her eyes connected once again with Derek, the rest of the world seemed to fade away and she could look nowhere else. The man was beautiful and she couldn\u2019t believe he was all hers. She picked up her pace, without even realizing what she was doing, until she heard a chuckle from Daniel.</p><p>They reached the pulpit and then Daniel reached down and gently kissed her on the cheek, before taking his place next to her son. The wedding party was complete, with all these stunning men surrounding her. She really did feel like a princess, in her fluffy white dress, in the middle of the masculine men but especially with Derek at her side.</p><p>She repeated the vows, while continuing to stare into Derek\u2019s eyes and the whole thing passed in a blur. After the wedding, he took her around the back of the church, where huge tents were set up, with caterers running around, poring champagne and serving appetizers.</p> <p>They did all the traditional things such as cutting the cake and having their first dance. He slowly pulled her into his arms, her heart bursting in pure happiness. He was looking at her as if she was a buried treasure he\u2019d just discovered and the lump in her throat wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking such great care of my son. I\u2019m sorry you had to do it alone all those years. I\u2019m sorry you thought I walked away from you. I\u2019m a real fool to think anything could\u2019ve made you do that. You\u2019re the purest person I\u2019ve ever known and I promise you I will spend the rest of my life proving how special you are to me,\u201d he said as he spun her around.</p><p>The rest of the people disappeared as they shared the intimate dance together. She felt like she was floating on a cloud. She hoped they\u2019d remain in the stars for the rest of their lives. She loved Derek so much it seemed impossible. How could she have gotten so lucky to have all her dreams come true?</p><p>\u201cI missed you every day. When I looked at our son I was filled with a mixture of joy and sadness. The older he got the more I missed you. The earlier days were the hardest because I wanted to share all those moments with you. I\u2019ve never felt such pain as when I thought I\u2019d never be in your arms again. I was never able to hate you,\u201d she said with her eyes filled with emotion.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t even talk about the negatives anymore. From this time forward we\u2019ll only focus on our future. If you can forgive a fool, I promise to love you the rest of our lives,\u201d he said. She wrapped her arms more tightly around his neck, loving she\u2019d never have to withhold her feelings from him again.</p> <p>Drew stood up and the room silenced. There was a lot of noise from the clinking of glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the toasts,\u201d Drew said. She was struck again at how lucky she was.</p><p>\u201cDerek and I are closer than even siblings could ever possibly be. He and Ryan are about the only two beings on this planet I\u2019d take a bullet for until today. I have known Jasmine since she was just a tiny little tot in grade school and her beauty has only ever been outshone by her truly kind heart. It\u2019s such a great privilege to have her as a part of my family, starting today. I\u2019m so glad to have her and Jacob as additions and I\u2019d take a bullet for them as well,\u201d he said. \u201cTo a lifetime of happiness and many more babies to come, congratulations Derek and Jasmine,\u201d he said, to the thundering applause of the crowd.</p><p>Jasmine managed to break away from Derek, to throw her arms around Drew and thank him for his kind words. She then engulfed Ryan and told him how much she loved him as well. The night continued on, with much laughter, dancing and kissing and by the time it was over, Jasmine was a little sad for it to end.</p><p>Daniel had insisted on keeping Jacob for a few days, so they could have a proper honeymoon and she knew Jacob would be spoiled rotten by his grandfather. He\u2019d been leery at first since his only other example of a grandparent hadn\u2019t been a good one but they were incredibly close now, in such a short amount of time.</p><p>As Derek and Jasmine ran through the birdseed, out to the awaiting carriage, she knew her life couldn\u2019t have gotten any better than at that moment in time. She was wrong though, because as Derek took her to his bed as his wife, she realized passion and love together made everything better and better with each new day.</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>Jasmine was in her second favorite spot in the house, cooking a huge meal. She was so happy with her life and couldn\u2019t believe how well things had turned out. They\u2019d spent their honeymoon at home, since neither of them had any desire to go anywhere without Jacob. They had plenty of time to take romantic vacations together.</p><p>Derek vowed to take her and Jacob to every one of Drew\u2019s magical resorts and they were off on their first adventure to one of them soon.</p><p>On that first night they were together he\u2019d taken the prenuptial agreement and burnt it in the fireplace. His trust in her was overwhelming and she knew nothing would ever keep them apart. They really were going to be a family together and she did get her fairytale.</p><p>His family was coming over that night to celebrate Jacob\u2019s tenth birthday and she was on cloud nine. She turned too quickly and her protruding stomach bumped into the island. The baby kicked inside of her as if to say, hey watch it mom. She laughed out loud, as she rubbed the spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing about in here on your own,\u201d Derek said, as he came up behind her and placed his arms around her rapidly expanding middle.</p><p>\u201cI bumped into the island and your son or daughter decided to kick back. I don\u2019t think he appreciated it,\u201d she said, with another giggled. Derek immediately dropped to his knees and lifted her shirt over her stomach to check the entire area.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? I think we should go into the hospital just to make sure,\u201d he demanded, as he rose to his feet. He was about to pick her up and head towards the car.</p><p>\u201cDerek I\u2019m fine, it was just a little bump. I need to get used to this big belly,\u201d she said, enjoying her overprotective husband.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s better safe than sorry,\u201d he mumbled and she could tell he was thinking about physically making her go in. She laughed some more and then pulled him close for a kiss. She knew how to distract the man. She rubbed up as close as her belly would allow and soon they were both groaning with pleasure, as his hands rubbed down her body, to grip her behind in his hands.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you two are disgustingly happy together and it makes the rest of us sick, so can you please, for two minutes, manage to tear yourselves apart from each other,\u201d Drew said, as he walked into the room.</p><p>Derek turned to glare at his cousin, not liking him much at that moment. Jasmine let him go, which furthered his dislike. She walked over to Drew and pulled his head down close, so she could kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re all talk. You\u2019re going to fall head over heels in love soon and then I\u2019ll get to pick on you. I love you to pieces Drew Titan and the lucky woman who gets to spend her life with you will be incredibly special,\u201d she said. Drew\u2019s face turned red, as he pulled Jasmine into a big hug.</p><p>\u201cOkay, find your own woman and leave mine alone,\u201d Derek told his cousin, before dragging him out of the room.</p><p>Jasmine watched them leave, her heart swollen with love. She had finally spoken to her father and it hadn\u2019t gone well. He was a sad man and was running away from his problems. She was sad he\u2019d rather she wasn\u2019t in his life but she had a new family and they were the type of people you were proud to call your own.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good in here but make sure you don\u2019t overdo it,\u201d Ryan said, as he came into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou boys worry far too much, you know,\u201d she said, as she gave him a hug. \u201cThe boys are all out at the pool,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a break and join us, so we at least have a great view,\u201d he asked her, with a wiggle of his brows.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that. My feet can use a break,\u201d she told him and then threaded her arm through his and walked out back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you lousy guys pawing all over my wife?\u201d Derek asked, as they stepped out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhen your wife is so extremely hot, it\u2019s too difficult to keep your hands off her,\u201d Ryan said, as he bent to kiss her cheek. She smacked him and then settled down into one of the comfortable lounge chairs.</p><p>Derek immediately headed over towards her and pulling up a chair and lifting her feet onto his lap. He immediately started rubbing them. She moaned in pleasure, as he inserted just the right amount of pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop in about ten years,\u201d she said, on a moan of pleasure. He leaned over and kissed her gently, before continuing. The family all came and surrounded them and as she looked around, she knew her life was so much better than it had ever been. The baby kicked her gently in the ribs and she smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re there,\u201d she whispered and then she counted her blessings, as she knew she\u2019d do the rest of her life. </p> </body></html>"]
