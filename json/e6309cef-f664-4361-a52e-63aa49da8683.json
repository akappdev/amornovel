Is the sight of my bare chest getting to you?\u201d Rafael Valdez licked white icing off one fingertip, and my fangs stabbed through my gums.</p><p>\u201cListen. I\u2019ve put up with your marathon showers until there\u2019s no hot water left for mine. And your cooking smells.\u201d Oh, great. Tears. But was it fair? Rafe\u2019s a shape-shifter with a shifter\u2019s insatiable appetite. He\u2019d spent nearly five years stuck in dog body acting as my bodyguard. Now he was staying in hunky human form and was no longer at my mercy for his menu. Who knew he was a gourmet cook? Maybe popping open a can of sweet rolls wasn\u2019t gourmet in some books, but I knew nirvana when I smelled it.</p> <p>He polished off roll number six\u2014yes, I\u2019d been counting\u2014then stood. I would not notice the towel flapping open. He strolled over\u2014flap, flap\u2014to lay a gentle hand on my shoulder. Someone in this apartment was making a trip to the nearest discount store to get jumbo beach towels tonight. Since Rafe obviously didn\u2019t care who ogled his family jewels, that someone would have to be me. Serve him right if I bought hot pink Hello Kitty. Let him strut his stuff in that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory.\u201d He smiled, his dimples showing.</p><p>It was still a shock to see Valdez as a human hottie. He\u2019d been a cute dog, usually a Labradoodle with wavy black hair. Still had the thick curly locks, with dark eyes to match, but now there was a whole Latin-lover thing going on, complete with those teasing dimples that were an absolute killer where the ladies were concerned.</p><p>Not me, of course. We were friends. That\u2019s it. V knew way too much about me. He\u2019d been an up close and personal witness to my love life, a tangled mess at the moment. And he\u2019d listened to me wail ad nauseam about my issues. Which were numerous. I\u2019m even afraid he knows my deepest, darkest secret\u2014the number when I step on a bathroom scale. I\u2019d been through a weight-loss experiment recently and had a feeling he\u2019d peeked. I mean, wouldn\u2019t you if your best friend weighed in mere feet away?</p><p>\u201cForget it, V. I\u2019m a mess. Doesn\u2019t take much to set me off these days.\u201d My voice cracked. Oops. Was another meltdown coming? Personally, I was sick of myself. Made some tough decisions lately, and regretted at least one of them almost instantly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Glory, I\u2019ve been an ass. I get it. Vampires can\u2019t eat. I know what it\u2019s like to crave what you can\u2019t have.\u201d He pulled me into his arms, and I felt weepy enough to actually lean into him. Damn those cinnamon rolls. Out of a can, but still.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that they smell so good.\u201d And he looked so fine. And felt so warm and strong and . . . I sucked it up and pushed back. \u201cWe need to get some things straight here.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to glance down to know that, hello, part of him was already headed in that direction under the stupid skimpy towel. Nice to know Mr. Tall, Dark and Shifty wasn\u2019t immune to my dubious charms.</p><p>Oh, who was I kidding? I still had on my shapeless Snoopy nightshirt and hadn\u2019t combed my hair since yesterday. It was probably his breakfast Rafe was excited about.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. It\u2019s your place. But I\u2019ve got to eat.\u201d His dimples were showing again as he headed back to sit at the kitchen table. \u201cI\u2019ll scarf these down, then spray some air freshener. Will that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and collapsed on the couch. \u201cIt would make me feel better if you put on some clothes. And, excuse me for noticing, bought some underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Guess I am getting to you.\u201d He laughed. \u201cCut me a break. I spent years naked inside a dog body. No wardrobe necessary.\u201d He dragged a finger through a puddle of icing and licked it clean. Tormentor. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been too crazy about underwear. But for you, I\u2019ll deal. Shopping\u2019s just low on my priorities right now. I\u2019ve been trying to get this nightclub off the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019s that going?\u201d I picked up my bottle of synthetic blood. Yawn. Not even my favorite type. Because my fave is expensive. And Glory St. Clair is always on a budget.</p><p>\u201cNot great. Everything costs more than I thought it would. So today I finally caved and called an old friend. She has plenty of money and likes the club scene. Unfortunately, knowing Nadia, she won\u2019t be a silent partner.\u201d Rafe picked up his empty plate, rinsed it off and set it in the sink.</p><p>\u201cNadia? Is she a shifter too?\u201d Even the name sounded exotic.</p><p>\u201cVampire. I worked for her back in the seventies. She\u2019s got bars and nightclubs all over the world. Austin, Texas, in general, will be a new scene for her so she\u2019s coming tomorrow to scope it out. If she likes what she sees, we\u2019ll strike a deal.\u201d Rafe plopped into a chair across from me.</p><p>Oh, he did not just flash me. I stood and stalked into the kitchen to rinse out my glass bottle. We recycle.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that. Now I\u2019m going down to the shop. Up here we need some rules. You\u2019ve got to shower during the day while I\u2019m conked out in my death sleep. The hot water heater here is only good for one shower a night, and I have a feeling you just took it.\u201d I strode over to the bathroom door, figuring the cold shower I\u2019d get was what I deserved with these instant replays of leaning on the almost naked Rafe in my brain.</p><p>\u201cSorry. My body clock\u2019s still on vamp time. Work all night, sleep all day, but with one eye open. You know?\u201d Rafe got up and sauntered over to face me.</p><p>\u201cRight. You went way above and beyond what any paycheck required to protect me.\u201d I kept my eyes on his. Otherwise, I\u2019d be checking out that truly great chest just inches from my nose. Didn\u2019t help that his scent was as familiar as my own. Hey, Valdez the dog had slept on the foot of my bed for years. One inhale and I felt safe and close to the best friend I\u2019d ever had.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re even. You saved my furry butt a time or two.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLike from a crowd of energy-sucking psychos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never be even.\u201d I couldn\u2019t smile about that memory. He\u2019d almost been killed by a group of vampires who\u2019d been trying to get to me. \u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful to you. But you\u2019re off the payroll. And I\u2019ve got to learn to deal without a bodyguard now. We\u2019re friends. Roommates. So sleep with both eyes closed, buddy. You deserve that.\u201d</p><p>I admit that, while I was determined to be independent for the first time in my life, the concept freaked me out more than a little. But I\u2019d told my overprotective maker and long-time lover, Jeremy Blade, to give me my space. That included no more freebies like the twenty-four-seven security he\u2019d provided for the past, oh, four hundred years. Stupid me had even turned down the chance to stay in Hollywood and play house with the amazing rock star Israel Caine.</p><p>Sure I\u2019m insane. But that\u2019s me. Now I was out to prove that I could stand on my own two feet. In cute shoes, of course. The fact that I\u2019d cried myself to sleep ever since I\u2019d come back from Hollywood was just me being stupid.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be safe. How I sleep is my business, Glory. Don\u2019t stress over it.\u201d Rafe put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cAnd get this, lady.\u201d He stared down at me, suddenly serious. No sign of a dimple. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m your friend, and I\u2019ll always protect you if I see the need, with or without a paycheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I blinked when he backed me up to a wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you anymore. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Rafe, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d Compared to my vamp subhuman temperature, his body was almost hot. I inhaled again, but this time instead of \u201csafe\u201d I got a sizzle of something I hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cThe deal is I\u2019ve watched you with Blade and Caine, and I figure there\u2019s a reason you won\u2019t commit to either one of them.\u201d He moved his hands from my shoulders to my neck, his thumbs doing funny things to the skin behind my ears.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d I shivered, absolutely speechless for once.</p><p>His grin was slow and knowing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Glory. I\u2019m not going to rush you. But one of these nights I\u2019m going to end up in your bed again, and it\u2019s not going to be lying at your feet.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and headed down the hall, his towel hitting the floor as he walked into the bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>I was left with the image of his perfect taut butt burned into my brain. Dimples there too. Damn.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Things have been crazy.\u201d Lacy Devereau, my day manager and right-hand girl in the shop, looked me over. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Rafe\u2019s been torturing me with his cooking again, that\u2019s all.\u201d I smiled at a customer heading toward a dressing room with a vintage dress over her arm. \u201cBusiness good, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but that\u2019s not the crazy part. It\u2019s Flo. She\u2019s made this place into wedding central. You know I\u2019m one of her bridesmaids.\u201d Lacy glanced behind her and lowered her voice. \u201cStop her, Glory. She\u2019s talking about changing the dresses again. I don\u2019t care if she is paying. With the wedding only weeks away, they\u2019ll never get here on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m on it.\u201d I picked up a pile of receipts. The daily take hadn\u2019t been too shabby. My vintage clothing and antique store was on trendy Sixth Street, between Mugs and Muffins, a coffee shop owned by a fellow vamp, and a tattoo parlor. The location for Rafe\u2019s nightclub was a few blocks down. We weren\u2019t far from the University of Texas, and my shop had become a hangout for some of the students. Since I call my place Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium and my bud Florence Da Vinci, the not-so-blushing bride, had painted a vampire mural on the wall, we were really popular with Goths and vampire wannabes. I\u2019d tried to discourage that at first, then played along, even passing out fake fangs at Halloween.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Flo now?\u201d I was maid of honor and had finally persuaded my former roomie to go with slimming black and a bodice that would cover a double-D cup. Being a tiny size six herself, Flo really didn\u2019t get a full-figured gal\u2019s issues with some of the cute little numbers she liked for her bridesmaids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, cara. Come see what I have in the back.\u201d Flo had thrown open the door to my storeroom. \u201cYou\u2019ll love this dress. Purple. Your color. It will look fabulous on you. Jeremiah will take one look at you and\u2014boom!\u2014he\u2019s yours again.\u201d</p><p>Jeremiah. Jeremy Blade. Whatever the hell he chose to call himself this week, we\u2019d parted ways in Los Angeles. He was there, I was here. One of the reasons for my recent crying jags.</p><p>\u201cJerry won\u2019t be seeing me.\u201d I didn\u2019t resist when Flo dragged me into the back room. She slammed the door. I\u2019d told Jerry we needed a break. So we were broken. Sniff.</p> <p>\u201cI fix everything.\u201d Flo hugged me. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be Ricardo\u2019s best man so you two can get back together. S\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>Ricardo, or Richard Mainwaring, was Flo\u2019s husband. They\u2019d been married at a private ceremony, but now Flo a.k.a. Bridezilla with fangs wanted a big wedding. Her brother Damian was footing the bill, so this promised to be the wedding of several centuries.</p><p>\u201cDoubt it\u2019ll be that easy, but thanks. I\u2019d have thought Richard would have asked one of his Vatican cronies.\u201d Richard is a former priest. Long story.</p><p>\u201cOh, there will be plenty of those guys here. One will be honored to perform the ceremony again, of course.\u201d Flo flipped open a magazine and stabbed a picture. \u201cThis dress. Cute? No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the manicure?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help noticing that each of her nails wore a slightly different color. I lifted her finger to examine the dress under it. It was cute. Actually might work on my size-twelve figure, if there was elastic involved. Forget puff sleeves. Made my arms look fat. But Jerry liked me in purple. And loved a low neckline. I had visions of him seeing me walk down the aisle and forgetting all our issues.</p> <p>\u201cGlory! I said I\u2019m trying out colors for my wedding day.\u201d Flo held out her hand. \u201cWhich one do you like?\u201d</p><p>I focused. Okay. Flo and I compared colors to the fabric swatch from her wedding dress until we settled on \u201cBlush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEs perfecto. Grazi, Glory.\u201d She hugged me again. \u201cI knew you would help me. Now I have another favor. Did you see this?\u201d She pulled a local newspaper out from under her magazine.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I glanced down and recognized the picture. \u201cRay? He\u2019s coming to town too?\u201d Ray a.k.a. Israel Caine. The other man I\u2019d left in L.A. Okay, I admit it. My heart, which barely beats anyway, gave a little jig of happiness. Both my guys, hot vampires who I loved and had decided to give up, were coming to town. Would either of them want to see me again?</p><p>Well, Jerry wouldn\u2019t have a choice, would he? And Ray? I grabbed the paper. The rock star was singing at a venue at the South by Southwest Music Festival. The festival was held every spring in Austin to give music producers a chance to hear new talent. The article claimed Ray was coming with the owner of his record label, another vampire. Maybe Ray would drop by the shop. I\u2019d been his mentor, and it had only been a few weeks since Ray had claimed he loved me. But then I\u2019d dumped him. Not an action guaranteed to keep his love light burning.</p><p>\u201cGlory? Look at me.\u201d Flo fiddled with a bottle of nail-polish remover. \u201cThat favor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, Flo?\u201d I threw down the paper. How pathetic. I\u2019d been on my own for less than a month, and I was already imagining scenarios where both men were begging for me to come back to them. And then there\u2019d been Rafe\u2019s interesting move. Forget it. I\u2019d looked like hell. Surely he\u2019d been playing me, hadn\u2019t really meant\u2014</p><p>\u201cGlory, quit ignoring me. And blocking your thoughts.\u201d Flo frowned and shook my arm. \u201cThis is serious, mia amica.\u201d</p><p>I hid my smile. Didn\u2019t everything to do with my friend\u2019s wedding rank right up there with the desire for world peace and half-price sales? \u201cOkay, Flo, I\u2019m riveted. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, Israel Caine. He\u2019ll be in Austin right before my wedding, s\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the calculating look on Flo\u2019s face. She was blocking her thoughts too. But then she always blocked. Not that I usually tried to pry into them anyway. But this was an emergency. \u201cWhat do you want, Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Israel Caine to sing at my wedding, Glory. Please ask him for me. He\u2019ll do it for you. You saved his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for me too, Flo. We\u2019re even.\u201d I frowned down at that purple dress. Six to eight weeks for delivery. But Flo would figure out a way around that minor technicality, probably by throwing money at it.</p><p>The major issue? Ray and Jerry at Flo\u2019s wedding. The two men hated each other. Because I loved both of them. And Rafe would be there, of course. I\u2019d ask him to be my date. He\u2019d love to jump into a brawl with my name on it. I smiled.</p> <p>Two</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bride. You want Ray, I\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d I winced when Flo hugged me a little too enthusiastically. \u201cEasy there, girlfriend. And wait, I have conditions.\u201d Gee, I was on a roll laying down the law, now wasn\u2019t I? But I\u2019d spent several hundred years being the doormat for everyone else to walk on. Those days were over, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cConditions?\u201d Flo stepped back and gave me a probing look. I blocked her of course. No way was I letting her stroll through my thoughts. Not when she never let me see hers.</p><p>\u201cThe purple dress. Lose the puffed sleeves. Or go back to the black. And this is the last change. Swear it.\u201d I grabbed her shoulders. \u201cSeriously, Flo. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re managing to get these dresses anyway, but decide already. Concentrate on the important stuff like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bachelorette party you\u2019ll be giving me!\u201d Flo hugged me again, more gently this time. For someone who\u2019d never been touchy-feely\u2014with women anyway\u2014Flo was being positively mushy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Right? What do I know about stuff like that?\u201d I knew enough to not want any part of it. Male strippers. Too much alcohol. I\u2019d seen movies. Watched TV.</p><p>\u201cHah! I see it in your eyes. You know what to do. Get some hunky men to dance for us. Gather all my girlfriends and we\u2019ll party all night. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Flo danced around the room. \u201cMaybe you can have it in Rafael\u2019s new club.\u201d</p><p>I bit back a snarky comment. Flo had no girlfriends other than me. She was scraping together my friends to get a bridal party. Even the Siren who\u2019d threatened to send me to hell recently was on the list to wear purple. My BFF was all about men and had never bothered to cultivate girlfriends until she and I had bonded over great shoes and designer handbags. I sighed and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll throw something together. At least there won\u2019t be alcohol involved. How bad could it be?\u201d I had three weeks. Maybe Rafe\u2019s club would be open. Hopefully he\u2019d let me do it after hours and wouldn\u2019t charge me. But with a new partner in the picture . . . And male dancers? Maybe a desperate student\u2014</p><p>\u201cGlory, not all of my bridesmaids are vampires, you know. Of course you\u2019ll serve alcohol. And some of those special treats the EVs make for vampires to eat. Don\u2019t worry about cost. I\u2019ll pay. I know you can\u2019t afford this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d I realized it was the truth, though. Flo liked everything first-class. I had a coach budget.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t fair, mia amica. This is my fantasy. So I pay. You be hostess. Send me the bills. We\u2019ll have a blast.\u201d She grinned and picked up her cell phone. \u201cNow I call and order the dresses. When they arrive, I\u2019ll get the seamstress to rip off the sleeves. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now I\u2019m running to the store. Rafe doesn\u2019t wear underwear. I\u2019m buying him some. And bigger towels.\u201d I slung my purse over my shoulder, wishing I\u2019d snagged his credit card.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. This is interesting.\u201d Flo nabbed me just as I reached the back door. \u201cI get a picture of you and Rafe, that\u2019s our Valdez, eh? And him with no underwear. He\u2019s a fine-looking human now, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You were a better roommate. He cooks, Flo. Tortures me with great smells, then struts around in a tiny towel.\u201d I leaned in. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend. That\u2019s all. But I know how to appreciate a great male body, just like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Tell me.\u201d Flo licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019m married, not blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s built. With these cute little dimples . . .\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m buying him underwear. So he\u2019ll quit flashing his butt at me.\u201d</p><p>Flo arched an eyebrow. \u201cSo. A friend who flashes you. Seems he wants you to notice him. And not in just a friendly way. S\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I can\u2019t deal with it right now. I\u2019ve got Blade coming to town, thanks to Richard. And Ray to talk to, thanks to you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it, I grinned. \u201cNow I\u2019m supposed to consider Rafe as a potential more-than-friend? I just can\u2019t.\u201d Well, I could, but that would make me a megaslut, now wouldn\u2019t it? I jerked open the back door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Tell Lacy I\u2019ll be back in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And do you know Rafael\u2019s size, mia amica?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThirty-two waist, but otherwise? Extra large, girlfriend, extra large.\u201d I heard her laughter as I shut the door. My aging Suburban sat parked in the alley in its usual spot. I had a fifty-fifty chance that it would start. Past time I traded it in and got a more reliable car, but that budget . . .</p><p>I was a foot away from it when I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. I smelled . . . human. Two humans were nearby. I whipped around, suddenly on high alert. Without a bodyguard I had to be smart. A hell of a lot of bad things had happened in this alley. I stuck my key in the door and jerked it to unlock the old car.</p><p>I could hear them breathing as they came closer. Damn this lock. It finally gave, and I wrenched the door open and leaped inside. Overreacting? Maybe, but I slammed it shut and locked myself in anyway. Good thing. The woman dressed in black from head to toe who stepped out of the shadows didn\u2019t look friendly. Neither did the large man who stood behind her. In fact, they both had the \u201cDeath to all vampires\u201d glare down pat. I stuck the key in the ignition and turned. Nothing but clicks. I slapped the steering wheel. Unreliable hunk of junk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman\u2019s fist in a black leather glove hit my side window. I admit it. I cringed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m calling 911. Go away.\u201d I pulled my cell out of my purse and made a show out of dialing. Not that I would really call the police. Vamps avoid law enforcement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d do that, Glory St. Clair.\u201d She was pale with dark hair tucked into her black baseball cap. Her black leather coat was long and expensive, and I wasted a few seconds calculating the value if I had it in my shop to sell. Nice. Italian. Small size. Too small for me, that was for sure. She had black jeans tucked into equally expensive black leather boots. Okay, so the woman knew how to dress. How did she know my name, and what the hell did she want with me? Bonus question: Why did she have a sumo wrestler with her as backup?</p> <p>\u201cWho are you? What do you want?\u201d I yelled through the closed window. \u201cGlory who? Never heard of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Vivien Westwood. And I know you killed my father. You were dumb enough to leave witnesses alive to tell the tale. Now I\u2019m here to get revenge.\u201d She snarled. Perfect teeth, of course, but I wasn\u2019t exactly shaking in my own Gucci knockoff brown leather boots.</p><p>Come on, vampire versus human in cute outfit? Even Sumo Guy, who looked like he could bench press my Suburban, would be an easy takedown. I blamed my earlier panic totally on the men in my life treating me like a helpless female. Naturally I\u2019d fall apart at the first sign of trouble. Trouble? Yeah, that crossbow Viv had tucked against her side definitely qualified. So did the stake her buddy pulled out of his pocket.</p><p>Damn. Westwood\u2019s daughter. The billionaire techno-freak had had a thing about vampires. He\u2019d really hated me and had stalked me until we\u2019d had the last fatal showdown where I\u2019d killed him with a crossbow a lot like the one his daughter was toting. Self-defense. No jury would have convicted me. Of course a grieving family member wouldn\u2019t care about that. I looked her over. Vivien didn\u2019t exactly look grief stricken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d No way was I admitting anything.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a freak. My father wanted to wipe out your kind from the face of the earth. I\u2019m taking over where he left off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kind? A shop owner with great taste?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cGet a grip, lady. You\u2019ve got the wrong freak.\u201d</p><p>Viv wasn\u2019t listening. She nodded at her pal. \u201cSean, knock out this window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I scooted over to the other side as the Hulk reached in his belt for what looked like a sledge hammer. I jerked open the passenger door and put on vamp speed to get out of there. I felt a sting and realized the bitch had shot at me and scored a hit. Damn. I didn\u2019t slow down, just leaped over a Dumpster, hearing a clang as Vivien smacked the side of it with what I bet was one of those wooden arrows. I didn\u2019t stop, just kept going, grateful for the dark as I ran around the corner and kept going until I found a deserted side street.</p><p>My vamp speed paid off, and I\u2019d left my pursuers far behind. To be on the safe side, I jumped up into an old oak tree and straddled a branch. Then I reached back and pulled a wooden arrow from my shoulder. Ouch. Yep, just like her father, Brent Westwood, had used. Rafe had taken one like it in the hip in the same alley. Wooden tip so if it had hit my heart, I\u2019d be history. Nice legacy, Brent. The nut hadn\u2019t fallen far from the tree. I took a moment to thank a higher power that Vivien obviously hadn\u2019t had target practice lately.</p><p>The bark was digging into my backside, and I felt like I was going to hurl if I thought too much about how close I\u2019d come to ending my eternal life. Scoping out the area, I climbed down then took off my jacket, frowning at the hole ripped into the red wool. The sweater underneath was probably ruined too. I could tell I was already healing since wood wounds itch like a son of a bitch. Another Westwood. I could hardly believe it.</p> <p>Underwear and beach towels would have to wait for another night since strolling into a discount store with blood stains wasn\u2019t exactly a low-profile move. I cautiously made my way home, keeping my eyes open for a woman and a not-so-jolly giant, both dressed in black. Geez. Just when I thought my biggest worries were puff sleeves and buff roommates . . .</p><p>My blood matched my jacket, but that didn\u2019t fool the vampires in the crowd. One whiff and it was fangs down and eyebrows raised for everyone in the back room of my shop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been bleeding.\u201d Richard had arrived while I\u2019d been playing hide-and-seek.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I had a run-in in the alley. Still not my favorite place to park.\u201d I shrugged out of my jacket, studied the hole, then tossed the thing into the nearest trash can.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, did I hear Richard correctly?\u201d Jeremy Blade, real name Jeremiah Campbell III, stood in the doorway. The storeroom door was ajar, but it took vamp hearing to pick up on our conversation above the oldies station blaring in the shop.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jerry.\u201d I was ridiculously glad to see him and realized I was grinning like a kid at Christmas. \u201cThe wedding\u2019s still weeks away. I\u2019m surprised to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject. Were you or were you not bleeding?\u201d He frowned, looking strong and handsome in a navy sweater and jeans.</p><p>\u201cYes. Westwood\u2019s got a daughter. She was going for the revenge thing with her daddy\u2019s crossbow. She got off a lucky shot. No big deal.\u201d I tried to scratch the wound that was driving me crazy as it healed, but couldn\u2019t quite reach it.</p> <p>\u201cNo big deal?\u201d He marched over to my side and grabbed my shoulders, turning me so he could look at my back. I felt him jerk up my sweater.</p><p>\u201cHey! We have an audience!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201d Richard sounded amused, until I heard him grunt. I imagined Flo had either stomped on his foot or tested her right hook. \u201cI\u2019m going out to the shop. Florence, darling, wasn\u2019t there a piece of jewelry out there you fancied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I think you\u2019re going to buy it for me.\u201d Flo stopped to pat my arm. \u201cAre you all right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I winked. \u201cThough I did lose some blood. I feel a little weak. I need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gloriana, this is what comes from going about without a bodyguard.\u201d Jerry eased me into a chair as Flo headed out of the room behind Richard and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Jerry. I handled the Westwood chick. But if you want to help me, please scratch where I was hit. It\u2019s itching like crazy.\u201d I sighed and closed my eyes when he did just that.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re feeling weak. Do you need to feed from me?\u201d Jerry pulled up another chair and sat close beside me.</p><p>I inhaled and felt my fangs go on Jerry alert. No one did it for me like Jerry did. He\u2019d made me, was part of me. I craved him like plants crave the sun. And of course I loved him too. I leaned against him, refusing to take advantage of his kindness. We hadn\u2019t parted on the best of terms. My fault. I wasn\u2019t about to step backward a few hundred years into the whole Jerry dependency thing. Though it was so tempting it hurt.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. But thanks.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Jerry. Why are you here? It\u2019s too soon for the wedding. And last I knew you had duties in Los Angeles. Family obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother is handling them. I had business to take care of here.\u201d Jerry slid his arm around me. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t like where we left things. I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I could stand on my own two feet, and I\u2019m doing it. Financially and every other way.\u201d Defensive much? Oh, well.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s not a very good example of that.\u201d He gently scratched my healing wound. \u201cShe could have killed you.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rolled over. It was the truth. And a bodyguard would have been a welcome diversion. As a dog, Valdez had always been front and center when I\u2019d been attacked before, throwing himself between me and danger. I swallowed, my mouth dry and my itchy back suddenly much more than a minor annoyance. It was a freakin\u2019 warning. That the woman would be out there, waiting for another chance.</p><p>\u201cLet me hire another bodyguard for you, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>As usual, Jerry had read my mind. And was willing to ride to my rescue.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not right. Just because you made me, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be stuck with me forever. Other vamps make fledglings and let them go. You\u2019ve got to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Are you comparing yourself to a mere fledgling? You think you\u2019re the only vampire I\u2019ve created? I can think of a dozen off the top of my head.\u201d Jerry stood and walked around the small room. He stopped at the trash can and picked out the red jacket I\u2019d tossed away.</p><p>I stared at him with an open mouth. Wasn\u2019t he the one for dropping bombshells. \u201cSince when do you create other vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young, I thought I was the next best thing to God, giving people immortality.\u201d He thrust his hand through the hole in my jacket. \u201cNot guaranteed though, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. Do you keep track of your other fledglings? Provide security like you do for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. They wouldn\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d Jerry realized he\u2019d just talked himself into a corner. \u201cThey were men, Gloriana. You were the first and only woman I turned. I did it to you for love, not power. It was totally different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Women are helpless creatures in need of guidance. Which sums up our basic problem.\u201d I faced off with him.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d He grimaced and threw down the jacket. \u201cI swear I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d I knew he was frustrated. He was who he was, the sixteenth-century man I\u2019d fallen in love with. I had to admit he\u2019d evolved more than most men from his time would have.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d He shook his head when I moved closer. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I convince you that I only want to protect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. And I begged you to turn me, back in the day. For love.\u201d I put my hand on his chest. He was and would always be in his prime. I\u2019d fallen for him in 1604 because he was the whole package\u2014a Scot in a kilt with battle scars. I\u2019d loved him so much I\u2019d been incapable of rational thinking, not even scared of the vampire thing. It had just added to his attraction. I\u2019d been mesmerized by his dark hair, dark eyes and masculine body that knew just how to pleasure mine. That he\u2019d wanted me, a lowborn actor\u2019s widow, had seemed a miracle. I\u2019d have done anything to keep him. Taking on my own pair of fangs had been a no-brainer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI took advantage of your innocence. But I selfishly wanted you with me forever.\u201d He smiled and pulled me against him. \u201cI haven\u2019t regretted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not innocent.\u201d I rubbed against him.</p><p>\u201cOf the vampire world you were.\u201d Jerry growled when I nipped his ear. \u201cGive over, Gloriana. Let me take care of you again. It\u2019s always been my pleasure to do so.\u201d He met my lips with his, kissing his way into my mouth until I sighed and let my tongue tangle with his.</p> <p>My Jerry. I grasped his hair and felt the edge of the worktable when he sat me on top of it. He leaned me back until I lay on it, then trailed his fangs along my jugular until I moaned and tried to press them into the vein.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lass, you\u2019re too weak. Take from me.\u201d His hands were on my breasts as he angled his neck to within an inch of my mouth. \u201cPlease. Let me help you heal properly.\u201d</p><p>I knew I shouldn\u2019t take anything from Jerry. It was opening a door. A slippery slope and all that. What about my independence? But this was my sire. Vamps just can\u2019t say no to their sires, or at least that\u2019s what I told myself.</p><p>So I settled in. He tasted like everything wonderful and familiar and what I needed to be whole again. By the time I came up for air, I could fight a hundred Westwood kids. Which was just as well, because it turns out Vivien wasn\u2019t an only child.</p> <p>Three</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d Jerry sat beside me on the table.</p><p>\u201cLike new.\u201d I jumped off, then pulled off my sweater. \u201cCheck out my back. Is it healed?\u201d I turned around, then felt his fingers trace the spot where I\u2019d been hit.</p><p>\u201cYou seem fine.\u201d His finger slid down to the edge of my bra. \u201cBut I\u2019d better make a more thorough examination.\u201d He deftly opened the clasp.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.\u201d I grabbed my bra to keep it from falling off. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hit anywhere else.\u201d His arms wrapped around me. \u201cJerry, stop. I\u2019m not doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I can lock the door. This is your shop. No one will bother us.\u201d He put his hands over mine, both of us holding my breasts. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Gloriana. Missed touching you.\u201d His breath was warm against my neck. \u201cTasting you.\u201d His fangs slid lightly along my throat.</p> <p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I sighed, almost admitting how much I\u2019d missed him. I closed my eyes and leaned back. I hated being so weak with him. All my resolutions, all my vows of independence were so much talk when it came to actually saying no to Jerry. He slipped one of his hands inside the waistband of my jeans to stroke my stomach. Oh, give me strength. When he eased his fingers into the Promised Land, I gasped and clutched his arms. My panties had been damp since I\u2019d seen him come through the door.</p><p>\u201cShall I lock the door?\u201d His voice was deep, his breath tickling my ear.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His arousal pressed against me. He wanted me, had always wanted me. And wasn\u2019t that an ego boost to a woman who had too much junk in her personal trunk? I wiggled against him and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d He locked it with a glance, then plunged his fingers into me and bit my earlobe. The combo was enough to make me shudder and reach back to grab his ass. I held him tight, wild for him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I let go and opened my jeans, sliding them and my panties down. I heard his zipper as I leaned over so he could spread my legs. My jeans were stuck down near my calves because I still had on those damned boots.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jerry held my breast with one hand while he surged into me from behind. He gripped my inner thigh to keep me from toppling over.</p><p>The pressure was exquisite torture as he found his place and his rhythm. I reached out, grabbed a shelf and held on. The shelf wobbled and sweaters tumbled to the concrete floor. I didn\u2019t care. I was too focused on how, um, wow this felt to worry about my storeroom.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I shrieked as I lost my grip on the shelf. Jerry tugged me against him and sat on the table with me on his lap. The new position did it for me, and Jerry clapped his hand over my mouth to keep me from screaming the building down when I came.</p> <p>At least one of us had remembered there was a roomful of people on the other side of the door. Not that it inhibited us. Still hard and pulsing inside me, Jerry held my hips. I moved and his arms tightened around me. I shivered, savoring the pleasure he\u2019d given me. When his hand fell from my mouth, he leaned on my shoulder, his kiss trailing up to my neck and that pulse point vampires can\u2019t resist.</p><p>I came back to Earth and heard rock music through the walls and people talking. Flo, Richard, Lacy and a few customers were right outside. I leaned back and realized Jerry had never even taken off his sweater.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, lover.\u201d I smiled and felt his answering grin against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re recovered enough?\u201d He kissed my vein.</p><p>\u201cMmm. I think I just proved that.\u201d I tugged on his hair. \u201cBite me, baby.\u201d</p><p>He growled and did, drinking with a rhythm that I felt from my throat to my womb. Then he moved inside me again.</p><p>Oh, my God, but he was going to give me another orgasm. Surely not. I couldn\u2019t\u2014but he reached around and touched me where he knew I was so incredibly sensitive, and I exploded. This time I held my own hands over my mouth and bit my palm. Maybe someday I\u2019d learn self-control. But not tonight.</p><p>By the time I slipped off his lap and found another sweater to wear from the pile on the floor, I was so boneless I staggered. Glory the slut grinned at Jerry the satyr.</p><p>\u201cYou going to let me stay with you today and sleep beside you?\u201d He slung his arm around me, the picture of a sated male who was pretty damned proud of himself. I couldn\u2019t fault him for it.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not.\u201d I smiled to soften what came next. Oops. His arm slid off of me and his face was stony. \u201cCome on, Jerry, you know that shouldn\u2019t have happened. I was in shock after my brush with death. We have issues. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIssues be damned. You love me, or did I imagine your words when we made love just now?\u201d He didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I love you. So I\u2019m willing to work on our relationship. Are you? Are you back for a while?\u201d I put my hand on his chest and smiled. Cozening. It usually worked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No answering smile. Not good.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still have your house here, don\u2019t you?\u201d I grabbed my purse and put on fresh lipstick, then ran my hands through hair that had to look wild. Flo and the rest had probably heard enough to know what we\u2019d done, but I didn\u2019t need to look like it.</p><p>My friend wanted Jerry and me together. And since she\u2019d gotten married, she thought everyone should enjoy wedded bliss. I didn\u2019t believe an immortal should tie that particular knot. Jerry didn\u2019t agree, had even bought me a ring. I wasn\u2019t going to fight either of them about it. One battle a night was enough.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come home with me? I\u2019ve got great security. Westwood\u2019s brat couldn\u2019t get to you there.\u201d Jerry smiled at last, sure he\u2019d just misunderstood my answer the first time, and squeezed my shoulders. \u201cAnd we could talk tomorrow.\u201d \u201cTalk.\u201d A four-letter word in any man\u2019s vocabulary. My, but Jerry was serious about this relationship.</p><p>\u201cNo. My security\u2019s fine.\u201d I stroked his cheek. \u201cI\u2019d love to fall asleep in your arms. Really. But I\u2019ve got phone calls to make. Call me tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sounds like I\u2019m getting the brush-off again.\u201d Jerry stepped away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brushing you off. It\u2019s business, Jer. And important. I\u2019m sure you have things to do too.\u201d I glanced at the clock on my phone, which I\u2019d dug out of my purse. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few hours before dawn, and I need to deal with some wedding stuff, among other things. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow. You\u2019ll not get rid of me so easily then.\u201d He kissed me long and hard. \u201cI\u2019m going out the back way. If I see that Westwood female, I\u2019m taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, no! It\u2019s too dangerous. She has backup. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shifting first. Besides, she\u2019s after you, not all vampires. So I\u2019ll have the element of surprise. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that. She recognized me. Guess her father left records, maybe a photo album.\u201d Which was a creepy thought. Westwood\u2019s most-wanted list. \u201cShe knew I\u2019d been the one to take out her father. Maybe one of his bodyguards got away the night I\u2014\u201d I shut up. Didn\u2019t want to go there again. Sure I\u2019d been stalked by that lunatic. But it still bothered me that I\u2019d killed a human being, though I\u2019d known at the time I had no choice. It had been kill or be killed. I\u2019ve gotten used to the immortality thing.</p><p>\u201cGlory, quit second-guessing. You did what you had to do.\u201d Jerry put his arms around me. \u201cI won\u2019t go on a killing rampage. Yet. But she did attack you. I won\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Whammy her into forgetting the whole thing? Maybe tell her that Daddy dear died in a hunting accident?\u201d I said this into Jerry\u2019s sweater since dredging up the whole Westwood fiasco had me near tears and he\u2019d pulled me close.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d Jerry stepped back and stared into my eyes. \u201cValdez told me exactly what happened. Westwood brought on his own death. The fool should have known better than to take on a vampire, especially one with your skills. I\u2019m proud of you, Gloriana. And I\u2019m damned glad he\u2019s dead. I just wish you\u2019d made him suffer more at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, Jerry. Because he killed your best friend and flaunted his kills with his sickening fang trophy necklace.\u201d I cupped his cheek. Jerry had taken the loss hard and almost inherited his friend\u2019s widow on top of everything else. Mara. No man deserved that woman.</p><p>\u201cSo you did all vampires a service that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m a freakin\u2019 hero.\u201d There had been a dozen or more fangs on that necklace. I shuddered, remembering it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, my hero.\u201d He kissed my palm, then stepped back.

Promise you won\u2019t go out there without shifting first yourself. It\u2019s your best defense.\u201d He gave me a searching look. \u201cYou\u2019re easier with the shifting now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Good idea.\u201d I\u2019m not crazy about shape-shifting, but I\u2019ve learned to do it without freezing in fear that I won\u2019t get back to Glory as usual after I\u2019m done. For centuries I\u2019d had a phobia about that. \u201cMy car\u2019s dead anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Westwood\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t just use the alley. Crowds are a great protection. Use them. And\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDamn it, where\u2019s Valdez? I want to hire him again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget it, Jerry. He\u2019s into this nightclub he\u2019s opening. He\u2019s done with the bodyguard gig.\u201d I gave Jerry an \u201cI mean business\u201d look. \u201cEven if I would tolerate it. Which I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardheaded woman.\u201d He stared at me until I wanted to kiss his stubborn mouth.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You should be used to it.\u201d I gave in to the impulse and pulled his head down to trace his firm mouth with my tongue until he pulled me hard against him.</p><p>When he finally lifted his head and licked his lips, I couldn\u2019t read his mood. \u201cAt least the rest of you is soft.\u201d</p><p>I laughed up at him. \u201cYep. And you seem to like me well enough to overlook my faults.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately I\u2019m a man enslaved by his cock.\u201d He squeezed my backside then turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I fumed as he shifted into a blackbird. \u201cYes, fly the hell away while I\u2019m still speaking to you. And be careful, damn it!\u201d I opened the door and watched him fly into the night. Thank God no arrows hit the door as I closed it and threw home the dead bolts.</p><p>Flo would give me knowing looks once I walked into the shop. So what? Jerry and I were two of a kind. If he was a slave to his cock, then I was a slave to my . . . I grinned. Yes, and wasn\u2019t I lucky to have a man who could satisfy me so unbelievably well?</p><p>I touched the table where we\u2019d just made love. What did they call what we\u2019d just done? A booty call? I straightened my sweater and adjusted my jeans, which had enough spandex to have helped when Jerry had reached inside and . . . I shook my head. Time to get a grip. I had life-and-death issues to deal with. Like planning a trap for Ms. Westwood. Jerry was right. I needed to use some vamp mind control and make her forget she\u2019d ever heard of Glory St. Clair. I headed for the door into the shop.</p><p>\u201cHold it right there, missy.\u201d Emmie Lou Nutt, one of my resident ghosts, shimmered between me and the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Emmie, I\u2019ve got things to do and people to see out there.\u201d I saw her husband, Harvey, shimmer into place beside her. He wore his usual overalls, never wore anything else. Emmie was stuck for eternity in the cowgirl outfit she\u2019d worn the day Harvey had accidentally run over her in his pickup at the Texas State Fair. They lived in my shop because they\u2019d met in this building more years ago than they\u2019d admit.</p> <p>\u201cReckon you don\u2019t wanta be goin\u2019 out there right now, missy. There\u2019s a mischief maker wantin\u2019 a piece of your hide waitin\u2019.\u201d Harvey had a toothpick in his mouth, and he shifted it from the left to the right as he looked at his wife. \u201cTell her, hon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Glory. Hidin\u2019 a stake in his pocket. Good thing he\u2019s not wearin\u2019 them vampire-detectin\u2019 glasses, or he\u2019d of had him a field day with your friends out there. Instead he\u2019s got a picture of you in his pocket right next to that durn stake.\u201d Emmie Lou swished her skirt. \u201cHarvey tossed a purse at his head.\u201d She giggled. \u201cMade him jump. Right, Harvey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did.\u201d Harvey sidled up close to me. \u201cCall your vampire buddies in here and have a confab. You know, send \u2019em one of them there mental messages like ya do. Get Flo to read that fella\u2019s mind. Find out who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Stake Glory week? I wonder if he works for Vivien Westwood?\u201d I realized Harvey had the right idea. I unlocked the storeroom door and sent a mental message to Flo. \u201cWhat did this guy look like?\u201d I listened while Harvey described him. Not exactly rock-star material. In fact, he sounded cute but ordinary. A lot like\u2014</p><p>The storeroom door opened, and Flo and Richard rushed inside, then slammed and locked it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s David Westwood, another heir to the Westwood billions. He\u2019s trying to kill you.\u201d Flo hugged me close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll rip out his throat as soon as he\u2019s outside and away from your shop. I know how you are about bad publicity.\u201d</p><p>I breathed in Flo\u2019s expensive perfume. What was this\u2014a vamp-hunting contest? I pulled back. Yes, got it in one. And how like Brent Westwood to arrange something creepy from the grave.</p><p>\u201cKilling Westwood\u2019s son would be a little more than bad publicity, darling.\u201d Richard leaned against the door. No sign of my ghosts. Apparently they were back in the shop, ready to toss more purses if necessary. I hoped they stuck to non-breakables.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Flo. As much as I\u2019d love an easy solution, I have a feeling that if both a son and a daughter are after me, then there\u2019s probably some kind of paper trail that would make a cover-up difficult.\u201d I sat on the table where I\u2019d had such fun just minutes ago. \u201cAnd how many kids did this billionaire have anyway?\u201d I wished for my laptop, which was in the shop.</p><p>\u201cEasy to find out.\u201d Richard opened the door a crack. \u201cI\u2019m also going to discover how many men he brought in with him. I thought it was busy for eleven o\u2019clock on a Tuesday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody buying anything?\u201d I jumped off the table. At least if business was good that would be some consolation.</p><p>\u201cZilch. Except for this.\u201d Flo held out her wrist. \u201cI love my new bracelet. Vintage costume jewelry is very in right now. And this was a signed piece. Lacy gave Richard a discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect on you.\u201d I knew it was one of my more expensive items too. I smiled at Richard. \u201cBring my laptop in here. We can research the Westwood family, and I\u2019ve got to check on stuff for Flo\u2019s party if I live long enough to throw it. You did register, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Richard grimaced. \u201cOf course we went through that nonsense. Can you imagine vampires picking china and sterling flatware? The crystal goblets? Fine. Bed linens? Sure.\u201d He glanced at Flo. \u201cBut my beloved is enjoying this, so I do what I must.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gloriana, you\u2019ll live to endure every one of these wedding festivities. Now, Florence, lock this door behind me.\u201d He slipped into the shop and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cPah! He loved picking out everything. You should have seen him feeling the towels and comparing thread counts on the sheets.\u201d Flo locked the door. \u201cHe\u2019s right. We\u2019ll take care of these Westwoods. Nothing is going to spoil my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d I forced a smile. Now Flo frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aggie. She says she\u2019s giving me a shower. Do you think she means one of those parties with gifts? Or ...\u201d She paced around the workroom.</p><p>\u201cWell, Flo, she is a Siren. Weather is her specialty. I\u2019ve seen her drum up a typhoon when she\u2019s unhappy. I\u2019ll check with her.\u201d I hugged my former roomie. \u201cOf course you should have a bridal shower. Wish I\u2019d thought of it. Tell me where you\u2019re registered, and I\u2019ll make sure she puts it on the invitations.\u201d I\u2019d put the screws to Aggie a.k.a. Aglaophonos. The Siren owed me. If a bridal shower would make Flo happy, then Aggie would deliver. And no one would end up wet.</p><p>We both looked up when there was a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Richard.\u201d Flo unlocked the door and eased it open.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone. I planted the idea that you\u2019d had a run-in with his sister and had fled town. Wouldn\u2019t be back for months.\u201d Richard laid the laptop on the table. \u201cThat should hold them off for a while. But we can\u2019t count on that to last. He\u2019s bound to have his own investigators.\u201d He opened the laptop and booted it up. \u201cNow let\u2019s see just how many little Westwoods are running around praying for a Glory sighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Richard, what\u2019s the deal? Why are they all after me?\u201d I looked over his shoulder. Google had a lot of sites about the billionaire, but Richard had become a pro at picking out the best one. Soon we could see a family portrait. I sagged with relief. Two kids. Vivien and David. Okay.</p><p>\u201cSeems Westwood\u2019s determined to get you even from the grave, Glory. I read young David\u2019s mind. The will says that if Dad\u2019s taken down by a vampire, the kid who gets the vamp \u2018assassin\u2019 gets the gold. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sank down on the table.</p><p>\u201cYep. Billions, made from the tech industry. And, trust me, Westwood sold out long before any problems with the economy. So it\u2019s a huge pile.\u201d Richard was on a page now that showed a bio for each child. Neither Vivien nor David seemed to work for a living, obviously sponging off Daddy. One lived in Hollywood and the other in Paris. Both had expensive tastes judging by the homes they kept.</p><p>\u201cDavid was really ramped up about it. He didn\u2019t even know Dad was missing until his allowance check didn\u2019t come on time. Seems they weren\u2019t close. Anyway, he and his sister jetted here to see what\u2019s what and met two bodyguards who told this wild tale about how Dad bit the big one at the hands of this female vampire. Had a cell phone video to prove it.\u201d Richard put his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. They took video?\u201d I looked at Flo. \u201cI\u2019m cooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d Richard still looked very serious. \u201cIt was poor quality. Made at night, from a distance. The guards knew your name because Westwood had talked about you so much. You know he was pretty obsessed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. He stalked me.\u201d I was mad now. Haunting me from the grave. How sick was that? \u201cBut what are his kids doing here? I mean, revenge? Surely a will that mentioned vampires wouldn\u2019t hold up in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Richard smiled. \u201cAnd I think when David and his sister calm down, they\u2019ll realize that. They got into his papers without consulting a lawyer. One look at the terms and sibling rivalry kicked in. Unfortunately, Westwood set up a timeline in his will. If he\u2019s not avenged within a certain time frame, the bulk of his estate goes to some charity\u2014the Save the World from Vampires Fund. A crock, of course. Run by one of his hunting buddies.\u201d Richard was on the fund\u2019s Web site.</p><p>\u201cListen to this: \u2018Our mission is to hunt down and exterminate the fanged monsters who prey on innocent victims for their blood. Membership in our organization is free to any who share our core values. For information on special vampire-hunting equipment, click on the following links.\u2019 Then there\u2019s a list of places where you can buy things like stakes, holy water and crosses, the usual foolishness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot Westwood\u2019s special goggles, I hope.\u201d I hated those things. He\u2019d developed goggles with lenses that could identify a vampire by the lack of a mortal\u2019s normal body heat. The worst was that he\u2019d had a pair that looked like regular sunglasses. It made my usual blending into crowds impossible.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t see them here.\u201d Richard glanced at me. \u201cGuess he didn\u2019t want to share all his trade secrets. But his crossbow and olive wood arrows are here. Expensive as hell.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered and scratched my back. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, mia amica. We will take them out. Set a trap and make these Westwoods vanish. S\u00ec?\u201d Flo put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cNo, like Richard said, we need for them to see this will is bogus. No court would let it stand. And so far Westwood is just missing, unless they found his body. David have any thoughts about that, Richard?\u201d I swallowed, thinking about it.</p> <p>\u201cHe hired a private firm to search the area the bodyguards told him about. Didn\u2019t want to involve the police because Dad was always low-profile and it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to go off on hunts for months at a time without communicating. He did always arrange to sign important financial documents though. That\u2019s what got the kids\u2019 attention this time. Bottom line, David didn\u2019t want his father\u2019s vampire obsession made public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want the vamp stuff public, he should get that Web site you\u2019re looking at taken down.\u201d I felt like I wore a target on my itchy back.</p><p>Richard suddenly swore, using words I\u2019d never heard from the former priest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Flo and I ran to stand behind him.</p><p>He started to slam the laptop shut, then shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. This site has to come down. But not to protect Westwood. No one should see these pictures. They\u2019re sickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo?\u201d Flo put her arms around him. \u201cCaro, you\u2019re scaring us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Westwood\u2019s \u2018Kills.\u2019\u201d Richard stared at me. \u201cYou should never regret ending that worthless sod\u2019s life, Gloriana. Look.\u201d He lifted the screen and clicked the mouse. There was a gallery of photos. He double clicked, and we could see Westwood standing with his crossbow, his foot on the body of a man who\u2019d been shot in the chest, the arrow still in his heart.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I felt sick as Richard enlarged the photo. In Westwood\u2019s bloody palm were two fangs. Tears filled my eyes. \u201cDo you think . . . could Jerry\u2019s friend Mac Tavish be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook away, Glory. Ricardo, shut that damned computer right now!\u201d Flo led me from Richard\u2019s side as she muttered Italian curses under her breath. \u201cHe\u2019s there, cara. I saw him. But you don\u2019t need to. Eight men, four women. Bastardo! I recognized . . .\u201d Her voice caught. \u201cI knew at least six of them, maybe more if I had time to study.\u201d More bitter Italian.</p><p>I turned, and we held each other as we cried. I\u2019d never seen Flo cry. Richard wrapped his arms around both of us. We stood there, a sad, sad trio for several moments. Then Richard stepped back and grabbed a roll of paper towels out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDry up, ladies. Thanks to Gloriana, the man will never kill another vampire or take another pair of fangs.\u201d Richard handed us each enough paper towels to dry every window in my shop.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ec, mia amica.\u201d Flo sniffed and dabbed at her eyes. \u201cNever forget that you did a wonderful thing, putting down that monster. We will make sure his children do not go on with their vendetta. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be tricky, but I swear it.\u201d Richard sat in front of the computer again. \u201cThere\u2019s this damned Web site, and he owned a tech company. I don\u2019t see how we can crash the site.\u201d Richard shut down the computer. \u201cBut, Glory, we\u2019re in this all the way. Whatever needs doing, we\u2019re here to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ec.\u201d Flo smiled at Richard. \u201cAnd pray for a miracle too, eh, Ricardo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He smiled at his wife and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>I wished for Blade\u2019s strong arms then. But I was glad he hadn\u2019t seen Mac posed as a trophy. I\u2019d swear Flo and Richard to secrecy on that point. They had good intentions, and I appreciated that. But that\u2019s all they were. Intentions. Right now what we needed was a solid plan of action. And right now we had zilch.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cI love purple. Not as slimming as black, but not all of us have figure issues.\u201d Aggie and Flo had their heads together over the magazine picture of the new bridesmaid dresses. Flo had agreed to pay an extravagant amount to rush the order, and we were good to go. Unless I killed Aggie before the wedding.</p><p>\u201cWhen you were a disgusting scaly sea monster, you didn\u2019t even have a figure, Aggie, so I wouldn\u2019t go there, if I were you.\u201d I\u2019d called Aggie to come over to discuss the shower she\u2019d proposed, not sure a Siren knew squat about wedding customs. That was the sixth dig since she\u2019d arrived. We weren\u2019t buds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both look beautiful in this dress.\u201d Flo ignored the tension. \u201cThis is my wedding. All eyes will be on me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. They will be. We\u2019re just the warm-up for the main event when we walk down the aisle in front of you.\u201d Even I had to admit Aggie looked sexy and stylish now, but as a sea monster, she\u2019d been willing to send me to hell to save her size-six butt.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you need so many bridesmaids?\u201d I stepped between Flo and Aggie.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to cut me out?\u201d Aggie pushed me aside. \u201cI\u2019m into this now. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want both of you. But, Glory, you\u2019re my number one, the maid of honor.\u201d Flo smiled.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So it\u2019s my duty to make sure things are done right.\u201d I fake smiled at Aggie. \u201cNow tell us what you\u2019ve got in mind for Flo\u2019s shower.\u201d I snatched the magazine.</p><p>Aggie grinned, her once slimy green teeth now a gleaming white. \u201cNo worries. My boss the Storm God is all over it. There will be an awesome display of thunder and lightning, Flo. Then a water spout over the lake. Your guests will love it. I\u2019m renting out the banquet room at that cute Mexican restaurant overlooking the water. I know you can\u2019t eat, but the shifters can, and there will be drinks for them too. Margaritas. Ol\u00e9.\u201d Aggie fluffed her blond hair and gave me a look that said, \u201cTop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a clue. A bridal shower isn\u2019t about the weather, Aggie. You shower gifts on the bride.\u201d I glanced at Flo, sending her a mental message that this sometime mermaid had to go.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Aggie had her chin up. \u201cWatch your mouth, fang girl. You have no idea what I had to do to get my boss to loosen the purse strings.\u201d She smiled at Flo. \u201cBut it\u2019s all good. Achy likes seeing me make nice with\u201d\u2014she looked me over\u2014\u201cthe not-so-little people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you slimy\u2014\u201d I lunged for her, sick of her attitude.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Flo jumped between us. \u201cIf you fight, where\u2019s the fun? The celebration?\u201d She glared at Aggie. \u201cFang girl? Look at me.\u201d She pointed at her own impressive pearly whites. \u201cGlory and I are vampires. Never forget it.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cAnd Aggie isn\u2019t slimy now. She\u2019s trying to make nice. Do me a favor? Make nice back.\u201d Her mental message was more blunt, but I loved my best bud and bit the bullet.</p><p>\u201cFine. Have at it, Aggie. A shower? Hell, throw a typhoon if you want to.\u201d I knew a challenge when I heard one. \u201cI\u2019ve got the bachelorette party.\u201d I smiled, full fang. \u201cFlo, a hot male dancer and exotic synthetic brews. How does that sound? My party will blow Aggie\u2019s right out of the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, sister. This is a lingerie shower, Flo. New undies and sexy nighties for your man to enjoy.\u201d Aggie\u2019s face was flushed, and if she\u2019d had her fish tail, I\u2019m sure it would have been whipping back and forth. \u201cI\u2019ve got a hundred bucks says our gal here goes for that over watching some random guy do a bump and grind while she drinks fake blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d I\u2019d worry about where I\u2019d get an extra hundred later. No, I wouldn\u2019t. My party would beat hers all to hell. If I could find a hot guy to dance, that is.</p><p>Flo was dancing around the room. \u201cYay! A party contest and I\u2019m the winner.\u201d</p><p>Aggie stopped Flo with a hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou bet you are. I\u2019ll have some kind of imported blood at my deal too. Maybe I can find margarita-flavored stuff for you on the Internet. Or I could bring in some mortals for you to suck dry.\u201d She winked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying human wedding customs, but maybe vamps do things differently. It\u2019s my first time as a bridesmaid since I don\u2019t count ancient rituals.\u201d She smirked. \u201cThe sacrificial virgin thing is a blast but doesn\u2019t exactly include a happily ever after for the bride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hmm. Aggie definitely had a dark side. But Flo sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo mortals for drinking. The Austin vampires have rules against that, and my brother is on the council. I promised him I would obey their stuffy rules.\u201d Flo smiled. \u201cMargaritas for vamps though? Go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s the Storm God involved in Flo\u2019s shower? I figured he\u2019d be back in the Mediterranean by now. Doesn\u2019t he trust you on your own?\u201d I\u2019d had a run-in with him, and he was freaky scary. Any place where he hung out was a place I didn\u2019t want to be.</p> <p>\u201cAw, Glory, afraid he\u2019ll zap you with another lightning bolt?\u201d Aggie laughed. \u201cFlo, that would make your shower sizzle.\u201d</p><p>Flo shook her head. \u201cForget it, Aggie. Last time Glory got hit by lightning, her hair was ugly frizzy for days. I want her to look nice for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention it hurt like hell.\u201d I sat on a stool. \u201cI hope you have some control over Achelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Aggie sighed and grabbed the magazine again to stare at the bridesmaid dress. \u201cHe\u2019ll do what he wants.\u201d She ran her hand down her perfect figure, which was poured into a green sweater and skinny black jeans. \u201cI have to let him play weather guy at the shower, or it\u2019s back to sitting on a rock in the lake with my fish tail, singing for my supper.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019m so over that this century.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I almost felt sorry for her. Then she gave me an evil look and turned to Flo. \u201cFlo, honey, I need a guest list and your sizes. I\u2019ll send the invitations out this week. Here\u2019s the date I\u2019ve reserved. Will it work for you? I bet Glory hasn\u2019t even started working on her party yet.\u201d Aggie whipped out a pocket calendar from her designer handbag.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at what I\u2019ve got going.\u201d I glanced at the date and made a note of it. \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to nail down details right now. Flo, I\u2019ll let you know all about it later.\u201d</p><p>My ex-roomie dabbed at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky. Such thoughtful friends doing this for me. I can\u2019t believe I never got married before. Glory, marry Jeremiah. We\u2019ll throw many parties and a giant wedding. Lots of presents. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse. \u201cThanks but no thanks. See you later. I\u2019m sneaking upstairs. Front door. Hopefully no one will try to shoot me this time. Maybe I\u2019ll use a customer as a human shield.\u201d I heard Aggie bombarding Flo with hopeful questions as I stepped into the shop. Like maybe I\u2019d be killed and she\u2019d win by default? Bitch.</p><p>My night clerk had come in to relieve Lacy, and there were no human customers. I glanced out the plate glass window, and the sidewalk in front of the store seemed clear. Three in the morning. A dead time of night but staying open twenty-four hours was still a novelty that had served me well. I knew the action would pick up later when shifts changed at a nearby hospital and the downtown hotels.</p><p>I\u2019d called him earlier and expected Rafe to be waiting for me, but once safely upstairs, there was no sign of him. I kicked off my shoes and pulled out my cell phone. Wait a minute. Was that the shower running? Hadn\u2019t we just had this conversation? I stomped over to the bathroom door and pounded on it with my fist.</p><p>The water turned off immediately, but I felt heat through the door. There wasn\u2019t going to be a speck of hot water left. I\u2019d worked up a good mad by the time the door opened a crack.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I kicked at the door.</p><p>\u201cTaking a shower. Who the hell are you?\u201d The door opened wider, and the woman wearing a towel looked me over from head to toe, then sniffed.</p><p>I recognized that look and that sniff. Had endured that treatment for centuries. It was the \u201cI\u2019ve got what you wish you had, honey, now get out of my way\u201d look. I stood my ground. I mean, it was my apartment, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Glory St. Clair, the woman who pays the rent on this place and who gets first dibs on the hot water here. Who the hell are you?\u201d I checked her out. Didn\u2019t take long. She was tall and slim. Her dripping hair was midnight black and so thick it would probably take her an hour to blow it dry. The towel was knotted between small perky breasts. That same towel barely met around me and had certainly never tied into a firm knot. Damn.</p><p>\u201cNadia Komisky, Rafael\u2019s business partner. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve inconvenienced you.\u201d She smiled, showing perfect teeth, shiny white with cute little fangs, and held out a hand.</p><p>\u201cAh, Nadia. So glad you\u2019ve decided to help Rafe.\u201d Against my better judgment, I shook her hand. She didn\u2019t do any creepy vamp moves on me, just touched palms and backed up to grab another towel for her wet hair. She was so damned gorgeous with her pale skin, dark eyes and thick lashes, I wanted to hate her. Too bad her smile was friendly and she was actually being nice as she kept apologizing while she wrapped her hair in the towel.</p><p>\u201cRafael didn\u2019t warn you, the bad boy. But when I got to Austin, I found there was no safe place to stay. This town is so primitive!\u201d Nadia laughed. \u201cWell, for vampires anyway. I told Rafe we should open a vampire hotel. But he is hot to do the club thing. Really wanted a cozy bar, but I said that is silly with the college so close. Students like music and dancing, and the space he\u2019s leasing is perfect for a nightclub.\u201d</p><p>I followed her out to the living room. Did she plan to put on clothes? She had long legs and bare feet that were elegant with pretty red-painted toenails. Mine needed a fresh coat of something.</p> <p>\u201cStudents do love a good club. And something new. Sounds great.\u201d I noticed a small open suitcase by the door.</p><p>Nadia casually dropped her towel and stepped into a black thong then pulled a black T-shirt over her head. Next came a stretchy black skirt, and she was dressed. She sat on the couch and went to work on towel drying her hair. I couldn\u2019t imagine being that unself-conscious about my body in front of a stranger. I kept my double-wide hips hidden from everyone but Blade, who had a weird liking for them. No wonder I loved him.</p><p>\u201cWe have a name for the club now. N-V. What do you think? Can you see it? In bloodred neon? For Nadia and Valdez, of course.\u201d Nadia pulled a brush out of a black leather tote and ran it ruthlessly through her hair.</p><p>\u201cN-V. Yes, I get it. Like envy. Has a sexy vibe. What does Rafe think?\u201d I turned when the hall door opened.</p><p>\u201cRafe thinks money talks. We\u2019re still working out the kinks, but Nadia\u2019s an old pro when it comes to the club scene. I see you two have met.\u201d Rafe walked in with a grocery bag and set it on the kitchen table. \u201cSorry about this, Glory, but there was nowhere else for Nadia to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Vampires have to stick together. Will you two be sharing your bedroom?\u201d I got that out with a straight face, though I felt my cheeks go warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Rafael? Do you want me to sleep on the couch? Glory wants to know if we are lovers.\u201d Nadia raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Rafe glanced at me. \u201cWe\u2019re all just friends here. But you can use my bed during the day, Nadia. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be busy with the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to him, breaking my heart.\u201d Nadia sighed. \u201cWe used to be lovers. Now he offers me his bed to die in during the day. No hokeypokey, Rafael?\u201d</p><p>I hid my grin. Rafe laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cLook out, Nadia, your Russian roots are showing. I think you mean hanky-panky. And we\u2019ve got a lot to do to get this club up and running. Let\u2019s keep us strictly business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. You were a very talented lover, my friend.\u201d Nadia smiled and looked me over. \u201cAre you and Glory exclusive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe and I are just good friends. But you can stay here as long as you need to.\u201d I got up, my mind full of Rafe\u2019s \u201ctalents.\u201d He just grinned and winked. \u201cCan we talk business? I have a proposition for you. Nadia, I\u2019ve got synthetics. Not the best, but you\u2019re welcome to try one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, Glory. Rafe went out to get some of my brand. I insist you try it.\u201d Nadia gestured, and Rafe pulled a six-pack out of his bag. It was an exotic synthetic I\u2019d never heard of.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that? I\u2019d love to try something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamian had some. Nadia wants what she wants, so I called and he agreed to sell her some.\u201d Rafe went to work on a sealed cap. \u201cHe charged you big bucks for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Damian and I had a hookup in Belgium once. He and I are both business people, so I didn\u2019t expect a discount. You gave him my credit card number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019ll keep it on file, he said. I guess he\u2019s remembering that hookup fondly, because he said just call when you want more. He\u2019ll have it delivered next time to wherever you end up staying.\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand and took the bottle from Rafe. The aroma was incredible and the taste . . . Well, whatever Nadia had paid was well worth it. I\u2019d planned to sip, to make it last, but it was gone way too soon.</p><p>\u201cThat was delicious.\u201d I sighed and put the empty on the table next to me. I guess I\u2019d known Damian sold high-end synthetics to vamps who could afford them, just never paid attention because I wasn\u2019t in his league. I ordered my budget stuff off the Internet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made in Bulgaria. I suspect there\u2019s genuine blood in here. Which makes it extra fine, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I noticed Rafe frowning at me. \u201cWhat? Surely they use a blood bank.\u201d</p><p>Nadia laughed. \u201cWhatever you say, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. You can drink whatever you want as long as I\u2019m not your donor.\u201d He focused on me. \u201cGlory, why didn\u2019t you tell me there\u2019s a bounty on your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s not. Exactly. And how did you find out? Damian?\u201d When Rafe nodded, I sighed. Flo must have called her brother. He wasn\u2019t just a member, he was head of Austin\u2019s vampire council. I hoped the council didn\u2019t decide to get involved in my personal problem. If they thought I was a threat to the vampire community, they could demand I leave the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlory? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nadia leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cI killed a billionaire. His will leaves everything to the child who takes me out first. Thank God there are only two children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a legacy, sending them after a vampire. My father slapped me around, but at least when he died, we were done.\u201d Nadia sipped her drink, which she\u2019d insisted Rafe pour into a goblet. \u201cKill them and your worries are over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d Of course, was it fair to be shot with a crossbow? Rafe straightened from where he\u2019d leaned against the doorway into the kitchen. Oops, forgot to block my thoughts, and Flo must have left out that detail. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not that simple. They die, and the money goes to a vamp-hunting foundation dedicated to staking Glory St. Clair. Then I\u2019ll have legions of vamp hunters after me.\u201d I grabbed my empty and got up to recycle it.</p><p>Nadia smiled at Rafe, who looked like he was about to explode. \u201cRafael, give Glory another bottle of Diablo Red. She obviously needs it. Then tell me how you killed this billionaire. I love a good story that ends with death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took him out to save me.\u201d Rafe handed me the bottle, then blocked me from leaving the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get hit?\u201d He touched my shoulder, then tugged aside my sweater to stare at the pale pink scar that would be gone by tomorrow night. \u201cShit, Glory. Thank God this Westwood isn\u2019t the shot the father was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had something to do with the miss. I ran like hell.\u201d My skin tingled where Rafe\u2019s warm fingers touched me, and I put my hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m fine. No worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a next time, and you might not be so lucky.\u201d He stared down at me, his eyes dark and reeling me in closer.</p> <p>\u201cLucky? Maybe I don\u2019t need luck. I can take care of myself, Rafe.\u201d I put my hand on his chest, feeling wobbly. \u201cNow that I know I\u2019m a target, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d</p><p>He steadied me with his other arm at my waist. \u201cI can see that. What the hell were you doing that they got off this kind of shot? Hanging out in that damned alley again? Probably digging in your purse for keys or a lipstick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like an idiot.\u201d I shoved back.</p><p>\u201cNo, just spoiled. Used to someone else watching your back.\u201d He grabbed my arm when I tried to walk away. \u201cSeven inches, Glory. Seven inches to the left and you\u2019d be gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to freak me out.\u201d I looked down until he released me. \u201cI\u2019m scared enough without you piling on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSparks are flying, you two. You sure there\u2019s no hanky-panky here?\u201d Nadia chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRafe won\u2019t stop playing guard dog.\u201d I immediately regretted that. Especially when Rafe\u2019s lips firmed and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d He stomped into the kitchen, coming out with a cold bottle of beer and twisting off the cap. \u201cNot every woman is as self-sufficient as you are, Nadia. Some vampires need keepers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some keepers need a muzzle.\u201d I shot him a mental finger and, ignoring the fact that innocent Bulgarians might have been sacrificed in the making of this delicious drink, chugged another bottle. Then I told Nadia all about Brent Westwood. She gasped when I mentioned his vamp-detecting glasses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible. If he sold those to every hunter, it would make us easy targets.\u201d Nadia frowned. \u201cHow do they work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not new technology. It\u2019s the same thing they use for night-vision goggles. Westwood just figured out that he could use them to scan a crowd of people, checking for body heat. Any person who isn\u2019t giving off normal heat has to be one of us.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHe made them look like regular sunglasses. So you never know whether a guy is someone who thinks it\u2019s cool to wear shades at night or if he\u2019s checking you out for fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever. The man was obviously a twisted genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Twisted for sure. He collected fangs. He had over a dozen pairs on a necklace he wore around his neck.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cOne set was from a dear friend. When V\u2019s life was on the line, I didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBravo.\u201d Nadia smiled at me. \u201cRafael, admit it. Your friend here is a strong woman. Why did you need to guard her for so many years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer boyfriend hired me. Blade\u2019s very protective.\u201d Rafe polished off his beer. \u201cGlory\u2019s a little late to the game, but she says she\u2019s through letting him interfere in her life. Or has that changed?\u201d He smiled, like maybe he\u2019d smelled Blade on me.</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cNo, he\u2019s back in town, but I told him I\u2019m still going it alone. No more of his hired goons.\u201d I faked a wince. \u201cI mean guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade is your sire?\u201d Nadia looked from me to Rafe.</p><p>\u201cAnd was my lover. So it wasn\u2019t easy for me to refuse his help.\u201d I realized that sounded lame, especially when I was talking to a woman like Nadia, who seemed so together. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m on my own now. I have a business and it\u2019s doing well. But these Westwood brats are trying to ruin it for me. I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to derail the \u2018Get Glory\u2019 train. Without killing anyone,\u201d I added, because it was clear Nadia was still on board with taking out the kids and worrying about the consequences later.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s out of the question to ask you to skip town, then.\u201d Rafe grabbed my empty bottle then stalked to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running away. I\u2019ve got friends here, a business. I won\u2019t let them spoil it.\u201d I followed him. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun or stay and fight. If it\u2019s a fight, I\u2019m in. Sounds like fun.\u201d Nadia yawned, reminding me that it was just an hour from dawn. \u201cYou had a proposition, Glory. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not open yet, but I was hoping I could rent your new place. For a bachelorette party. Is that possible?\u201d I glanced at Rafe. We\u2019d been sniping at each other all night, but I figured he\u2019d still do me a favor. Nadia was an unknown quantity. Sure she was friendly, but when it came to business, I had a feeling she was all about the bottom line.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Rafael?\u201d Nadia smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not? I don\u2019t think we can turn away business at this point, and this is for a friend\u2019s wedding.\u201d Rafe gave me a nod. \u201cThe bride\u2019s my friend too. A party for a bunch of women? How much trouble can it be?\u201d Rafe dumped the bottles in the recycle bin and walked back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? A bachelorette party? Listen, Rafael, you have no idea how ugly those things can get. I have experience in these matters.\u201d Nadia looked around the apartment, assessing my net worth. \u201cThere will be a security deposit of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I smiled. \u201cThe bride\u2019s footing the bill. Damian\u2019s sister. Maybe you know her too. Florence da Vinci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Florence. Of course. She\u2019s good for it, then. And she\u2019s getting married?\u201d Nadia\u2019s eyebrows were up and her mouth amused. \u201cThe man who caught her must be something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard Mainwaring. Do you know him?\u201d I saw Nadia shake her head. \u201cJust as well. Flo\u2019s the jealous type. Anyway, Richard knows how to handle her.\u201d I grinned at Rafe. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment. Guys stick together. And any man who thinks he can handle a woman is clueless.\u201d Rafe was on his second bottle of beer. \u201cBachelorette party. You ladies are going all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this to be amazing. I\u2019ve got to find a male dancer. One of those Chippendale types.\u201d I figured that was something Aggie couldn\u2019t beat with her panty party.</p><p>\u201cLook no further.\u201d Nadia\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cDid Rafael ever tell you he\u2019s one of the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Rafe, you can dance?\u201d I looked at him slouched against the kitchen table. He certainly had the body for it. I remembered him in a towel. Now if he had the moves . . . I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He can shake his moneymaker, eh, Rafael?\u201d Nadia laughed and stood. \u201cWhy are you frowning? Surely you would do this for your friend. Think how this will make the party a success. When he danced in my club in Charleston, he was called the Fallen Angel, Glory. The wings were the first to go, of course. His G-string was made out of white feathers. Very few white feathers.\u201d She laughed again and grabbed her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cThanks for sharing, Nadia.\u201d Rafe slammed his empty bottle on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou said your bedroom is at the end of the hall, Rafael? I\u2019m going to bed. It was a long flight from New Orleans. Thanks for letting me stay, Glory.\u201d She stopped next to my CD collection and plucked out a case. \u201cPut this on and let Rafael do his thing. I think you\u2019ll like what you see.\u201d She winked and headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThe Fallen Angel?\u201d I grinned at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see my moves?\u201d He stalked over to my chair and pulled me to my feet. \u201cFallen for sure. Nothing angelic about it. The ladies wanted a bad man.\u201d His lips parted, and I saw the tip of his tongue. \u201cI could handle that.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath. I felt his heat, a shifter\u2019s heat, an inferno compared to a vampire\u2019s temp. Then there was his smell, earthy with a hint of the animal I knew he could be. I\u2019d memorized it in the five years we\u2019d been together and would know it with my eyes closed in a crowd of a thousand men.</p><p>Bad? Suddenly he had the vibe down, from the gleam in his dark eyes to the way he leaned into my space, just inches from the tips of my aching breasts. His gaze raked over my body like he was remembering how I looked naked. Oh, yeah, he\u2019d seen me a time or two. Accidentally, but still . . . I wanted to step back, to touch myself, to do something to ease this damp welcome that hit me hard and fast.</p><p>Instead I smiled and shook my hair back, pretending I was unfazed by his act. Yeah, that\u2019s all it was. A show. He didn\u2019t mean any of it. He\u2019d done the same hot-gaze thing hundreds of times with strangers in crowded clubs for tips. Good to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you dance for Flo\u2019s party?\u201d Yay, Glory. Got that out in a normal voice.</p><p>\u201cNot a good idea.\u201d His eyes lingered on my lips, then swept over my body again, every spot sizzling where they touched.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Nadia says you\u2019re very . . . talented.\u201d I didn\u2019t shift so much as a toenail. God, but I was working my self-control.</p> <p>\u201cYou decide.\u201d He abruptly stepped away to pop the CD into the player and turned the music on loud enough so the bass vibrated. I knew the walls were well insulated, but my neighbors wouldn\u2019t care that it was close to dawn. They were night creatures too. I did hear a laugh coming from down the hall. Forget the hall. Rafe shoved me onto the couch and pushed the coffee table out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I sat sprawled where I\u2019d landed and watched him unbutton his shirt, his hips moving to the music. His chest was broad, strong, ripped. I knew that. Shouldn\u2019t care. But combined with that sexy beat and those moves . . . Oh, my.</p><p>\u201cGiving you the full effect. I\u2019d take off my pants, but you know how I feel about underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I flushed from my cheeks to my toes. \u201cI mean, for a really good audition I should see the whole act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your imagination.\u201d He moved closer.</p> <p>No problem. His skimpy towel routine had given me plenty to work with.</p><p>Get with the program, Glory. Show him this is no big deal. I jumped up, grabbed my purse and pulled a twenty from my wallet. I waved it in front of me, laughing when Rafe danced closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this get me?\u201d I looked to where his jeans hung low on his hips. The arrow of dark hair below his navel made my fingertips itch.</p><p>\u201cIn a club? Sit back down and I\u2019ll give you a lap dance. But you\u2019d need to add another couple of twenties to that.\u201d He shoved me onto the couch again. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a discount.\u201d</p><p>Then he was on the couch, his knees on either side of mine. The bulge between his legs brushed against my stomach as he braced his arms on the seat back. He lowered his head with a heavy-lidded stare before he pushed my hair back with his nose, his hot breath teasing my right ear.</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d</p> <p>I was surrounded by his heat, the pulsing of the music echoing the throbbing inside me.</p><p>\u201cRafe, I ...\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t actually touching me anywhere. Well, unless you counted the occasional bump of his zipper against my sweater. Trust me, I was counting it. And thinking about reaching for that weight that proved he wasn\u2019t unmoved.</p><p>The music sped up, and Rafe was off of me again, my twenty between his teeth. What the hell?</p><p>He strutted over to the CD player and hit a button. The silence was startling. Worse. You could hear me panting like a teenager after heavy petting.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you like my moves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Had I really squeaked? I cleared my throat. I tried again. \u201cGreat. The ladies will love them. So you\u2019ll do it? Dance for Flo\u2019s bachelorette party?\u201d Flo would go nuts. Aggie would too. No way could she top this.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. Not for a bunch of vampires. One-on-one or in a regular club, no problem.\u201d He picked up his shirt and shrugged into it. Darn. \u201cBut get a bunch of female vampires worked up like you were just now, and you\u2019re liable to find yourself drained dry in a Dumpster. You think I can\u2019t see you have your fangs down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t all that worked up.\u201d Oh, wait. Maybe I did have a little bloodlust thing going along with the other kind of lust. I struggled to my feet and told my fangs to hide again.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were. I know the signs, sweetheart. Even the ones that aren\u2019t so obvious.\u201d He grinned and laid his hand between my breasts. \u201cFor a vampire, this heartbeat is pretty fast, and you didn\u2019t drink enough of that Bulgarian brew to have cheeks that pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not immune. But that\u2019s what you were after, wasn\u2019t it? To get me stirred up? Mission accomplished. It\u2019s a party for Flo. You\u2019ll know a lot of us. Don\u2019t you think I can control my friends?\u201d I lifted his hand off me, though, truth be told, I\u2019d have welcomed it a little closer to my tight nipples. Instead, I fluttered my eyelashes and put my hand on his chest, on top of his shirt. \u201cCome on, Rafe. I need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, sweetheart, but have you ever controlled anybody?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I was too fascinated by the speed of his heartbeat (Hah! I wasn\u2019t the only one turned on, now was I?) to realize what he\u2019d just said. Then it sank in.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? That was unnecessary. So I have a few issues. I\u2019ve been working on them, haven\u2019t I? Didn\u2019t I come back to Austin by myself?\u201d I shoved back and headed for the hall.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Rafe was by my side in an instant. \u201cBut I smelled Blade on you the minute I came into the apartment. He\u2019s already back and got you where he wants you. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Maybe I\u2019ve got him where I want him.\u201d I blinked back tears. But Rafe was right and I knew it. \u201cWe have this connection. It\u2019s in my blood. He\u2019s in my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. You can\u2019t say no to him. Too bad.\u201d He glanced down the hall toward his bedroom. \u201cSo you do your thing, I\u2019ll do mine. Batting your eyelashes at me to get me to dance at your party is pretty lame, Glory. Instead of worrying about shit like that, you should be taking care of this Westwood threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out what to do, so I move on to something I can deal with. Won\u2019t you help me out, Rafe?\u201d I didn\u2019t do the flirting thing this time. Rafe was right. It was a cheap ploy, and we were friends who should be able to be straight with each other. I couldn\u2019t play naughty games with Jerry and then lead Rafe on. It wasn\u2019t fair. To which one of them, I wasn\u2019t sure. My body still throbbed from Rafe\u2019s sexy dance moves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Now if you ask me to help with your security, then I\u2019m in. I\u2019ve got guys I can call. I\u2019m sure Blade will pay the freight again for bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d I leaned against the wall next to my bedroom door. \u201cBut, Rafe, what am I going to do? I can\u2019t kill two mortals who have the misfortune to have had a crazy father. I feel bad enough that I robbed them of a dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestwood needed taking out. This may play out the same way, and you can\u2019t feel guilty about it.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice was hard. I understood. He\u2019d felt the sting of one of the hunter\u2019s arrows too, after throwing his body in the line of fire.</p><p>I shivered and wrapped my arms around myself. That night, when we\u2019d had the \u201cshowdown\u201d as Rafe called it, was still way too vivid a memory. I\u2019d managed to wrestle Westwood\u2019s crossbow away from him and pull the trigger. Then I\u2019d been hustled away from the scene. My last sight of Westwood had been of him bleeding out with one of his own arrows in his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou could always run.\u201d He pulled me to him, his look of sympathy making me feel weepy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tempting.\u201d I took a breath. \u201cDamn it, Rafe, I don\u2019t want to leave Austin, but if I stay here, I\u2019m risking all my friends. Those vamp-detector glasses will spot every vampire who comes near me. The Westwoods might decide to use them for target practice.\u201d I felt overwhelmed and couldn\u2019t see a way out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you, Glory. We\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d Rafe gave me a comforting hug, nothing sexual about it, and I relaxed against him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. I like your friend Nadia. I know you\u2019ll make a success of this club.\u201d I pulled back and touched his cheek. \u201cShe can stay here as long as she needs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate that. But I checked with Damian. He\u2019s got a secure house she can rent, and I\u2019ll set her up there. She likes her own space. And she\u2019ll be bringing in other people to work in the club. Her people. More vamps and shifters she trusts to watch over her during the day.\u201d He glanced in the bathroom. \u201cShe use up all the hot water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019ll just shower when I get up. \u2019Night, Rafe.\u201d I was sinking fast. Dawn couldn\u2019t be very far away. I opened my bedroom door and kicked off my shoes. I hoped Rafe could help me figure out a way to beat these Westwoods. Because right now I felt like waving a white flag and getting it over with.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Rafe stopped me the next evening as I was stuffing my cell in one pocket of my jeans and my credit card in the other.</p><p>\u201cTo work. By way of the roof.\u201d I reached up and patted his cheek. \u201cNo worries, pal. I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to share?\u201d He grabbed my hand and pulled me to the couch. \u201cYou know Vivien Westwood\u2019s not going to give up after one failed attempt. And her brother will quickly figure out that you\u2019re still in town.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d filled Rafe in about the night before. No choice. He\u2019d threatened to go to Blade and offer up some bodyguard buddies for hire if I didn\u2019t come clean with every excruciating detail, right down to Viv\u2019s hair color and where I\u2019d tossed the arrow I\u2019d pulled out of my shoulder after the attack.</p><p>\u201cI get it. So I\u2019m going to go up to the roof, shift into bird form and fly down to check out the alley. If I see it\u2019s clear, I\u2019ll shift back and go into the shop, Glory as usual.\u201d I jumped up, grabbed my keys and stuffed them in with my credit card. Didn\u2019t like the added inches on the hips, but unavoidable.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not clear?\u201d Rafe frowned, obviously trying to decide if I needed him as backup. But I knew he and Nadia had an appointment in a few minutes to sign papers.</p><p>\u201cThen I sneak inside. I know better than to take on the crossbow queen and her hulk by myself again, thank you very much.\u201d I smiled. \u201cRelax, Rafe. I can shift now without freaking out. I\u2019ll use that to my advantage. Once I\u2019m inside the shop, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be okay. The Westwoods wouldn\u2019t dare do something stupid like attack me in front of witnesses.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d Rafe put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m coming up on the roof with you. I want to watch how you handle the alley.\u201d He shook his head when I started to object. \u201cOld habit. Let me do this. It\u2019ll only take a few minutes. Nadia\u2019s still working on her makeup. I\u2019ll be back before she\u2019s got her eyeliner on straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interfere, Rafe. I am handling this. But if you want a front-row seat, for purely entertainment value, come ahead.\u201d I slipped out of his grasp and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cCocky, aren\u2019t you? I hope that doesn\u2019t work against you.\u201d Rafe grumbled as he followed me up the stairs. On the roof, the sky was clear and the stars were out. It was a beautiful night. Too bad. A little cloud cover would have helped. But then the lights were out in the alley so that was okay. Not that I needed them to see Vivien and her tough guy crouched behind my Suburban. What? Did they think I\u2019d go back to my car that wouldn\u2019t start?</p><p>Maybe I was feeling a little cocky, but that was way better than the depression and defeatist attitude of the night before. I\u2019d decided to have a little fun at Viv\u2019s expense.</p> <p>\u201cHere goes.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cPayback for that hurt Ms. Westwood put on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Glory. Be careful.\u201d Rafe was talking to the flutter of my wings, as I\u2019d already shape-shifted into a small brown bird that could land on a wire behind my stalkers without being noticed.</p><p>I settled on the wire and got into some mind reading. Interesting. Viv was aggravated that she\u2019d broken a nail on that crossbow the night before. I chirped with pride when she blamed her misses on what she called my supersonic speed. Her sidekick called the whole thing a pain in his ass. But a paycheck. So he\u2019d crouch here all night as long as he was getting the big bucks. Didn\u2019t believe in this vampire shit. No way. But something was up with the chick from the night before, standing up to them like that. He could usually intimidate women with his size. I chirped again.</p><p>Back to Viv. Now she was worried about the rustling sounds coming from the Dumpster. Didn\u2019t blame her. I\u2019d smelled a rat as soon as I\u2019d landed. And roaches. Trust me, I may be a bloodsucker, but I\u2019m as freaked out by insects and rodents as any other sensible person. Phil the exterminator and I were bosom buddies, so to speak. I flashed cleavage and got the shop checked out twice a month at half price. Of course my own phobia didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t use Viv\u2019s to my advantage . . .</p><p>\u201cYou believe in vampires, Sean?\u201d Viv moved closer to Sean when there was another rustle and a squeak from the Dumpster.</p> <p>\u201cSeems like that\u2019s a question you shoulda asked yourself before you shot at that woman last night, Ms. Westwood. My answer is hell no.\u201d Sean just barely kept from laughing. He was thinking that it was a shame rich people were nuts, but maybe he could use it to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cDaddy was so sure. You saw his house. It\u2019s full of vampire stuff.\u201d Viv grabbed Sean\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean pulled out a sidearm.</p><p>\u201cI think there are rats out here.\u201d Viv was having a hard time concentrating on vampires. Didn\u2019t blame her. \u201cAnyway, if the woman wasn\u2019t a vampire, why didn\u2019t she call the police? I wounded her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of reasons people don\u2019t call the police. Maybe she\u2019s running a little something illegal out of her shop here.\u201d Sean shrugged and put his gun away. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything. You ready to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive more minutes. I\u2019d like to talk to this woman. See what she and Dad had going. Maybe she can tell me where Daddy is or if \u201d\u2014Viv\u2019s voice cracked\u2014\u201che\u2019s alive. Those bodyguards swore she killed him. Maybe she was after his money. Wouldn\u2019t have to be a vampire to be a greedy bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Sean sighed, obviously resigned to waiting.</p><p>A roach scuttled out from under my car, and he casually smashed it with his sneaker. Viv and I both jumped and squealed. Luckily mine came out as a chirp.</p><p>Greedy bitch? Westwood had come after me. I hopped off my perch and landed behind Viv. Another shift and I was ready to show Viv how a real monster worked. Not that Sean would have considered what I had in mind such a freak-out. But Viv would go absolutely nuts. Not even a glance at Sean\u2019s lethal size twelves could stop me. Hey, I was pissed.</p><p>I eased around beside her really nice boots, gray suede, and crawled up the sole to the edge of her jeans. Inside gave me an interesting perspective and a fragrance in a \u201cthe woman used a really expensive body lotion\u201d kind of way. It was almost too much as I headed north. I got to the top of her boot and hit the inside of her knee.</p><p>Hey, Viv, you\u2019ve got a visitor.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d</p><p>She jumped, and I slid a few inches down a well-waxed and toned calf. Her squeal could have shattered glass. Nice.</p><p>\u201cMs. Westwood? What is it?\u201d Sean\u2019s deep voice was hushed and worried. \u201cYou see her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! There\u2019s something, oh, oh, crawling on me!\u201d</p><p>I scampered up until I was in ick territory, way too close to a pair of sheer black panties, then made a circuit of her thigh, doing a little impromptu break dance that made her squeak and screech. Plenty of room for dancing since she hadn\u2019t favored tight jeans. She hopped around, doing a pretty good high kick until she jarred me loose. I slipped down to the top of one boot and almost fell inside, hanging on to the rim with both claws or whatever the hell cockroaches call those things they grab with.</p><p>\u201cHush, now. Someone could hear you. I reckon if there\u2019s something illegal goin\u2019 on in that shop, your girl could have muscle helping her. You want them to come check this alley?\u201d Sean\u2019s voice was soothing, and Viv froze, proving she wasn\u2019t as dumb as she looked. \u201cWhere is it? Point and I\u2019ll kill the sucker.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. I clung tightly to my perch. I really didn\u2019t want to end up inside, next to Viv\u2019s bare foot. These were obviously last year\u2019s favorites, if you get my drift. What had seemed like fun now wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hit me.\u201d Viv shook her leg. \u201cThis is stupid. I don\u2019t feel anything now. Must have been my imagination.\u201d</p><p>Easy for her to say. At least I was slipping down the outside of her boot now and ready to run for freedom.</p><p>\u201cThere goes your imagination, lady.\u201d Sean sounded gleeful. Viv shrieked.</p><p>Guess she\u2019d seen me. I put on vamp speed at the sound of Sean\u2019s shoes behind me. Could I be one of those flying roaches? I was all set to take wing when I was hit from behind and slammed into the brick wall at the back of the shop. I fell to the pavement and lay dazed and still. I knew better than to struggle to my feet. It was dark and from the sweet smell I figured I\u2019d landed in, oh, great, a puddle of molasses from Mugs and Muffins next door. I\u2019d be invisible to a mortal.</p><p>\u201cGot him, Ms. Westwood. Ready to call it a night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need to talk to my brother. This vampire thing is nuts. Daddy was, sorry to say it, a little nuts too. That will makes no sense, and I\u2019m not doing this. We need to lawyer up and see what we can do to get the estate settled.\u201d Viv sounded determined. \u201cBut we need to find Daddy or his, um, body. This Glory St. Clair may have killed him. She looked like the kind of woman who would go after a rich man and take advantage.\u201d Viv sniffled. \u201cPoor Daddy. Bet he tried to break up with her and she wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><p>How did I get to be the bad guy? I wanted to shift and tear out her throat. I even tried to move my foot, but the sticky mess held me prisoner.</p><p>\u201cIs some money missing? Maybe you need to check your daddy\u2019s accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, Sean. I find checks made out to this St. Clair woman, I\u2019ll make sure you get a bonus. A very generous bonus.\u201d Viv\u2019s voice faded as they headed out.</p><p>I lay there, utterly miserable, and decided to console myself with a taste of my bed of pain. Because that kick hadn\u2019t exactly been a love bump. Molasses. No, maple syrup. Mmm. Too bad I couldn\u2019t do more than lick my wing. Mortals would have enjoyed a stack of pancakes with this stuff. I\u2019d heard the coffee shop made killer muffins with maple syrup and brown sugar. I wallowed in self-pity, dreaming of a muffin and wondering if I should try to shift back to my vampire self. I dreaded it. I\u2019d ruin my outfit if I went to Glory form while lying here.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what were you thinking?\u201d Rafe stared down at me.</p><p>I figured that didn\u2019t deserve an answer so I closed my eyes and stayed put, silent and mortified. A cockroach covered in maple syrup. Could I be more wretched? Sure. I could lie here and be reamed out by Rafe. And I had it coming. I\u2019d pulled a stupid, impulsive stunt and had no defense.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Nadia.</p><p>Well, if that didn\u2019t put the icing on my shit cake. I opened my eyes and saw Rafe reaching for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, Glory, I\u2019m going to be very careful. You don\u2019t want to lose a foot or, uh, wing.\u201d Damn it, he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Rafe.\u201d If my thoughts seemed a little defensive, blame it on the fact that my mouth was sealed closed except where I darted out my tongue for a last lick of that delicious syrup. Rafe didn\u2019t say another word, just eased me out of my sticky prison.</p><p>Between Rafe\u2019s gentle handling and Nadia\u2019s excellent self-control\u2014not a smile on her gorgeous face\u2014I would have cried if I thought roaches had tear ducts.</p><p>\u201cThat woman was the enemy after you?\u201d Nadia glanced down the alley. \u201cWe should have left Glory here a little longer and taken care of her when we had the chance, Rafael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Glory asked us to wait and try to solve the problem another way, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d Rafe had me out of the mess. Now he nodded toward Nadia. \u201cI\u2019ve got shop keys in my left front pocket. Would you pull them out? We need the red one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Nadia grinned and took her time probing Rafe\u2019s pocket. At one point he grunted and gave her a look that should have warned her off, but she just laughed and finally held up the set of keys. \u201cGot them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In moments, we were inside. Rafe stuck his head inside the shop and let the clerk on duty know that we were in the back and not to be disturbed.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to try shifting back, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered with syrup. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll end up with that gunk all over the clothes I\u2019m wearing.\u201d I saw Nadia nod.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Give her to me. I\u2019ll take her in the bathroom I see here and carefully clean off the mess. She may end up a little damp, but better than sticky, eh, Glory?\u201d Nadia smiled and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, woman to woman, I understand.\u201d Nadia carried me into the bathroom and was meticulous, using paper towels and even cotton swabs to get the sticky mess off me. Finally, she sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do. Shift and let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I concentrated and ended up hobbling into the back room. Sean\u2019s kick had done a number on my backside. I had a feeling I had a boot print on my butt. My own boots stuck a little when I walked across the floor and I needed to wash my hands, but other than that, my clothes and everything else were in great shape. I impulsively hugged Nadia, careful not to touch her with my hands.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much. I know you guys have an appointment and I\u2019m making you late. You went above and beyond here.\u201d I smiled, then rushed over to rinse the sticky off my hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Nadia shook her head at Rafe. \u201cThis man wasn\u2019t leaving your side until he was sure you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still won\u2019t until I\u2019ve ripped you a new one. Are you friggin\u2019 nuts?\u201d Rafe put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cSean could have stomped you, and no amount of vamp healing could have brought you back. I was seconds away from shifting and ripping his damned head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you let me do it my way. Thanks for that. And I get it. I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d I put my hands over his. \u201cSorry I freaked you out. Temporary insanity. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cThanks. For sticking around. I do appreciate it. Now go take care of your business. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be surrounded by people here, and it\u2019s not your job to keep me safe anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I can\u2019t seem to break the damned habit.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cTry not to do anything stupid while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reached my quota for tonight.\u201d I rubbed my sore butt. \u201cI\u2019m taking it easy for now. Sean must have been a kicker on his high school football team. He sure drop kicked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d Rafe grabbed the back doorknob. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Nadia. I\u2019m done here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I see. Glad you\u2019re all right, Glory.\u201d Nadia followed Rafe. \u201cLock the door behind us. I don\u2019t like these people stalking you. Anyone who wants to kill one vampire is an enemy to all of us.\u201d She shut the door.</p><p>Well. I stared at the closed door, trying to work up warm fuzzies for Nadia, who had been pretty cool about this, and Rafe, who\u2019d actually respected my wishes. But my butt was killing me. Bottom line? My playtime had been a dumb stunt. Hindsight. Oh, I could do jokes like that all night long. Instead, since I was safe inside, I would do a little work for the shop. Too bad Flo and Aggie arrived just then. They were chattering about the latest Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog. Shower research. Fine. Concentrate on the wedding. So I\u2019d make some calls to show Aggie that my party was on track too.</p><p>\u201cSimon Destiny, please. Tell him it\u2019s Glory St. Clair.\u201d</p><p>Flo gasped when she heard me. \u201cGlory, hang up. You know he\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She was right. The leader of the Energy Vampires could arrange to have the stuffing sucked right out of you, and had tried to get to me, Rafe, and even my buddy Flo more than once. But recently we\u2019d called a truce, and now he had something I wanted. This bachelorette party had to rock. And the EVs made stuff you couldn\u2019t get anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cGloriana. How did you know I was just talking about you?\u201d Simon\u2019s snake-oil-salesman voice came on the line. And the idea that he\u2019d been discussing me? Well, it was enough to make the room spin and my stomach camp out in the back of my throat. I\u2019d have sat down, but it wasn\u2019t worth the pain.</p><p>\u201cMust be boring out there in EV land. What on earth would you have to discuss about me?\u201d I held off Flo and shook my head when she tried to snatch my phone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deflect, dear. Why did you call? What can I do for you? Is your friend Israel Caine in town again? I read in the paper that he\u2019s performing here. Also that you two broke up. So sorry to hear that.\u201d Simon oozed fake sympathy. Well, maybe not so fake. He knew Ray could afford his services, including a daylight room and chocolate that vamps could actually eat.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read, Simon. Ray and I are still tight, just not engaged. But I\u2019m not calling for Ray. I\u2019m throwing a little party and want to buy some of your special treats.\u201d I smiled when Flo backed off and settled down to listen.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory, I know you like my chocolate truffles, but those are only available here at headquarters.\u201d Simon chuckled. \u201cBring Israel out here again, and you can have my treats. We\u2019ll arrange a romantic weekend that should have him yours again in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Simon. When I want relationship advice, I know where to come. But don\u2019t you have a menu of things I can do for takeout? Like you do with the Vamp Viagra. Come on, Simon. Flo\u2019s getting married. I\u2019m throwing her a bachelorette party. This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. We hope.\u201d I gasped when I got a stiletto in the instep. \u201cWe know. Anyway, I\u2019m sure Energy Vampires have some great products that a group of ladies could enjoy. Anything margarita flavored?\u201d</p><p>Aggie gave me a narrow-eyed look, clearly seeing me trying to steal her thunder. Oops, bad choice of words. She had the thunder all tied up. Rain and lightning too. Anyway, I heard Simon talking to someone in the background.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll send Greg Kaplan to you with samples. Unless you\u2019d like to suck it up and come out here.\u201d Simon chuckled, like he didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d have the nerve.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what gets sucked up out there. Hate to disappoint, but I\u2019ve been shifting lately. A lot. My energy level\u2019s at an all-time low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that, Gloriana. Your value to me just took a nosedive. But I\u2019d still like to see you. I\u2019ll play nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Nice? Somehow that\u2019s one four-letter word I doubt you know.\u201d I patted Flo\u2019s hand when she put her arm around me. She knew how much I hated dealing with Simon. And that I was doing this for her.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to talk to a man who can give you what you want?\u201d Simon\u2019s voice cooled, and I figured I\u2019d pushed too hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. But we\u2019re talking business, and I\u2019ve got Flo\u2019s platinum card ready to close a deal. You really don\u2019t want me anywhere near your place anyway, Simon. The last time I was out there, my new boyfriend and old boyfriend almost tore the place apart and got you some bad publicity. Besides, that energy-sucking goddess of yours creeps me out. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. You\u2019re wise to be cautious around our supreme being. Many foolish vampires have ignored her power to their regret. But you\u2019d be perfectly safe this time. There\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019d rather suck blood from a rabid hyena.\u201d I smiled at Flo. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Greg hasn\u2019t been sucked dry by now. Seems like he\u2019s always on your to-do list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. But then he comes up with something valuable, and I spare him one more time. What can I say? I guess I\u2019m a soft touch.\u201d Simon said something to whoever was with him, and I\u2019d heard enough. It wasn\u2019t just his goddess who creeped me out. I was going to hang up or hurl right into the phone if I had to put up this brave front one more minute.</p><p>\u201cSend him out, then. When can I expect him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater tonight. No reason to delay. I\u2019ve heard the wedding is in a few weeks.\u201d Simon tossed this off casually while I felt my heart freeze. How did he know that?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Flo\u2019s wedding? You\u2019re not on the guest list.\u201d I glanced at Flo, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI know everything that happens in the vampire world in Austin, well, even in Texas, Gloriana. Why, I know a lot about your recent trip to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Stay out of my business, Simon. Just sell me some of your goods. That\u2019s all.\u201d I ended the call.</p><p>\u201cGreg Kaplan\u2019s coming over with some samples. We can pick out what we want. Aggie, maybe you\u2019ll find something you want for the shower too. That\u2019s why I asked about the margarita stuff.\u201d Guess near death by tennis shoe had rattled my brain tissue. I was actually being nice to Aggie.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Greg Kaplan?\u201d Aggie smiled, folded down a page in the catalog and tossed it on the table.</p><p>\u201cAn old flame of Glory\u2019s. Ended badly, right, Glory?\u201d Flo picked up the catalog. \u201cNo more black, Aggie. I want some color in my underwear drawer. Red, violet, tiger print. Molto sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear the story.\u201d Aggie smiled at me. \u201cHe dump you?\u201d</p><p>Of course she would assume that. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue. The loser is a vampire who wiped out my memory so I wouldn\u2019t remember dating him. Can you believe it? Like he\u2019s such a catch I would have stalked him to try to get him back.\u201d I grabbed a pink silk bustier from a shelf, ready for a subject change. \u201cFlo, this is vintage, but you\u2019d look hot in it. Try it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear more about this vamp who made a fool out of you.\u201d Aggie snagged the bustier out of my hand. \u201cThis is great, though. Maybe I\u2019ll try it on and buy it for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Aggie. And she showed it to me first. I try.\u201d Flo took the bustier and stalked over to the bathroom. \u201cGreg is a toad, but he has good connections, so we\u2019ll be nice to him. Simon Destiny is worse than a toad. He is il diavolo. I would kill him with my bare hands if I wasn\u2019t afraid of him and his goddess.\u201d Flo shuddered and slammed the bathroom door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. Is she kidding? I didn\u2019t think Flo was afraid of anything or anyone.\u201d Aggie was wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cSmart people, vamps, Sirens, whatever, are afraid of Simon Destiny. He\u2019s got power on top of power. I\u2019ve come up against it and almost didn\u2019t live to tell about it.\u201d I leaned against the table. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that freeze thing you do. I bet your boss can do that to you. Am I right?\u201d Aggie could freeze you in place, and you couldn\u2019t even blink. It\u2019s a skill I\u2019d like to have, I tell you that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I hate it. You feel freakin\u2019 helpless.\u201d Aggie shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Simon can do it too. And he can read your mind past any block. Totally blows your defenses.\u201d For once, Aggie and I were in sync.</p><p>\u201cBet he couldn\u2019t read my mind.\u201d Aggie\u2019s chin went up.</p><p>\u201cNot a bet I\u2019d take.\u201d I sighed, tentatively tried to sit on the stool and hopped up again. It was better, but it would take a day of vamp sleep before my bum would be 100 percent. I wished for my computer mirror upstairs. I just knew there was a boot print on one or both of my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure a throw-down between the Storm God and Simon would be quite a sight, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be close by. Simon\u2019s got a goddess backing him that\u2019s from some part of the Underworld. So we tread carefully around the EVs. Unless we have no choice.\u201d I grinned. \u201cI almost skewered Simon once. To save Rafe. Simon\u2019s never forgiven me. So I don\u2019t trust him. I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll try to get even with me someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you called him and sounded calm as can be.\u201d Aggie actually sounded admiring. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you had it in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate my BFF. Eh, Glory?\u201d Flo stepped out of the bathroom, a vision in pale pink and lace. When Richard saw her in that, he\u2019d swallow his tongue. \u201cHow I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous. That\u2019s your shower gift from me. Take it off and I\u2019ll wrap it. Save it for your honeymoon.\u201d I grinned and got up when I heard a knock at the back door. I knew who it was, could smell him through the door, but asked anyway. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour long lost love, Glory. Who else?\u201d Greg said cheerfully. \u201cWhy are there mortals with crossbows and your picture lurking in your alley, lady? Want me to take them out?\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cGet in here.\u201d I grabbed Greg\u2019s arm and dragged him inside, then slammed the door. \u201cAre you crazy? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour. A leader and three bodyguards. That\u2019s my take.\u201d Greg grinned at Aggie. \u201cIntroduce me to this beautiful lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be doing her any favors, but, Aggie, this is Greg Kaplan, the creep I told you about who does grunt work for the EVs. Greg, Aglaophonos, a Siren who can freeze you in your tracks if you do her wrong, so behave yourself.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I bothered warning him; it would have served him right if he\u2019d ended up a statue in the park across the street.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory, I\u2019ve risen in the ranks at EV headquarters lately. And I\u2019m not so bad once you get to know me.\u201d He ignored Flo, who, muttering Italian curses obviously intended for him, had emerged from the bathroom dressed in her own clothes again. He smiled at Aggie. \u201cAggie, I\u2019m sure you can make up your own mind about the men you meet.\u201d Greg gave her his \u201cI\u2019ll seduce the panties off you, but I hope you\u2019re not wearing any\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cI certainly can.\u201d Aggie looked from me to Flo and back to Greg. \u201cThat freeze thing is no joke. I can turn you to what amounts to stone with a look, buddy boy.\u201d She ran a red-painted fingernail down the front of his blue button-down shirt. \u201cBut that\u2019s only in an emergency. Seems a shame to turn a hot guy into a cold statue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as I enjoy watching the mating dance here, we\u2019ve got a war party in the alley, and I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d I tapped Greg on the shoulder. \u201cGive me your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He reached into his jeans pocket anyway, then sniffed. \u201cGlory, anyone tell you your new perfume smells like maple syrup? When I was mortal, I loved the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. If I can\u2019t eat, at least I can smell yummy. Now I assume your number is untraceable. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Can\u2019t have just anyone calling EV headquarters.\u201d Greg grinned at Aggie. \u201cYou should come out there. It\u2019s an amazing place. I\u2019m sure you like water. We\u2019ve got a creek and private pool where you can swim as nature intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m either going to throw up or toss Gregory out the door into the alley again. What are you going to do?\u201d Flo shoved him out of the way and stepped to my side.</p> <p>\u201cListen.\u201d I hit 911 and pressed speaker phone.</p><p>\u201cNine-one-one, what is your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gawd. Oh, my gawd. They\u2019re going to kill us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down, miss. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixth Street. Near the alley behind where I got my new tat and that coffee shop, Mugs and somethin\u2019. Oh, yeah, Muffins! My boyfriend parked his bike there, and when we went to get it, this gang of guys were like hiding between the cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they threaten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! They had, oh, my gawd, spear guns. And Ronnie, he\u2019s saying\u2019 what\u2019re they doin\u2019 next to my bike? And wantin\u2019 to take \u2019em on.\u201d I sobbed noisily.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet \u2019cause I\u2019m not lettin\u2019 him get killed even though he\u2019s got shit for brains. Oh, my gawd, oh, my gawd! They\u2019re comin\u2019 this way! They\u2019ve got real guns too, not just those spear things.\u201d I screamed Ronnie\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cMiss, please stay on the line. Help is on the way.\u201d</p><p>I yelled \u201cNo!\u201d then slammed the phone shut.</p><p>\u201cBravo! I forgot you were an actress, Glory.\u201d Greg clapped.</p><p>\u201cI want to see what happens when the polizia come.\u201d Flo laughed, and even Aggie grinned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out through the front and hit the roof. We should have a great view of the action from there.\u201d I opened the door into the shop and told the clerk I was taking off for a while. There were a couple customers in the store, and we got a few curious looks as we hurried through, my boots squeaking when they stuck to the floor. A quick glance assured me that there wasn\u2019t anyone suspicious out front, so David Westwood must have concentrated on the alley this go-round.</p><p>I punched in the security code, then we ran up the stairs just as we heard sirens coming down Sixth Street. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon sound in this area, and I\u2019m sure David ignored it, figuring there was trouble farther down the street.</p><p>We\u2019d just settled on the roof when police cars screeched to a halt at both ends of the alley. Uniformed officers wearing bulletproof vests hopped out and crouched behind vehicles, shouting for the men hunkered down near the Dumpster and my car to lay down their weapons and come out with their hands up.</p><p>David cursed and threw down his crossbow. His men tossed guns and rifles into a pile, and I shivered. All this to take me out? Flo put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cYou outsmarted them, mia amica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time.\u201d I leaned against her.</p><p>Flo sniffed. \u201cYou do smell funny. And walked funny out of the shop, like you\u2019re hurting. You want to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. Look!\u201d I pointed to a man behind the police cars and the officers assigned to keep the interested crowd back while Westwood\u2019s gang was being handcuffed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you, Glory.\u201d Flo wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Jerry!\u201d I concentrated and sent him a mental message. We were pretty far up, but he should be able to hear me.</p><p>\u201cHe sees us!\u201d Flo hugged me. \u201cNow I feel better. He\u2019ll come, and you can tell him what\u2019s wrong.\u201d She glanced at Aggie and Greg, who were whispering. \u201cThose two chummy? I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggie\u2019s a big girl, and she can be mean as a snake. Remember? She can handle Greg.\u201d I had my own worries. Aggie wasn\u2019t even in the top ten. Flo was right. Jerry had glanced up and nodded. Message received. Now he was talking to a policeman and giving the silent prisoners who\u2019d asked for a lawyer a narrow-eyed look. Reading minds.</p><p>The men still weren\u2019t wearing the vamp-detecting glasses. Why not? Had Brent kept those a secret? All his guards had worn them. If the innovation had died with Brent, it was an unexpected advantage to us. If these guys had worn the glasses and noticed Jerry was a vampire . . . Well, what would they have done? Yelled \u201cFangs!\u201d? In front of the police, who were already interested in why they were hanging out in the alley with my picture and weapons?</p><p>Oops. My picture. I bet the cops would come calling to ask me about that. I\u2019d have to make up a story. And what would David\u2019s story be? Spurned lover? That would make him a stalker. Of course he could afford the sharpest lawyers and would probably get off with a plea bargain and community service. His best bet would be temporary insanity. He could point to his daddy\u2019s vampire-hunting Web site. Claim the crazy ran in the family. I heard the door to the roof open. Jerry was here.</p><p>Greg\u2019s body language changed from seducer to warrior in an instant. Obviously he remembered that Blade wasn\u2019t a fan of the EVs or their representatives.</p><p>\u201cAggie and I are going down to my car to try some samples. What she doesn\u2019t want for her shower, she\u2019ll leave for you at the shop.\u201d Greg finally acknowledged Flo with a tight smile. \u201cFlorence, guess you should come with us. These are for your parties after all.\u201d</p><p>Flo glanced from me to Jerry\u2019s grim face. \u201cGlory, that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Make a list of what you like.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cJerry and I need to talk. I\u2019ll be fine, right, Jer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jerry nodded. \u201cFlorence, Aggie.\u201d He didn\u2019t acknowledge Greg. \u201cBe careful, ladies. If you need me, give me a mental shout. I\u2019d be more than happy to eliminate any problems.\u201d He gave Greg a warning stare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelax, Blade. I come in peace. Simon sends his regards. No hard feelings on our side.\u201d Greg pulled a packet out of his pocket and tossed it at Jerry. It fell at his feet. \u201cFree Vamp Viagra. Don\u2019t be such a hard-ass. Glory will thank you for trying it.\u201d He yelped when Blade suddenly had him up by his shirt front and dangling over the edge of the roof.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I drop you into the alley? The ladies will meet you downstairs.\u201d Blade shook Greg, who\u2019d grabbed his wrists.</p><p>\u201cEase up. Can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d Greg cut his eyes toward me. \u201cGlory? The cops are still down there. We don\u2019t need this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJerry, he\u2019s right. He wouldn\u2019t even get a broken bone, and we\u2019d get unwanted attention.\u201d I put my arms around his waist and pulled him back. Not that he\u2019d have moved if he hadn\u2019t realized what I said was true. \u201cAnd the Vamp Viagra might be fun. Why not take a free ride?\u201d I stood on my toes and ran my fangs along his neck. \u201cI\u2019m having a stressful night. Might help me relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d Greg landed on the roof and smoothed out his shirt. \u201cLadies, shall we take off? Seems Glory\u2019s got an agenda, and we\u2019re in the way.\u201d He steered Aggie and Flo toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I only go if you say it\u2019s okay. Jeremiah is not in such a good mood.\u201d Flo moved away from Greg. \u201cJeremiah, be kind to her. Glory handled this very well. But she is shook up. S\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Look at all those weapons.\u201d I clung to Jerry. Why was he so angry? Not at me, of course. I threw up a block. As long as no one told him I\u2019d gone crawling into Viv\u2019s jeans, I should be golden. Totally the victim.</p><p>\u201cGloriana knows I\u2019m just worried about her. It\u2019s those bastards downstairs I\u2019d like to rip apart. You can leave us, Florence.\u201d Jerry said this quietly. \u201cI\u2019d never hurt Gloriana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Go, Flo. We\u2019re fine.\u201d I finally let go of him. \u201cSee you tomorrow night. Oh, and I forgot to tell you. Nadia Komisky is Rafe\u2019s partner. She says she knows you and that we can have the bachelorette party at their new nightclub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNadia! Yes. She gave Damian a run for his life. Hah!\u201d Flo was now all smiles. \u201cAnd this bachelorette party will be some fun. I\u2019ll invite her. You and I will talk tomorrow.\u201d She turned on her heel and shoved Aggie and Greg out ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cAnother Westwood attack.\u201d Jerry looked over the wall as the police cars finally left the alley and all was quiet again.</p><p>\u201cYes. But Greg saw them, and I called nine-one-one. The police handled it. I was never in danger at all.\u201d I tried to relax.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you can explain why you smell like a cheap pancake house.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t look at me. Just kept staring down at the dark alley.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about places like that?\u201d I moved closer.</p> <p>\u201cI know a lot of things that seem trivial at the moment. And don\u2019t know what I need to.\u201d He finally looked at me. \u201cWhen I heard there were men in the alley with crossbows and your picture ...\u201d He slapped the wall, and a piece of concrete crumbled. \u201cDamn it, Gloriana, what the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that arrow attack was more than the revenge thing I took it for. Brent Westwood left a will. He\u2019s got two kids. The first one to pop his killer inherits his estate, the whole enchilada. It\u2019s over a billion dollars, and that\u2019s a powerful motivator.\u201d I picked up the baggie of Vampire Viagra. If I could persuade Jerry to use this, I could definitely get his mind off life or death. Does that make me a live-for-the-moment kind of woman? Well, might as well. When you\u2019re being stalked . . .</p><p>Suddenly I was grabbed by both arms and shaken until my hair flew around my head like I\u2019d been struck by lightning again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you? You could have been killed tonight. Did you see the weapons that mob carried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I miss them?\u201d I jerked out of his grasp, the rooftop spinning. \u201cWas that necessary? I think you bruised my arms. And after you told Flo you\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d And what was with my men tonight? Seems I\u2019d pushed Jerry and Rafe too far for once. And how rude of Jerry to poke into my mind without an invitation. It was something we simply didn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll heal. It\u2019s a miracle I haven\u2019t knocked you on your arse before now. I swear you are the most damnably provoking woman I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d Jerry ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot. And, trust me, my arse has suffered enough abuse tonight.\u201d I brushed my hair out of my eyes, then pulled up my sleeves as if to check for those bruises. Laying on some guilt. In case Jerry decided I still had a knock on my arse coming. He was seriously steamed. And I understood. If he\u2019d been in this kind of danger and kept it from me . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask what the hell that means. God, Gloriana, you could have stepped out of your back door and been shot through the heart.\u201d He reached for me again, gently this time, and pulled me to his chest. \u201cI remember what those crossbows can do. Saw my best friend taken down with one right in front of me. Remember?\u201d He said this with his face in my hair, arms wrapping me tight as if he could keep me safe single-handedly.</p> <p>I swallowed. He was right. Of course this had brought back horrific memories for him. But I wasn\u2019t a complete idiot. Hadn\u2019t planned to unwittingly step out there without someone checking the alley first. Though if the men had been wearing vamp-detection glasses . . .</p><p>I cleared my throat and looked up. \u201cThey hauled David off to jail. I\u2019m safe for tonight anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jerry released me and stepped back, under control again. \u201cYou said there were two Westwood brats. Where\u2019s the other one now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran her off earlier tonight. Stepped in maple syrup doing it. That\u2019s where the pancake smell is coming from.\u201d I glanced down at my shoes. \u201cAnyway, Rafe saw me do it.\u201d Oops. Jerry looked like a thundercloud.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Valdez knows about this, but he didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your employee anymore. He doesn\u2019t owe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him out of his contract, but he does still owe me.\u201d Jerry pulled the Vampire Viagra from my hand. \u201cYou want to play? Forget the future and live for the night? Why not? Come home with me. I don\u2019t have roommates to hear you scream with pleasure. If your life is going to be cut short, I guess we should make the most of the time we have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, I\u2014\u201d Tears clogged my throat, and I followed him dumbly to the door. Did I want to make love with him? Of course I did. Maybe I didn\u2019t like what he said, but he was way better at facing reality than I was. A warrior. And I had a history of running away when things got hot instead of standing and fighting. I hated to do it, but maybe leaving was still my best move. So a night of his lovemaking? Bring it on.</p><p>He silently held the door open, and I walked ahead of him down the stairs. My damned sticky boots squeaked with every step. I\u2019d worn tight jeans and a red sweater. I wished I could stop in my apartment to at least change shoes. Or it might help my cause to switch out my bra. What I had on could have carried rocks for David to use against Goliath. The image made my mouth quirk in a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d He slipped his arm around me at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMe, us. Always ending up in bed together. It beats talking when we\u2019ll only fight anyway.\u201d I reached up and brought his head down to kiss his lips. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about me. I love you for it. Be patient. Give me a night to remember. Tomorrow night, I promise we can take this threat seriously.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me tight against him and kissed me deeply until I felt that centuries-old connection I needed so badly. \u201cI love you, Gloriana. I don\u2019t want to live forever if it\u2019s in a world without you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled my eyes. \u201cJerry. That\u2019s the most romantic thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the God\u2019s truth, but if you tell Valdez I spouted such drivel, I\u2019ll call you a liar.\u201d He kissed my nose, then hit the code to open the security door. \u201cStay here and let me check to make sure the coast is clear. Just because you ran a Westwood off once doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stayed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled, totally pleased with him, while I waited for him to come back for me. For once I\u2019d relax and let him take charge without a lot of objections. Vampire Viagra. I\u2019d taken it accidentally once with the wrong man. It had made me wild, but I\u2019d been left unsatisfied. It enhanced a vampire\u2019s sexual pleasure and prolonged it. Since we already have amazing libidos and the males can last pretty much all night long, this was going to be quite a night. I remembered that it took a few minutes to get going so we\u2019d swallow our pills in the car on the way to Jerry\u2019s house. Then once in his bedroom . . .</p><p>We never made it to the bedroom. Jerry opened the back door and dragged me into the kitchen. The granite counter-top was cold but solid, and I landed on my back, ready to take him on top of me. Thank God, my bum seemed to have healed and it didn\u2019t hurt, or at least not enough to slow me down.</p><p>My skin was tingling, on fire. I couldn\u2019t bear the touch of even a stitch of clothing on my body. Jerry had ripped off my sweater in the car. I\u2019d shucked off my boots there too. My jeans and thong were near the door. Jerry ripped my unsexy bra apart down the front, and it was destined for the garbage. Jerry\u2019s shirt hung from the doorknob, and his shoes and pants lay tangled in a heap near the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I tried to drag him down on top of me.</p><p>\u201cGloriana!\u201d He slapped my hands away, then grinned and leaped on top of the counter to stand behind me. He was being playful. I loved it. He lifted me until I faced him. Good thing he had twelve-foot ceilings in this house.</p><p>\u201cYou realize mortals would think it\u2019s nasty to make love on kitchen countertops.\u201d I pressed myself against him, rubbing my breasts against his chest and lower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never cooked anything here. If Damian ends up selling to mortals, he\u2019ll have it cleaned.\u201d He teased my nipples, then gently gathered me in his arms and lowered me to the cold granite again. \u201cThis is a proper use for a kitchen. Perhaps I can have a meal while I\u2019m here.\u201d His grin was full of fang.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But seems like you want more than a drink from me.\u201d I reached between us to grasp him. \u201cYou\u2019re as hard as this stone beneath my bum. Are you feeling as wild as I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if I don\u2019t have you in the next moment, I\u2019ll disgrace myself?\u201d He leaned down to take my nipple into his mouth, suddenly rough and hungry. When he raked his fangs across it, he drew blood and I moaned.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d I guided him into me and lifted my hips. At the same time I arched my back and dragged my own fangs along his shoulder. We were bleeding and moving and grinding into each other, as we became more frantic. We\u2019d never abused each other, and yet this was more thrilling than I could remember. Jerry savaged my other nipple, and I gouged his biceps with my fingernails before I sank my fangs into his jugular.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes!\u201d He cried as he plunged into me again and again. He grabbed my legs and flipped us over until I was on top, still connected to him. I rode him hard, releasing his neck so I could sit up and take him deeper inside me. He\u2019d licked the wounds on my breasts clean, and I felt them healing already.</p><p>I looked down and saw his eyes closed as he strained to give me all of him. He pulsed inside me, and I reached down to squeeze his sacs, then raked them with my nails.</p><p>\u201cGloriana. Love!\u201d He came with a warmth deep inside me. Answering spasms shook me from my toes to my heart. I collapsed on top of him and lay there, listening to his answering beat. Faster than usual. The Viagra, or what we\u2019d just done?</p><p>Usually we\u2019d lie together and bask in the afterglow for a few minutes. But not this night. The VV made Jerry pull me up the stairs at a dead run. His bed was a king with a comforter that he tossed aside before he flung me down.</p> <p>\u201cMadness, but I\u2019ve got to have you again. Right. Now.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him. Oh, yes, he was good to go again, and so was I. I held out my arms, and with a Scottish battle cry that made me laugh, he fell on top of me. He sheathed his sword inside me and grinned.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been this randy since I was a lad chasing milk-maids into Da\u2019s barn.\u201d He stroked me, making me gasp at the pressure and the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cCatch many?\u201d I shoved him until we sat facing each other.</p><p>\u201cA few. God, Gloriana, tell me if I hurt you.\u201d He held my hips as he pumped into me.</p><p>\u201cTell me if I hurt you.\u201d I growled and bit his ear, then licked it clean, savoring the salty sweetness of his blood as release shuddered through me again. I tightened my legs around him and held his shoulders as I screamed and fell back on the bed. He came with me, still moving, still hard inside me while I saw stars and moons and a crazy Scot looming over me as intent as if he were drilling a well.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t stop.\u201d Not my normal in-control Jerry, he was panting and flushed.</p><p>I pulled his face down to mine, mouth to mouth, tongue to tongue. I let him know I could go as long as he could, longer. I grabbed his ass, pressing him deeper, and held on until he finally, finally surged one last time. He collapsed next to me, his body slick with sweat and streaks of blood where I\u2019d scored him with my nails when I\u2019d come yet again.</p><p>\u201cDear God in Heaven. That drug.\u201d He turned his head to stare at me, then touched my nipple with his fingertip. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding again. Sorry. I don\u2019t remember doing that.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over to lick away the blood smeared along his hip. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you doing it. I was too crazed.\u201d I sighed and laid my head on his chest. \u201cStill feel, I don\u2019t know, like I\u2019ve got an itch inside me that can\u2019t be soothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I like this Vampire Viagra.\u201d Jerry ran his hand down my bare back. \u201cWhere\u2019s the finesse, the foreplay?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cYou been reading sex manuals, Jer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive over, Gloriana. I watch cable. I try to do what pleases a woman. Even a milkmaid liked a bit of sport before she\u2019d lift her skirts in the hayloft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting jealous.\u201d I eased my knee over his rising erection. Again. So soon. And I felt that rising urge myself. Crazy. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known how to please me.\u201d I nudged him with my knee. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s time, your foreplay is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I squealed when he abruptly rolled me off of him, then grabbed me and carried me toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re to have another go, then we\u2019ll shower first.\u201d He kicked open the bathroom door. \u201cGod help me, if the drug allows it, I\u2019ll show you finesse that\u2019ll have you screaming my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d I landed on my feet and pulled him into the huge double shower. We discovered that the VV still rode us hard. Jerry took me standing against the tile wall, the soap giving us something new to play with and Jerry a chance to show that finesse he was so proud of. Scream his name? Oh, yeah.</p><p>I took him on the bench seat with the warm water pounding against the middle of my back. This time he shouted my name and almost knocked a hole in the tile wall when I used some of my own finesse. By the time we\u2019d towel dried and collapsed back on the bed, dawn was near and we could hardly move.</p><p>\u201cGuess that stuff\u2019s not too bad as long as you don\u2019t care about the niceties,\u201d I said as Jerry gathered me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cNiceties? You mean like making love instead of sex? Guess it would be okay for an occasional hookup.\u201d Jerry yawned and watched for my reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d I laughed at his expression. \u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019d tear out the throat of any bimbo you hooked up with, so don\u2019t go there.\u201d I snuggled against his hard body, then trailed a fingertip down his stomach. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on what I\u2019d do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand warned.\u201d Jerry kissed the top of my hair, which I\u2019d blown dry in his bathroom while he\u2019d played with my breasts and kissed erotic paths all over my body, front to back, exclaiming over my various healing bruises and bites. I\u2019d put off explanations of those he knew he hadn\u2019t given me, and he\u2019d let me.</p><p>\u201cThis VV is dangerous. Do it too often, and you\u2019d never get any work done. I\u2019ve been neglecting my business lately, and that\u2019s got to stop.\u201d I had trouble getting too worked up over it though. Eight orgasms\u2014or was it ten?\u2014will do that to you.</p><p>\u201cYour business won\u2019t matter if the Westwoods get their way. We need to talk about that, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry propped himself on one elbow and stared down at me.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m taking this very seriously, Jerry. I am. But can we put this discussion off until we wake up in the evening? Right now I\u2019m limp from being well served, and I don\u2019t have it in me to get into this life-or-death stuff.\u201d I smiled up at him and put my hand on his jaw, rough with the start of his daily beard.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue with you. But heed me, my girl. You\u2019ll not keep things like this from me again. I am going to keep you safe. Sappy sentiment or not, I love you. I will kill the man or woman who hurts you. But I\u2019d rather keep them from trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve always known it. I love you for it. Thank you, Jeremiah. Now lie back. The sun\u2019s coming up, and I\u2019m out.\u201d I fell back, the darkness claiming me. I prayed Jerry didn\u2019t live to regret his vows. I sank with a shiver of foreboding.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Jerry\u2019s housekeeper, a shifter who worked during the day, had left my clothes, cleaned and folded, just outside the bedroom door. My cell phone, keys and credit card were piled on top. My boots, no longer sticky, sat neatly next to them. I guess she\u2019d gone out to the garage and found them and my sweater in Jerry\u2019s car. Jerry obviously paid her really well. I checked my phone. Six missed calls and three messages. One from the shop, the rest from the Austin police department. Gulp.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to listen, just called the shop.</p><p>\u201cVintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium, Lacy speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Glory. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t up, you mean. The police have been here. Seems they arrested a gang of guys behind the shop last night who were holding your picture and carrying enough weapons to start a revolution. They have questions.\u201d Lacy sighed. \u201cAll those cops in here haven\u2019t helped business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. I have a bunch of messages I want to ignore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say?\u201d Lacy spoke to someone next to her. \u201cI\u2019m taking this to the back room. Erin\u2019s handling the front.\u201d I heard a thud. \u201cDoor\u2019s closed. Rafe came down and gave me the four-one-one. Westwood. He\u2019s haunting you from the grave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the pits.\u201d I sat on Jerry\u2019s bed. He was downstairs, returning some business calls in his home office. We hadn\u2019t had our confrontation yet. Lucky for me, unlucky for Jerry, there was some kind of crisis in a company he owned in Florida. I wished I could sneak out of here before he could grill me. I hated to ruin the afterglow of a hot night.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say if the police come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m coming in.\u201d I glanced at my watch. I needed to go home and change. Clean or not, I wanted clothes that hadn\u2019t touched Vivien Westwood\u2019s thigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in an hour. I\u2019ll make up a story that should satisfy them. For now, we don\u2019t know who David Westwood is or why he\u2019s carrying around my picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said. That the guy must be psycho. Running around with a crossbow. I mean, how weird is that?\u201d Lacy paused. \u201cGlory, this is serious. You want me to get my family on it? We can handle a mortal, no problem.\u201d</p><p>Lacy\u2019s a were-cat from a large and powerful family. \u201cThanks, Lacy, but I don\u2019t want to answer to your mom if anything should happen to you or one of her other kittens.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been good to me, Glory.

Blade and I are on it. Let me see what we can figure out.\u201d I heard the bedroom door open. \u201cGot to go. Thanks for handling things.\u201d I ended the call, then met Jerry\u2019s gaze. Time to face the music. I just hoped it wasn\u2019t a funeral dirge.</p><p>I laid it all out for him, all the little details I\u2019d left out before. Richard\u2019s help to get David out of my shop and how I\u2019d gotten the police involved on his second try. Then my little adventure with Viv as a cockroach.</p> <p>\u201cYou make this sound like a game.\u201d Jerry had practically walked a trench into the hardwood floor, and he looked like he wanted to shake me again.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not. The stakes are too high. A billion has more zeros than I can wrap my brain around.\u201d No kidding. I celebrated when my bank balance hit three digits after all my bills were paid.</p><p>\u201cEverything you\u2019ve done so far has just postponed the inevitable. Convince the Westwoods to give up this hunt, or kill them both.\u201d Jerry sat on the bed beside me. \u201cI think you know the only viable option.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I forgot just how ruthless Jerry the warrior had been back in the day. I guess he saw my lack of self-preservation at all costs as a character flaw.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jer, but I just can\u2019t kill two mortals. Besides, where would their bodyguards be while we\u2019re ripping out Westwood throats? Twiddling their thumbs?\u201d I grabbed his hands. \u201cYou see how this could turn into a nightmare?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt already has, Gloriana. Wake up and deal with it.\u201d Jerry was itching to do just that. The old-fashioned way. And vampires didn\u2019t take prisoners. The bodyguards would be collateral damage.</p><p>\u201cQuit looking like you want to rip out someone\u2019s throat, damn it.\u201d I started my own stomping circuit of the room. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way. But reasoning with them won\u2019t work. They both want the money and surely deserve to inherit their father\u2019s estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. We have no idea what their relationship with their father was like.\u201d Jerry stopped me in my tracks. \u201cLet\u2019s go. You have to talk to the police. Look how these people have already complicated your life. Now you\u2019re involved in an investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I hate it. I remember when the media thought Vintage Vamp\u2019s stood for vampires. It got worse when Flo painted that mural on the shop wall that looked like a vampire biting a woman\u2019s neck. I had a heck of a time convincing the public that a vamp was nothing but a roaring-twenties hottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Goth customers are still hoping for a fang sighting.\u201d Jerry pulled me down the stairs. \u201cForget all that. Tell the police that Westwood\u2019s crazy and you\u2019re an innocent victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true! This vamp hunt is totally unfair. The police should be on my side. I pay taxes. Though pitifully little compared to a billionaire. Damn, Jerry. If it comes to a power play, I\u2019m shit out of luck.\u201d</p> <p>Jerry frowned and jerked open the kitchen door. \u201cWait and see what the Westwood boy told them to explain his presence in the alley with an army at his back. That\u2019ll help us.\u201d</p><p>The detective who interviewed me was happy to share David Westwood\u2019s story. Seems David had my name as a person of interest, someone who\u2019d been around when his father had disappeared. He\u2019d been watching my shop trying to find his missing dad. Cue the violins. Witnesses claimed Daddy had died in the woods near Lake Travis and I\u2019d been seen there that night. Blood had been found in a clearing that private DNA tests had confirmed belonged to Brent Westwood. No one had reported it to the police because his body hadn\u2019t been found. No body, no proof of a crime.</p><p>The detective shook his head. \u201cBeats me why they didn\u2019t even file a missing person\u2019s report. If I disappeared like that, my kids would be all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is strange. Not sure I\u2019d believe a word this guy has to say.\u201d I wondered why David hadn\u2019t mentioned that video I\u2019d heard about, but I sure didn\u2019t bring it up.</p><p>Anyway, according to the detective, David had admitted that his father had been hung up on vampires. The whole scenario had freaked out his kids, and maybe David had overreacted to Dad\u2019s notes that claimed I was one of them. So he\u2019d come to my alley fully armed to try to talk to me. The one time he\u2019d come to my shop, I\u2019d refused to meet with him. And my friends had been big dudes who seemed to run with a rough crowd. So Dave had brought his own reinforcements.</p><p>\u201cWhat a fairy tale. First, this guy showed up in my shop with bodyguards built like fire plugs and the IQs to match and asked my clerk some questions about me, made my customers uncomfortable. My friend who asked him to leave was an ex-priest. Sound like a rough type to you?\u201d I waited until the detective wrote that down.</p><p>\u201cSecond, yes, I met his father once. He was creepy, talking about vampires. Who believes in that stuff? I threw him out of my shop. I mean, do I look like a vampire to you?\u201d I tossed my hair, batted my eyelashes and gave the detective my \u201cGlory is an innocent victim\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cNutcase, pure and simple. The whole family obviously has a screw loose. Had him pegged as soon as I saw that crossbow. Sorry to bother you, Ms. St. Clair, just had to follow up.\u201d The detective shut his notebook and stuck it in his pocket. \u201cThe firepower those guys were carrying was way out of line, permits or not. Looked like an ambush, not a guy wanting to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly! You see why I\u2019m so freaked out? One of my employees had a car parked back there and saw the whole thing. She said they had my picture, like I was a target or something.\u201d Jerry, who\u2019d stayed silent and watchful, was right beside me. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to go out my own back door now. Surely Westwood will face some kind of charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to the DA. I\u2019ll turn over my notes, suggest they step up patrols in this area.\u201d The detective laid a business card on the counter. \u201cCall me if Westwood bothers you again. Ask for Danny Oleto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Detective. I feel safer already.\u201d I walked him toward the door. \u201cIf Westwood gets released, will you let me know? I want to be aware . . .\u201d I pulled a face. \u201cIn case he\u2019s stupid enough to come around again. And he\u2019s got a sister. Do you think she might bother me too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Warn her off. But it was obvious to me that Westwood realized he\u2019d made a mistake when he got to the station. His lawyer sure reamed him out.\u201d Danny smiled. \u201cI think you\u2019re okay for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d I smiled and held out my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll stay in touch.\u201d Danny shook my hand, then headed out. Once outside, he walked over to a patrol car parked at the curb. He leaned in and spoke to the officer inside as I shut the shop door.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Jerry spoke from behind me.</p><p>I looked around and saw that we had no customers. The patrol car pulled away, and the detective got into an unmarked car. That should help.</p><p>A lot of my regular customers were leery of law enforcement. Paranormals enjoyed my shop because they liked helping out a fellow freak. Other customers sometimes had an illegal substance stashed in their pockets while they enjoyed my reasonable prices on vintage clothes. Then there were some who avoided establishment types on general principle. Sure enough, the door jangled as a couple dressed in black with multiple piercings came in from the coffee shop next door.</p><p>Erin waved me off and went to help them, steering them to the cape section. Lacy\u2019s shift had ended, and she\u2019d taken off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the back room.\u201d I led the way, Jerry silent behind me.</p><p>I turned to Jerry once the door was closed. \u201cIf the Westwoods aren\u2019t believing in vampires now, I wonder what they think happened to their dad? That video, and the two bodyguards, made it look like I killed him. Which I did, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll certainly never admit to that. Unless you can convince them that it was self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was! The video is bound to prove that. And everyone knows he was treating me like an animal, hunting me down.\u201d I paced the small room. \u201cI bet that estate can\u2019t be settled until they declare Westwood legally dead. Both kids are dependent on old Brent\u2019s money. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d do anything to get it settled quickly.\u201d</p><p>Jerry watched me pace. \u201cSo what do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find Westwood\u2019s body for them. They\u2019ll be so grateful, they\u2019ll be more than willing to forget I ever existed. Even better, they might even spring for a reward.\u201d I stopped in front of him. \u201cOf course I know exactly where he died. Then you asked your daughter and her friends to clean up the site. Drac should know where they dumped the body.\u201d Lily\u2019s boyfriend had renamed himself Dracula this century.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s see what they know.\u201d Jerry pulled out his phone and hit speed dial. \u201cLily, where are you? Is Dracula with you?\u201d</p><p>I could see Jerry getting frustrated but didn\u2019t use my vamp hearing to eavesdrop. I knew he\u2019d give me the highlights.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you there in ten minutes. Don\u2019t move.\u201d Jerry ended the call. \u201cThose half-wits are at Damian\u2019s trying out a new synthetic blood that\u2019s supposed to give you a buzz. We\u2019ll be lucky if they\u2019re coherent by the time we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go now, then.\u201d I stuck my head out to tell Erin we were leaving and came face-to-face with Vivien Westwood and her bodyguard. She gasped and grabbed Sean\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cMs. St. Clair? C-can we talk?\u201d Viv didn\u2019t look as confident as usual. Maybe because Jerry was glaring at her like he was about to rip out her throat. Oh, yeah.</p><p>\u201cLove to. Come into my back room.\u201d I threw open the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean balked. \u201cOut here. Witnesses.\u201d He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Jerry. I figured he was getting all kinds of mental messages because sweat was popping out on his broad forehead. I had a few for him too. This was the guy who\u2019d booted my backside.</p><p>Jerry was suddenly right in front of Viv. \u201cSay what you\u2019ve got to say and get out of here. But know this. You ever attack Ms. St. Clair again and\u2014\u201d Jerry leaned forward and whispered in her ear. Vivien paled. He stopped Sean with a hand on his chest, and the big guy froze before he could pull the gun he obviously carried in the shoulder holster under his jacket.</p><p>\u201cListen, Ms. Westwood. I know you\u2019ve seen some kind of video that involved your father and a crossbow.\u201d I waited until she nodded, her eyes wide.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople talk. Which you\u2019d do well to remember. Forget this vampire stuff. Totally bogus. Your father obviously had a screw loose. I think he may have had an accident in the woods near one of the lakes around here. He was out there vampire hunting and ran into some totally innocent people camping and partying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Viv gripped Sean\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You can imagine what might have gone down if someone came at you with a crossbow in the middle of the night and you\u2019d been enjoying a substance or two. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Viv nodded vigorously this time.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s possible your dad had an accident. I\u2019m going to ask around. See what I can find out. Would you like me to do that?\u201d</p><p>Viv was speechless and just nodded her head again.</p><p>\u201cFine. Your brother spent the night in jail. I\u2019d suggest you both lay off the harassment before you end up serving time for stalking. I will press charges.\u201d I glanced at Jerry. \u201cOr, even worse, let my boyfriend here do what he wants to with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Viv looked like she was going to fall to the floor, but Sean held her up. She took a breath and rallied. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary. We\u2019re going to have this will my dad wrote about vampires thrown out. It was obviously nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut that means until we find Dad\u2019s, uh, remains we can\u2019t settle the estate. So while you\u2019re, uh, asking around?\u201d Viv wobbled on her high-heeled boots. \u201cWould you see if you can find his, um, body?\u201d Her eyes actually filled with tears.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d I realized that sounded a little strange, but I certainly meant it. I\u2019d hated Westwood with a passion usually reserved for the Devil incarnate.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve settled that. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t find it necessary to come into this shop again without an invitation.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice was quiet. I shivered and knew he was on my side. \u201cYou want me to spell out what will happen if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d Vivien was shaking now and leaning on Sean, who looked none too steady himself.</p><p>\u201cMs. St. Clair is under my protection. There will be no more attempts on her life in the alley or anywhere by you or one of your hired guns. Is that clear?\u201d Jerry met her gaze, then Sean\u2019s. Both of them nodded and backed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cVivien, you and your brother will forget this vampire stuff. No such thing. The invention of a sick mind. Got it?\u201d I moved in on her.</p><p>\u201cSick mind. Daddy was sick.\u201d Viv hit the door.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Jerry threw it open. Viv and Sean scurried out.</p><p>\u201cWhew. Guess it\u2019s safe to head out now.\u201d I grinned at Erin. \u201cI swear Jerry had me shaking in my boots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou both were awesome, Glory. Don\u2019t want you mad at me, Mr. Blade.\u201d Erin didn\u2019t look scared, she looked more than a little excited. Werewolf. And not long till the full moon. I\u2019d have to be sure her shift was covered then.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of here.\u201d I grabbed Jerry\u2019s arm. \u201cCall if you need me, Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. And we\u2019ve got your number here too, Mr. Blade. For emergencies.\u201d Erin looked like she really wanted to use it.</p><p>Obviously pumped after the confrontation, Jerry hustled me out to his car and drove at top speed to Damian\u2019s castle on top of the hill near Sixth Street. When we got close, we could hear laughter and shouts of partying. Obviously the new synthetic had created more than just a little buzz. The vamps who\u2019d tried it sounded like they were flying high and not as birds or bats.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably a waste of time, but let\u2019s see if they can show us where they dumped Westwood\u2019s body,\u201d Jerry grumbled as we climbed out of his Mercedes.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks for what you did back there. Warning off Vivien.\u201d I kissed him as he helped me out of the car. \u201cTotally hot too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me to protect you.\u201d He pulled me close, his hand sliding down to hold me against him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like to see your warrior side occasionally.\u201d I grinned when I heard him grumble about never understanding women as we walked up to Damian\u2019s front door. It opened before we could ring the bell.</p><p>Damian was flushed and had obviously been celebrating along with his company. \u201cCome in, friends. We\u2019re just getting to the best part of the evening. Glory, it\u2019s strip poker. As I remember, you\u2019re a lousy gambler, so I\u2019d love to have you join the game.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cLousy and reformed. I don\u2019t play at all anymore.\u201d Long story. I\u2019m so bad I had to join Gamblers Anonymous and pay on credit cards for years as part of my recovery. I still can\u2019t be around a game without feeling dangerous urges.</p><p>We walked into Damian\u2019s spacious living room with its breathtaking view of the Austin skyline. But it wasn\u2019t the city that made me gasp, it was the sight of Jerry\u2019s daughter, her boyfriend Dracula and his two best buddies, Benjamin and Luke, all in various stages of undress. They were surrounded by empty bottles and crystal goblets. Their cheeks were flushed too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look, Dad. I\u2019m not very decent.\u201d Lily giggled and covered her bare breasts with a throw pillow. She\u2019d obviously been losing because she was down to a thong and two high heels. Leave it to Lily to keep on her shoes while discarding her top.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than decent, my love.\u201d Drac made a grab for the pillow but toppled over. He wore stretchy black briefs that left nothing to the imagination and a knit cap. Benny and Luke had fared better, both of them still in pants and socks, but shirtless. Somehow Damian was the only one fully clothed, unless you counted a missing belt. Cards were scattered across the glass tabletop.</p><p>\u201cAnte up, you two. One article of clothing to start.\u201d Luke gave me a wicked smile. \u201cDo us all a favor, Glory. Take off that sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, sweetheart.\u201d I grinned back, not above noticing that all three male vampires were beautiful men. \u201cAre you sober enough to remember the night I killed Brent Westwood? The night Israel Caine\u2019s house burned down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could we forget?\u201d Benny jumped up, swaying before striding over to sling his arm around my shoulders. \u201cYou took down the baddest man in the whole damn town.\u201d He grinned at his mates. \u201cHey, that\u2019s a song lyric. \u2018Leroy Brown,\u2019 eh?\u201d He started to sing, Drac and Luke joining him for the chorus. Their group had been a singing sensation in the seventies. I waited until they\u2019d run out of words, stopping Jerry with a look when it was obvious he wanted to shout at them to shut the hell up or knock their heads together. The guys were that good.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant. Now we need to know where you stashed Westwood\u2019s body.\u201d I turned to Lily, who\u2019d put her head on Drac\u2019s shoulder, her pillow slipping to show most of her left breast. \u201cLily, cover up, girl. You were in charge of getting these guys to clean up the mess when I took out Westwood. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Damian came in with a tray of full bottles. I read the labels. B-sotted. Blott-O. Oh, and my favorite, Undead Drunk.</p><p>\u201cHere we go. Refills. Glory, Blade, try one. You look like you need a pick-me-up.\u201d Our perfect host picked up one for himself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d I had to admit I was tempted. After the night with the Vamp Viagra, I wouldn\u2019t mind a little experimentation. But business first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give them any more until we get some answers.\u201d Jerry put his hand on Damian\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWait a damned minute. Who put you in charge?\u201d Benny turned to face Jerry. Or tried to. He lost his balance and landed in the middle of the card table. Glass broke, cards went everywhere, and everyone except Jerry and me thought this was hilarious. When Benny got a cut on his foot trying to pull himself up, a growl went around the room that made Jerry try to put me behind him.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Calm down and answer me.\u201d I pushed Jerry out of the way, grabbed another throw pillow and jammed it against the cut on Benny\u2019s foot. My own fangs were down, but I ignored them. He did have a delicious blood type. I grabbed one of Damian\u2019s bottles and took a swig. Self-preservation. It wouldn\u2019t have been cool to lick Benny\u2019s big toe.</p><p>\u201cGee, Glory. Watch how you chug that. It\u2019s got a powerful kick.\u201d Lily grinned at me. \u201cDad, you may want to take her home after this. It also makes you, um, horny as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Now answer Gloriana. Where did you dump Westwood\u2019s body that night?\u201d Jerry picked up a bottle and took a sip. Clearly I wasn\u2019t the only one thirsty.</p><p>\u201cNowhere. The guys were messing around. Wanting to cut off his head, take a trophy, which I knew you wouldn\u2019t like, Dad. See how loyal I am?\u201d Lily rubbed Drac\u2019s knee, and I looked away from his obvious response.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you take the body, Lily? And don\u2019t say nowhere.\u201d I wanted to slap some sense into her. Especially when she let Drac grope her in front of all of us.</p><p>She at least had the good sense to shove him away and stand. \u201cI\u2019m telling you. I don\u2019t know where in the hell the body ended up. Another vamp came along. He offered me big bucks if we\u2019d let him have Westwood. Said he\u2019d do the cleanup.\u201d Lily shrugged and took a bottle Drac snagged for her. \u201cHey, I could use the money. The guys here are loaded, but I\u2019m not. It was expensive moving here from Transylvania.\u201d She wrapped a rich black velvet throw around her, toga-style, and dropped her pillow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, Dad. Since I got here, you\u2019ve been nice, but even though I\u2019m your one and only child, you haven\u2019t offered me an allowance or a place of my own. I had to look out for myself. So I decided we should take the cash and split. What did we care what happened to that body anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember now.\u201d Drac took a long draw from his bottle of B-sotted. \u201cMan, that\u2019s fine. Oooh, baby.\u201d He grabbed Lily\u2019s hands and pulled her close. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to find Damian\u2019s love shack soon. I\u2019m hard and hurtin\u2019.\u201d He laid a kiss on her that was triple X-rated, his hand moving up her thigh.</p><p>Damian rolled his eyes at me. \u201cYoung vampires. No manners. Blade, your daughter is lovely, but the company she keeps ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d Jerry took another hit from his bottle and put his hand on my hip as if to show he wasn\u2019t just Lily\u2019s old man, but in need of a love shack too. \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you couldn\u2019t handle this one simple task, Lily. Why the hell did you palm it off on a stranger? You had to know this was important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me too.\u201d I swatted Jerry\u2019s hand away. \u201cWho was this man? You don\u2019t know where he took Westwood\u2019s body? Of all the irresponsible, stupid . . .\u201d My great plan was slipping away just like Lily and Drac were toward the French doors that led outside. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d My voice was nearing screech level.</p><p>\u201cLet them go, sweet thing. They are lucky enough to have each other. We didn\u2019t know the guy or care. Like Lily said, the girl needed cash. The price was right. You took off in a tearing hurry, now didn\u2019t you? If it was so important, why didn\u2019t you stay around and see to it yourself? Eh?\u201d Luke looked me over.</p><p>\u201cI should have. Valdez and Ray made me leave, and I was shook up. In shock, really. I don\u2019t go around plugging men with crossbows every day.\u201d I took another gulp of the synthetic and appreciated the heat of it going down. \u201cWe should have stayed and handled it ourselves. Jerry, you weren\u2019t even there. You met us at the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave you either. That\u2019s why I delegated. Obviously to the wrong people.\u201d He glared at his daughter and Drac, making out by the glass doors.</p> <p>Luke smiled at me. \u201cThat\u2019s old news. Glory, don\u2019t suppose I could interest you in a little two on one with Benny and me.\u201d</p><p>Blade had Luke up and off the couch in a heartbeat, glass crunching under his leather boots. \u201cThe lady is spoken for. You and Benny satisfy each other. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s your usual way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, chill.\u201d Luke blew him a kiss from his landing spot on the floor next to the wall. \u201cBenny and me swing either way. No problem. And if you want to join in, I\u2019ll take on a hairy Scot, though Glory\u2019d be my first choice.\u201d</p><p>Lily giggled and stopped at the glass doors. \u201cYou\u2019re propositioning my dad? I\u2019d pay money to see that video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there even one of you that has something useful to say?\u201d I wanted to scream with frustration. Just when I thought we\u2019d found a solution to our problem, we\u2019d entered the twilight zone and I was surrounded by pod people.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this\u2019ll help. The guy with the cash was a dealer. Gave us some of that cool drug. Vampire Viagra.\u201d Luke grinned at me. \u201cOh, look at you, Gloriana. I can see it in your eyes. You\u2019ve tried it. So you know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about, sweet thing. Good stuff, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d I flinched when I felt a hand on my shoulder, relaxing when I realized it was Damian beside me.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been an Energy Vampire, then, who took Westwood\u2019s body. Don\u2019t know why you want a pile of bones, but you\u2019ll have to deal with the EVs to get the information you need. Maybe Lily will give Blade a description of this dealer.\u201d Damian nodded toward where Jerry was talking to his daughter.</p><p>Vamp hearing let me know it wasn\u2019t that night he was asking about. No, the allowance comment had struck a nerve, and he was offering to support her if she\u2019d find a better set of friends. That was met with a string of profanities, and Lily jerked Drac outside to Damian\u2019s gazebo a.k.a. love shack.</p><p>I turned to Damian. \u201cWell, no help from those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want Westwood\u2019s body?\u201d Damian took a swallow of his drink and looked around the room. \u201cNever mind. Tell me later. Right now I need to call my own woman. These thugs are right. The drinks are an aphrodisiac. And I figure Blade would cut out my heart if I made a move on you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned right.\u201d Jerry slung his arm around me. He finished his bottle of Blott-O and slammed the empty down on a table. \u201cOne lead. I guess that\u2019s more than we might have gotten from this bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I walked up to Luke, who was arguing with Benny about whether to leave or call some women they knew to come over.</p><p>\u201cLuke, Benny. Focus a minute.\u201d</p> <p>They stared at me, their smiles making it clear they\u2019d taken my command as an invitation. Benny held out his arms.</p><p>\u201cKnew you couldn\u2019t resist the two of us. Come closer, darling. We\u2019ve got some Vamp Viagra if that works for you.\u201d Benny blinked, like focusing was beyond him. I could relate. I\u2019d drained my bottle of hooch, and though it had been delicious, I was a little woozy myself.</p><p>I stayed out of reach. \u201cWhat did this drug dealer look like? The guy who took Westwood\u2019s body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was months ago.\u201d Benny leaned against Luke. \u201cTall? Kind of hot, I guess. Give us a kiss, Glory, and I might remember more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. Luke? You remember anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenny\u2019s right. He was hot. I wouldn\u2019t kick him out of bed.\u201d Luke\u2019s grin was sexy and knowing.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kick a were-hyena out of bed, you horn-dog.\u201d Benny collapsed against the sofa cushions, laughing so hard he choked.</p><p>\u201cStupid sod.\u201d Luke pounded him on the back. \u201cGlory needs our help.\u201d He looked at me, suddenly almost sober. \u201cHe was blond, blue-eyed and, oh, yeah, had a sweet ass.\u201d He grinned and opened his phone. \u201cHere, call him. I\u2019ve got him on speed dial.\u201d</p><p>I realized my mouth had dropped open. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I grabbed the phone and heard ringing then the voice mail for Greg Kaplan. Well, well. I left a message for him to call me, then handed Luke his phone.</p><p>He grinned and slipped it into his pocket. \u201cNow you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Jerry stepped between us. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep that in mind. Come on, Gloriana. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks, Luke. I do owe you.\u201d I didn\u2019t wait around to play any more verbal games, just followed Jerry to the door. \u201cMuch as I hate the thought, looks like we\u2019ll have to meet with Greg Kaplan. I\u2019m doing business with him anyway. Maybe Greg will tell me where he dumped Westwood\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate for you to deal with one of those devils too. But Kaplan will tell you what you need to know if I have to beat it out of him.\u201d Jerry ran his hand through his hair. \u201cDamned drink. Right now all I can think about is getting you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked sounds good. Race you to the car.\u201d I slipped out of his grasp and hit the door. We were in the car in seconds and speeding toward Jerry\u2019s house again. I felt guilty for abandoning the shop again, but not much. And I hadn\u2019t checked in with Rafe. He deserved to know what was going on after worrying about me. First thing tomorrow. Flo too. Then Jerry had his hand inside my pants, and I felt obliged to do the same for him. One thing led to another, and we were doing the wild thing in his car inside the garage.</p><p>Forget the kitchen. This time we made it to the den and the leather sofa in front of the fireplace. Ridiculous to keep using artificial stimulants. We\u2019d gone centuries without them. But I had to say the extra boost added a new level to our lovemaking. It had certainly cut out the need for small talk this go-round.</p><p>I climaxed for the fourth time and lay atop Jerry, listening to his heart beat. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at you.\u201d</p><p>We both jumped when we heard the back door open. Jerry grabbed a furry brown throw and tossed it over us.</p><p>\u201cLily!\u201d I sat up and covered both of us reasonably decently.</p><p>\u201cI took your advice, Dad. I dumped Drac, and I\u2019m moving in.\u201d Lily dropped a bulging leather bag on the floor and grinned. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to move your action to the bedroom from now on unless you like an audience.\u201d She yawned. \u201cWe can work out those details tomorrow. See you in the evening.\u201d She picked up the bag and headed for the stairs. \u201cUsual room? Down the hall from yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jerry shook his head. Poor Jerry. He hadn\u2019t even known he had a daughter until a few months ago. Now she\u2019d be living with him. And taking an allowance since that had obviously sealed the deal.</p><p>I kissed his cheek. \u201cBuck up, old man. You\u2019ll do fine. The girl needs guidance. Obviously she\u2019s never seen how a decent man goes on. Look at the company she\u2019s been keeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrash.\u201d Jerry\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So you\u2019ll show her how it should be.\u201d I stood and held out my hand. \u201cDawn\u2019s coming. Let\u2019s to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You\u2019ve fair worn me out.\u201d Jerry yawned and lifted me up in his arms. \u201cWell worth the effort, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I always will be.\u201d I leaned against him as he walked up the stairs.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Quit worrying, Jerry. Rafe will be here any minute. You take care of your business, and I\u2019ll take care of mine.\u201d I ended the call and concentrated on writing out payroll checks. My business needed attention, and if I didn\u2019t pay my clerks on time, I wouldn\u2019t have a business. I\u2019d just signed the last one, wincing at how low that left my bank account, when there was a knock on the back door. I knew with a sniff that it was Rafe. I threw the double dead bolts and let him in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlade filled me in on the Westwood situation. I don\u2019t like the EV involvement.\u201d He didn\u2019t waste time with a hello.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped.\u201d I locked the door again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see either Westwood hanging out in the alley just now, did you?\u201d</p><p>Rafe gave me a \u201cGet real\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. So we\u2019ve declared a temporary cease fire. I\u2019m sure Jerry\u2019s warning to Vivien helped too.\u201d I glanced at my cell lying next to papers strewn across my work table. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for Greg Kaplan to call me back. He took over the cleanup after I killed Papa Westwood. I wonder why he did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s worrying me. An EV never does anything without an agenda.\u201d Rafe shoved the papers aside and sat on the table. He looked good in a black T-shirt with a red N-V slashed across it. His dark wash jeans were snug and well-worn.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out when Greg calls back.\u201d I stacked my papers. \u201cNice shirt. That your new logo for the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Nadia\u2019s design. What do you think?\u201d Rafe glanced down. \u201cShe\u2019s very tuned in to the club scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. You going to have live entertainment or a DJ?\u201d I shoved the papers onto a shelf and sat next to Rafe. I still wanted him to dance at Flo\u2019s party. Especially now that I had hope I might live long enough to hostess the thing.</p><p>\u201cA mix of both. In fact, I told Nadia I\u2019d talk to Nathan about getting Israel Caine to perform as our opening act since he\u2019s coming to town anyway.\u201d Rafe nudged my knee with his. \u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I? Sounds like an excellent plan to me. Ray isn\u2019t exactly your biggest fan though.\u201d I smiled, remembering how Rafe had run interference when Ray had made moves on me. I\u2019d always thought it was out of loyalty to Jerry, his employer. Now I wondered how much of it was from Rafe\u2019s own jealousy.</p><p>\u201cNathan\u2019s a businessman and an excellent manager. Nadia\u2019s willing to pay big bucks to get this club off to a good start.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cBut if you want to put in a good word with Ray, I wouldn\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking a favor?\u201d I smiled at Rafe. For a weak and selfish moment I wished that he was still my bodyguard. Then I could have him by my side when I had my meeting with Greg Kaplan and not seem like I was wimping out. I blocked all these thoughts so Rafe, who could read me better than anyone but Jerry, couldn\u2019t get them. He had his own obligations, and I wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you\u2019d rather not talk to Caine, I understand. It took you a long time to convince him to move on. The guy might think you were trying to start up again.\u201d Rafe pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket. It was a clipping from a magazine. A picture of Ray with a tall beautiful brunette I recognized.</p><p>\u201cReading the tabloids now?\u201d I tossed it back in his lap and jumped off the table.</p><p>\u201cNadia does. She thought you\u2019d be interested.\u201d Rafe dropped the clipping in my overflowing trash can. \u201cGuess you\u2019re not. The woman\u2019s vampire, Glory. She came on to me in that club in L.A.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I remember. Guess Ray finally got his vampire sex.\u201d I managed to say it like I didn\u2019t give a damn. And I shouldn\u2019t. I could have initiated Ray into the ways of vampire lovemaking myself. But I\u2019d been with Jerry. Had always been with Jerry.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s Jerry got on you, Rafe? He says you still owe him. How can that be? Your contract is up, right?\u201d I watched his face carefully. If I didn\u2019t know him so well, I might have missed the slight tightening around one corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Rafe pushed off the table and headed for the door. \u201cI assume you\u2019re here for the night? No EV games planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play games with EVs.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to share my plans with Rafe. He needed to work on his club. But if Greg called, I was meeting him. \u201cI\u2019ll put in a personal plea with Ray to sing in your club, but I want a favor in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d Rafe threw the dead bolts open and had his hand on the knob. \u201cDancing for your bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I grinned and stepped up to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear your angel costume, just something sexy. To please the ladies.\u201d I put my hand on his chest. \u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hiring extra security and putting it on the tab.\u201d He grabbed my hand and tugged me closer. \u201cAnd quit toying with me. It\u2019s becoming clear that I need to move on just like Caine has. You\u2019re Blade\u2019s woman, always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I stepped back. But I was more attracted than \u201cBlade\u2019s woman\u201d had a right to be. The animal part of him pulled at me on a deeply primitive level. And then there was that heat again. Vampires had a chill that never quite went away. No matter how many times Jerry and I exchanged blood, we never gave each other warmth like I felt from Rafe\u2019s body. His blood would be hot, fire on my tongue. He smiled, his dimples so charming that my heart stumbled. Yes, Rafe could be a warrior, but he understood me on a level that Jerry never had, despite our centuries together.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, Glory. You\u2019ve had some damned near misses, haven\u2019t you. Still feeling shaky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I slid my arms around Rafe\u2019s lean waist and laid my head on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not toying with you, Rafe. You\u2019re my best friend. Please don\u2019t ask me to let you walk out of my life and forget you. I . . . I can\u2019t.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at him because I knew his dark eyes would be pushing to see into my soul.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Glory. I\u2019m still here for you. You want me to stay?\u201d His strong arms held me close. \u201cYou can always count on me. Whatever you need. I hope you know that. But I wanted to be more than a friend. Guess that\u2019s my problem, not yours.\u201d He laid his cheek on my hair for a moment. \u201cEnough of this shit. If I\u2019m staying, I\u2019ve got to make a call.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back, relieved yet confused. \u201cNo, you need to take care of your club. I\u2019ll call Ray. Nate too, if necessary. Give me the date you want him to sing.\u201d I ran my fingers through my hair, suddenly nervous. Silly to be uncomfortable around Rafael Valdez. I mean, I\u2019d had him sleeping on the foot of my bed for five freakin\u2019 years.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a list of possible dates.\u201d Rafe dug in his pocket, pulled out a piece of paper and practically threw it at me. \u201cNadia\u2019s got a crew working night and day to get the place ready. As soon as we get the headliner nailed down, we\u2019ll start publicity for the opening. You\u2019ll have to schedule your party a night or two before then.\u201d Rafe grinned, obviously bursting to get out of there and tell his partner things were rolling along.</p><p>\u201cFine. Go. I\u2019ve got work here and a call to make.\u201d I picked up my cell. \u201cThanks, Rafe. Seriously. Flo\u2019ll be over the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t guarantee anything, but I appreciate the try. Lock the door behind me.\u201d Rafe grabbed me around the waist, landed a kiss on my lips, then was out the door.</p><p>I touched my fingers to my mouth. Not much there as far as a kiss, but sweet to see him so excited. I hit speed dial on the phone for Israel Caine. We\u2019d pretended to be engaged long enough to have each other\u2019s numbers. He picked up on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cGlory, babe. Everything okay?\u201d Ray\u2019s voice was deep, with the same sexy vibe as the way he sang.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve been reading in the press here that you\u2019re coming to Austin for the South by Southwest Music Festival. I hope you\u2019re going to say hi when you\u2019re in town.\u201d Still a fangirl, I just managed to bite back a giggle.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You were my first stop.\u201d Ray laughed, and I heard noise in the background. \u201cLet me go outside. It\u2019s crazy in here.\u201d I heard music, then silence. \u201cThere, I\u2019m on the balcony. I rented one of Chip\u2019s houses in the hills, and it\u2019s party central here for the band. The guys won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like business as usual.\u201d I laughed and sat on the table. Chip was the vampire who owned his record label and a big chunk of real estate in L.A. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Ray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Promoting the new album. Getting into the vamp scene.\u201d He coughed. \u201cFinally got a vamp woman to pop my cherry, Glory girl.\u201d</p><p>Gee, put it right out there. I wouldn\u2019t make love with him, and Ray had been desperate for vampire sex. It was different when you added the incredibly erotic mutual blood drinking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d So why did I feel like crying?</p><p>\u201cWish it had been with you. Even though it was incredible with the fang banging and all. I\u2019m even writing a song about it. You know how you feel like you\u2019re taking in the life force and connecting so deep.\u201d He groaned, a noise that made me squirm. \u201cStill, I have a feeling the wild thing with you, babe, would have been the absolute best.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice was a sensual rumble.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut, Ray, new subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. This one\u2019s killing me. What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you come to town, you\u2019re bringing the band, right?\u201d I knew he was, it had already been in the newspapers.</p><p>\u201cYes, Chip and Nathan have worked out something to promote the first single on the new album.\u201d Ray coughed again. \u201cDamn it, vampires aren\u2019t supposed to get sick, but something here is bothering me. It\u2019ll be good to get out of L.A. for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking weird drugs out there, are you?\u201d I knew Ray liked to experiment. Of course lately so did I.</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, not much anyway. Now you were going to ask me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Two favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that. Then you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d Ray laughed, the evil laugh that I loved so much. Yeah, I did love him. Jerry too, and Rafe. I did love my men. But I couldn\u2019t like the way everyone I knew was suddenly keeping a tally of the favors I owed. I was in debt up to my eyebrows. Money I could handle, but favors? Those could end up biting me on my chubby butt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, one\u2019s really a favor for Flo. You remember my buddy Florence da Vinci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, the woman is unforgettable.\u201d Ray laughed. \u201cWhat does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting married to Richard again, a big blowout, and would love for you to sing at their wedding. It\u2019s while you\u2019ll be here anyway.\u201d I heard a knock on the connecting door from the shop. \u201cHang on. Someone\u2019s at the door.\u201d I sniffed. Greg Kaplan and Aggie? Hmm. I opened the door anyway. After all, I was safely in the back room of my own shop. I waved at Lacy to let her know that I\u2019d yell if I needed her. I made a sign to Greg and Aggie that I\u2019d be with them once I got off the phone.</p> <p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll sing at the wedding. Let me know if there\u2019s a particular song she wants.\u201d Ray coughed again. \u201cI hope like hell I don\u2019t lose my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealing sleep should fix you right up.\u201d I realized I had Greg listening and was careful with what I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s opening a club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talking about that mutt who used to be your overprotective bodyguard?\u201d Ray actually growled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, Ray, you\u2019ve got to admit he saved my life and yours on more than one occasion.\u201d I smiled at Greg and Aggie. \u201cI\u2019ve got company so I can\u2019t go into details, but think about doing me a personal favor and singing at the opening of Rafe\u2019s club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy had the hots for you, Glory. Why would I help him score?\u201d Ray sounded like a spoiled child.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not scoring any more than you are, and you know it. I\u2019m Blade\u2019s, uh, woman. Rafe said it just tonight. He knows it. Accepts it. Just like you have. The shifter stayed in dog body for five long years just to protect me. I think it would be cool of you to help get his club off the ground. I\u2019d be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow grateful?\u201d Ray sounded like the Devil himself angling for a soul.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it, Ray. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow. Got to go now.\u201d I ended the call and looked up to see Greg grinning like he\u2019d learned something useful. Oh, boy, did I hate that.</p><p>\u201cI swear, Glory, I don\u2019t know how you get all these men dancing to your tune.\u201d Aggie tugged down her turquoise knit top in case Greg and I missed seeing the swells of her breasts. \u201cI mean, you are absolutely nothing special, and those hips ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the reality check, Aggie.\u201d I stuffed my cell phone in my pocket. \u201cGuess some men have no taste.\u201d I looked pointedly at Greg. \u201cOr maybe you two didn\u2019t come in together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we did.\u201d Greg grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve found that Sirens have many talents, some of them extremely useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Greg appreciates me.\u201d Aggie clung to his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou left a message for me last night. What\u2019s the deal? The samples for your party are already here.\u201d Greg walked over to the shelf, pulled out a gold bag and looked inside. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you tried them yet. Go nuts. Then you can order from the list. I\u2019ve included bottles of three kinds of exotic brews as well as samples of vamp edibles you\u2019re gonna go crazy for.\u201d Greg grinned like he knew things about me I\u2019d rather he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Forget him. I glanced inside the bag, my mouth watering at the sight of what looked like real chips and salsa. And a cupcake! It wasn\u2019t chocolate\u2014I guess mean Simon Destiny saved that for EV headquarters\u2014but I\u2019d take white with strawberry icing any day. I dipped my finger into the icing and licked it.</p><p>\u201cHeaven. But this isn\u2019t why I called last night. I have a question. About the night that I killed Brent Westwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Simon and I call that \u2018the night Glory finally got her guts.\u2019 Brilliant of you.\u201d Greg smiled at Aggie. \u201cShe turned his own crossbow on the hunter and plugged him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen left Jerry\u2019s daughter Lily and her pals to clean up the mess. Now Lily tells me that you came by and paid to take over the job.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist. I dug a chip out of the bag and bit into it. Salty and crunchy. My moan of ecstasy was downright embarrassing.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it was my own brilliant move of the night. Simon is calling that \u2018the night Gregory became an invaluable asset.\u2019\u201d Greg laughed, pulled the jar of salsa out of the bag and twisted off the cap. \u201cDip a chip in this, Glory. It\u2019s spicy hot, delicious.\u201d</p><p>What can I say? I\u2019m easy. I dragged a chip through the bright red salsa and stuffed it in my mouth. Oh, yeah, on fire. I grabbed a bottle of something called Moch-A and took a swig. Coffee flavored. I had tears in my eyes and not from the hot sauce. I was in food lover\u2019s Heaven. I hoped this stuff didn\u2019t have consequences. I\u2019d suffered after an encounter with Cheetos.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. Why did taking Brent Westwood\u2019s body make you an invaluable asset?\u201d Call me a pig, but I said this around a mouthful of cupcake.</p><p>\u201cThat, dear Glory, is what you\u2019re about to find out.\u201d Greg nodded to Aggie. \u201cDo your thing, love bunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwallow that bite, Glory, and wipe the frosting off your nose. What a pig.\u201d Aggie put her hands on her hips.</p><p>Mortified, I swiped at my nose, then washed down the cupcake with another thirsty gulp of Moch-A. Man, those EVs knew their stuff. I glanced at the price list in the bag. Good thing Flo was paying because I sure couldn\u2019t afford it. But Jerry could. Maybe I should break down and marry him. Was that a terrible reason to say vows? Aggie and Greg just watched me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Aggie smiled and turned me to stone.</p><p>Aggie and Greg carried me out between them like a five-foot-five-inch log. When my head whacked the edge of the back door, Aggie thought it was hilarious.</p><p>\u201cQuiet. She has a lot of nosy friends around here. We don\u2019t need one of them riding to her rescue.\u201d Greg hit a remote, and the lights flashed on a black SUV with dark tinted windows.</p><p>\u201cBig deal. Then we\u2019d have more statues for the alley.\u201d Aggie chuckled and let my hair brush the dirty concrete.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like dealing with the complications.\u201d Greg shoved my feet into the back of the vehicle.</p><p>And what could I do about it? Zip. Not a damned thing. Couldn\u2019t even blink. It had only been a few minutes, and my eyeballs already felt like sandpaper. I strained with every fiber of my being to move something. I shouted frantic mental messages in every direction. Apparently no one heard.</p><p>\u201cPoor Glory. You want to know where you\u2019re going?\u201d Greg patted me on the rump just before he crammed me the rest of the way in. \u201cNot telling. Not until we\u2019re well away from this shop of yours. I know you\u2019re trying to call for help.\u201d</p><p>I saw him take Aggie\u2019s arm before he slammed the back door, leaving me in darkness. I could hear them arguing. Aggie wanted to come along, but Greg had strict orders to come alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat good is it going to do to have her out there like that? Nobody can take the freeze off her but me.\u201d Aggie sounded seriously pissed.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Simon will thaw her out with a glance. Sorry, sweet thing, but we\u2019ll go another time. We\u2019ll have one of the luxury suites and a romantic weekend. This is business.\u201d</p><p>Aggie changed tactics. \u201cCombine business with pleasure, baby.\u201d I heard some sounds I didn\u2019t want to analyze.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but not tonight. Soon. Now I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Greg was out of breath but determined. Which just proved how scared of Simon he was. Because offer Greg sex and he was usually putty in your hands. Or at least I\u2019d heard rumors to that effect. The overhead light blinked on then off when Greg got into the car and started the engine.</p><p>\u201cGuess you heard. So now you know where we\u2019re headed. Not to worry, Glory. Simon won\u2019t hurt you. Not if you cooperate.\u201d</p><p>I lay there in the dark, rolling and bumping helplessly with every turn the SUV made, and figured this was it for me. Because I couldn\u2019t imagine cooperating with Simon Destiny.</p><p>What the hell did he want with me? To meet the mystery man the EV king had mentioned? Oh, yeah. Simon called himself king of the EVs. Didn\u2019t wear a crown, or at least I hadn\u2019t seen one, but that didn\u2019t mean the jerk didn\u2019t keep one on his nightstand to impress the ladies insane enough to sleep with him. Another turn and I rolled until I lay facedown on the carpet, the rough nylon smashed against my nose.</p><p>Would Simon give me to the energy-sucking goddess the EVs worshipped and feared? They\u2019d built a gold-domed temple to her. The car swerved, and I slid to my back again, staring at a black ceiling and wondering if I could find a way to hurt Aggie before I died. I really, really wanted to take the Siren down.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Glory. You\u2019re broadcasting your thoughts pretty clearly, and you can forget hurting Aggie. Maybe this will help you chill. I bought this CD just for you.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice suddenly filled the car. His new album. Of course I had it at home and in my car. Cut number three was a song Ray had written for me. When it came on, I wanted to cry bitter tears. Damn. Couldn\u2019t squeeze out a single drop. I wanted Ray badly. He\u2019d rip out Greg\u2019s throat and sing while doing it.</p><p>The music changed, faster, rocking hard. I lay there in the dark, awash first with hopelessness, then with a homicidal anger that had no place to go until the last song faded into silence.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019re here. Good thing. I know he\u2019s a big deal, but I couldn\u2019t take another second of your rock star\u2019s wailing. \u2018The Glory Years\u2019? Gag me.\u201d Greg stopped the car, and the overhead light came on. His door slammed, then the back door opened. \u201cHey, could use some help here. Got a heavy package to unload.\u201d</p><p>Greg grabbed my shoulders and pulled me out, then another man took my legs and they carried me across a parking lot to a large brick building. Once inside, they set me on my feet, Greg leaning me against a wall.</p><p>\u201cGet Simon, will you?\u201d Greg ordered the other man.</p><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019m here.\u201d Simon walked into the room, his weasel face all smiles. \u201cWell done, Gregory. I see you used your Siren\u2019s skills to subdue Gloriana.\u201d He walked close and brushed my cheek with a cold fingertip before he sniffed. \u201cStrawberry?\u201d He laughed. \u201cShe really went for that cupcake, didn\u2019t she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. You sure you can undo this freeze thing?\u201d Greg patted my cheek, hard enough to make me rock against the wall. \u201cAggie really wanted to come out here and do it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of it. Leave us.\u201d Simon smiled into my eyes. It was like staring into a cobra\u2019s gaze, waiting for the fatal strike. I prayed he\u2019d thaw me out, so I could run like hell or shift and fly away.</p><p>Greg left and closed the door.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, you know I can read your thoughts. Since you\u2019re so hell-bent on leaving, it suits me to leave you in this helpless state awhile longer.\u201d Simon backed up a step. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere until you meet my special guest. That\u2019s why I had Gregory bring you out here, since you refused my invitation to come on your own.\u201d Simon walked over to his desk and picked up a phone. \u201cSend him in, Loretta.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know who to expect and sure didn\u2019t like Simon\u2019s secret smile when the door opened and a man walked in. When I saw who it was, I really wished I could blink, rub my eyes, something. No way. Couldn\u2019t be. That bump on my head had given me hallucinations.</p><p>\u201cGlory St. Clair. I\u2019ve been wanting to thank you for what you did.\u201d The man strode over to stand right in front of me.</p><p>Gag reflex. No, not working. Hyperventilate. Breathing didn\u2019t function either.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder, and I began to slide.</p> <p>\u201cFrozen. It\u2019s a trick some of us higher-level entities can use as a defense. She doesn\u2019t like to visit here.\u201d</p><p>I landed on my back and lay staring at the ceiling. Neither man so much as lifted a finger to help me. Real gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do that. Freeze someone. Is she stuck like this permanently? That would be bad. I need her, you know. Able to move.\u201d The man squatted beside me and peered into my eyes, so close I could feel his breath on my face.</p><p>He\u2019d been drinking from a type-B mortal, and I could see his fangs. Vampire. Hysterical laughter knocked around in my brain, sending my thoughts scattering. One landed front and center. I hated him. Oh, yeah. First chance I got, he was going to hell and staying there. His eyes raked my body, and he squeezed my breast through my sweater. His smile begged to be ripped off his face.</p><p>\u201cI can release her at any time. But I\u2019d suggest you be on the other side of the room when I do it.\u201d Simon stood beside his guest and clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cRead her thoughts. I think you\u2019ll find them enlightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I keep forgetting I can do that.\u201d He stood, then stared into my eyes. I sent him a very specific message.</p> <p>\u201cWow. She\u2019s got a mouth on her.\u201d He glanced at Simon, then back at me, his smile full of fang. \u201cSorry, Glory, but Brent Westwood\u2019s back, and thanks to you and Greg Kaplan, I\u2019m going to live forever.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m going to release you now.\u201d Simon had taken Westwood\u2019s place by my side. \u201cI\u2019d advise you to behave if you want to stay free.\u201d</p><p>Behave? Instead of fight or try to escape? Why not? I wanted to know what Brent Westwood could possibly need from me. Gross touches or not, it wasn\u2019t sex. I\u2019d read his mind too, enough to know he\u2019d just been trying to intimidate me. God, I hated him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I can see you\u2019ve decided to be reasonable.\u201d Simon touched my shoulder. I could move.</p><p>Good intentions or not, I leaped and went straight for Westwood. I threw him up against the wall, my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, you asshole. You ever touch me like that again, and I\u2019ll kill you and make sure it\u2019s permanent this time. You hear me?\u201d I slammed his head against the wall. Simon just watched, apparently amused. \u201cI\u2019m not ripping out your throat because you probably taste like dirty gym socks. But, remember, you\u2019re a fledgling, and I\u2019m over four hundred years old. I can take you down and not even break a sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon? You just going to stand there and let her do this?\u201d Westwood\u2019s mouth trembled over his new fangs.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have touched her. Only a man who can\u2019t get a woman any other way would take advantage like that.\u201d Simon strolled over to his desk and sat in a black leather chair. \u201cLet him explain his needs, Gloriana. I think you\u2019ll see an advantage in cooperating.\u201d</p><p>I smacked Brent\u2019s head against the wall one more time, then let him slide down into a groaning heap on the floor. \u201cCooperate with him? You\u2019re kidding. Damned vampire killer. Why haven\u2019t you fed him to your goddess in little chunks already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, I would have. But remember who we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Simon gestured at Westwood, who was giving me hate-filled looks. \u201cHe\u2019s a billionaire. Money talks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that loud. I can\u2019t believe Greg turned him. What the hell was he thinking?\u201d I strode over to an armchair in front of Simon\u2019s desk and sat. I didn\u2019t doubt Simon would keep Westwood from retaliating against me. Obviously I had a purpose here.</p><p>\u201cIt was genius. I was amazed Kaplan had the foresight to do it, and I\u2019ve rewarded him.\u201d Simon smiled. \u201cYou can imagine how surprised our guest was when he woke up.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cHey, Brent, how\u2019s it feel to be one of those evil undead bloodsuckers? Where\u2019s your crossbow? Want me to put you out of your misery?\u201d That earned me a one-finger salute, and I laughed so hard I got tears in my eyes. \u201cI love the irony. Tell me, Simon, did he cry and beg you to stake him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, bitch.\u201d Westwood threw himself into a chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that you hunted down innocent vampires. I saw that Web site. You put your kills on exhibition.\u201d I snarled at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d He smiled and showed fang. \u201cI got it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it, both of you. Westwood, remember you need Gloriana\u2019s cooperation. Living forever is an expensive proposition. You said you wanted access to your funds.\u201d Simon was serious now. \u201cDon\u2019t get sidetracked by petty concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not petty when I\u2019m attacked. She nailed me in the first place with my own weapon.\u201d Westwood glared at me. \u201cThe pain! Hell, I prayed for death as I tried to stay absolutely still and listened to that bunch of vampires talk about chopping off my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad they didn\u2019t follow through. It would have made a sweet bowling ball.\u201d I smirked at him. \u201cYou can appreciate the desire to take a trophy, can\u2019t you, Brent? Where\u2019s your necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured one of those damned vamps took it.\u201d Westwood looked down at his fists. \u201cBut forget that. I\u2019m looking to the future now.\u201d He glanced at Simon. \u201cI want my old life back, or at least access to my funds. But I\u2019ll need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen monkeys fly out of your butt.\u201d I sat back. \u201cYour kids are already divvying up your fortune. All they want is your body. Somehow I think they\u2019ll be disappointed if you show up now.\u201d I grinned at him. \u201cNot exactly father of the year, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made some mistakes. Like anybody could.\u201d Westwood stood, looming over me. I jumped up and faced him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I made a big one. I should have ripped out your throat. Made sure you were truly dead that night.\u201d I looked him up and down. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t bear to get that close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we drop the pissing contest and get down to business?\u201d Simon pounded his fist on his desk, making his phone clatter and Westwood jump a foot. Newbie.</p><p>I shrugged and sat down again. \u201cBusiness. Whatever it is, I\u2019m not interested. This is a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn us down, Gloriana.\u201d Simon smiled, his fangs gleaming in the light. He was basically ugly as sin\u2014sharp nose, thinning hair and squinty eyes. But those eyes could promise you the pains of hellfire with just a glance. He gave me the creeps and scared me more than I\u2019d ever admit.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d I hid my fear with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to prove that I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Westwood fidgeted. \u201cI want my money and to resume my old life as Brent Westwood, billionaire. I can\u2019t just show up and claim it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I was interested in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cBecause there were bodyguards who got away that night. They saw you take me out. I\u2019ve been out to the ranch, in disguise of course. I heard what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, shift into your natural form and slither in?\u201d I saw him struggle to keep from lashing out again. Damn, he really did need me. This could work to my advantage. I peeked at Simon. He nodded, like there you go. Be smart.</p><p>\u201cI went out there really late one night. I managed to destroy the vamp-detecting glasses, every pair. No one else knows exactly how they work, so we won\u2019t be bothered with them again. That was my survival instinct kicking in, of course.\u201d Westwood straightened, looking more like a man who\u2019d made billions with his ideas.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I waited to see what was coming. Insane, talking to Brent Westwood without a stake aimed at my heart.</p><p>\u201cThere are statements from several witnesses who saw me go down under fire that night. You were identified as the shooter. One guard even had the foresight to take a video with his phone. It\u2019s poor quality, but you can see enough to figure I was down for good. No one went to the police for a couple of reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Like maybe the kids didn\u2019t give a damn how you died or who killed you as long as they could get to your money?\u201d I loved seeing Westwood lose his cool.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, quit goading him.\u201d Simon\u2019s quiet voice rang with authority and the implied threat that I could be a statue again if I didn\u2019t shut up and listen.</p><p>Westwood, half out of his chair, glanced at Simon, then settled for a look that promised me payback.</p><p>\u201cA couple of reasons. First, it was clear I had the drop on you first. You were acting in self-defense.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI\u2019d underestimated you, and you managed to turn my own weapon on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned back. \u201cThe police are involved now anyway. Because of your stupid will that pitted both kids against each other. Did you tell Simon about that?\u201d I turned to the EV leader. \u201cFather of the year? Get this. First kid to take out Brent\u2019s killer gets the whole fortune. How\u2019s that for an equitable distribution.\u201d I saw that Simon wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cWe know all about that, Gloriana. And it seems Brent is now listed as a missing person.\u201d Simon nodded toward Brent. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, when those monkeys . . .\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote that will when I still thought vampires were out to get me. Damn, I hate that David ended up in jail.\u201d Westwood sighed.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, your children have seen the light. Lawyers are racking up big fees getting that piece of crap tossed aside.\u201d I sighed. \u201cSeems Brent here was showing signs of losing his mind at the end. The will proved it. Along with that horrible Web site.\u201d I glared at Westwood. \u201cSimon, have you seen it? The pictures of his kills? Westwood, I don\u2019t know why the law hasn\u2019t come knocking on your door about those murders.\u201d</p><p>Westwood flashed his fangs. \u201cBecause vamps live off the grid. No one was reported missing, no bodies were found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed my boyfriend\u2019s best friend.\u201d I blinked back sudden tears. \u201cI\u2019ll never work with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gloriana. I\u2019m sure Westwood has regrets now.\u201d Simon toyed with a letter opener, sliced his own finger and licked it clean with his reptilian tongue.</p> <p>I turned back to Westwood. \u201cScrew your regrets. Those pictures and that Web site have to come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019m no longer proud of my role in destroying vampires and sure don\u2019t want to encourage hunters. But only I can crash the site. I used special codes and equipment I have at the ranch to build it.\u201d Westwood\u2019s eyes gleamed with pride. I wanted to snatch Simon\u2019s letter opener and stab them out. Too bad he\u2019d heal now.</p><p>I took a steadying breath. \u201cSlither out there some night then and take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want my life back. The ranch, the jet, all of it. I\u2019m sure the Energy Vampires will enjoy some of my homes in other parts of the world. Right, Simon?\u201d Brent looked at his mentor for approval and got a nod. \u201cGood thing they need proof or my children would have already started dismantling everything I built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why can\u2019t you just show up now and say \u2018Daddy\u2019s home\u2019?\u201d I was so ready to get out of here.</p><p>\u201cBecause we need to do this right. There\u2019s a pile of evidence out there I\u2019ve got to refute. I want to prove that the video was bogus and the witnesses who saw what went down were tricked. Got to show that the whole vampire thing, my kills on the Web site, all of that, was a scam too.\u201d He darted a look at Simon.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, what do I have to do with anything?\u201d I got up, drawn by a bowl of Simon\u2019s famous chocolate truffles near the door. I loved them, but what I\u2019d just been through had given me trust issues with anything made by an EV.</p><p>\u201cI want you to reenact the whole death scene with me. I\u2019ll take my own video to them when I show up. There we\u2019ll be, you aiming the crossbow, me pretending to go down, then jumping up again like it was a hoax. Claim that I was just trying to make myself look good. It\u2019ll explain away the whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the disappearing act?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYour kids think you\u2019re dead, Westwood. They have for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work out the details later.\u201d Simon sounded very sure of that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. An increase in their allowances and they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Now Westwood wouldn\u2019t look at either one of us. Obviously he didn\u2019t like having to act the fool to his children or his adoring public who came to his Web site to feed their hatred of things that go bump in the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat would be in it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you.\u201d Westwood\u2019s jaw was tight. Aw, did he hate asking me for a favor? I smiled.</p><p>\u201cHmm. That job should be worth millions. Right, Simon?\u201d No way did I trust either of them to actually pay up.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be greedy, Gloriana. You\u2019d be paid what amounts to a fortune for a working person such as yourself.\u201d Now Simon smiled. \u201cWestwood is becoming an Energy Vampire. In gratitude, he\u2019ll donate part of his fortune to the goddess and her causes.\u201d</p><p>Should I warn Westwood that deals with Simon usually ended up with everyone a loser except the king of the EVs? Naw, let him find that out the hard way. By the time Simon got through with him, Westwood would be begging for his own allowance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really busy right now. Got Flo\u2019s wedding coming up. Lots to do. Sorry, fellas, but I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d I got up and strolled to the door. I glanced down at the chocolate again, my mouth watering. Damn, I hated depriving myself.</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable, Glory.\u201d Simon followed me. He reached into the bowl and took a chocolate, then popped the truffle into his mouth. \u201cThese are delicious. Remember when you were out here before? Take one.\u201d</p><p>Why not? Had to be okay since Simon had eaten one. I selected the biggest and bit into it, savoring the burst of flavor as my taste buds went wild.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll pay you big bucks. It won\u2019t take long to do the video.\u201d Now Westwood was on my other side, his voice a whiny irritation that made me take a second chocolate.</p><p>\u201cForget it. I don\u2019t trust you. You\u2019d get the footage you want, and then I\u2019d never get a stinking dime.\u201d I smiled at Simon. \u201cI know how Energy Vampires operate.\u201d I gasped as a pain hit me. Too much chocolate? I didn\u2019t think that was possible. I staggered back to my chair.</p><p>\u201cNot this time. You\u2019ll get paid. Cooperate for your own good, Glory. My kids are trying to kill you, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Westwood actually looked proud of this. \u201cYou want to take a chance that they\u2019ll be successful before I can call them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kids took a shot, but their lawyers won\u2019t have to break a sweat getting that dumbass will thrown out. I mean, vampires? What judge is going to think a competent man wrote that?\u201d I laughed. \u201cSo Daddy\u2019s crazy, and the kids will split your dough down the middle. They just don\u2019t want to wait seven years to do it. Right now I\u2019m their only hope of recovering your body, so I figure I\u2019m safe from them.\u201d I bent over as stomach pains hit me hard. \u201cSimon, what was in that candy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little something to make you more cooperative, Gloriana. You forced me to use it. If you\u2019d just said yes.\u201d I heard this as I fell to the floor. The pain! Everything went dark.</p><p>I woke up in a room without windows. I was lying on a double bed, and I wasn\u2019t alone. I rolled over and saw Rafe, seriously battered and bloody, unconscious beside me.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I carefully touched his swollen jaw and torn lip. Blood seeped from several wounds on his beautiful face. One thing I knew how to do was heal. I touched the cuts I could see. He\u2019d obviously put up a hell of a fight before he\u2019d been thrown in here. But how did he know where to find me?</p><p>His eyes opened, and he stared up at me. I realized I was crying when a tear splashed on his scraped chin.</p><p>\u201cOw! Dry up, will you? That stings like a son of a bitch.\u201d Rafe lifted one hand up to his face, his knuckles raw and bloody.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you trying to do, take on the Energy Vampires single-handedly?\u201d I sniffed, relieved when the worst of the cuts started healing under my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were in here. No way was I letting you face these creeps alone.\u201d He sat up carefully. \u201cI did some damage before three of them took me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are piss-poor odds, Rafe. You should have called in reinforcements. Or waited for word from me.\u201d I looked around at what amounted to a jail cell. The walls were concrete and the door steel. Anything useful as a weapon had been removed. The bed was a mattress on top of a concrete shelf. We didn\u2019t even have a sheet we could strangle someone with.</p><p>\u201cWhat would your word have been, Glory? From what Aggie told me, you were a statue. Couldn\u2019t move or talk.\u201d Rafe lifted his shirt, and I saw a gash in his side seeping more blood. I inhaled and had to force back my fangs.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, look at you. It\u2019s a miracle they didn\u2019t toss you to their goddess.\u201d I put my hand over his wound and heard him suck in his breath. \u201cHold still, I\u2019m healing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured. Thanks.\u201d His smile was lopsided because of a swollen lip.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was? Did Aggie tell you what she did?\u201d At least the bleeding stopped.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you calling for help after I left your place. So I went back. Lacy said Aggie and Greg Kaplan had come by just before you took off without a word. She was worried.\u201d He winced when I pulled up his sleeve. Another cut.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come out here. Look at you. Your shirt is a bloody mess. Take it off and let me see what else is under there. I hate that you did this for me. You\u2019re off the payroll, you know.\u201d I still felt like crying.</p><p>\u201cGlory, look at me.\u201d Rafe put his hand on mine. \u201cForget the freakin\u2019 payroll. I will always take care of you. End of story.\u201d He ripped off his shirt. \u201cNow go ahead. Fix me up so I can get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe. I didn\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful.\u201d I put my hand on his chest, which was bruised but not cut anywhere. \u201cIt means the world to me that you would put yourself through this for me. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cA good fight beats paperwork any day. You want to tell me why Greg dragged you out here? Obviously not to decorate the square in front of the golden dome since you\u2019re not a statue anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m surprised Aggie told you where to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg pissed her off because he left her behind.\u201d Rafe rolled off the bed and walked slowly around the room, stopping to study the solid door. He tried the knob. Locked, of course. \u201cWhen I tracked her down, she was happy to spill his secret. Besides, where else is an EV going to go?\u201d He stopped in front of me. \u201cAre you okay? What did they do to you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrugged me with some of Simon\u2019s chocolate truffles.\u201d I made a face. \u201cGuess I\u2019m pretty predictable around food. As soon as Simon ate one, I was all over them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I get it. How are you feeling now?\u201d He brushed my hair back behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live. The drug\u2019s worn off.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut what\u2019s next? Water boarding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did they bring you out here?\u201d Rafe sat beside me on the bed again. \u201cWhy the drug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems Brent Westwood\u2019s alive and \u2018Livin\u2019 La Vida Loca\u2019 out here as a new vampire.\u201d I still couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me. I saw you take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he didn\u2019t stay down. Wild, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s now the one thing he hated most.\u201d I studied Rafe\u2019s pale face. He\u2019d lost a lot of blood, and I wondered if I could get him to drink some of mine.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, we were sloppy that night. I should have confirmed that he was dead.\u201d Rafe swayed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well. You had your hands full, taking care of me. You know, you don\u2019t look so good. Lay back, and I\u2019ll tell you the rest.\u201d He didn\u2019t argue, which meant he really was weak. He even closed his eyes while I laid out the facts. Rafe\u2019s bare chest rose and fell, and I wondered if he was asleep. I snagged his discarded shirt and draped it over him. He grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake. Barely. Must have a concussion. Talk to me. Shouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d He opened his dark eyes. \u201cYou going along with Westwood\u2019s plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019d like to see him staked out in the sun to fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that would be cool.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes drifted shut again.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Rafe. Listen. I\u2019m going to pretend to cooperate, or Simon will never let us go.\u201d I jiggled his shoulder. Was he out again? Damn it. I bit open my wrist and pressed it to his mouth. \u201cDrink. Pretend this is from a juicy rare steak.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and reached for me, his hand on the back of my head. \u201cGlory.\u201d At least that got some of my healing blood into his mouth. I saw him swallow, then grimace.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, keep drinking. Damn it, Rafe, I need you healthy. Do it for me.\u201d I pressed my wrist harder against his mouth and laid my head on his chest. His heartbeat was strong and reassuring. I felt him swallow and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right, buddy. Drink Glory\u2019s magic juice. Then you\u2019ll be all better.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered, then his arm tightened around me. With his other hand he shoved my wrist away and rolled me under him. His mouth came down on mine, and he kissed me like he was about to take his last breath. I went with it, savoring his taste, the heat of his mouth and the feel of his hard body. Rafe. I couldn\u2019t bear it if I lost him. The kiss seemed endless and stirred all sorts of feelings deep inside me. Then I heard the scrape of a key in the door lock.</p><p>I shoved him off and jumped to my feet. I\u2019d rip out the throat of whoever thought they were going to beat on Rafe again. Then he was by my side, standing close and in the same defensive posture I\u2019d taken. Fine, we\u2019d kick butt together.</p><p>\u201cChildren, please relax.\u201d Simon and two of his EV muscle-men stood just inside the door. \u201cWhile I admit the preceding scene was quite illuminating, I want to talk now. Unless you make these guards take a rough road instead of an easy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw ... ?\u201d I glanced at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my dear. Have you forgotten that I have every nook and cranny of this compound wired for sound and picture? I wonder what your lover Jeremy Blade would think if I sent him a short clip of you two rolling around on the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jerry knew I was out here, he\u2019d be at the head of the army ready to take you down.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to lower my guard. \u201cOnce a voyeur, always a voyeur. How pathetic is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot pathetic, Gloriana. Useful.\u201d Simon smiled and gestured to his men. \u201cJerry, as you call him, will not be in such a hurry to rescue you if he thinks you\u2019ve been out here with your new lover.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll wonder what\u2019s been going on all those years he had you on his payroll, Valdez.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy you\u2014\u201d Rafe lunged for Simon, but the two guards stepped between them. One of them aimed a weapon and there was a sizzle, then Rafe staggered and went down.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d I ran to where he lay flat on his back, scowling and twitching one foot.</p><p>\u201cTaser.\u201d Rafe growled at the two men. \u201cAssholes, I\u2019d like to see you try to hold me back without that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should they, Mr. Valdez? It\u2019s such a handy tool. Lucky for you I told them to keep it dialed back. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to speak; you\u2019d be in a drooling coma.\u201d Simon chuckled. \u201cYour big tough bodyguard came running to your rescue, Gloriana, but obviously he\u2019s gotten careless since he\u2019s fallen for your voluptuous charms. We caught him before he\u2019d gone a foot inside the compound.\u201d Simon flicked me with a look that made me want to check to see if my breasts were covered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Rafe. He\u2019s playing mind games.\u201d I helped Rafe up. \u201cWhat do you want, Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo finish our earlier conversation. About Westwood. I\u2019ll hold your \u2018friend\u2019 here as a guarantee that you cooperate.\u201d He nodded, and one of the men aimed the Taser at Rafe again.</p><p>\u201cNo! Leave Rafe out of this. I\u2019ll do what you want, just let him go.\u201d I jumped in front of Rafe when he tried to get at Simon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Glory. You know you can\u2019t trust him.\u201d Rafe looked battered, pale and determined.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Rafe. Simon and Westwood need me. And Simon knows he has to hold up his end if he wants me to hold up mine.\u201d I sent Rafe a mental message to trust me. He wasn\u2019t happy, and I could tell he wanted to take another shot at those guards.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Gloriana. If you\u2019ve truly come to your senses, Mr. Valdez will be waiting for you when we\u2019re done, no worse for wear.\u201d Simon gave Rafe a warning look. \u201cBe aware, Valdez, that your actions can endanger Gloriana. She\u2019s right, we need her. So relax and heel like a good dog.\u201d Simon laughed when Rafe lunged and got a jolt from the Taser that sent him to the floor again.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Let\u2019s go.\u201d I didn\u2019t look back at Rafe, just followed Simon out the door. God, I hated this. But with Rafe as a hostage, what choice did I have? We were both going to be out of this evil place before dawn no matter what I had to do.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Another face-to-face with Westwood, who was waiting in Simon\u2019s office. I turned to the EV leader.</p><p>\u201cSimon, I\u2019m never helping this murdering rat bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, pay attention.\u201d Simon pointed to the chair where I\u2019d sat before my chocolate swan dive.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust either of you.\u201d I dropped into the chair. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen up, lady. Simon and I can make your life a living hell. You believe that?\u201d Westwood was obviously in a better mood now, which worried me.</p><p>\u201cSure, Simon\u2019s powerful and has lots of evil tricks up his sleeve.\u201d I smiled at the thought of Westwood getting his energy sucked out while Simon spent his billions. \u201cSlither out from under Simon\u2019s skirts, and I\u2019ll show you how vampires deal with each other. It\u2019ll be fun for you, fledgling.\u201d</p><p>Westwood\u2019s snarl needed work, but he was definitely furious. \u201cI fight with my brain, not my new fangs. I\u2019m a computer genius, and that\u2019s not bragging. It\u2019s how I made my fortune. So I can hack into your records, empty your bank accounts, give you a criminal history, even issue warrants for your arrest in foreign countries. That could be fun for you.\u201d His superior smirk begged to be slapped off of his very forgettable face. Westwood was average in every way\u2014height, build and bland features under close-cropped mouse brown hair. It had made him a dangerous hunter who could blend in with a crowd.</p><p>Simon must have read my mind. \u201cGloriana, focus. I know Westwood\u2019s not your type. You go for big men with short tempers.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I like tough guys, real men who aren\u2019t afraid to stand and fight instead of hiding behind a piece of technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Gloriana.\u201d Simon gripped that letter opener like he wanted to use it on me. \u201cWestwood has his tricks, and you\u2019re right, I have mine. We can make your life a living hell. And then there are your friends. Like Mr. Valdez.\u201d</p><p>I flashed to Rafe\u2019s bloody body. And with Westwood\u2019s hacking skills, even Jerry could become a pauper. So not fair.</p><p>\u201cBlackmail? Getting desperate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I managed a superior look.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Florence is having a wedding soon. It would be a shame to have the festivities ruined by an unfortunate event.\u201d Simon dropped the letter opener, obviously assured he had my full attention now. He steepled his long fingers and tapped them together. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been so looking forward to it. Florence too, of course. Even your friend Israel Caine will be here. How would things play out if you had some uninvited guests?\u201d</p><p>Westwood laughed. \u201cGot you on the ropes now, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He was right. I couldn\u2019t risk my friends or their happiness because I hated this creep. Make a video. Okay, not a big deal. And if I could squeeze some money out of this, so much the better.</p><p>\u201cAh, I think you\u2019re finally getting it, Gloriana.\u201d Simon stood and walked around the desk. \u201cWe have some details to work out. It will be up to you to keep people like your Valdez from interfering as we take care of this. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to.\u201d I hated being backed into a corner. No way was I telling Jerry any of this. He\u2019d want to charge right out here and make sure we had a Westwood body with us when we left. But Simon had an army of EVs and those damned tricks. Jerry wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the plan. You go back to your little life. Communicate to my children that you have a line on proving whether I\u2019m alive or dead. That should keep them off your case while I get things set up.\u201d Westwood leaned back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem. I already told your daughter I might be able to find your remains. Know what? She didn\u2019t even shed a tear. Did a happy dance around my shop \u2019cause that meant she\u2019d get to your cash sooner rather than later.\u201d I smiled when Westwood looked sick. Aw, did I break the big bad man\u2019s heart?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch, Gloriana. Chocolate?\u201d Simon strolled over and dropped one into his mouth. \u201cThe others were just to make sure you stayed around long enough to see reason. And you have, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I see is that I have no choice. Unlike you two social rejects, I do have friends. And I won\u2019t have them bothered on my account. Don\u2019t interfere in Flo\u2019s wedding or hurt any of them, financially or otherwise.\u201d I was over chocolate. Just the smell had my stomach doing jumping jacks into my windpipe.</p> <p>\u201cCooperate and everyone near and dear to you will be fine.\u201d Simon smiled and went for another candy. Sadist. \u201cSure you won\u2019t have one? These are excellent. I may let you have some for your little bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>Bachelorette party. Like I could think about that now. It seemed so normal and impossible.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. Bring out the camera.\u201d I looked from Simon to Westwood. \u201cLet Rafe go as a sign of good faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Gloriana. As I said, we have things to arrange first. But you and your\u201d\u2014Simon winked\u2014\u201cfriend may leave. You understand the consequences if you try to back out of this deal now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Just tell me when and where, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I grabbed the doorknob. To my surprise, it turned beneath my hand. \u201cRelease Rafe and we\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ll have Gregory give you a ride.\u201d Simon walked toward his desk and picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cForget it. We\u2019ll shift and get back on our own. Call and tell them to release Rafe.\u201d I glanced out into a hallway but had no idea exactly where they were keeping him. Simon had led me through two buildings before we\u2019d arrived at his office. \u201cHave him meet me outside.\u201d I could see the glass door to the grounds at the end of the hall. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo demanding.\u201d Simon picked up the phone. \u201cSend the shifter to the front of the temple. Tell him you\u2019re taking him to his girlfriend, but put an extra guard on him, he\u2019ll probably give you trouble. Release him when she gets there.\u201d He hung up and looked at me. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to respond. I hurried to the door and pushed it open. I was in the area in front of the gold-domed temple where the goddess resided. I heard an ominous groan coming from there, and my nerves shredded. When I saw Rafe being half dragged from the opposite side of the clearing, I ran to him. The guards just dropped him at my feet and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWas this necessary?\u201d I snarled at the guards. They didn\u2019t bother to answer. \u201cBastards!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, what the hell happened?\u201d I knelt beside him and touched his forehead. He was bleeding from a new gash.</p> <p>\u201cTaser again. I wanted to know if you were okay and where they were taking me. They didn\u2019t like questions.\u201d Rafe held on to my arm. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re free to go. Can you shift? I can get us a ride, but I thought we could just fly the hell out of here.\u201d I glanced at the stony-faced guards. One of them had a bruised chin and the other the beginning of a black eye. All right, Rafe.</p><p>\u201cI can manage.\u201d He looked at the guards. \u201cLet\u2019s jet.\u201d He visibly pulled himself together. With a groan, he changed into a bird in a blur of motion.</p><p>I did the same and we headed out. Not that I had a clue which way to go, but I figured Rafe had found me out here, he could lead us home.</p><p>I was right. We landed less than a block from the shop and apartment. The flight had been a long one, much longer than I was used to, but Rafe had been watching out for me to make sure I didn\u2019t stray too far from him. We shifted back, and both collapsed on the grass under a tree.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear what you had to do to get us out of there, but home first. It\u2019s late.\u201d Rafe slung his arm around me.</p><p>I leaned against him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been Tasered and kicked around. Can you stand up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so.\u201d He pushed himself up, using the tree for leverage, then put his arm around me again. \u201cYou did great, Glory. Shifting like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. And I\u2019ll tell you everything when I wake up. It is late, and you need to lie down before you fall down.\u201d We walked toward the alley, Rafe limping but surprisingly strong. He was still the bodyguard, scouting out the area first before we got close to the back door of the shop. Luckily Rafe still had his keys. Mine were inside where I\u2019d left them.</p><p>In the back room, I grabbed my purse, then remembered that my cell phone was in my pocket. Three missed calls and a voice mail from Jerry. Later.</p><p>We checked in with Erin, who promised to phone Lacy and let her know I was all right, then headed for the apartment. I opened the door and almost walked into Nadia, who\u2019d just come out of the kitchen with a glass of her favorite synthetic.</p><p>\u201cRafael, where the hell have you been? I needed you there tonight.\u201d She came closer. \u201cWhat happened? You look like you were in a fight and lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, Nadia. I got my licks in.\u201d Rafe headed into the kitchen. \u201cHere, Glory, drink one of Nadia\u2019s power drinks. I figure you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I smiled at a frowning Nadia. \u201cSorry we disappeared on you. It was an emergency. Let Rafe heal, and he\u2019ll be all yours again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Nadia sat on the couch and crossed her long legs. \u201cHe seems to be very . . . attached to you. I bet he got hurt riding to your rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can rescue myself, thanks. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk for myself.\u201d Rafe sat beside Nadia on the couch, an opened package of Twinkies in his hand. He crammed one into his mouth and chewed, closing his eyes for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSo talk. What are you eating?\u201d Nadia hadn\u2019t quit frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s comfort food. Look at me. I was stomped, Tasered and generally beaten like a junkyard dog.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t do dog duty anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Rafael. We had papers that needed signing. Work you should have supervised. And you disappeared for most of the night. What am I to think? Are you serious about this club, or do you want to go back to guarding your lady friend here?\u201d Nadia took a deep drink of her synthetic, and we could see her fangs.</p><p>I twisted the top off a bottle and chugged some myself. God, but I needed that. The drug Simon had given me had worn off, but I was exhausted from all that flying. And the stress!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m into the club thing. This was a loose end. Something I should have handled while I still worked here. I owed it to Glory to follow up.\u201d Rafe bit into another Twinkie, then got up. \u201cI need a beer. Glory, if you\u2019re going for a shower, you\u2019d better hurry. It\u2019s too close to dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right.\u201d I walked over to the hall and stopped at the bathroom door. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Nadia. Rafe\u2019s all yours. I promise I won\u2019t distract him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call.\u201d Rafe stood in the kitchen doorway and took a pull on his beer. \u201cNadia, I have some loyalty here. Deal with it. If that ruins our arrangement, I\u2019ll let you buy me out, or we can just cancel the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I understand loyalty. I prize it.\u201d Nadia drained her glass and set it on the coffee table. \u201cAnd I have good news. Israel Caine\u2019s manager called me. We\u2019re coming to terms.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThanks to Glory. So I forgive you both this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s going to do it?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cFor a very steep price. His manager said he was doing it as a favor to you, Glory. I owe you.\u201d She got up and stretched, a tall and elegant woman all in red this night. Her dark hair gleamed, and her lipstick matched her two-piece outfit perfectly. She was beautiful, and I knew she was on her way to Rafe\u2019s bedroom. They were just friends, and once dawn hit, there\u2019d be no \u201chokeypokey,\u201d but until then . . . ? I couldn\u2019t blame Rafe if he decided to let her ease some of his pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fry up a steak, rare.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cFor some reason I\u2019ve got a craving. I\u2019ll see you ladies when you wake up tonight. And, Nadia?\u201d He put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cI am sorry. I never should have flaked out on you like that without some kind of explanation. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>I left them talking and heard Rafe promise to spend some daylight hours at the club. I grabbed my robe, then shut the bathroom door. I stood under the hot water and scrubbed every inch of my body. If only I could wash away the memory of what had happened at the EV compound. Westwood alive. Ridiculous. And then Rafe\u2019s kiss. Oh, wow. Even wounded, he knew how to make me feel things and forget for a few moments where we\u2019d been. Trapped by Simon. Damn the EV king and his plotting. I\u2019d get him for that if it was the last thing I did.</p><p>When I woke up that evening, I realized I\u2019d never listened to Jerry\u2019s voice mail.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I\u2019ve called you three times. I know you have caller ID, so why aren\u2019t you picking up? We need to talk. I have some ideas about how to handle this jam you\u2019re in. I even came to your shop, but you apparently took off without informing your staff. I thought you were serious about your business, so perhaps you\u2019re merely avoiding me. You must know I intend to help you. Call me. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>Had to love the logic there. Sure, Jerry, it\u2019s all about you. But I wasn\u2019t going to tell him about Westwood. Best case, Jerry would try to take over, and we\u2019d have a vampire war with my friends as casualties. I told myself that he meant well with this protective thing, but the way he issued orders . . . I put that problem on the back burner. Obviously I needed to come up with a story that would satisfy my bossy lover. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>First, I had to make sure the Westwood children had declared a cease fire. I found a phone book, but the Westwoods weren\u2019t listed. A few minutes on the Internet got me what I needed.</p><p>\u201cWestwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid Westwood?\u201d I really hated that last name.</p> <p>\u201cYes, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory St. Clair. I want to talk to you about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, my lawyers have advised me not to contact you.\u201d He sounded sullen and not a bit happy.</p><p>\u201cI contacted you. To try to clear up this crazy misunderstanding.\u201d I gathered my thoughts. \u201cHave you talked to your sister since she visited my shop yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hate to say it, but my dad was obviously nuts toward the end. Have you seen that Web site he put up? Must be early Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the will that demanded you stalk a supposed vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lawyers are all over it. Dad was even leaving money to this stupid vampire-hunting organization he started. Ridiculous. Vivi and I agree on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I had to like the idea of Westwood arriving home and his kids throwing him straight into an asylum.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you can relax. Vivi and I aren\u2019t going vamp hunting again. Guess we went a little nuts ourselves. Should have checked with the lawyers sooner. Sorry if we scared you.\u201d</p><p>An apology. Did I smell a potential lawsuit? Oh, if only I were a simple mortal with a grudge. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cYour sister traumatized me with that crossbow, you know. And then you showed up with an army at my back door. Scared away my customers.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI should probably get my own lawyer, press some charges.\u201d More sniffs. This was fun.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Ms. St. Clair. Feel our pain. We\u2019ve just lost our father. And to make matters worse, we don\u2019t have a body to bury.\u201d David sighed. \u201cIt\u2019ll take years to settle this thing and have Dad declared legally dead. Even if you won a lawsuit, you wouldn\u2019t be able to collect anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTied up? That\u2019s tough. I\u2019m sure you and your sister don\u2019t deserve to wait for your rightful inheritance.\u201d I oozed concern.</p><p>\u201cExactly! I\u2019m glad you understand. You see, one of Dad\u2019s bodyguards swears you were with my father that last night. I even saw a video, though it was pretty poor quality. It looked like you and Dad facing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the woods that night, near the lake and with some friends. We were camping out, partying if you know what I mean. Is that where he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buds and I used to do that when I was in college.\u201d David chuckled. \u201cSmoked some weed. Whatever. And Dad? The bodyguards said he was chasing some vampire. Claimed it was you. Not sure of the exact location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019re really convincing me he was crazy. I mean, you\u2019ve seen me. I run a business. I don\u2019t have fangs. Come on, David, do you really think I\u2019m a vampire?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It sounds really insane, doesn\u2019t it? But that video ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019ve got, but you said it was at night, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. And on a cell phone. Quality was the pits. Can\u2019t see much. But it sure looks like Dad and a woman and his stupid crossbow. The guards swear it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you should do a background check on those dudes. See what they might have been smoking, you know?\u201d I sighed. \u201cAll I know is I did meet him once. He came into my shop and claimed I was one of those demon vampires. \u2019Cause of the name of the place, I guess. Scared me to death waving around a stake of all things. You need someone to testify he was nuts, I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d David sighed again. \u201cBut where the hell are his remains?\u201d</p><p>Gee, get all choked up about your dead father, why don\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cLike I told your sister, I\u2019ll try to help you with that. Maybe he followed me out there that night. I told you he thought I was a vampire. Maybe some of my friends who were with me saw something. If you offered a reward ...\u201d Did David know Austin had had one of the worst storms in its history that night? Perfect for a camping trip. But then his dear old dad had been hunting in that torrential rain too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Pass the word. Big bucks for absolute proof Dad\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d I heard a knock on my door. Nadia was in the bathroom, and Rafe had been gone when I got up. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to help you. For the reward, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I do apologize. For before. Vivi and I both went a little nuts at first.\u201d David actually laughed. \u201cBillions will do that to ya. But we\u2019re on the same page now. Fifty-fifty split. All we need is a body, and we\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>I felt a chill. Papa Westwood was a first-class creep, but his children were colder than . . . Not my problem. \u201cOkay, then. If I find out anything, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. If we don\u2019t come up with a body though, enough reliable witnesses who can testify they saw him die might do the trick. Would you be willing to say you saw Dad take his last breath?\u201d</p><p>Another, stronger knock, a sniff, and I knew it was Jerry outside.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that wouldn\u2019t be true, David. Please accept my sympathy for your loss.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist that parting shot as I slammed the phone shut and ran to the door.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I could hear you on the phone. Were you talking to young Westwood?\u201d Jerry dropped a kiss on my mouth, then strode inside, full of purpose and obviously ready to take charge.</p><p>\u201cYes, I told him we were working on finding his father\u2019s body. He\u2019s through vampire hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Jerry smiled and pulled me into his arms. \u201cI was worried about you. Where the hell were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Rafe and I went out to the woods where I shot Westwood and tried to find the body. No luck and no signal on my cell phone.\u201d I kept my mind blocked from Jerry\u2019s probing.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me to go with you. The shifter has his own life now, as you\u2019ve reminded me. I guess he was good protection, though. At least you didn\u2019t go out there alone.\u201d Jerry looked down and saw the bottle of Nadia\u2019s good stuff I\u2019d started on. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew brew. Rafe\u2019s new business partner Nadia Komisky is staying here. She bought it.\u201d I decided to let Jerry\u2019s attitude go. Protect me? Hell, who\u2019d arranged for Rafe and me to leave the EV compound? I was practically Superwoman. I picked up the bottle and offered it to him. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I fed on the way here.\u201d Jerry still drank from mortals and knew I disapproved. No doubt he\u2019d whammied some poor sap who\u2019d gone too close to an alley, taken just enough to quench his thirst, then wiped the donor\u2019s memory and sent him on his way.</p><p>\u201cYou can search those woods if you want to. I promised Nadia I\u2019d leave Rafe out of this from now on. He\u2019s got enough to do with their new club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d Nadia walked into the room, this night elegant in a long silver top and black leggings. Her hair was pulled back from her face, highlighting her cheekbones. I\u2019d seen my cheekbones once, for about five minutes. I loved that top but figured it wouldn\u2019t look half as cute in extra large.</p><p>\u201cNadia, Jeremy Blade. Jerry, this is Nadia, Rafe\u2019s partner.\u201d I finished introductions, then watched Jerry\u2019s reaction. His smile was genuine as he took her hand and bowed over it like he was meeting the queen. Damn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure. We\u2019ve met before. In Kiev. It\u2019s been a century or more, and the country was in turmoil so you may not remember. I was Jeremiah Campbell then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s coming back to me now. I rarely forget a handsome man. What a small world this is.\u201d Nadia clasped his hands and kissed both his cheeks. Didn\u2019t mean a thing; it was a European greeting. I swallowed a jealous growl and stepped between them to break up the action.</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s going to sing at their club opening.\u201d I figured mentioning a man Jerry had been insanely jealous of would get his attention back on me.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Israel Caine agreed to do Valdez a favor?\u201d Jerry raised an eyebrow. \u201cOr was it a personal favor for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of both.\u201d I smiled at Nadia. \u201cHe\u2019s charging them a paw and a tail for the performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it. With a headliner like that opening our club, it\u2019ll be an instant success.\u201d Nadia slinked toward the door, slipped her long, narrow feet into silver ballet flats, then picked up a black leather handbag large enough to hold a laptop. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. So much to do before then. Nice to see you again, Jeremiah. You must come to our opening.\u201d She nodded to me. \u201cBoth of you. I\u2019ll save you a special table. Glory has been kind enough to let me stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I think Rafe\u2019s lined up a house for you. Maybe tonight. You\u2019ll be so much more comfortable there than bunking with Rafe.\u201d I said this with a smile. Jerry tried to be discreet, but I saw the way he studied her body. We\u2019d been monogamous for a while now. Maybe that was hard for him. I had my own problems with monogamy. Why hadn\u2019t it occurred to me that Jerry did too?</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been imposing.\u201d Nadia opened the hall door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . . You\u2019re welcome to stay as long as you want. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Glory, but you\u2019re right.\u201d She gave my tiny living room a quick glance that said it all. \u201cI need more space. I\u2019ll let you know what my plans are. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine meeting her again after all these years.\u201d Jerry sat on the couch. \u201cShe\u2019s Rafe\u2019s partner? And sleeping with him. Bet that\u2019s an interesting story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe uses his bed during the day. They\u2019re just friends.\u201d I needed to shut up on that subject before Jerry thought I was a little too concerned about Rafe\u2019s love life. \u201cDon\u2019t know how they met. But Rafe used to work for her.\u201d I didn\u2019t share the dance thing. Jerry would deride that. Let him assume Rafe had done the bodyguard gig for her too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s wealthy and smart. She owned several really nice vampire clubs in Kiev.\u201d Jerry pulled me down beside him. \u201cYou going to tell me what you have going on tonight, or are you going to disappear again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Flo, work on wedding plans. I am her maid of honor, you know.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Richard\u2019s best man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pulled me into his lap. \u201cYou want to make it a double ceremony? Finally tie the knot?\u201d He slid his hand up to cup my breast while he breathed against my throat with just a hint of fang.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, Flo would die if anyone tried to horn in on her big night. And, second, Jerry ...\u201d His mouth settled over mine. His kiss was familiar, comfortable and still exciting. Sort of. I was in big trouble. I grabbed his hair and leaned in, rubbing my hand over his hard thigh. Of course I loved kissing him. We had this thing. I reared back, breathing hard. What the hell was the matter with me? I couldn\u2019t stop thinking, analyzing . . .</p><p>\u201cGlory? You okay?\u201d Jerry slid me down to lie on top of me on the couch. \u201cWhat freaked you out just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, I have a lot to do, Jerry. A lot on my mind.\u201d I gently shoved him off of me. Oh, my God. Had Jerry picked up on my thoughts? I smiled at him, reassured by his concern. He wasn\u2019t blocking his thoughts, and they were all about a manager robbing him blind. \u201cRain check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I have work too. That mess in Florida is getting worse. If I thought you were really all right, I\u2019d fly out there.\u201d Jerry sat up and pulled down my sweater.</p><p>\u201cYou should go. I\u2019m fine. The Westwoods and I have called a truce. They\u2019re having the crazy will thrown out and agree their dad was a few bottles short of a six-pack with the whole vampire-hunting thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Jerry stood and pulled me to my feet. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll head out for a few days. Back in plenty of time for the wedding preparations. I\u2019ve got a company out there ...\u201d</p><p>Jerry went on about his labor problems, but I wasn\u2019t really listening. He was here now. I should be crawling all over him to send him off with hot memories. Instead, I couldn\u2019t walk him to the door fast enough. The giant secret I was keeping from him\u2014that was my problem. This guilt was all about the Westwood video deal, nothing more. Right?</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cI can see why you sent Blade off on a business trip. He\u2019d never allow you to deal with Westwood like this.\u201d Rafe had come in a few minutes after Jerry left and made me tell all. To say he thought the whole thing was nuts was an understatement.</p><p>\u201cJerry doesn\u2019t get to allow or not allow me to do anything, thank you very much. Neither do you. I hate dealing with both Simon and Westwood, but what choice do I have? You\u2019d still be locked in a cell being Tasered every time the guards wanted their jollies if I hadn\u2019t agreed.\u201d</p><p>Rafe paced the perimeter of the living room, not a bit happy with me. \u201cI can take care of myself, was already working on an escape plan.\u201d He finally sat across from me and zeroed in with dark eyes that saw way too much. \u201cI\u2019m free now so you can forget it. Or can you? Why are you going along with this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck. Westwood can give us hell with a computer\u2014clean out bank accounts, you name it. And then there\u2019s Simon. You know how he is.\u201d I didn\u2019t back down, matching him stare for stare.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s Simon got up his sleeve this time?\u201d Rafe stalked into the kitchen. He came out with a bag of Cheetos and ripped it open. Let the torture begin.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to eat those in front of me?\u201d I sniffed and got a jolt of salt and deep-fried cheese that made my eyes water. God, I loved stuff like that. Damned liquid diet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. And I\u2019m waiting for some answers. Spill. What\u2019s Simon threatening you with now? His energy-sucking goddess again? Don\u2019t listen to him. You\u2019ve been shape-shifting your ass off lately, so you\u2019re not nearly the energy fat cat you used to be.\u201d Rafe examined an extra-large cheese puff, then popped it into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use the \u2018f\u2019 word when you refer to me or my ass, damn it.\u201d I stomped into the kitchen. \u201cYou keep crunching in front of me, and I\u2019m going to rip out your throat.\u201d I grabbed a bottle of Nadia\u2019s premium synthetic. It wasn\u2019t close to the same, but at least I wouldn\u2019t hear my stomach growl again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d He blocked me when I turned to go back, and pointed to his neck with a grin. \u201cHelp yourself, Blondie. Just be gentle. And I expect a nice thank-you kiss afterward.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him out of my way. \u201cGet serious, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Quit evading and tell me why you\u2019re doing Simon\u2019s bidding.\u201d No smile now. Too bad.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, here it is. He\u2019ll ruin Flo\u2019s wedding if I don\u2019t go along with this. He\u2019s got his eyes on Westwood\u2019s fortune. With billions on the line, he\u2019ll do whatever he has to, and he doesn\u2019t care how many local vampires he alienates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard. He\u2019d be happy to disrupt a big shindig like that to make a point.\u201d Rafe finally closed the bag and set it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou see why I have to cooperate?\u201d I swallowed some synthetic.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s this video going down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going on business as usual and getting this bachelorette party organized. Acting like there\u2019s nothing in the wind.\u201d This wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Flo knew me too well.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s going to let you know when the video is happening, and you\u2019re to drop everything and show up for it.\u201d Rafe stopped next to me. \u201cIt won\u2019t end there, Glory. You\u2019ll probably have to back up Westwood\u2019s story, verify everything. He\u2019s got a lot to explain away\u2014like his lifestyle before he \u2018died.\u2019 Fake video, phony vamp hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they promised to pay me for my part in this. Westwood\u2019s son is offering a reward too, in case I come up with a body.\u201d I frowned. \u201cIf Simon wasn\u2019t involved, I\u2019d be happy to take another shot at that bastard and deliver his body personally.\u201d</p><p>Rafe put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming if you think you won\u2019t get screwed over in this deal. No good ever came from working with an EV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? That\u2019s why I\u2019m so freaked out.\u201d I put my hand over his and squeezed, comforted instantly.</p><p>We both froze when we heard a knock on the door. Bad news that neither of us had sensed someone coming up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I hear you in there. Open up.\u201d Flo was here. Let the acting begin. I got up and unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cIs the bachelorette party all set?\u201d Flo had Richard with her, and he was weighted down with packages. \u201cPut them on the kitchen table, amante. I want to show Glory what I bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ironing out the details now.\u201d I pasted on a smile. \u201cHave you tried Damian\u2019s synthetics with a buzz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfetto.\u201d Flo was all smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he donates several cases of his very best for the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, Glory, hope you\u2019re not sick of this wedding already.\u201d Richard dropped the bulging sacks on the table. \u201cIt can\u2019t get here soon enough for me. You\u2019d think we were planning a coronation instead of simply renewing our vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Is that the love of my life talking? The man who finally captured my heart?\u201d Flo put her hands on her hips. \u201cWe can call it off. Just because there are dozens of our friends flying in from all over the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, darling.\u201d Richard put his arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. I just like to see you fired up. You\u2019re so sexy when you\u2019re mad.\u201d Richard grinned at Rafe. \u201cYou ever tie the knot, run off somewhere with strangers as witnesses. No muss, no fuss. Which is what I thought I\u2019d managed when we eloped. But no, my dearest has to do it again in high style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo does everything with style.\u201d Rafe was smiling, but there was something wrong, and it wasn\u2019t just the secret we were keeping. I actually didn\u2019t know a thing about his background. Whether he\u2019d ever \u201ctied the knot\u201d or even his age. He had awesome powers too. More than you\u2019d expect from a shape-shifter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be wonderful, you\u2019ll see.\u201d Flo turned to me. \u201cIs Israel Caine going to sing for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Ray said he\u2019d be happy to do it for you, Flo. A personal favor.\u201d I peeked into the sacks. I couldn\u2019t solve the riddle of Rafe\u2019s background now, and I had to keep Flo out of my thoughts. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? A new nightgown? Flo, you should have waited to see what gifts you get at Aggie\u2019s shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. A sale, Glory. I bought one for you too. As a little thank-you for all you\u2019re doing for me.\u201d She hugged me, then pulled a sheer piece of silk and lace from the bag. \u201cLook, it\u2019s your color and your size.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to say that it was twice as big as the one she\u2019d gotten for herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I held the turquoise silk up to my chin. \u201cMy color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to notice the color when you\u2019ve got something like that on?\u201d Rafe grinned and grabbed the edge of it. \u201cI can almost see straight through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Flo looked from Rafe to me. \u201cGlory will look very sexy, s\u00ec? And it does bring out the blue in your eyes, my friend. I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, darling. You got Israel Caine to sing at the wedding?\u201d Richard grinned. \u201cHow\u2019d you manage that, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. He loves Flo and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do anything Glory asks. He\u2019s even singing at my club for the opening.\u201d Rafe dropped the gown and put his arm around me. \u201cThanks to our girl here, the place\u2019ll be a guaranteed hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll do anything I ask. He was going to be in town anyway.\u201d I glanced at my watch and eased away from Rafe. Flo was pro-Jerry, and she looked like she was ready to step between us if she had to break Rafe\u2019s arm to do it. \u201cI hate to interrupt this, but I\u2019ve got to get down to the shop. None of my clerks could work the late shift tonight so it\u2019s on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should hire more staff.\u201d Flo pulled out a skirt and a sweater. \u201cLook at what else I got. For the honeymoon. Richard won\u2019t tell me where we are going this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only our sixth\u2014or is it tenth?\u2014one.\u201d The usually reserved Richard couldn\u2019t stop grinning. \u201cI\u2019m not counting, just happy to belong to this woman.\u201d He shoved Flo\u2019s finds into the bag and picked up everything. \u201cCome on, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, you can always come help out again.\u201d I hid a grin. Flo had subbed for me right before I got back from L.A. The store would never be the same. She wouldn\u2019t wait on \u201cfrumps\u201d and had declared some of my vintage finds \u201ctacky\u201d and \u201ctoo old\u201d to sell. She\u2019d rearranged shelves, stuffing rejects in the back room. I still couldn\u2019t find all my merchandise, and was afraid some of it had ended up in the Dumpster in the alley.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks. So many people have no taste, and would they listen to my advice? No.\u201d She laid my new nightgown on the table. \u201cHere is your gown, Glory. Enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I touched the fine lace and imagined how it would look against bare skin. I glanced up to see Rafe staring at me. Hmm. I had a feeling he was picturing the same thing. I smiled. \u201cThanks, Flo. It\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it to good use.\u201d She sniffed at Rafe. \u201cWith Jeremiah. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff to Florida. A business crisis. But he\u2019ll be back in time for the wedding.\u201d I walked Flo and Richard to the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better. I figure he owes me a bachelor party, since Florence is getting hers.\u201d Richard opened the door. \u201cI imagine a naked mortal woman in my favorite blood type served to me on a platter would be about right. Or at the very least a poker night and some of Damian\u2019s potent brews.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoker, definitely. No naked women for you, amante. And you come home sloppy drunk, and it\u2019s the couch for you, I tell you.\u201d Flo scolded him all the way down the stairs and out of sight.</p><p>\u201cYou did great. She has no idea her dream wedding depends on you dancing to Simon\u2019s tune.\u201d Rafe picked up the nightgown. \u201cYou sure you have to hurry down to the shop? Maybe you should try this on, see if it fits.\u201d</p><p>I snatched it out of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll fit, and you\u2019ll never see me in it, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t count on that.\u201d Rafe grinned and followed me to my bedroom where I carefully put the gown away. \u201cI think I\u2019m making headway in taking our relationship to the next level. You were really upset when those guys Tasered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d seen yourself when they did it, you\u2019d have been freaked out too. You looked like you were break dancing without music.\u201d I sighed and shut the drawer. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend, I care about you. But nightgowns like this one ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre meant for only one thing.\u201d Rafe moved closer until I was against the dresser. \u201cYou kissed me back out there, Glory. I didn\u2019t imagine that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny response on my part was involuntary. I was an emotional wreck, and you had a concussion. I felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bump on the head. And you\u2019re never an emotional wreck.\u201d He leaned in, his body hard and hot against mine.</p><p>\u201cHah! I should record you saying that. And Simon\u2019s chocolates were drugged. I was under the influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more excuses you trot out, I figure the more I got to you.\u201d He pushed his hand into my hair and massaged the tight muscles at the back of my neck. It felt so good I wanted to moan and weep with relief. It had been a hellish roller-coaster ride of a twenty-four hours. But encouraging Rafe wasn\u2019t fair to him or to me. Though I was having trouble pulling together the exact reason why with his hands working their magic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, uh, don\u2019t make too much out of it, Rafe,\u201d I said to the N-V on his chest. Another logo T-shirt, this one red with black letters. Envy. Maybe I did envy Flo her excitement and her big wedding. Not to mention all those honeymoons. To be so crazy in love . . . How long had it been since I\u2019d felt so completely lost in a man\u2019s arms, wild for his touch. Oh, wait a minute, that happened every time I was with Blade. Right? Or did it? The Vampire Viagra had helped. But without it?</p><p>\u201cIt was just one kiss.\u201d I stiffened when Rafe pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you need another, for comparison. To see if the response is still there. What if it wasn\u2019t just the circumstances? What if there\u2019s more to this? Is that such a bad thing? I\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I want you.\u201d He rubbed my back in a slow circular motion that was erotic and yet comforting at the same time.</p><p>Yeah, he wanted me. I could feel how much below his belt buckle pressed hard against me. I laid my hands on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this now, Rafe. I\u2019ve got to go. Seriously. And what you\u2019re suggesting could take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d Rafe grinned, his dimples punctuating his relief as he released me and stepped back. \u201cGo. But we\u2019re definitely getting back to this later.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother responding to that. I\u2019d left the door open, which was wrong, wrong, wrong. I should just shut Rafe down. Instead I grabbed my purse and left without another word. Down in the shop, I took over from Erin and settled in for the night. We weren\u2019t very busy, and I had way too much time to think. I\u2019d just about talked myself down from my EV freak-out and fantasies about Rafe when Aggie walked in. Did she think I\u2019d be glad to see her? I met her near the door, ready to go to war.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d How\u2019s that for customer service?</p><p>\u201cI thought we should discuss Flo\u2019s shower since you\u2019re the expert on all things bridal.\u201d She eased around me and began to flip through my cocktail-dress rack.</p><p>\u201cLast time I saw you, you were happy to turn me into a freakin\u2019 statue. I won\u2019t forget that any time soon.\u201d I wanted to snatch the sea green dress she was holding out of her hand. Damn it, she acted like nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I admit it. Greg had convinced me I\u2019d be doing him a favor, and he\u2019d, well\u201d\u2014she smiled and winked\u2014\u201che\u2019d do some favors for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he left you here. Why didn\u2019t you just thaw me out then and leave him in the lurch? Make him a statue?\u201d I glanced at the price tag on the dress she was holding. Good profit potential. I\u2019d like to toss her butt out of here, except if she was going to buy something . . . Damn, I hated that my finances didn\u2019t allow me the luxury of alienating a paying customer. Westwood\u2019s cash payoff couldn\u2019t come fast enough.</p><p>\u201cI sent your buddy Rafe out there to save you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She held up the dress and looked at herself in the full-length mirror next to the dressing rooms. Yeah, she has a reflection. Me, not a glimmer. It\u2019s a vampire thing.</p><p>\u201cYou sent him out to be beaten and tortured.\u201d I itched to claw the smile off her face. \u201cYou buying that dress or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry if Rafe\u2019s visit didn\u2019t go well, but that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d She swept her eyes, the same color as the dress, over me. \u201cYou look like you survived okay. Greg said they just wanted to talk to you, so why shouldn\u2019t I help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, no thanks to you or Greg. But believing anything Greg says isn\u2019t smart. Haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\u201d Had to stay on track here. As far as Aggie knew, I had just gone out there to talk. Greg wouldn\u2019t have told her any EV plans. She\u2019d blab to Flo if she thought she had a juicy tidbit.</p><p>\u201cSure. Now I have. But, unless your shifter suffered permanent damage, I\u2019d say you need to relax and cooperate with me. We\u2019re both supposed to help Flo have the wedding of her dreams. Am I right?\u201d Aggie didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just stepped into the dressing room. \u201cI\u2019m trying this on. Tell me what I need to do at a shower besides invite people and feed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve been to a wedding shower?\u201d I heard the rustle of her clothes behind the curtain. \u201cAll I know is what I\u2019ve seen on TV and in movies. I think they play games. Oh, and wrap the bride in toilet paper. I have no idea why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking Flo into a Charmin mummy sounds like fun but I doubt she\u2019d stand for it. Might not be a good look for her.\u201d Aggie threw back the curtain. \u201cFits perfectly. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I thought that I\u2019d kill to have her kind of figure. The vintage sixties shift could have been made for her. It was a size five, six max. The color did amazing things for her skin and eyes, and the hem hit her mid thigh. She had great legs that seemed to go on forever. Panting men would follow her anywhere in that dress. The short length would even allow for her fish tail if the Storm God got mad at her again. That thought made me smile. I\u2019d like to see Aggie stuck on a rock singing for her supper again like a Siren should.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Where are you going to wear it?\u201d I swallowed my snark for the sake of a sale.</p><p>\u201cThe bachelorette party. We should dress up, right?\u201d Aggie bit her lip. \u201cYou said it\u2019s at Rafe\u2019s nightclub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, dress up.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe I was having a civil conversation with her. But she was more powerful than I could ever hope to be. I didn\u2019t want to end up a statue again.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of games should I get for this shower? I\u2019m not usually into them myself. Though I played strip Scrabble once.\u201d She stepped back into the dressing room and shut the curtain. \u201cI\u2019m really good with words, but I lost on purpose. The guy I played with was unbelievably hot, but he didn\u2019t like to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo word games. Flo\u2019s English isn\u2019t so great. Do some research. Search the Web for bridal-shower games. See what comes up. You do have a computer, don\u2019t you?\u201d I took the dress she handed out to me. I realized I had no idea where Aggie lived or how she lived. As far as I knew, she still called a cave in the middle of Lake Travis home. But she dressed well and seemed to have plenty of money. Siren magic. I really didn\u2019t care as long as she didn\u2019t give me a rubber check for this dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. Maybe I\u2019ll see Greg again. He has a computer.\u201d She stuck her head out. \u201cI told you he has his uses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Just don\u2019t plan to bring him to the wedding as your date. Flo won\u2019t want any EVs there. Now I\u2019ll write up this sale. Come out when you\u2019re dressed.\u201d I headed to the cash register. In a few moments, Aggie came out and stopped in front of the mirror again. She fluffed her hair and pulled a lipstick out of her purse, retracing her pink lips. Finally, she walked over to watch me fill out the sales slip.</p><p>\u201cYou know you could tell me what they wanted out at the EV headquarters.\u201d She leaned on the counter. \u201cI can keep a secret.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right. Forget it. It was my personal business, none of yours.\u201d I clipped the tag off the dress.</p><p>\u201cBe that way.\u201d She made a face. \u201cAt least tell me what the place looks like. Greg raved about it. That\u2019s why I was so mad when he didn\u2019t take me along.\u201d Aggie handed me a credit card. The name on it was A. Sirena. Hmm. It went through without a hitch, so I was happy to answer her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and scary as hell. Imagine a gilded mosque with an energy-hungry goddess inside, in the middle of a pine forest. If you were with Greg, you\u2019d be safe, but the king out there, Simon Destiny, and I don\u2019t exactly love each other. I\u2019ve tried to kill him; he\u2019s tried to kill various friends of mine. His goddess acts like a giant Shop-Vac, sucking energy out of paranormals. I used to be loaded with energy, so I had a near miss out there. I avoid it like plastic flowers on flip-flops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. That\u2019s why the statue thing was necessary. And the EV leader did snap you out of my freeze. Impressive.\u201d Aggie signed the credit slip without even checking the total.</p><p>\u201cSure, if you like weasels. Be careful around EVs, Aggie. Ask your boss about them. He\u2019d probably tell you to steer clear.\u201d I figured I\u2019d done my good deed for the night. Now I was ready for her to leave. I stuck the dress on a hanger and slipped a plastic bag over it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell the Storm God squat about my love life. He\u2019d try to interfere, and I\u2019ve definitely decided to give Greg another go. He is amazing in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI, Aggie.\u201d I held up a hand. \u201cI really don\u2019t want details of your love life either.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and took her purchase. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t remember your time with Greg. He said he wiped your memory because you were too clingy. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered by your whining when he broke up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose to believe that liar, go ahead. I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t remember being with him, obviously a low point in my life. But when a guy and I decide to part ways, I don\u2019t cling or whine.\u201d Apparently Greg and I had been together in New York City. I\u2019d had other vampire friends there too. I\u2019d tried my luck on Broadway but soon realized matinees ruined my chances of actually being in a show, and I\u2019d ended up working as a waitress. I could remember all of that, but not a speck of my time as a couple with Greg Kaplan. The blank spot made me insane.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got right now. Maybe at the wedding I\u2019ll have better luck. I always wanted to hook up with Israel Caine. You know how I love his music.\u201d Aggie stuffed her charge card and receipt into her purse.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kill him, Aggie. I doubt he\u2019ll be happy to see you again.\u201d When would she leave? A new customer entered the shop, so I figured that was her cue to take a hike. I was right.</p> <p>\u201cYou never know, Glory. You and I seem to have patched things up.\u201d With that, she sashayed to the door like she owned the place. I just stared at her, my mouth open. Patched things up? Not even close. She stopped next to the new customer, looked her up and down, then glanced back at me. She mouthed a word, then hit the door and was gone.</p><p>I reached for the stake I kept behind the counter. A vamp can\u2019t be too careful when she\u2019s alone at night. And Aggie had said a word I didn\u2019t hear too often. \u201cDemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d I kept the stake out of sight, not sure it would do much good anyway. Some demons were susceptible to them, just like vampires; others laughed when plugged. I wished I had something else, like holy water or a Bible. But then they didn\u2019t always work either. Instead, I threw out a mind probe. Nada. Not surprising. Demons aren\u2019t into sharing their thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Glory St. Clair, and obviously I\u2019ve found her.\u201d The woman smiled and showed off a pair of fangs. She was posing as vampire. Didn\u2019t fool me. I knew a demon when I smelled one. The evil has a sweet odor like baking donuts. It would make you hungry if you didn\u2019t know it came straight from hell.</p><p>Of course she was beautiful; demons usually are when they\u2019re in public. This one had long dark hair and amethyst eyes with long lashes against pale perfect skin. She was about Flo\u2019s size, short with the same tiny waist and size-six figure. She wore an expensive designer outfit in a deep purple silk that set off those exotic eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Glory. How can I help you?\u201d I kept the counter between us. I\u2019m a churchgoing Christian and try not to consort with demons as a matter of principle. Not to say that I haven\u2019t hit a few low spots in my long, long life and been tempted to make deals with the Devil. A girl\u2019s got to do what a girl\u2019s got to do to survive. Am I right? But I\u2019d squeaked by without resorting to that. So I was fairly calm. Unless someone had put a contract out on me . . .</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m not here to take you out. I\u2019m here to find someone.\u201d She smiled, and the fangs were gone. \u201cObviously you\u2019ve figured out what I am, so I won\u2019t try to play games here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that you\u2019re from the dark side. So what\u2019s your business, and who are you looking for?\u201d Now I was worried. Someone close to me. Who could she possibly want and why?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Rafael. I believe he\u2019s using the name Valdez this century.\u201d She\u2019d quit smiling and was suddenly on my side of the counter. \u201cI know he\u2019s been near you. I can smell him.\u201d She sniffed my blouse. \u201cHe\u2019s been touching you.\u201d</p><p>I almost jumped over the counter to get away from her. Almost, because she\u2019d hooked me with a silver-painted fingernail, and I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. It wasn\u2019t brute force; it was more like an electrical current that jammed my feet to the floor. Similar to Aggie\u2019s statue trick except I could talk and blink and move my arms. She looked up, her eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he been touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my bodyguard. Sometimes he has to get close. What\u2019s it to you?\u201d I tried to shove her away. Nope. I didn\u2019t like where this was going. Powerful entity and demon. I knew nothing about Rafe\u2019s history. Maybe he\u2019d made a pact with the Devil, and this thing had come to collect a debt. I tried to wrench free and couldn\u2019t make headway. Rafe was strong and clever, but against this? I was afraid he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Could I get a message to him to run like hell?</p><p>\u201cBodyguard. That\u2019s okay, then.\u201d She removed her claw and gave me an inch of space. \u201cSo you have a business relationship.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to correct her. I mean, it was true. Somehow I didn\u2019t think she needed to know that Rafe was also my best friend. I sent out a mental message to him to meet me upstairs if he could hear me, then realized this creature had been reading my every thought since she\u2019d stepped through the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with Rafael?\u201d</p><p>The demon smiled and her eyes glowed red. \u201cI\u2019m his wife.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cYou and Rafael are married?\u201d I jumped over the counter then. I needed some air not tainted with a sugar rush.</p><p>\u201cYep. And this is our anniversary. Bet that bad boy forgot again. I try to check in every decade or so.\u201d She sighed and made a move that put her in front of the same mirror Aggie had preened at moments before. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so difficult to pin down. It\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t a love match.\u201d She smiled, then pulled a brush from a leather shoulder bag and proceeded to fuss with her hair.</p><p>Rafe and a demon, even a beautiful one. I didn\u2019t get it. I mean, Rafe is good. Honest. I knew him. Had spent five years close to him, as close as two creatures could get, and had never seen a hint of a dark side. Well, unless he was in fighting mode. All warriors dredged up a little hell then, even Jerry. That didn\u2019t make either of them evil, just tough. For the guy to have hooked up with this, this thing . . . Well, it just didn\u2019t compute.</p><p>\u201cCompute this, Glory.\u201d She\u2019d stowed her brush, too close to me again. \u201cWe have an open arrangement. If you and Rafael are doing the dirty, it\u2019s not going to get you staked. But I\u2019m not a \u2018thing.\u2019 I\u2019m a third-level demon, one of Lucifer\u2019s favorites.\u201d Her eyes were back to that incredible violet.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Rafe and I are just friends.\u201d I backed toward the door and flipped the sign to Closed. I didn\u2019t want a customer walking in on this. Should I run? I didn\u2019t think it would do me much good. And right now she honestly seemed to mean me no harm.</p><p>Get a clue, Glory. Demons don\u2019t honestly do anything.</p><p>\u201cJust friends? Too bad.\u201d She grinned wickedly. \u201cYou gay or something? The man can bring it, girlfriend. But then if you don\u2019t roll that way ...\u201d She was suddenly mere inches from me and touched my shoulder. \u201cI can bring it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I mean, you\u2019re beautiful, but I\u2019ve got a guy. I\u2019m in a committed relationship. Rafe was just my bodyguard. That\u2019s all.\u201d I was pressed against the shop door and felt it hit me hard between my shoulder blades when someone shoved at it.</p><p>\u201cLet me in, Glory.\u201d Rafe was here.</p><p>I moved away, relieved and yet worried sick about what would happen next. Demons lied all the time. Maybe this creature wasn\u2019t his wife but a hired gun here to take him out. Stuff like that happened. I spied a nineteenth-century prayer book and a rosary on a shelf of collectibles and used a vamp move to snatch them. Maybe they\u2019d work in a showdown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The look on Rafe\u2019s face assured me this wasn\u2019t some demon for hire but someone he knew well and wasn\u2019t happy to see. I stayed out of their way and waited with my weapons. I wanted to bawl. What else hadn\u2019t Rafe told me? Of course I had plenty of secrets myself. Enough already. Concentrate.</p><p>\u201cAlesa. What the hell are you doing here?\u201d Rafe\u2019s greeting didn\u2019t exactly say loving husband. He radiated fury from his tight jaw to his fists hitting his thighs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our anniversary, Rafael. How could I ignore it?\u201d She smiled, her eyes red again. Really creepy. Rafe stepped closer.</p> <p>\u201cEasy. You go back where you came from and do your thing. I do mine. That was the agreement.\u201d Rafe glanced at me and shook his head. Shorthand for \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d? Not nearly good enough.</p><p>\u201cThe agreement sucks. I want a child, and you\u2019re going to give me one. You owe me that after what you put me through. Your rejection made me a laughingstock where I come from. I need to gain back my pride. I\u2019m not leaving until you give me what I want.\u201d Her eyes were really heating up the place, and I looked away before my eyeballs got singed.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I don\u2019t owe you a damned thing.\u201d Rafe stepped to within inches of her. God, but the man had stones. I wanted to escape out the back door and leave them to hammer out their own domestic details. But what if Rafe needed me? I shivered but gripped the soft leather prayer book in one hand and the cross dangling from the rosary in the other.</p><p>\u201cPlease, darling.\u201d She dragged a silver nail down his cheek, drawing blood. He never moved. \u201cI\u2019m getting older, and my fertile time is almost over. You\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d He grabbed her shoulders and shook her, his fingers digging into her skin and ripping the fine silk of her blouse. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this all before, Lesa. I\u2019m not tying my family to yours or damning a child of mine. I promised my grandfather, and that promise I\u2019ll keep. The marriage was annulled in the Mayori court. I\u2019m sorry if you don\u2019t want to accept that, but it\u2019s done. Over. Go back to hell and take a lover there. Or creep into a mortal bed and get a spawn that way. But you\u2019ll never have a child of my blood. Ever.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes suddenly glowed red too.</p> <p>I gasped and clutched the book and rosary to my breast, so shocked I felt my knees buckle. Rafe\u2019s eyes red? That could only mean one thing. The room darkened right before I hit the floor.</p><p>When I woke up, I was in my own bed and I was alone. What the hell had happened?</p><p>Not much, Glory. Just everything you know about Rafael Valdez is suddenly wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>I glanced at the clock and realized I\u2019d been out for about an hour. The shop! I sat up, but when the room spun, I fell back again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake. Sorry about that scene earlier and then the blackout. Alesa is hell on wheels when she\u2019s pissed.\u201d Rafe stood in the doorway, a bottle of Nadia\u2019s synthetic in his hand. \u201cHere, drink. Maybe it\u2019ll help get you on your feet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that demon knocked me out?\u201d I took the cold bottle and held it against my forehead, not ready to drink yet. I felt shaky inside and out. \u201cShe didn\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s one of her tricks. She gave you a psychic right hook. Sent you straight to the floor. She didn\u2019t like having an audience, since I was rejecting her.\u201d Rafe looked like he wanted to hit the wall next to the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s gone for now, but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be back. The woman\u2019s on a mission.\u201d He slammed his fist into his palm. \u201cDamn it, Glory. I\u2019m sorry she dragged you into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she was your wife.\u201d I struggled to sit up again. Rafe was there instantly, arranging a pillow behind me. When I waved him off, he frowned but stepped back. \u201cI can handle this.\u201d I leaned against the headboard and sipped from the bottle. \u201cIs she? Your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rafe pulled his phone out of his jeans pocket and answered it. Guess he\u2019d had it on vibrate. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d There was a long silence while he listened to whoever was on the other end.</p><p>I could hear enough to know the guy wasn\u2019t happy. Neither was Rafe. He burst into a different language, one I\u2019d never heard before, and began pacing around the bedroom. Another long silence. Judging by Rafe\u2019s body language, this was serious. You know the phrase \u201cblind with rage\u201d? Well, that was Rafe. I lay very still, not sure I wanted to draw attention to myself.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d That outburst was followed by another long silence, Rafe listening, then suddenly ending the call.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I still didn\u2019t move but decided it was safe to ask the question.</p><p>\u201cNo. Damn it!\u201d He turned off the phone, shoved it into his pocket and faced me again. \u201cI owe you an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to, Rafe.\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cCome, sit and cool down first.\u201d I hated to see him so upset. He was my calm-in-a-crisis buddy. Now I wanted to wrap my arms around him and hold him till he collected himself.</p> <p>\u201cYou sure you trust me that close to you? I know you saw my eyes earlier. My demon eyes.\u201d He came close to the bed now but still hadn\u2019t taken my hand.</p><p>I swallowed. Yes, there was that. But right now I saw the same soft brown eyes of the guy who\u2019d risked his life for me countless times. They weren\u2019t teasing me, and I sure wasn\u2019t seeing the dimples that came out when he grinned. But I loved everything about Rafael Valdez, and I wasn\u2019t going to throw away our friendship without giving him a chance to explain.</p><p>How can he explain demon eyes, Glory?</p><p>\u201cCome here, Rafe.\u201d I grabbed his hand, pulling him down to sit on the bed. The movement made me a little woozy, and I sank back against the pillow. \u201cYour ex really did a number on me. I still feel like I\u2019ve been shaken, not stirred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a vindictive bitch. She was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d Rafe smoothed back my hair. \u201cThanks for hanging in with me, Glory. I hope you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. How on earth did you ever fall for such a creature? And who was that on the phone?\u201d I held on to his hand. \u201cNever mind explaining about her. I can\u2019t say much. I apparently once carried on with Greg Kaplan. Brain farts. Hormones override common sense. It happens to the best of us. Alesa is beautiful when she\u2019s looking like a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. And I was young and rebellious. My grandfather, the guy on the phone, had warned me to stay away from demons. So naturally I was hell-bent, pardon the pun, on trying one.\u201d Rafe laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a merry sound. \u201cKids can be stupid pricks. I sure was. Alesa and I had a hot time and even made it legal during a wild weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did marry her.\u201d I wanted to jerk my hand away but decided that would be childish and stupid. I was jealous. I had no right. I\u2019d been married before. Of course my husband had been dead for more than four hundred years. Then there was my relationship with Jerry. He figured we were as good as married.</p><p>\u201cYes. Big mistake. Once she thought she had me tied to her, she let the worst parts of her evil side hang out. Man, was I stupid.\u201d Rafe took my now empty bottle of synthetic and set it on the nightstand. \u201cSo I went crawling home to my grandfather, and he helped me get the marriage annulled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Alesa said, she\u2019s never accepted that.\u201d I gripped Rafe\u2019s hand, imagining a young, impressionable shifter in the hands of a demon bitch. \u201cI\u2019ll bet those creatures are never na\u00efve and always know exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the argument we used in court. The Mayori court is the governing body of the shape-shifters. Demons don\u2019t obey their edicts. So it suits Alesa to pretend we\u2019re still married. I know we\u2019re not.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cVampires don\u2019t acknowledge our court either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. We\u2019re free spirits. But I\u2019ve heard of the Mayori.\u201d Blade and Damian actually admired the shape-shifter power structure. It kept them off the human radar. You didn\u2019t read a lot of scary shifter stories like you did the Dracula thing, now did you? I was finally feeling better and sat up straight. \u201cSo what\u2019s your grandfather got to do with them, and how did you end up with demon eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Only part of me is demon. The rest is pure shifter. Grandfather is head of the Mayori court now.\u201d Rafe stood and pulled me to my feet. \u201cHe\u2019d like to pretend it never happened, but my mother, his only daughter, was the result of his own romp with a demon bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the sins of the fathers . . . or in this case, the grand-fathers.\u201d When my knees started to cave, I slipped my arms around him, absorbing his warmth and strength. \u201cNo wonder he was giving you hell on the phone. He wanted this all to go away permanently, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. And he\u2019d flip if Alesa had a child of our blood.\u201d Rafe held on to me. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t let that happen. Being part demon has made me something of an outcast among my kind.\u201d He breathed against my hair.</p><p>\u201cPoor Rafe.\u201d I ran my hands up and down his back.</p><p>\u201cI handled it. Grandfather would have bought me acceptance, but I\u2019ve always made my own way.\u201d He put his hand under my chin. \u201cBut if sympathy gets me something here, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he think about you consorting with vampires?\u201d I looked up and caught a glimpse of white teeth and dimples.</p><p>\u201cHates it.\u201d Rafe slipped his hands down to my waist and pulled me closer. \u201cWhich makes you even more desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill the rebellious youth, I see.\u201d I didn\u2019t resist, and his eyes darkened. \u201cHow old are you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight hundred and seventy-two.\u201d He lowered his head and took my lower lip between his teeth, then gently sucked it into the heat of his mouth.</p><p>Hmm. No youthful fumbling here but rather a world of experience. He kissed me as if he could dive into my soul and pull me into his. I shoved my hands into his hair and lost myself in the moment, reveling in the taste of him, the heat of his mouth and the magic of his hands moving down to grab my butt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted his head. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting there.\u201d I really was feeling stronger. I ran my hands over his back, his muscles bunching under my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better lie down again.\u201d He eased me back to the bed until I was sitting on the edge, then knelt in front of me. He kissed me again, his mouth hot on mine as he slid his hands under the back of my sweater. One went up to the clasp of my bra, and one went down to slide into the back of my jeans.</p> <p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d I fell back on the pillows, dragging him with me, our mouths still connected. This was feeling very right, very\u2014</p><p>\u201cRafe, Glory?\u201d Nadia slammed the hall door, and I could hear her heels tapping as she headed across the living room.</p><p>We sprang apart like guilty children, then grinned at each other. Rafe ended up next to the dresser, a book in front of his bulging zipper. Like he\u2019d been reading me a bedtime story. I finger combed my hair.</p><p>\u201cIn here, Nadia.\u201d I sat up and grabbed one of my shoes lying on the rug next to the bed and slipped it on. \u201cI had an accident, and Rafe was taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident? What happened?\u201d Nadia looked concerned, but I could tell it barely covered a combo platter of curiosity and aggravation.</p> <p>\u201cA blast from my past came by. In the form of a demon bitch. She knocked Glory around a little.\u201d Rafe gave up on the book, took Nadia\u2019s arm and steered her back to the living room. \u201cI need to warn you in case she comes back. And I\u2019m pretty sure she will. She lives to cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she? What does she look like?\u201d Nadia was now all business. \u201cI need you on track here, Rafe. This is the second night in a row you\u2019ve disappeared on me, damn it. This club isn\u2019t going to open on time if this keeps happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about her on the way to the club.\u201d Rafe turned to me. \u201cGlory, about your shop ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, did you just lock up?\u201d I stuck my foot in the other shoe and followed them to the living room. Nadia\u2019s attitude had snapped me back to reality in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cI had no choice, Glory.\u201d Rafe acted like abandoning my shop hadn\u2019t been a big deal. Aggravating.</p><p>\u201cSure, fine. But now that I\u2019m recovered, I need to get back down there. I\u2019m missing sales and ruining the track record we had for being open twenty-four hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you let it go for one night? Alesa might come back.\u201d Rafe was in my space, staring worriedly at me while Nadia tapped her foot and looked like she wanted to say something. It didn\u2019t take mind reading to know she was over the whole Rafe-and-Glory connection and ready to pull the plug on their partnership. I couldn\u2019t let him ruin this club thing over me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to do that, Rafe. I\u2019ll call Richard. He\u2019s an ex-priest. He\u2019ll know what to do about a demon. If nothing else, he\u2019ll stay with me until the next shift comes in. You and I can talk later. How\u2019s that?\u201d His eyebrow went up. Okay, so we hadn\u2019t exactly been talking when Nadia had come in. I saw my purse and dug in it for my phone. Silence. I looked up and saw Rafe staring at me. Mr. Inscrutable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d I pulled out my phone. \u201cCalling Richard now.\u201d I patted Rafe\u2019s chest, then pushed him toward Nadia. \u201cGo. This is important to you. I want the club to be your number-one priority until it\u2019s opened successfully. I\u2019m a businesswoman too, Nadia. I totally get where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to her, Rafael. Now let\u2019s go. There are a million details, and I can\u2019t handle them all by myself. I called your cell, and it went straight to voice mail. This is no way to run a business.\u201d She opened the hall door and gestured for Rafe to precede her. \u201cAre we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess we are. Don\u2019t go down without Richard, Glory. I\u2019ll be back before sunrise.\u201d He gave me a look that was a promise of something interesting later, then walked out. Nadia\u2019s glance actually said thanks, then she slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d I picked up my phone and called Richard. Voice mail. Knowing Flo, that probably meant they were practicing for the honeymoon and she\u2019d made him turn off his phone. I left him a message that this was urgent and involved a demon in my shop. More than a little shaky about my decision, I grabbed some supplies, stuffed them into my purse, then headed out.</p><p>The first hour was uneventful. I had a few customers, including two who had tried to come earlier and were disappointed that we\u2019d been closed. The sales I made convinced me that I\u2019d done the right thing reopening. When the bell rang over the door and Aggie came in, I was relieved. Reinforcements. I hoped she\u2019d fight on my side if a demon showed up.</p><p>\u201cI had Greg look up shower games, Glory. Tell me what you think.\u201d Aggie plopped papers on the counter and sat on the stool in front of me. \u201cSome of these are pretty funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny\u2019s good.\u201d I picked up a paper. \u201cUnless you\u2019re making me look ridiculous. \u2018Stack cotton balls on your head. The person who can balance the most wins a prize.\u2019\u201d I crumpled the paper and dropped it in the can behind the counter. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>Aggie grinned. \u201cAw, come on. Where\u2019s your sense of humor? I can see you now, a stack of those fluffy things on your head, Miss Cottontop, while we all laugh and cheer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d I picked up another paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? \u2018Kiss Flo\u2019s ass.\u2019 Are you nuts?\u201d</p><p>Aggie snatched it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t read it all. You blow up a picture of her head and draw a body. Then we each put on a ton of lipstick and a blindfold. The person whose lips end up closest to Flo\u2019s cute little ass wins a prize. Isn\u2019t that fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Siren land maybe.\u201d I grabbed the paper and tore it in quarters, dropping it in the can. Okay, maybe I wasn\u2019t in a game-playing mood. Getting drop-kicked by a demon will do that to you.</p><p>\u201cFine. Be that way. I\u2019ll pick my own games, and you\u2019ll just have to go with the flow.\u201d Aggie laughed. \u201cGet it? Flo, flow?\u201d She stared at me. \u201cNever mind. What\u2019s got you so bummed? You\u2019re usually a little more upbeat than this. Is it something to do with that demon I saw come in here earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. What do you know about demons?\u201d I sat on the stool I kept behind the counter. Aggie was right. I was down and sinking fast. I\u2019d even lost a sale earlier because I hadn\u2019t smiled and faked interest in a customer\u2019s dress choice. Now Aggie and I were alone so I could vent.</p><p>\u201cI know they\u2019re trouble.\u201d She pulled another sheaf of papers out of her Louis Vuitton tote. \u201cGames for the bachelorette party. X-rated. That should cheer you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Aggie, I can\u2019t think about games right now. The demon may come back anytime, and she\u2019s hurt me once.\u201d I pulled a vial of holy water out from under the counter, then draped the rosary around my neck. \u201cThink this stuff will help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Aggie picked up the holy water. \u201cWell, I take that back. Fake. Whoever sold it to you ripped you off. I can tell the real deal from a mile away. Gives me the heebie-jeebies. Not that I\u2019m evil or anything, but I\u2019ve got enough of the bad stuff in me to have a sense of things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot. Got it off the Internet. I had high hopes for it.\u201d I dropped the vial in the trash can. \u201cWhat about the rosary? I had it in front of me, along with a prayer book, when she was here earlier and she didn\u2019t approach me, but she did treat me to a kind of psychic knockout punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they don\u2019t like touching stuff like that. But it depends on what kind of demon you\u2019re dealing with. There\u2019re good demons and bad. I assume you\u2019re going at it with a bad one.\u201d Aggie was checking her manicure like this was no big deal. I wanted to cram her stack of papers down her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely bad. She\u2019s really after Rafe. Wants to have his baby, of all things.\u201d I propped my chin on my fist. Visions of that coupling made my skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cOoo. Now you\u2019ve got me interested. Sex with a demon. Tell me more.\u201d Aggie leaned in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Rafe\u2019s ex. Now she claims her biological clock\u2019s ticking, and she wants her little hellbaby to be his. Rafe\u2019s not interested. She hit me, so maybe she\u2019s thinking it\u2019s because I\u2019m in the picture. Of course that\u2019s not it. He wouldn\u2019t do her if she were the last female in Heaven, hell or any part in between.\u201d I glanced at the bachelorette games. Ring toss with an inflatable penis? Oh, joy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better be careful. She could sneak up on him. Knock him out like she did you, and then take him while he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d Aggie started to stuff her papers back into her tote. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me how, but demons can get men up when they don\u2019t want to be there. It\u2019s happened before. The Storm God has told us some really cool stories about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure with Rafe. He\u2019s part demon himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo frickin\u2019 way.\u201d Aggie stopped in mid stuff.</p><p>\u201cI was as shocked as you are.\u201d What was I doing spilling Rafe\u2019s secrets to Aggie like she and I were girlfriends? \u201cDon\u2019t you tell anyone I told you that. Swear it, or I\u2019ll tell the Storm God you love your shoes more than you love him.\u201d</p><p>Aggie blinked. \u201cGee, Glory. Play hard ball why don\u2019t you? Fine. I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d She crossed her heart.</p><p>I looked up when the bell over the shop door rang. Customer? No. I nudged Aggie. She turned around. We knew immediately that we had a problem on our hands.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. A vampire and a Siren. I just love a twofer.\u201d The demon glanced back, and my sign flipped on its own from Open to Closed. The dead bolt clicked shut, and we were trapped with her.</p><p>\u201cLove this.\u201d Aggie threw up her hands like she did when she was about to turn someone to stone.</p><p>The demon just laughed and threw up her own hands. Aggie was frozen in place. Yep, stuck on her stool like a permanent fixture. I gaped at Alesa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlesa, wait a minute. Why start something when we really don\u2019t have a problem here?\u201d I picked up the Bible I\u2019d brought from my apartment and rounded the counter. I didn\u2019t have a clue what to try, but hoped my religious objects would at least keep me mobile. I glanced at Aggie. Still frozen.</p><p>\u201cNo problem? Honey, you think I can\u2019t read your every thought? You\u2019re into Rafe, and I bet you a thousand dollars that he\u2019s into you. You\u2019re just his type, so sweet, so freakin\u2019 good.\u201d She gagged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how in the hell he stands the stench of all that decency. You reek of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, but that\u2019s not a problem I care to fix.\u201d And who was she to talk? The woman was giving off so many sugar fumes a human would gain five pounds just breathing in the air around her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. You\u2019re supposed to kill, drain people dry. Come over to the dark side with us and use your powers to do our master\u2019s work.\u201d Alesa had been roaming the shop, ripping a piece of silk here, smashing a fine porcelain there. I wanted to screech at her and toss my Bible at her head. She needed to see my dark side? Let her ruin one more piece of merchandise.</p><p>\u201cRafe and I aren\u2019t together. I told you that. But it wouldn\u2019t matter if we were. Rafe doesn\u2019t want you. Why do you demean yourself by going after a man who has rejected you?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stand it. She was aiming for a designer dress that would bring me several hundred dollars. \u201cGet away from there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Glory, am I bothering you?\u201d Alesa plucked the dress from the rack and held it up to her. It was much too big. Would have fit me if I hadn\u2019t decided I couldn\u2019t afford to keep it.</p><p>\u201cPut the dress back, Alesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She gave it a look that stained the red wool with a smear of black oil, then slid it back onto the rack, careful to smudge it against two other expensive dresses on either side. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d I flung myself at her, fangs down, claws out. I landed on the floor because she used a lightning-fast move to get out of the way.</p><p>She laughed and stepped on my back. \u201cMissed me.\u201d She dug her high heel into my spine until I heard a bone crack. \u201cVampires have such lame skill sets.\u201d</p><p>I bucked and rolled away, diving under another dress rack before I sprang to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rip out your throat, take you down and drain every toxic ounce from your evil body.\u201d My taunt just earned a cackle that made me back up until I hit another rack behind me.</p><p>She\u2019d dropped the mask of beauty, and I cringed away from her hideous hawkish face. Nut brown skin stretched over her beaklike nose, with deep grooves on either side. I heard her breathing as she circled around the rack, and I leaped to the other side of the shop. Her eyes glowed bright red, and her lips peeled back in a grin that exposed rows of sharp teeth that would rip me to shreds if I let them get close.</p><p>I was definitely having second thoughts about that. Forget an attack. I saw my Bible where I\u2019d dropped it on the floor. Would that keep her away? My rosary sure hadn\u2019t. My back ached where she\u2019d dug her heel into me, and I could smell my own blood and the stench of hellfire coming from her flaming eyes.</p> <p>The shop door banged open, and there was a definite change in the atmosphere. Alesa\u2019s face changed too. Her mask of beauty slipped back into place, and she smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we here? More help from a vampire? Another Goody Two-Shoes at that.\u201d She flew over the dress rack and landed behind me, her hand clamping around my throat, her nails digging into my jugular. I knew then that she\u2019d been playing with me. I\u2019d never been any real match for her.</p><p>My vision darkened. I grabbed her arm, tearing desperately at her skin to try to relieve the pressure. Black liquid oozed from her wounds, but she didn\u2019t give an inch.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, demon.\u201d Richard\u2019s voice came from far away.</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d She ripped her nails down my throat, and my own blood poured down my chest. I had to do something, or I was going to die right here in my own shop. Through a haze of pain and terror, I lifted my feet and slammed them down onto hers, grinding my high heels into her insteps just like she\u2019d done to my back. Her bones shattered, and she finally released my throat with a screech. Free, I lunged away from her, falling to the floor and rolling under another dress rack.</p><p>Cool water splashed my jeans as I fell. Alesa\u2019s screams bounced off the walls as I crawled through skirts until I collapsed against the cool metal legs supporting the rack.</p><p>I reached up to my wet, torn throat. There was a terrible hole where my jugular belonged. The demon had known exactly how to kill me. I fought away the darkness and held my flesh together, praying healing thoughts. I couldn\u2019t let evil win. Church. This Sunday. Night service.</p><p>\u201cGlory, can you roll this way a little?\u201d Richard calmly tried to coax me from my hiding place. Or was it a trick?</p> <p>I cautiously cracked open my eyes, afraid to wiggle even a finger or she\u2019d know I still lived. Masculine brown leather boots and dark jeans. Richard. Or was it? Demons could be so cruelly clever.</p><p>He murmured a prayer in Latin. I didn\u2019t know Latin, but I knew Jesus and God when I heard them called on, something a demon would never dare. All right, then. I reached out my trembling hand.</p><p>Oh, Glory, when did you get so weak? I eased toward him until he pulled me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cRichard? Where\u2019s the demon?\u201d I leaned against him, not caring that I was getting his blue shirt bloody. I\u2019d buy him a new one. Two new ones. He was my hero.</p><p>\u201cGone. Holy water got her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, that was close.\u201d Aggie peered over his shoulder. \u201cYou look like crap on a cracker, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. How did you get out of that freeze?\u201d I whispered. Whatever the demon had done to my throat hadn\u2019t healed yet.</p><p>\u201cGuess when Richard watered her down, it broke her spell. Never saw anything like it. Well, except in that movie The Wizard of Oz, when they threw the water on the bad witch. Anyway, he tossed the holy water, his was the real deal, and there she went, dissolved like Kool-Aid powder. Amazing stuff that holy water.\u201d Aggie was clearly buzzed. She patted Richard on the back, following him as he carried me to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou did a great job, preacher man. Flo\u2019s a lucky gal. Glory, don\u2019t worry about your little shop here. I\u2019ll stay till your helper arrives. Should be soon. Dawn\u2019s only an hour away.\u201d Aggie grabbed the shop door and pulled it open so Richard could carry me out. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Aggie? I need to get Glory upstairs. She\u2019s in pretty bad shape.\u201d Richard was obviously losing patience. He looked tired. I guess facing a demon, especially after a night of pleasing a bride in the bedroom, took a lot out of you.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been a bitch to you. You were awesome tonight. Really went after that demon.\u201d Aggie put her hand on my arm. \u201cI\u2019d like to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aggie.\u201d I blinked back tears. God, but I hurt and I was weak. Now I was supposed to have some kind of sweet make-up scene with Aggie? Not sure I could handle it. \u201cTalk to you tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019d disappointed her, but that was all I had in me.</p><p>\u201cSure. Tomorrow.\u201d She thrust something into my lap. \u201cHere\u2019s your purse. I wrapped it in a plastic bag so you wouldn\u2019t get blood on it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Okay, so she was acting like a friend. \u201cThanks, pal.\u201d That got her to smile. Good thing because she could be a really bad enemy. Hold that thought, Glory.</p><p>Richard carried me up the stairs while I dug for my keys. I was desperate for healing sleep. But when I saw who was waiting for me in the apartment, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get it yet.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d Flo hovered over me after Richard deposited me on the bed. She shooed him from the room, then cleaned me up herself and put me into my new nightgown. I protested weakly, thinking this was a real waste, but she ignored me. \u201cYou are so terribly hurt. Wearing pretty things will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m weak too.\u201d I blinked and wondered why she didn\u2019t turn on the lights.</p><p>\u201cYou lost too much blood. Here, mia amica.\u201d</p><p>Before I could stop her, Flo had ripped open the vein in her wrist and pressed it to my lips. What can I say? I\u2019m a vampire and needed the nourishment. I drank and realized the lights were on. I\u2019d been closer to death than I\u2019d been in a long, long time. Finally, I sighed and pulled away. Flo wiped my lips with a cool washcloth and settled me back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn. I want to hear the whole story about this demon, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re up to telling me. Aggie can tell me some of it. Your day help arrived, so she came up. She\u2019s in your living room talking to Richard. You can tell me the rest tomorrow. Will you be all right if I leave you now?\u201d Flo still sat on the edge of the bed, her hand next to my head.</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks, dear friend.\u201d I reached for my throat, relieved it was almost healed. A good feeding will do that for you. After I slept, I\u2019d be 100 percent again. \u201cI need to thank Richard. What he did was dangerous. And awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, he was in his element. When he got the call to come fight a demon? You should have seen him when he pulled out his holy water\u2014blessed by the Holy Father himself, he said\u2014and stuff he has in a special trunk. He even prayed over it.\u201d Flo smiled and stood, then leaned over to kiss my cheek. \u201cI am very proud of him. He is a good man, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the best. He saved my life.\u201d I sighed, really exhausted. \u201cSo did you. I love you, Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, Glory. Rest now. Rafael is arriving. He will guard you through the day, but the demon is no more. Ricardo did the trick.\u201d Flo stopped at the door. \u201cShould I call Jeremiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I tried to sit up but couldn\u2019t manage it. \u201cNo need to worry him. It\u2019s over. I\u2019ll be fine when I wake up. I\u2019ll tell him about it when he gets back.\u201d Maybe. But probably not. If I could persuade Richard and Flo that Jerry didn\u2019t ever have to know about it. Did Jerry know he\u2019d hired a bodyguard who was part demon? I\u2019d like to know the answer to that. I heard doors close, then saw Rafe in the doorway. His eyes were dark, hot and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost died because of me.\u201d Right beside me in an instant, he gazed down like he wanted to take me in his arms but was afraid he\u2019d hurt me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I almost died because of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you say that? I brought Alesa here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who had to open the shop.\u201d I held out my arms. \u201cWould you hold me? Please?\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and gently gathered me close. He smoothed my hair like I\u2019d once run my hands over him when he\u2019d been in dog body. The thought made me smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s gone now. For good. That ought to make you and your grandfather happy.\u201d I leaned back and looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re petting me. You realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cI used to do this to you when I was hurt or upset. You\u2019d lie next to me on the couch, and I\u2019d run my hands over your furry coat. It made me feel calm and protected, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I had to lie there and take it. Because I was a friggin\u2019 dog.\u201d He grinned and studied that sinfully beautiful nightgown I wore. \u201cOf course you never pranced around in stuff like this. You favored granny gowns and robes you found in thrift stores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVintage chenille. Valuable stuff and comfortable.\u201d I was very aware that I hid nothing under the gown.</p><p>\u201cIs this comfortable?\u201d He ran his finger under the tiny satin strap.</p><p>\u201cAlmost like being naked.\u201d I smiled and fell back on the pillow. \u201cIs Nadia here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She got a house and decided to spend the night there. She took a change of clothes in her tote when she left earlier.\u201d Rafe was looking his fill, but he frowned when he got to what was surely an ugly red scar on my neck.</p> <p>\u201cRichard, Flo and Aggie?\u201d I adjusted the sheet, which reached my waist. At least he couldn\u2019t see what was probably a nasty looking heel mark on my back. It still ached.</p><p>\u201cGone. The vamps had to beat the sun home, and Aggie wanted to get back to her watery digs.\u201d Rafe yawned. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll hit the hay. Been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind lying here next to me and just holding me?\u201d I knew nothing could happen. In about a minute I\u2019d be dead. Then he could go to his own bed.</p><p>\u201cSure. Squeeze over.\u201d He stepped out of his jeans, surprising me with a pair of white jockeys, then pulled off his black T-shirt. He eased into bed, treating me as carefully as a piece of the finest porcelain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you went through that. A brush with hell isn\u2019t something you soon forget.\u201d He gently touched his lips to the scar on my neck. \u201cWhen I think of what she did to you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Rafe. I survived, thanks to Richard. I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t just knock me out again, but she didn\u2019t.\u201d I snuggled into him. \u201cThis feels good. Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are safe. I swear it. And I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t knock you out because she was toying with you. Figuring she\u2019d have fun tearing you apart before she finally took the kill. She didn\u2019t count on a former priest showing up to do his thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real holy water do it?\u201d I could barely speak. The combination of blood loss and shock were getting to me along with the coming dawn.</p><p>\u201cIt helped. Richard\u2019s had dealings with demons before. He had some special prayers too, I guess. Anyway, he managed it in fine form, and I\u2019m telling Grandfather about him. The Mayori needs to know there\u2019s someone they can call on for situations like this.\u201d Rafe kept talking, his hand warm on my back. But my lights winked out, and I didn\u2019t hear any more.</p> <p>I woke up with my nightgown twisted around my legs, and Rafe hard against me. I did a quick inventory and realized I\u2019d healed, all aches and pains gone. He stirred next to me, as usual hyperaware of me and my movements.</p><p>\u201cHow you feelin\u2019?\u201d He stretched, his arms hitting the headboard, his feet a good six inches beyond the end of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cPerfect except for a desperate need to brush my teeth. Be right back.\u201d I bolted for the bathroom and took care of business, even washing my face and brushing my hair. What was I up to? A major right turn in my life. I knew in my heart that Rafe was there with me. I posed in the bedroom doorway.</p><p>\u201cFlo was right about that nightgown.\u201d Rafe brushed by me, his hand grazing my breast. \u201cIt does bring out the color of your eyes.\u201d He stepped into the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>My eyes? What the hell was he doing looking at my eyes? I stomped over to the bed and sat. Then jumped up again. Took a trip to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of synthetic. Chugged it. Marched back to the bedroom and slammed into Rafe, who stood just inside the doorway.</p><p>\u201cSomething bothering you, sweetheart?\u201d He grinned, his dimples deep and sexy as hell.</p><p>I looked him up and down. Hmm. Guess maybe he had noticed something besides my eyes if that bulge stretching his shorts was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cNo. Something bothering you?\u201d I ran a finger down the center of his chest, then popped the elastic on his briefs.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He jerked me to him and covered my mouth with his. The kiss was wet heat and a slow melting of my senses. I knew this taste. Knew this firm body. Could find this scent in the dark. I had his hair in one hand and his taut ass in the other. God, how I wanted him. What had taken me so long to do something about it?</p><p>I jumped, wrapping my legs around his waist and felt his hands on my butt, holding me hard against him. My aching breasts jammed against his chest, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of his mouth, his tongue, the edge of his teeth. I scraped a fang over his lip and sipped at his blood, moaning with pleasure at the salty tang.</p><p>He walked us over to the bed and eased me back on it, dragging one of my legs off so he could stroke his hand up my thigh. I clenched around his roving fingers, so on fire I wanted to scream at him to hurry and take me then and there. He broke the kiss and leaned back, his face flushed, his hair wild.</p><p>\u201cGod, Glory, what\u2019s come over you, girl?\u201d He smiled and eased my straps down. \u201cSlow this down. A lot. I\u2019ve waited five long years to see you go wild for me. I\u2019m taking my time.\u201d</p><p>I helped him get the gown down to my waist, unable to speak. Not that we needed words. We were experts at mind reading. I sent Rafe a graphic message that made his eyebrows go up. But he had his own ideas about where to go as he stroked his tongue around one nipple, then sucked it into the heat of his mouth.</p><p>I held on to his shoulders, desperately trying to slow down too. But my bloodlust was on fire, urging me to scratch him and make him bleed, needing that scent to bind us. No, he wouldn\u2019t like it, wouldn\u2019t want to feed me. Before we were done, I was so going there. I writhed beneath him as he moved to the other breast, his mouth clever while his hand dove between us to search out that aching place between my thighs that wept for him.</p><p>I opened my legs and stroked his chest, exploring his nipples, while I traced his contours with my tongue and teeth. Control. I couldn\u2019t lose it. Didn\u2019t want to scare him off. Oh, who was I kidding? It would take hell\u2019s legions to scare away this bad boy. He traveled down my body with his hot mouth. I gasped and lost it, clawing at him. Rafe just growled and used his own teeth until I bowed off the bed.</p><p>His eyes gleamed as he rose above me and carefully stripped away my gown\u2014he knew how much I prized such beautiful things\u2014and tossed it toward the dresser before he pounced, saying my name in a way that made me hot and cold and hungrier than ever. He murmured words in that language I didn\u2019t understand, kissing and licking his way up my body again. I still couldn\u2019t speak more than his name. But every time I said it, his eyes darkened.</p><p>Finally he took my mouth again in a deep, ravenous kiss that left me breathless. We were coming to the point of no return, and we both knew it. A point that would change things between us forever. He pulled back and stared down at me. I met his gaze, so hot, so hungry, yet still so very kind.</p><p>Forget kindness. I wanted passion, to be taken completely. And I knew we\u2019d already crossed that line a dozen kisses ago. Rafe, Valdez, my bodyguard, a man Jerry had trusted . . . No, wouldn\u2019t think about him now. Only Rafe. He wanted me. I wanted him and was way beyond pulling together a single reason why I couldn\u2019t have what I wanted. I shook with pleasure when he moved over me, his hand caressing my breast, his mouth gently touching mine before he asked a question I wished he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I dragged his mouth down to mine, then pulled him to me, crying out at the exquisite rightness as he pressed hard and deep inside me. Sure? Was I ever certain of anything? But I couldn\u2019t keep wondering if I\u2019d been wasting time waiting for another man to change. This man was here now, and he knew me, really knew me, and accepted me, Glory St. Clair, as I was. He wasn\u2019t taking me. I was taking him.</p><p>I rose to meet him and felt something else shift besides my body. What was I doing? Oh, yeah. Setting myself free. And it felt damned good. As Rafe moved, I opened my eyes and looked directly into his. I smiled and felt the pure pleasure of moving with him. He grinned and put his hand behind my neck to pull my mouth toward the vein I wanted like a wanderer lost in the desert. Every heartbeat, every pulse that throbbed through him, called to me in the most primitive way.</p><p>\u201cDrink, Glory. I know you want it. Take it, baby.\u201d He drove into me, his eyes on my face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say a word, but of course he\u2019d seen and felt my fangs down since the first kiss. My body already trembling on the edge of satisfaction, I sank into his vein, the shifter\u2019s blood hot and sweet like I knew it would be. I shuddered with the exquisite pleasure, then let go for a kiss long and deep. I felt Rafe\u2019s release inside me before he stilled and sighed my name. His head landed next to mine on the pillow.</p><p>We lay there for a few moments, just breathing, until I reached over and touched the fang marks I could see on his neck. I propped myself up so I could lick them closed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I told you to. And I kind of got off to it.\u201d Rafe grinned at me, then pulled me on top of him. His shorts had long ago disappeared, and he was so beautiful naked. \u201cI\u2019ve always known you were a vampire, Glory. And you\u2019re not my first. I know feeding ramps up a vamp\u2019s pleasure.\u201d He drew a circle on my hip that made me shiver. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all about pleasure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMmm. I can see that.\u201d I wiggled against his stirring erection. \u201cBut now I\u2019m disillusioned.\u201d I dropped a kiss on his lips, obscenely happy. \u201cI wanted to be your first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how old I am. Bound to have had a little experience. The demon chapter was a onetime deal. I learned from that mistake. I\u2019m really sorry you had to pay for it.\u201d He ran his hand up my back. \u201cSure you\u2019re all healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just proved that. But why don\u2019t we jump in the shower, and you can examine me for yourself? Front and back.\u201d I sat up and pulled him with me.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d He laughed and gathered me in his arms for a long, lusty kiss. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to have to meet Nadia at the club in a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better hurry.\u201d I glanced at the clock. I was late getting down to the shop, and I was pretty sure Blade had called at least once in the last two days. I hadn\u2019t even glanced at my cell phone. I ran into the bathroom and pulled a shower cap over my hair. No guilt. Just fun. I was sick of being Glory the good, the decent, the boring.</p><p>I watched Rafe adjust the water temperature, admiring his taut butt. Maybe I\u2019d regret this later, but I laughed when Rafe jerked me under the warm water. There, I did a few things that actually surprised him. And he did a few things to me . . . definitely no regrets.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you. Looks like opening night is Thursday. Ray will be here before then so we can set up for him. You\u2019ll have to have your bachelorette party on Wednesday night. It\u2019ll give us a chance to make sure the sound and lighting systems all check out. If you still want me to dance . . .\u201d Rafe ran a comb through his wet hair in front of the bathroom mirror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Show me your moves again, Angel Man.\u201d I licked my lips, then realized what he\u2019d said. \u201cWait a minute. Wednesday? This is Saturday. Not much notice, Rafe.\u201d I stuffed my feet into red heels and stomped into the bathroom. Rafe hadn\u2019t put on a shirt yet, and the sight of his bare chest stopped me. I was turning into a fool over a hot body.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it. Nadia\u2019s already pissed at me. She set the schedule. I\u2019ve got to go along. If you want the party at our club, that\u2019s the date.\u201d He turned and grinned at me. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Waiting for a demo?\u201d He did a bump and grind that sent every bit of blood straight to my, well, you know.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d I turned and flounced out of the room. Or tried to. Rafe caught me around the waist and pulled me to him.</p><p>\u201cLiar. You were lusting after my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. And thinking what a shame you had to play dog all those years and sleep at the foot of my bed\u201d\u2014I ran a fingertip around one of his dark brown nipples\u2014\u201cwhen you could have been in a much choicer position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why that couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Rafe slipped open a button on my silk blouse and slid his hand inside my white demicup bra.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Not going there. So I\u2019d better get down to the shop. Saturday night is busy. And now I\u2019ve got to call the list of people Flo wants at this bachelorette party and invite them for Wednesday night.\u201d I sighed when he found my nipple and squeezed it between two fingers. \u201cI\u2019m already late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Rafe groaned because I\u2019d eased my hand down the front of his jeans. No underwear tonight. Which was fine by me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re torturing each other.\u201d I pulled his head down and kissed him, amazed that I was so comfortable doing this. Rafe as my lover. I still hadn\u2019t checked my cell but figured there would be missed calls and voice mails from you know who. I couldn\u2019t seem to give a damn.</p><p>\u201cA quickie?\u201d He licked my ear and pulled me toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cA very quickie.\u201d I drop kicked my thong across the room. \u201cLeave my clothes on. Jeans down to your knees, mister.\u201d I lifted my skirt. He was ready, I was ready. I pushed him back to the dresser so he could lean against it, and he helped me climb on board, wrapping my legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d I felt him sink home, the pleasure so intense my toes tingled. My head fell back, and Rafe kissed my neck, then the vee exposed by my open blouse.</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d He held on to me and worked my hips against his, the motions fast and hard until we both gasped and bumped heads, laughing at our own crazy passion. A book I\u2019d been reading about relationships, Should You Be Committed? , had hit the floor along with a box of necklaces and earrings, jewelry flying everywhere.</p><p>I glanced at my watch. \u201cSix minutes. Not bad, big boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly pride myself on my speed, sweetheart.\u201d He eased me onto my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a washcloth.\u201d Rafe grinned and pulled up his jeans. Then he headed into the bathroom while I found my thong and ran a brush through my hair.</p> <p>Once we were cleaned up, we kissed and made a promise to meet back at the apartment two hours before dawn for a more lengthy session. I was grinning like an idiot when I walked into the shop. Flo and Richard were waiting for me.</p><p>They exchanged looks that warned me I was in for some explaining. I pulled them into the back room, then held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cStop. Don\u2019t say it. I\u2019m a big girl. I can do what I want on my own time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you. You had a near miss with a demon, and now you are falling into bed with Rafael.\u201d This time she held up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to deny it, girlfriend. Ricardo and I can both smell sex and him on you. And Jeremiah is still out of town, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at her. Nice play of the guilt card. \u201cI had a good time. Flo, you of all people understand that sometimes you just want to have fun. Jerry and I aren\u2019t married. I can take a lover if I want one. Rafe and I have known each other for five years. I love him. He\u2019s a dear friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo and I are your dear friends too. We should have stayed with you.\u201d Flo bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were wonderful. Both of you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cCome on, Flo. I had a near-death experience. It reminded me that life can be shorter than we think. So Rafe and I took our friendship to the next level. I\u2019m allowed. Right?\u201d I pulled my cell phone out of my purse. Good diversion. I glanced back at my friends.</p><p>Flo pursed her lips but didn\u2019t say anything else. Richard frowned but obviously had nothing to add either.</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s club is opening this weekend, so we have to have the bachelorette party on Wednesday night. Will that work for you?\u201d I added a smile, trying to get this back on a friendly basis.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Flo glanced at Richard. \u201cYou have the list I gave you of people to invite? I have a few to add.\u201d Flo pulled a paper out of her purse. \u201cHere, there are names and numbers. It should end up thirty-five, maybe forty women in all. Is that too many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the more the better. We\u2019ll have the whole club to ourselves.\u201d I kept smiling. \u201cI wish I could pay for this myself, but with my budget I\u2019d have to have this in my apartment with a movie rental.\u201d I looped my arm through hers. \u201cBut I\u2019d be sure to get one with naked hot guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting.\u201d Flo laughed when Richard grumbled. \u201cBut let\u2019s do it in the club. Like I told you, it\u2019s on me.\u201d Flo had definitely thawed out. Richard just looked ready to escape. I grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cRichard, would you please not tell Jerry about Rafe and me? I know Jer\u2019s your friend, but why get him all stirred up if this is just an experiment? Post-traumatic stress or something?\u201d I stepped back at the look on Richard\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to lie to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo! Glory didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Flo stepped between us. \u201cYou want to be the one to break up her relationship with Jeremiah permanently?\u201d Flo glanced at me. \u201cSpare your friend the pain of jealousy. You know how bad that feels, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the one breaking them up.\u201d Richard didn\u2019t say it, but his stare clearly proclaimed me an unfaithful slut. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t lie to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, amante.\u201d Flo walked him to the back door and turned the dead bolt to unlock it. \u201cYou just won\u2019t volunteer information. If Jeremiah asks the question, you will tell him what you know. Glory won\u2019t expect anything more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Richard.\u201d I relaxed. Jerry and Richard never discussed their love lives. The most personal info I\u2019d ever heard them exchange had been the name of the shifter who handled a stock transaction for Jerry. \u201cI haven\u2019t thanked you properly. You saved my life last night. I\u2019d be dead or in hell if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure you should thank me yet, Gloriana. Fights with a demon can have lasting effects.\u201d Richard still wasn\u2019t smiling as he kissed Flo\u2019s cheek and stepped into the alley. \u201cBe careful with Rafe. It isn\u2019t like you to have what Florence is calling a fling. Think about that.\u201d</p><p>Flo closed the door and grinned at me. \u201cI love him, but he is a bit old-fashioned, eh? You and Rafael? Tell me everything, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>After Flo left I headed into the shop and assisted customers. I may have lost a few sales, but suddenly I was talking first, thinking later.</p><p>\u201cHoney, big ass flowers on a big ass? Never in four hundred years will that look good. Trust me, I know.\u201d I pushed the woman over to a nice pair of pin-striped gabardine pants that would make her look taller. \u201cOf course you could always lay off those strawberry Pop-Tarts for breakfast if you really want to squeeze into a twelve.\u201d I ignored her gasp. \u201cHere, try these on and don\u2019t torture yourself. Fourteen.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s face was red, and she was wondering how I knew about the Pop-Tarts, but she ended up buying those pants and two blouses in an extra large, not the large she\u2019d tried to cram her boobs into.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Erin watched the woman leave before she turned to me. \u201cYou were pretty, uh, blunt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just told the truth. Come on, Erin, you know that sideways stripe made her look fat. I sure don\u2019t wear them.\u201d</p><p>Erin gasped. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the \u2018f\u2019 word in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it.\u201d I frowned and picked up my cell phone. Ten more calls to make and I\u2019d have the bachelorette party locked down. I\u2019d thought of a theme, and every woman I\u2019d called had gotten excited about it. Still had to arrange the munchies, but Greg Kaplan would come through on those. The EVs wanted my cooperation, so I was sure there\u2019d be no problem there. Damian was going to provide some of his buzz-producing synthetics, so I\u2019d have to go on the Internet for some drinking games. Did I still want Rafe to dance for the crowd of women? Now that he was my guy . . .</p> <p>I flinched when the phone in my hand vibrated, then rang.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Westwood. I want to meet tonight to work out the details on that video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do.\u201d I glanced around the shop. We had a lull going. I signaled to Erin and headed for the back room. I\u2019d had a brainstorm about this video, and I was going through with my plan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have that option. Remember your pal\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure I do. But I want a little down payment before I start any preproduction work on this video.\u201d I shut the door and picked up the newspaper I\u2019d looked at earlier.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money yet, vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Simon will spot you some. Here are my terms.\u201d I smiled and focused on the ad that had caught my eye. \u201cI want a brand-new red convertible.\u201d I rattled off the make and model. \u201cMust have the extended warranty, and the title will be in my name, free and clear. It should be delivered to the alley behind my shop and my old Suburban towed away. Once that is done, I\u2019ll be ready to play your video game. Got all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your friggin\u2019 mind.\u201d Westwood actually growled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m being smart. Bet you didn\u2019t give me credit for that, did you?\u201d I slapped the phone shut and sat staring at the picture of my new car. Boy, did I look forward to this. Paid for by the EVs. How sweet. Much better than cash that could be stolen away with the click of Westwood\u2019s computer mouse. For once, I actually think I had outsmarted the bad guys.</p><p>My phone rang. Westwood calling back? I glanced at the caller ID, my stomach twisting. Earth to Glory. Jerry. Time to decide just what kind of future I wanted.</p> <p>\u201cNot now, Jer.\u201d I shut off the phone without answering.</p><p>\u201cWas that Mr. Blade?\u201d Emmie Lou Nutt shimmered in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t feel like talking to him.\u201d I sat on the stool and saw that Erin or someone had piled the three dresses Alesa had ruined on the table. Infuriating. So much lost revenue.</p><p>\u201cYou okay now? Never saw such a horrible fight. The way you and that demon were goin\u2019 at it.\u201d Harvey Nutt stood next to Emmie Lou. \u201cI figured you were a goner fer sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d I sighed. \u201cRichard saved the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe preacher was awesome, but we helped.\u201d Emmie smiled at Harvey.</p><p>\u201cSure did. When we seen your friend was fixin\u2019 to throw that holy water, we shoved your shirt rack outta the way.\u201d Harvey had his thumbs stuck in the straps of his overalls.</p><p>\u201cHoney, not a speck of water got on your fine silk blouses. And that demon got enough holiness in her face to send her straight back to hell where she belonged.\u201d Emmie grinned at Harvey. \u201cIt was flat amazin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea you helped.\u201d I would have hugged them both, but I knew they were nothing but cool air and a vision. \u201cThanks so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProved somethin\u2019 to us, I tell ya.\u201d Harvey put his arm around Emmie\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I glanced down at the dresses and wondered if a good dry cleaner could salvage any of them.</p><p>\u201cLook at us, Glory.\u201d Emmie\u2019s voice was suddenly quieter.</p><p>I looked. \u201cYou\u2019re fading out. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe finally got the message.\u201d Harvey pulled Emmie tighter against him. \u201cWhen I first laid eyes on this little gal all those years ago, right in this here building, I knew she was the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Harvey. I knew it too. I was just stubborn enough to make you court me proper for two years before I\u2019d say yes.\u201d Emmie\u2019s eyes sparkled, and she sniffed. She wasn\u2019t wearing the cowgirl costume she\u2019d been wearing when Harvey had accidentally run over her in his pickup truck. Now she had on a beautiful wedding gown, a fifties-style satin that must have been what she\u2019d worn on their wedding day. She looked about twenty, and her gray hair was a soft brown.</p><p>\u201cAnd we were happy for many a year.\u201d Harvey kissed her cheek. His overalls were gone and so were about thirty pounds. He had on a black suit and a white shirt with a black western tie. Wedding suit. \u201cIf I just coulda given you children ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now. I was happy. Didn\u2019t need no kids. You were a handful, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Tears ran down her face. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Harvey Nutt. Always will.\u201d</p><p>Now I was crying. Because the more they talked, the more they faded out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leavin\u2019 ya, Glory. Finally goin\u2019 upstairs now that we\u2019ve figured things out.\u201d Emmie took a blue bandanna from Harvey and dabbed at her wet cheeks. \u201cBe happy, girl. I hope ya find a good man ya want to keep by yer side forever. But iffen ya don\u2019t, well, be safe and take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stay away from them demons!\u201d Harvey shouted. But it was hard to hear him. Because he and Emmie Lou were winking out.</p><p>I blinked and rubbed my eyes, then realized I was truly alone in the back room. I looked down and saw a blue and white bandanna on the floor. When I picked it up, it was still damp from Emmie Lou\u2019s tears.</p><p>That did it. I lay my head on the table and sobbed like my heart was breaking. And maybe it was. To have a love like that . . .</p><p>\u201cBabe? Glory? What the hell is wrong?\u201d</p><p>I looked up. One of the men in my life. A good one? Maybe. The good one? Probably not.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cRay?\u201d I mopped at my eyes with that bandanna.</p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He pulled me up to face him.</p><p>\u201cThe Nutts are gone.\u201d I sniffed and tried to make myself presentable. I hadn\u2019t seen Israel Caine in ages, and now I had to face him with a red nose and swollen eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t eat nuts anyway. Why\u2019re you crying about that?\u201d He smiled and pushed my hair back from my face. \u201cGet a grip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean Harvey and Emmie Lou Nutt, my resident ghosts. They made up after fighting for decades, and now they\u2019re finally on their way to Heaven. They\u2019ll never haunt my shop again.\u201d I choked back a sob, still sad but realizing that was pretty selfish of me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. Can\u2019t have creepy stuff like that scaring the customers.\u201d Ray looked down at the ruined dresses on the table. \u201cWhoa, what happened here? Looks like motor oil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to share my run-in with a demon. He and Rafe already had issues. If he knew Rafe had brought a demon into my life . . . \u201cMy ghosts left my customers alone as long as they were good people. The Nutts hated vamp hunters and were a big help when Westwood was after me.\u201d Now maybe this was something Ray would like to hear about.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Good ghosts.\u201d He looked around the back room. \u201cSo where\u2019s your knight in shining armor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I smiled, wondering if Ray was jealous. I have and always will be a fangirl for this hot rock star.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Blade, but maybe you have the dog panting after you now too.\u201d Ray tried to put his arm around me, but I slipped out of reach.</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s a shape-shifter, not a dog. I love dogs, by the way, but now he\u2019s staying in human form and he\u2019s my roommate. When you sing at his club, you\u2019ll have to treat him with respect, Ray.\u201d I kept some distance between us. \u201cWhere\u2019s your new girlfriend, the vampire who, as you so delicately put it, popped your cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a temporary thing. We\u2019ve moved on. Sienna came with me to check out the music festival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You and Sienna\u2014\u201d Sienna Star was another singer, and they\u2019d had a hit together but nothing more as far as I knew.</p><p>\u201cNot together, though the tabloids think so, especially since our duet went platinum.\u201d Ray came close and ran a finger down the vee of my blouse. \u201cI\u2019m still available if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not asking. Guess who\u2019s still alive and kicking. No. Guess who\u2019s undead and annoying as hell.\u201d I moved out of reach again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite.\u201d Ray grinned and showed fang. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent Westwood.\u201d This time I grinned as I waited to see his reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I saw you take him out with his own crossbow.\u201d Ray sat on the stool.</p><p>\u201cThe ever-helpful Greg Kaplan, drug pusher and EV, turned him, and he\u2019s now one of those evil vampires he hated so much. Don\u2019t you love it?\u201d I sat in the chair on the other side of the room. I really didn\u2019t want Ray too close to me, if he picked up on smells like Richard and Flo had . . .</p><p>\u201cI say let\u2019s get a stake and put that creep out of his misery.\u201d Ray was right in front of me and pulling me into his arms before I could stop him. \u201cHe almost killed you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over that urge. Now he just wants me to help him get his billions back. Trust me, I\u2019m going to make him pay through the nose before I think about taking the bastard out again.\u201d I watched Ray\u2019s face and knew the moment he figured out my scent.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d He shoved me back and put a good five feet between us. \u201cYou\u2019re having sex with that damned shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ray.\u201d I could see he was furious. With me, with Rafe, even with himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll those weeks I played the fool, begging you to sleep with me. \u2018Oh, no, Ray, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m saving myself for Jerry.\u2019 Damn it to everlasting hell.\u201d He picked up the wooden stool and threw it at the steel back door where it shattered with a crash.</p><p>\u201cRay, I didn\u2019t plan it. It just happened. I\u2019ve known Rafe for five years. We\u2019ve lived together. He\u2019s saved my life.\u201d I shut up when I saw this was futile and sounding desperate. I held out my hand. \u201cRay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Not unless you plan to strip off and fuck me right here and now.\u201d Ray\u2019s face was hard, and I\u2019d never seen him look so cold or sound so bitter and heartless.</p> <p>Something sick and twisted inside me reared its head and shouted, \u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me, Rock Star?\u201d I slid my panties down my legs and kicked them across the room, then cleared the table and jumped on it. \u201cCome and get me.\u201d I grinned and spread my legs. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d I hiked my skirt in case he wasn\u2019t clear on the \u201cget me\u201d part.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what the hell is this?\u201d Ray stared at me like I was a stranger.</p><p>That look brought me down to earth. What the hell was I doing? I sat up and swiped at stupid tears.</p><p>\u201cMissed your chance.\u201d I pulled down my skirt and hopped down. \u201cBesides, that would only prove that I care about your feelings enough to help you get even with Rafe. If you\u2019re keeping score.\u201d I dropped back into my chair. Dear God, but I\u2019d almost made a huge mistake. What was the matter with me? Ray still looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. He wouldn\u2019t be wrong. \u201cYou want me to do it out of pity, Ray?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell? If I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d hate me later, I\u2019d be inside you right now.\u201d Ray picked up the pieces of the stool and slammed them on the table. \u201cHow could you sleep with that shifter, Glory? I thought you were in love with Blade, so I could kind of respect that. Where is the Scot, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of town.\u201d I probably shouldn\u2019t have said it. It only gave Ray ammunition.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. So how long has this affair been going on? Were you two going at it the whole time Valdez was playing bodyguard?\u201d Ray shook his head. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d feel sorry for Blade, but this may do it. Dumb bastard was paying the shifter\u2019s salary, big bucks from what I understand, and the V-man was getting a little somethin\u2019 somethin\u2019 from you on the side as well. Pretty good job, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, Ray. When you and I were together, Rafe and I had never . . .\u201d I sighed. \u201cHell, why am I explaining myself to you? You think I\u2019m a slut? Fine. I guess that\u2019s all I am to you. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve hurt your feelings, but who I sleep with is really none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m just the fool who came here because you asked me to.\u201d Ray picked up the broken stool leg, which looked very much like a stake, and I shuddered. \u201cThe idiot who agreed to sing in your lover\u2019s club. As a favor to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re paying you. And wait till you meet his partner, Nadia. She\u2019s just your type. Beautiful with a world of experience.\u201d I stalked over and jerked the piece of wood out of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Afraid I\u2019ll stake you in a fit of jealousy?\u201d Ray shook his head. \u201cThe hell of it, Glory girl, is that I am jealous. And as much as I\u2019m hurting, I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d His expression promised pain of another kind.</p><p>\u201cRay, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d He was. Not for myself. I knew he wouldn\u2019t lay a hand on a woman. Had always known it. But there was a violence simmering inside him now that I\u2019d never seen before. It made his bright blue eyes into laser beams that were almost painful to stare into, but I couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the fledgling vampire, who\u2019d needed me to guide him, anymore. This man had come into his power and knew it. He could be dangerous but leashed it now. Barely. Insanely, part of me was turned on by it and still wanted to jump his bones. I backed up, to give myself space.</p><p>\u201cJump his bones.\u201d I swear I heard a voice in my head saying it.</p><p>\u201cThe person I\u2019d like to ram that piece of wood through isn\u2019t you, sweet thing. It\u2019s that damned shifter. That dog who\u2019s tasted you\u201d\u2014Ray jerked me into his arms\u2014\u201cseen you naked and made you scream his name when you came.\u201d He nuzzled my neck, his fangs scratching across my jugular. \u201cHe did make you come, didn\u2019t he, babe? Because if he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Ray.\u201d I shoved him away, my heart pounding, the makeshift stake shaking in my hand. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, play this twisted game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you can.\u201d I told my inner bad girl to shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a game to me.\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes dimmed. \u201cI was never playing with you. That\u2019s the hell of it.\u201d</p> <p>My heart stalled at the pure misery in that confession, and for a moment I wanted to soothe him and kiss away his pain. Couldn\u2019t do it because something in me wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to stop at just a kiss. I bit my trembling lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray. All I can tell you is to remember you\u2019re a professional. Sing in Rafe\u2019s club. Sing for Flo\u2019s wedding. Do whatever you need to at the music festival, but forget about anything we once had going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never had anything going, Glory.\u201d Ray jerked the stake from my fingers as easily as if I hadn\u2019t gripped it tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I played things too safe with you. Like I would with a human female. Obviously I didn\u2019t have a clue how to deal with an ancient vampire.\u201d He smiled and walked to the back door, turning the dead bolt. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to find out. Maybe this Nadia will give me some pointers. Then I\u2019ll be back. Because for some reason, maybe because you aren\u2019t easy to get, you fascinate me. And now that I know you can be unfaithful to Blade? All bets are off.\u201d He tossed the stake onto the table. \u201cSee you around.\u201d He stepped outside and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cGo after him.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, tempted. Wrong. I rubbed my forehead. Concussion. Hearing voices now. Could things get any worse? The phone rang again. Guess so. Blade. I had to answer it this time. At least he couldn\u2019t smell me from Florida. My cheeks went hot with guilt as I punched the button to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana! Why the hell haven\u2019t you been answering your phone? Are you all right?\u201d Jerry sounded truly worried. Which just made me feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Lost my phone. Finally found it tonight. Sorry if you were concerned.\u201d How easily I lied. Had I always been this glib? This manipulative?</p><p>\u201cEverything all right there?\u201d His voice was quiet, as if there might be someone else in the room with him.</p><p>\u201cSure. How\u2019s your business coming?\u201d I picked the stake up off the table. I was saving it. You never knew when one could come in handy. I might use it on my own forehead if this voice didn\u2019t shut up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mess here. I\u2019m interviewing new managers right now. Then Richard called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I dropped the wood with a thud.</p><p>\u201cHe wants a bachelor party. It\u2019ll have to be pretty close to the wedding. I\u2019ll be here for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need my help? With the party?\u201d I collapsed in the chair with relief.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll handle it from here. Thank God all he wants is poker and cigars. I\u2019ll get Damian to bring some of that potent brew we had at his house. We\u2019ll get the man roaring drunk and have a fine time.\u201d</p><p>I heard a knock on my back door. \u201cSounds great, Jerry. I\u2019ve got to go, someone\u2019s here. See you when you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Take care.\u201d He hung up without another word.</p><p>Hmm. Pretty abrupt, but we didn\u2019t gush at each other, usually exchanging love words only in bed. I couldn\u2019t stress about it. I walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg Kaplan. Let me in. We need to talk about your party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d I hurried to shove the broken pieces of stool into the bathroom, leaving the one leg that would work as a stake under a soiled dress, then opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the party? I thought you had my order all figured out. But the event\u2019s now this Wednesday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if you want good eats, you never should have played hardball with Westwood on the phone. Simon\u2019s furious.\u201d Greg strolled in, a shit-eating grin on his face. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door. \u201cI was thinking that Simon and Westwood would try to screw me out of my payoff for helping them. So I needed some of my reward up front.\u201d I put my hands on my hips. \u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d get that, Greg. You\u2019ve been around Simon long enough to know how he does business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he always comes out on top.\u201d Greg frowned down at the stained dress. \u201cThat one\u2019s ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, an accident. So what are you here for? To spank me?\u201d I got between him and the table.</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, Glory, that sounded like an invitation.\u201d His eyes lit up, and he had a look on his face that seemed vaguely familiar. \u201cIf you\u2019d been that much fun in New York, I might not have wiped your memory clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, Greg. Am I getting my car or not? I won\u2019t do the video without one, and I want it up front.\u201d I poked his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, I brought you a car all right. A loaner.\u201d He tossed a set of keys on the table. \u201cThe tow truck will be here later to haul away that piece of crap you used to drive.\u201d He chuckled and sat in the only chair. \u201cHow long you had that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. It will cost more to get it fixed than it\u2019s worth, so it\u2019s salvage now. I don\u2019t need a loaner; I need a car that I can own, free and clear. I told Westwood that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWestwood\u2019s broke. He can\u2019t buy you a pair of roller skates, Glo. And it\u2019s Saturday night. Even Simon can\u2019t get you a clear title on a new car until Monday.\u201d Greg opened a bag he\u2019d brought with him and pulled out a tortilla chip. He shoved it into his mouth and crunched. \u201cMmm. Don\u2019t know how Simon makes these, but they taste like the real deal. Want one?\u201d He held out the bag.</p><p>\u201cNo. Last time I ate some of Simon\u2019s food I ended up unconscious.\u201d I inhaled corn and listened to more crunching. Could I trust the food at Flo\u2019s party? \u201cIt had better be okay at the party. No funny business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all those area vampires there? Simon\u2019s a businessman. He\u2019s counting on using this party to get his catering gig up and running. We\u2019ll make big bucks on these snacks.\u201d Greg ate another chip. \u201cDon\u2019t be paranoid, Glory. You want your party to be a success, you\u2019ll get this stuff and serve it. Wednesday?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, well, it\u2019s when I could get the club.\u201d I knew the ladies would flip if I brought out chips and salsa for vampires. Combined with a hot male dancer, it would be a party Aggie sure couldn\u2019t top.</p><p>Greg smiled. \u201cGet with the program, Glory. If Westwood calls for you to come do the video, you\u2019d better show up, new car or not. If I can\u2019t take back a guarantee from you on that, I\u2019m afraid bad things will start to happen to those you love.\u201d Greg crammed another chip into his mouth. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll blow off the p.r. opportunity. No snacks at your ladies\u2019 night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like threats, Greg. This is my deal. Leave my friends out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Israel Caine? That fledgling vampire just left here. He\u2019d be Simon\u2019s guest at the energy vacuum pump right now if I\u2019d had orders to take him out.\u201d Greg laughed. \u201cCaine never even saw me in that alley. You\u2019d think he\u2019d remember all the trouble you\u2019ve had back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Leave Ray alone.\u201d I would call Ray the minute this creep left and warn him to keep his bodyguard with him. I assumed he still had Brittany, his shape-shifter, on the payroll.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead and warn him. Warn the bride too. She was shoe shopping at the mall earlier. Two of our men tailed Florence into Nordstrom and would have had no problem getting her and her three pairs of shoes back to the compound.\u201d Greg finished the last chip and crumpled the bag into a ball. \u201cSeems she favors black patent for spring. Couldn\u2019t decide on the pumps or the sandals so she bought both.\u201d</p><p>A chill shuddered through me. \u201cRichard will turn that compound into a wasteland if you harm one hair on Flo\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Greg smiled. \u201cHe could try. Note to Glory: Holy water doesn\u2019t work on Simon or our goddess.\u201d He aimed his bag at a trash can in the corner of the room and hit the shot. \u201cScore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only scoring around here is the zip your team gets when it tries to harm my friends.\u201d I slammed my fist into his nose and blood spurted. \u201cWestwood and the EVs can kiss his billions bye-bye if any of my friends are dragged off to EV central.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Glory. You broke my nose.\u201d Greg glared at me, his hands trying to stem the blood flow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a point, Gregory. I want my new car, and I\u2019ll come when Westwood calls. No car, no video. I\u2019m essential to Westwood\u2019s plans, and he\u2019d better not forget it.\u201d I grabbed Greg\u2019s shirt and dragged him to the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Greg gasped but kept his hands over his bloody nose. I think he was in shock at my sudden attack, because he didn\u2019t fight me.</p><p>\u201cAnd if one vampire gets so much as a twinge from any of the EV goodies, there will be hell to pay.\u201d I opened the back door and used my foot on his backside to shove Greg out into the alley. \u201cAsk your girlfriend, Aggie, about this. I\u2019ve got a demon connection now, and I\u2019m not afraid to use it.\u201d I slammed the door and locked it.</p><p>\u201cDemon connection is right, girlfriend. You have no idea how close a connection it is.\u201d The voice in my head laughed until I wanted to tear my hair out.</p><p>\u201cWould that demon connection be me?\u201d Rafe grinned at me from across the room where he\u2019d obviously come in from the shop side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it.\u201d I ran to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cYou have any idea how glad I am to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why don\u2019t you show me?\u201d He leaned down to kiss me, his mouth hot and dangerously knowing.</p><p>I indulged myself for a long and satisfying moment until Rafe pulled back.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what that was all about. Kaplan threaten you?\u201d</p> <p>I slid out of his arms. \u201cWorse. He threatened Ray and Flo.\u201d I rummaged among the dresses on the table for my cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got to warn them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that.\u201d Rafe frowned down at the broken stool leg on the table. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay found out about you and me. Didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d I hit speed dial for the rock star and got voice mail. I left a message for him to call me back. \u201cHe might not return my call. I wonder if he brought Brittany with him. We should call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Come here first.\u201d Rafe pulled me into his arms again. \u201cHow badly did he take it?\u201d He glanced at the stool leg. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend you get alone with him in the alley anytime soon.\u201d I leaned my head against his chest and listened to his strong heartbeat. \u201cIt was horrible, Rafe. He was hurt, furious. You remember how he was with me.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s arms tightened around me. \u201cHell, yes. He ran around naked in front of you every chance he got. Tried everything to get into your pants. Never did, though, did he?\u201d There was a world of satisfaction in those words.</p><p>I leaned back. \u201cAs far as you know.\u201d I shoved and put my hands on my hips, then remembered that my panties were still on the floor in the corner of the room where I\u2019d tossed them. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun to explain. \u201cLet me make things clear. I am my own woman. I can sleep with whomever I please.\u201d I still held the cell phone, too aware of the man I\u2019d talked to earlier.</p><p>\u201cSo Caine got to you.\u201d Rafe wasn\u2019t smiling as he dug out his own phone from his pocket. His jeans were snug enough to make me lick my lips. Ridiculous to notice that right now.</p><p>\u201cI felt sorry for Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s okay.\u201d Rafe\u2019s grin was back. \u201cPoor pitiful rock star. I can work with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot her on speed dial.\u201d Rafe pulled out his phone.</p><p>Rafe and Brit had been an item once but had parted in L.A. and not on such good terms. Both shape-shifters, Brittany thought I took advantage of Rafe\u2019s loyalty and worked him way too many hours. The fact that she\u2019d been right had ramped up my guilt and left us on not great terms either.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that convenient.\u201d Oops, my jealousy was showing. Better deflect. \u201cAnyway, remember, Ray\u2019s supposed to sing at your club Thursday. If he doesn\u2019t because you two get into it over me, Nadia will be pissed.\u201d</p><p>Rafe pushed me against the back door. \u201cMight be worth it. Caine\u2019s arrogant, called me a dog. Always wanted me in my place, which in his world was at his feet or on the floor. It wasn\u2019t easy doing my gig knowing you were sharing his bed.\u201d He pressed his body against mine, his breath hot against my cheek. \u201cI wanted to be the one holding you through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d I slid my arms up around his neck. \u201cNothing happened between Ray and me. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings happened, all right. Just not what Caine wanted.\u201d Rafe lowered his head and kissed me tenderly. \u201cSo I\u2019ll steer clear of the bastard. Cause I got what I wanted. Plan on getting it again too. Real soon.\u201d He kissed me again, this time with a hunger that could have headed toward something more if there hadn\u2019t been a knock on the door from the shop.</p><p>I tugged on his hair, the soft curls much finer than the Labradoodle fur he\u2019d worn. \u201cGot to get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And we need to warn your friends. We\u2019ll continue this later.\u201d Rafe eased back.</p><p>I took a breath, then walked to the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m swamped out here. Can you give me a hand?\u201d Erin was flushed, and I could see she had a good half dozen customers roaming the shop with items in their hands. Good business.</p><p>\u201cGive me two minutes to make a phone call.\u201d I smiled and slammed the door, then hit the speed dial for Flo. Voice mail. Left a message for her to call me. Same for Richard. I just hoped they were together and practicing for the honeymoon again. I heard Rafe on the phone with Brittany. He was telling her about the EV threat, so she was here and on Ray guard duty. Okay, then. I opened the door again and stepped into the shop.</p><p>\u201cHold up, Goth Girl. Step away from the black. Try on this silk blouse. It\u2019s definitely your color, and think how shocked your parents will be when you wear it at home on spring break. Daddy tight with the purse strings since you pierced everything? Play it smart. Go home and pretend you\u2019ve seen the light. Take out the safety pins, put on colors and watch Daddy melt. After he raises your allowance, come back and buy this!\u201d I took her arm and steered her to the Goth girl\u2019s dream, a black satin cape and thigh-high black leather boots studded with silver.</p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d She looked uncertainly at her friend, who was even more pierced than she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gagging.\u201d The friend was no help.</p><p>\u201cIf you hate it, after the break, have it dry-cleaned, and I\u2019ll buy it back from you.\u201d</p><p>That got her attention, and she decided to try it on, and two other colorful blouses. I could hear her muttering about her dad stroking out when he saw her, obviously an added incentive.</p><p>Two hours later, I had rung up six sales and convinced three students that I was psychic. Okay, so I used my mind reading to help things along.</p><p>I moved in on another student who was fumbling through the blouse rack. \u201cYou\u2019re student teaching kindergarten this semester, am I right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl gasped and looked at her boyfriend. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I overheard something. Anyway, you look fine if you were planning to teach Serial Killing 101. But you\u2019re scaring the little kiddies.\u201d I dragged her to the skirts. \u201cTry one of these print skirts. And ballet flats instead of combat boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her in black.\u201d The boyfriend was obviously not on board. But then he probably had trouble seeing her through his guy-liner and mascara. I could have told him a fresh tube would take care of his clumping problem.</p> <p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll also like her when she\u2019s hired next year and earning a paycheck. Am I right?\u201d I smiled and assessed him. Slacker. The girl could do better. I handed her three skirts to try on and herded her toward the dressing room. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to class, Stacy. Check him out. This guy will never graduate or work, as long as you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d Stacy was wide-eyed and glanced back at eyelash boy, who was deep into the vintage comic books.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in here before. It\u2019s on your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How do you know so much about Rod?\u201d She held up the print skirt, then grabbed a red blouse to go with it. Definitely getting with the program.</p><p>\u201cGut feeling. He\u2019s reading comics. When\u2019s the last time you saw him reading a textbook?\u201d I had her attention now. \u201cCheck things out. Ask someone who\u2019s in those classes he\u2019s supposed to be taking. You\u2019ve got a lot on the ball, don\u2019t sell yourself short.\u201d I smiled and saw Erin wave at me. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Stacy stared at the blouse rack, a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>Erin grabbed me. \u201cI almost forgot to tell you. Rafe left a message before he took off. He\u2019s picking you up at three o\u2019clock to take you to see his new club.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a quarter till now. How\u2019s my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could use a quick brush and some lipstick.\u201d Erin headed back to the register, and I followed her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Can you handle things alone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s slowing down. Go. Have fun.\u201d Erin began taking tags off of Stacy\u2019s new skirts. \u201cWhen\u2019s Mr. Blade coming back?\u201d</p> <p>I stopped in my tracks. \u201cUh, not sure. This week sometime. The wedding\u2019s on Sunday. He has to be back before then.\u201d</p><p>Erin started punching numbers into the register but paused to glance at me. \u201cYou two over now? Since you and Rafe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how things are going to shake out. But keep my love life to yourself. Okay?\u201d I grabbed Erin\u2019s arm. I figure I must have squeezed pretty hard because she suddenly looked alarmed. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not going to fire you or anything, but just don\u2019t mention Rafe to Jerry if he drops by and I\u2019m not here. I\u2019ve got a delicate situation going.\u201d</p><p>Stacy was all ears. \u201cBoyfriend trouble?\u201d She glanced back at Rod who\u2019d dropped a stack of comics on the counter, obviously expecting her to add them to her credit card bill. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure things out.\u201d If the guys don\u2019t kill each other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Glory. I\u2019m not saying a word to anybody.\u201d Erin looked a question at Stacy, and the girl sighed and nodded. \u201cCan\u2019t we give this girl a discount on these comics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Ten percent.\u201d I smiled at Stacy and headed for the back room. Oh, boy, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Jerry and Rafe meeting face-to-face. Truth though was that I missed Jerry. Just talking to him on the phone had reminded me how I loved his voice, loved the way he could take charge of a situation and you knew, just knew, that everything would be all right.</p><p>Yeah, but what if you didn\u2019t like the way he wanted things to go? Oh, hell. I was so mixed up, I didn\u2019t have a clue how I wanted things to go.</p> <p>I grabbed my purse, quickly fixing my makeup and hair by feel. I spotted those keys on the table. A loaner car. What could it be? A Mercedes like Jerry had tried to give me once? Or maybe a nice Cadillac. Not sporty but reliable. I\u2019d take it.</p><p>I unlocked the back door and cautiously stepped outside, looking both ways to make sure there was no danger before I checked the parking lot. My old Suburban was still there. The workers from Mugs and Muffins parked out back, a couple of beat-up economy cars. Diana, the owner, had a sleek Jaguar, and it was in its usual spot. Next to it was a beige\u2014or maybe it was a dirty white\u2014four-door station wagon. It had to be at least fifteen years old, and the back door was scraped and dented. I looked down at the keys in my hand. No way. I hit the remote and sure enough, the lights flashed. Damn Simon Destiny. He\u2019d sent me an ancient beater. Oh, but he was going to pay for this.</p><p>My phone rang, and I dug it out of my purse. Maybe Flo had finally gotten my message.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I see you\u2019ve found your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Simon. This is\u2014\u201d I stopped in mid harangue. \u201cHow do you know where I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, my dear, that Westwood is a genius where surveillance is concerned. It took a matter of moments for Gregory to plant bugs that give me sight and sound in your alley, your shop and your back room, of course.\u201d Simon laughed as the implications of that sank in.</p><p>\u201cYou slimy worm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you\u2019re getting it now. I have you exactly where I want you. Unless, of course, you don\u2019t care if I send a certain rather interesting video to Jeremy Blade\u2019s cell phone. I have several to choose from.\u201d Simon waited a beat. \u201cThere\u2019s the one where your friend Florence says she can smell sex on you and you admit you\u2019re sleeping with your shifter.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, imagining Jerry\u2019s fury and pain.</p><p>\u201cOr there\u2019s the more graphic image of you and Rafael kissing against the door. Then you tell him the rocker never had you, but of course he, Rafael, could have you anytime, anywhere.\u201d Simon hummed. \u201cOr perhaps that\u2019s just implied in the body language. I\u2019m sure Blade can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Gloriana, be nice. I know you want me to cooperate. Unless you no longer care what Blade thinks of you? But surely you care if he comes gunning for your new lover.\u201d Simon tsked. \u201cAncient vampires like Blade are so predictable. Always wanting to tear out someone\u2019s throat. But how would that work against a man with demon blood?\u201d</p><p>Of course Jerry would rip first and ask questions later. Because Rafe had betrayed his trust. And what about me? How would Jerry feel about what I\u2019d done? I had a sick feeling that I was going to find out before this was all over.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really very simple, Gloriana. Stop making demands. Do exactly what I say, when I say it. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>I stared down at the phone, knowing Simon could probably see my reaction. I looked around, but the cameras were well hidden. Back inside, I tore the back room apart until I finally found a minicam and microphone on top of a dusty shelf. I smashed them to bits with the seat of that broken stool. But there could be more. Didn\u2019t matter. Simon already had what he needed. I sank down on the chair and waited for Rafe. I\u2019d been outmaneuvered. I had no choice now. I was Simon\u2019s bitch.</p><p>\u201cMy bitch too, Glory. Wondering about that voice in your head? Guess who? It\u2019s Alesa. Alive and well and inside your chubby self. Get ready for some fun \u2019cause you\u2019re a hell girl now.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>I had a demon inside me. Talking to me. No. Had to be some kind of hallucination. Weird meltdown from all the stress I\u2019d been under. Should I tell Rafe about it? I started to, but he was so excited to show me the club that I didn\u2019t have the heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Rafe.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe the dark, cavelike place he\u2019d shown me before had been transformed into this trendy club. It was still dark, but now it had a sexy vibe. Deep purple walls glowed under special lighting, and those red N-V logos were slashed behind a sleek chrome and black bar and in neon on a black leather-wrapped stage. One end had been cleared of the comfy clutter of tables and chairs and now would be a mosh pit in front of the stage when it wasn\u2019t a dance floor. Cushioned booths lined the walls, and there were even private balconies hugging the edge of a vaulted ceiling.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have come together without Nadia.\u201d Rafe grinned, his arm around my shoulders. \u201cWhen she takes on a project, she brings in her own crew and there\u2019s no stopping her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the ceiling?\u201d I looked up, impressed by the wooden beams and vintage chandeliers.</p><p>\u201cShe had them blow it out. There used to be storage up there, but a weak floor. Now we\u2019ve got great acoustics and those balconies. Wait till you hear the sound system.\u201d Rafe nodded toward where technicians were rolling in massive speakers. \u201cRay\u2019s crew just arrived. They\u2019re already setting up. He\u2019s wasting no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. Has he seen you yet?\u201d I doubted it. Rafe wasn\u2019t bruised or bleeding, but then I hadn\u2019t seen Ray either. Was his body out back in the Dumpster? I didn\u2019t want to think about how the two would deal with each other. And what about Simon\u2019s latest threat? I sure hadn\u2019t shared that with Rafe. He\u2019d probably be all for sending Jerry that video. No, I\u2019d just do Simon\u2019s bidding and deal with this hatred that burned like acid in my gut all by myself.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But he\u2019s been here. One of the crew said he left with Nadia.\u201d Rafe shouted to a man who came in carrying a load of glasses. \u201cHang here for a minute. I\u2019ve got to handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I just stood there. Ray and Nadia already. No one could accuse Ray of dragging his feet.</p><p>\u201cYour fault, clueless. You shoulda had him on that table in the back room when you had the chance. Now the rocker\u2019s moved on. Listen to me next time.\u201d</p><p>So I hadn\u2019t imagined this. But did she really think I\u2019d take advice from a demon who\u2019d managed to get stuck inside me? From her attitude, I\u2019d guess if she could move on, she would have. Just my luck. But how could this happen? Richard had doused her with holy water. Prayed. What next? Would she make me do demonic stuff like bite the heads off of chickens or have wild monkey sex with one of the good-looking shifters working on the lighting? Believe me, the urge was there. For sex anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forget her. Bachelorette party coming up. Such a big space. How would we fill it? And did I give a rat\u2019s ass? I had to, for Flo\u2019s sake. She\u2019d called me back while I\u2019d been waiting for Rafe, and I\u2019d told her about Simon\u2019s threat. So she and Richard were alerted. But I figured they could paint targets on their backs now and Simon wouldn\u2019t aim, not with the ammunition he\u2019d loaded in the gun he held against my heart.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a great venue?\u201d</p><p>I jumped a foot. Fantastic. Now my vamp skills totally blew. \u201cNate!\u201d I hugged him and smiled. \u201cSorry. Daydreaming. Flo\u2019s bachelorette party is coming up. I\u2019m looking for a male dancer. You want to throw on a G-string? Strut your stuff?\u201d I winked at him. I\u2019d seen his \u201cstuff,\u201d and he was hot chocolate on a cold night. \u201cYou could earn big tips.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere you go. Get him to strip off now and audition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting. But Ray\u2019s got rhythm. Me? Not so much.\u201d Nate grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou have other talents. Ray\u2019s lucky you\u2019ve put up with him and his new lifestyle.\u201d I\u2019d already checked out the crew here. Except for an occasional delivery guy, everyone was either a shifter or a vampire. Nathan Burke, Ray\u2019s manager and still a mortal, was in danger of being on someone\u2019s menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known since grade school that Ray was special, but a vampire? Hell, we both thought they were comic book fiction till he woke up as one.\u201d Nate looked over his shoulder. \u201cSpeaking of . . . I\u2019m not making this up. That guy by the amp is giving me thirsty looks. I\u2019m beginning to recognize the signs, not to mention his fangs are showing. See what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to miss.\u201d I sent the guy a serious mental threat to his future sex life, and he turned away. \u201cThat AB negative running through your veins is like fine champagne to us fanged ones.\u201d I linked my arm through his. \u201cThe guy\u2019s going to leave you alone for now, but just to be safe, don\u2019t come here again unless Ray\u2019s with you. Most of this crew is on a liquid diet.\u201d I fought my own fangs. AB negative was my personal favorite.</p> <p>\u201cSo who are you with these days, Glory? The way you left Hollywood after the Grammys, I figured you were finally on your own.\u201d Nate pulled me close. \u201cYou want to sip some of my wine? Come back to my hotel room. We can get comfortable, then you can have all you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I grabbed his hand and tugged him toward the door. From the look on his face, I\u2019d shocked him.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Now you\u2019re acting like one of us.\u201d Alesa was proud.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Rafe was suddenly right in front of us and looking dangerous, even with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cNate invited me back to his hotel for a late night snack.\u201d I smiled and leaned against him. \u201cYou know what I am, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d He touched his throat, and there were snickers from a few of the vamps working. He turned to glare at them, and laughter was quickly drowned out by the buzz of power tools.</p> <p>\u201cYou trying to stop her?\u201d Nate didn\u2019t let me go, which made me respect him and pity him. He didn\u2019t have a clue how far in over his head he was.</p><p>\u201cOoo. Are they going to fight over you? Bloodshed. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d What had I been thinking? I didn\u2019t drink from mortals. I had to get a grip on this demon inside me. I shoved my fangs and my urges back where they belonged and kissed Nate\u2019s cheek. \u201cThanks for the offer, Nathan, but better not. Now head out and be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Glory?\u201d Nate glared at Rafe. \u201cThis guy\u2019s not forcing you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m my own woman, Nate.\u201d I said this to Rafe too. I shoved Nate toward the door. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grabbed a suit jacket and briefcase, and practically sprinted for the door. I\u2019d like nothing better than to take a hike myself. I actually took a step toward freedom.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Rafe grabbed my arm. \u201cSo you\u2019re your own woman. Not mine, obviously. Does that mean you\u2019re going back to Blade when he hits town?\u201d</p><p>I looked down to where he gripped my arm. He was strong, and his fingers would leave a mark. He let me go with a curse.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a break.\u201d A wave of heat hit me. What was that about? \u201cWe hooked up. Does that mean I\u2019m yours now? I don\u2019t think so. And if I don\u2019t want to hurt Jerry any more than necessary, that\u2019s my choice.\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou tell him, girlfriend.\u201d Alesa approved.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it drives me crazy when other men come on to you.\u201d Rafe glared back. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Act like it means nothing to me? You know\u2014\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cDamn it, Glory. You know it meant everything to me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stay mad. I slid my arms around Rafe\u2019s waist. \u201cI get that, Rafe. But I saw what our news did to Ray, and he and I were just friends. Jerry and I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it. He made you. You two have been off and on for centuries. Blah, blah, blah. I\u2019ve heard all this before.\u201d Rafe stayed rigid, not even relaxing when I ran my hands up and down his back. \u201cYou forget that when I was at your feet, wearing a fur overcoat, I heard all your excuses, all your reasons why you couldn\u2019t give up on old Jer.\u201d He backed away, throwing my hands off of him. \u201cGuess nothing\u2019s changed. Except that I got to enjoy your bed and your body for a change.\u201d He looked me up and down, like he was wondering if it had been worth the wait.</p><p>I smacked him right across his handsome face, then stared at my hand like it was an alien being. Inside, Alesa laughed like a wild thing. Damn her.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Rafe grabbed my hand and pulled me to him, the look in his eyes warning me that I had started something dangerous.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d I slipped a button free on my blouse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what got into me. Things have changed. I swear it. I\u2019m confused, that\u2019s all. I can\u2019t just throw away those centuries with Jerry if this isn\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The real deal?\u201d Rafe shook his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s real and what\u2019s not? I sure as hell don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard you lie to people and never blink. I can do the same. It\u2019s how we survive. Damn it, every time you block your thoughts\u201d\u2014he gave me a hard look\u2014\u201clike you\u2019re doing now, I figure you\u2019re lying about something, and it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at you, Rafael.\u201d I understood. I eased closer. I sent him a mental message about what I wasn\u2019t wearing under my skirt. That hard look heated up. Progress.</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to play me, Glory. I thought I meant more to you than that.\u201d He pulled me closer. \u201cI won\u2019t sneak around with you and then watch you go hit it with Blade when he gets back. I did that for too damn long, and it hurt too damn bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I\u2019m not going to treat you like that. You do mean more to me ...\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to hurt Jerry either. I looked around and realized this was a hell of a place for this kind of conversation \u201cCan you leave? Can we go back to our place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till Nadia gets back. There\u2019s too much to do before the opening.\u201d Rafe dropped my hand and whistled to a man behind the bar. \u201cJimmy, take Ms. St. Clair home. Make sure she\u2019s inside her apartment with the door locked before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, boss.\u201d Jimmy nodded. He was a shifter I\u2019d met in here once before, when Rafe had first rented the place.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go, Glory. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d Rafe waved me away, then strode over to talk to the men with the sound equipment.</p><p>I watched him, so strong and confident and so damned right. I guess I was a coward, afraid to make a choice. Afraid to come clean with Jerry. Modern women managed more than one man well enough, or seemed to on the TV shows I\u2019d seen. Problem was, I couldn\u2019t seem to get the hang of modern ways. I dressed modern, talked modern, but I was obviously still stuck back in the 1600s in some ways. Stupid. Because that was the very thing that bugged me about Jerry. He always treated me like that ancient female he\u2019d met back in the day, helpless and in need of a keeper. Damn, I\u2019d hate to think he\u2019d been right about me all along.</p><p>No. Ancient males were possessive and wouldn\u2019t change. Unfortunate it was the ancient ones that attracted me\u2014Jerry and Rafe. Ray wasn\u2019t ancient, but I\u2019d like to have a go at him too. Why couldn\u2019t I have them all?</p><p>\u201cYou can, you should. The more men, the merrier.\u201d Alesa was all for it. But I knew better than to think that would work. Who did I want? Rafe or Blade? Both of them meant so much to me. And I didn\u2019t have to choose yet. Rafe was here. Blade wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I locked the apartment door and waited until Jimmy clomped down the stairs. Did Rafe really think he could just send me to my room? No freakin\u2019 way. Sure he had work to do, but I was going back to that night club and talking to him. I had a point to make and knew just how I\u2019d do it. I changed clothes, then unlocked the door, stuffing my cell phone in one pocket of my jeans and my keys in the other.</p><p>I was going to try a different approach, a surprise attack that would catch Rafe off guard and hopefully make him listen to reason. I slipped down the stairs and out the front door. I looked both ways, hugging the shadows next to the building. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see what I did next.</p><p>It was really late, almost four in the morning now, and the street was deserted. Fine. I shifted and headed toward Rafe\u2019s club. It wasn\u2019t far, just a few blocks. Even if Simon had surveillance on the front of my apartment building, I doubt he\u2019d have noticed my change. I picked up the pace. Rafe was going to be so amazed, he was bound to soften toward me. I was counting on it.</p><p>The back door of the club was locked of course, but I waited until a delivery truck pulled up at the loading dock and the driver got out. I hid in the shadows as he rang a bell. Nadia must have paid a premium to get tables delivered this late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The steel door swung open and there was conversation, then the huge garage door came up with a groan and a crash. I darted inside while three men stepped into the truck. I kept to the shadows, slipping into the main room and looking for Rafe. He was behind the bar, and he\u2019d pulled out a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s and a glass. Great. I\u2019d driven him to drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Oops. I\u2019d been spotted by the human truck driver. I ran across the empty dance floor to the bar.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore her.\u201d The shifter carrying two tables laughed. \u201cOne of the owner\u2019s pets if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s head came up, and he stared at me. He shook his head and drained his glass. I just sat down in front of the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Rafe poured another drink and knocked it back.</p><p>Several of the men had stopped working to watch. A few of them laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d one of them called. \u201cWho\u2019s the bitch?\u201d</p> <p>Rafe leaped over the bar and was on him in a heartbeat. \u201cYou want to ask me that again?\u201d He had a fistful of the man\u2019s shirt. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man. Sorry.\u201d The man glanced at me, then at the rest of the gang who all got really quiet, then busy with hammers and electric drills and saws.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it for tonight. Clear out.\u201d Rafe grabbed the clipboard the delivery man thrust at him and signed. \u201cAll the tables inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The delivery man was confused as the work crew packed up their tools with quiet efficiency and exited the building in record time.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d Rafe followed him to the door, and I heard the garage door come down with a noisy clang.</p><p>I just sat there, not so sure this had been a good idea. If he\u2019d just smiled . . .</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, just laid down and looked at him with big eyes. What had he done to show he was sorry in the past? Oh, yeah. I rolled over and showed him my tummy.</p><p>Finally, he smiled with just a hint of dimple. \u201cA golden retriever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matched my hair.\u201d I wiggled and thumped my tail against the floor. Mental messaging seemed to be the way to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Rafe knelt down and rubbed the fur under my chin. \u201cSoft. How does it feel? To be a dog when I\u2019m human.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like it one damned bit to tell the truth. I rolled over again. The tummy up position had been way more vulnerable than I could deal with for more than a minute at a time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not great. How did you stand it all those years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a shifter, not a vampire, for one thing. We look at these things differently. And I was getting a big paycheck for the inconvenience.\u201d Rafe sat on the floor beside me. He put his hand on my head. \u201cSeriously. I want you to remember this feeling. I had to live with it a long damn time. Watch you go about your business, and see you as a desirable woman while I knew you never saw me as a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over. I\u2019m not doing that again.\u201d He looked around the club. \u201cBut this has to be a success. I\u2019m through with the bodyguard thing. When I cut myself off from my family\u2019s wealth, I had to take some jobs that weren\u2019t so great. Like dancing in Nadia\u2019s clubs. And doing dog duty for Blade. And those were the best of the lot.\u201d He turned to stare into my eyes. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you cut yourself off?\u201d I wondered if I should change back but felt maybe Rafe would share more about himself if I stayed in this dog persona. I wasn\u2019t physically uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t have fleas or anything. And the concrete floor wasn\u2019t cold. But I was definitely in a subservient position, and I didn\u2019t like that at all. Alesa hated it, and I was hot again. Guess that was my punishment when she was displeased. I mentally shot her the finger, then sucked it up and stayed put.</p><p>\u201cGranddad is head of the family. Because my branch has the demon taint, we have to be model citizens to be accepted in the shifter community. We\u2019re supposed to marry the right women, have the perfect children, always be above reproach. My brother pretends to go along with it, but I wanted to do things my way. So I took off.\u201d Rafe stroked my head like I used to do when I was upset.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, your brother \u2018pretends\u2019 to go along?\u201d I sighed. His hand felt good on me. Warm, soothing.</p><p>\u201cWe do have demon blood. It makes us enjoy being a little, okay, a lot wild at times.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cEthan keeps his stunts on the down low. I never bothered. It caused my family some grief. I haven\u2019t shown you that side of me yet, Glory. Because it would probably be too much for you. Like now.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, reading his mind. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that. You just veered into ick territory.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThought so. Brittany was up for it, but then she\u2019s a shifter. Like I said. Different point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging the subject now. I saw your eyes go red at the shop. That\u2019s part of the demon thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got a few dark powers. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to see me go there. But if I need them, I can call on the forces of evil.\u201d Rafe lifted his hand from my head. \u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch, though.\u201d He frowned. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, your dog is ringing.\u201d Nadia walked into the room, her high heels tapping on the concrete floor. \u201cAnd why the hell is the crew gone early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got enough done. The sound system and lighting are installed. The tables arrived. I let them go. The vamps needed to feed before dawn and the shifters ...\u201d Rafe shrugged, then jumped up and faced her. \u201cThey\u2019d earned a break. The second crew will be here in a few hours. I\u2019ll come back and supervise.\u201d He frowned down at me. \u201cGlory, shift and answer your damned phone.\u201d</p><p>I hated to. Blade? Simon? And shifting in front of the sophisticated Nadia made me feel awkward and vulnerable.</p><p>Rafe grinned. \u201cWhat? You naked inside that dog body?\u201d He\u2019d done his guard duty clothing optional.</p><p>Damn, I should have thought of that. But Nadia being here would have ruined that scenario anyway. I gave up and stood. The phone had stopped ringing, but I heard the sound that meant I had a voice mail. I trotted behind the bar, then shifted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not naked, just felt a little weird about shifting again.\u201d I straightened, then walked around to face both of them. \u201cNot my usual thing.\u201d</p><p>Nadia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t care what games you two play on your own time as long as the club gets ready.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cI see Ray\u2019s men were here and set up his special sound equipment. Now we\u2019ve got to rent a grand piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Rafe walked with her toward the stage while I dug my cell out of my pocket.</p><p>Uh-oh. Missed call from an unknown caller. I had a feeling that meant Greg, Simon or Westwood. I pressed a button and listened to the voice mail while at the other end of the room Rafe and Nadia argued over Ray\u2019s performance and the expense.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, we think we\u2019ve got the right location for the video shoot. Meet Kaplan behind your shop in ten minutes, and he\u2019ll lead you there. We want your input.\u201d Simon\u2019s voice. A command, not a request. I glanced at Rafe. He wasn\u2019t going to like this, but I had to go. I owed it to Rafe to tell him about it. No secrets. Our relationship was hanging by a thread already.</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d I eased up behind him.</p><p>\u201cOne minute.\u201d Rafe put his hand on Nadia\u2019s arm. \u201cGo ahead with the piano. It\u2019ll be like his Grammy performance. Right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It was sensational. Ray really gets the crowd going when he sits at a keyboard.\u201d I forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Nadia laughed, clearly pleased to have won the round with Rafe. \u201cRun along and enjoy the rest of the evening. I\u2019ll tell Ray. He\u2019s staying at my house.\u201d She gave me an inquiring look. \u201cI know you two used to be together, Glory. I hope that doesn\u2019t cause a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, have fun.\u201d I even managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure we will.\u201d Nadia laughed. \u201cAs I told you, there are no safe hotels for a vampire here in Austin. It will be so much better for Ray at my house than having his shifter keep housekeeping out of the room during the day.\u201d She nodded at me. \u201cYou understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly.\u201d I understood that Ray was putting his plan into motion at warp speed. Nadia would give him an up close and personal lesson in how ancient vampires played.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a winner.\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t bother to hide his satisfaction at the news. He picked up a paper. \u201cHere\u2019s the invoice for the tables. I\u2019ll lock up. Ray\u2019s already moved in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was getting his luggage.\u201d Nadia frowned. \u201cGlory, he said you\u2019d left him a message. For some reason he didn\u2019t seem inclined to call you back. Was it important?\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth at the slam. \u201cRay and I had a misunderstanding earlier, but I still care about him. There\u2019s been a threat against some of my friends. Rafe talked to Brittany, Ray\u2019s bodyguard, so she knows all about it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it handled now, but Ray should still be careful. I assume you have excellent security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. No vampire can sleep during the day without it.\u201d Nadia picked up the purse she\u2019d dropped on a table and slung the strap over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll keep an eye on Ray.\u201d She winked. \u201cSorry about the fight, but seems you and Ray have both moved on. Rafe, I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow night. Have fun, you two.\u201d She left without a backward glance.</p><p>\u201cNow are you going to tell me who called? Was it Blade?\u201d Rafe kept a table between us, not exactly taking Nadia\u2019s \u201chave fun\u201d to heart.</p><p>\u201cNo. Simon. He wants me to check out the site for the video. I\u2019ve got to meet Greg in the alley behind the shop in\u201d\u2014I glanced at my watch\u2014\u201cabout five minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Rafe moved in front of me and laid his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t trust those assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Rafe. I\u2019m going to do it. It\u2019s the only way to keep my friends safe. But come along, keep an eye on everyone if it makes you feel better.\u201d I put my hands over his. \u201cIt would make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why so cooperative with Simon all of a sudden?\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t release me, just gave me one of his probing and very intense looks.</p> <p>\u201cI had time to think about it. Seriously, what choice do I have? And maybe I\u2019ll get a paycheck at the end of this.\u201d I stepped back, and he released me. \u201cI can\u2019t live in fear, worried that he\u2019ll hurt someone I love to try to coerce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess I see your point. But I sure as hell don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d Rafe followed me to the back door. He pulled a key ring out of his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll both keep our eyes wide open. Any sign of a double cross, that this is a trap to bring you down, and we\u2019re out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Rafe, if Simon or Westwood wanted me dead, I\u2019d be gone already. Out at the EV compound I was unconscious. The goddess there could have sucked me dry, and I couldn\u2019t have done a damned thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. My fault. I never should have gone out there without backup.\u201d Rafe locked the door, set an alarm, then walked beside me around the building until we were on the sidewalk. It was really late now. This would have to be a quick trip.</p><p>\u201cNothing is your fault. Simon and Westwood are the bad guys here.\u201d I stopped Rafe and gave him a quick kiss. \u201cPlease be careful. I can\u2019t bear to see you hurt. Just watch and listen. Maybe we can learn something that can help us later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a man of action, Glory.\u201d Rafe put his hand behind my head and kissed me this time, his mouth hot, a claiming kiss.</p><p>\u201cMmmm. A man of action. I can feel that.\u201d I held on to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, action. I told you he could bring it.\u201d Alesa sighed. \u201cTakes me back. We once spent a solid week in bed.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. How creepy to think about Rafe and the slime sister inside me together. No, had to forget that. My plate was full enough with this video.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I grabbed his hand and dashed down the street. When we got to the shop, I could see my clerk inside reading a paperback book. No customers. Couldn\u2019t worry about that now. Rafe and I ran to the alley and found Greg sitting on the hood of that ancient white car.</p><p>\u201cAbout time. What\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Greg jumped off the car.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with her. You got a problem with that?\u201d Rafe shoved Greg until he hit the bumper.</p><p>\u201cNaw. Knock yourself out.\u201d Greg smiled. \u201cGlory, we\u2019re shifting out of here. Keep up. Simon\u2019s waiting.\u201d He whirled and, always a clich\u00e9, did the bat thing.</p><p>Rafe and I were right behind him. We flew out and over rooftops until we left the city lights behind. We were headed toward a part of Lake Travis I recognized, so Simon and Westwood had figured out the approximate location. When we came to the edge of the lake behind some houses, we landed and shifted back into our human forms. Simon and several other men walked out of the woods nearby. Westwood carried a crossbow. I wanted to hurl.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Rafe jumped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary prop. We also have wardrobe.\u201d Simon gestured, and a man brought out a video camera and tripod. Another carried a large suitcase. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen change locations. We\u2019re too close to those houses. This is all wrong.\u201d I looked around. \u201cWe climbed out of the water on a strip of rocks and sand. No houses in sight.\u201d</p><p>Simon frowned. \u201cKaplan, you and Bevis go up and look around. See if you can find a spot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Greg the bat and the suitcase guy took off.</p> <p>I turned to Westwood. \u201cYou pick this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t remember a damned thing because I was shot, remember?\u201d He looked defensive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be this great hunter.\u201d Rafe stayed close to me. \u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d have scouted out the area pretty well in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. And how\u2019d you even find me in the first place? You weren\u2019t shot then.\u201d I was stalling. I really didn\u2019t want any part of a play where I had to stand in front of a crossbow. To my relief Westwood laid it on the grass and looked around.</p><p>\u201cIt was all spur of the moment. We missed the shot at Caine\u2019s house but finally got word from my men on the water that you\u2019d escaped that way. So we parked and walked in. We tracked you for miles.\u201d He looked up when Greg landed. \u201cFind anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. This way, just a hundred yards or so. Perfect spot. You can walk it.\u201d Greg led the way through the trees.</p><p>When we came out into a clearing, I shuddered. If this wasn\u2019t the same spot, it was damned close. I remembered that night too well. We\u2019d had to swim for our lives, leaving Ray\u2019s house burning to the ground after Westwood and his men had shot flaming arrows into it. Ray, Valdez and I had climbed out of the freezing lake thinking we were finally safe, only to face Westwood\u2019s hellacious crossbow.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect.\u201d Westwood looked at me. \u201cCheck out Glory\u2019s face. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? This is like the place where you plugged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay off, Westwood.\u201d Rafe shoved Westwood back when he got too close to me. \u201cCan\u2019t you see this is upsetting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, poor little vampire. Having a flashback?\u201d He smiled and aimed the crossbow right at my heart.</p><p>That did it. Something snapped, and I pushed Rafe aside. Before Westwood had time to react, I\u2019d snatched that crossbow and flung it into the lake where it landed with a splash.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch! You aim that thing at me again, and I\u2019ll stuff it down your throat.\u201d I was shaking, but I wasn\u2019t backing down. I swallowed, the urges to throw up or scream both fighting for first place.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! We need that weapon for the video. Simon?\u201d Westwood didn\u2019t even have sense enough to know I was on the edge of doing something I really wasn\u2019t going to regret.</p><p>\u201cKaplan, jump into the lake and retrieve the bow.\u201d Simon actually looked amused. \u201cGloriana, calm down. We\u2019re just acting here. Westwood isn\u2019t going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right he\u2019s not.\u201d Rafe tried to put his arm around me, but I wasn\u2019t having it. I brushed him off, my focus on Westwood and his smirk. It was the damned superior look of a man who still thought he was the great hunter. No fang necklace, but I remembered it. Could imagine it hanging around his neck. Trophies from vampires he\u2019d killed like they were animals and not people who had friends and lovers who would grieve for them forever. A tear slid down my cheek, and I angrily knocked it away with my fist.</p><p>\u201cWestwood, we need her cooperation. Try to get along with Gloriana.\u201d Simon obviously issued an order this time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Westwood glared at me. \u201cI\u2019m not making nice with this bitch. She\u2019s done nothing but insult me. And now she\u2019s acting like she\u2019s got all these tender feelings.\u201d He curled his lip. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it. Come on, Glory, you tellin\u2019 me I was the first guy you killed?\u201d</p><p>I heard Rafe growl but ignored him as I leaped for Westwood\u2019s throat. Fangs down, hands wrapped around his scrawny neck, I heard him squeak as I lifted him off the ground. Rafe was at my back, holding off Simon\u2019s men, but he didn\u2019t interfere.</p><p>\u201cHell no, Brent. I\u2019ve killed men. So many I\u2019ve lost count. You\u2019re just the first one who didn\u2019t stay dead.\u201d I tightened my grip and heard him wheeze. One more minute and I was going to finish him, twist off his head and toss it into the lake like I\u2019d done his crossbow. Damned if I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSimon, help me. She\u2019s going to kill me. Look at her eyes. They, they\u2019re glowing.\u201d Westwood gasped again. \u201cRed!\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>\u201cYou really want to do this, Glory? Simon can be a bad enemy. I\u2019m with you no matter what. You need my demonic powers, you\u2019ve got \u2019em.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice was inside my head as I squeezed Westwood\u2019s neck, watched his face go dark and his eyes pop.</p><p>\u201cNo! The price is too high, you said.\u201d God, but I wanted this worm dead and lying at my feet.</p><p>\u201cListen to him, Glory. Even if you get out of here alive, you\u2019ll regret it. If I lose this man\u2019s fortune, I\u2019ll make sure everyone you love or ever have loved will die.\u201d Simon\u2019s voice was in my head now too, cold and determined.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get away with what he\u2019s done.\u201d I couldn\u2019t let go, but I didn\u2019t squeeze harder either. If Rafe asked for hell\u2019s aid, what would it cost him? Red eyes. Oh, God. What would it cost us?</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. As soon as his money is mine, he\u2019ll pay in other ways.\u201d Simon gave an unearthly chuckle. \u201cHe\u2019ll wish he\u2019d died tonight before my goddess gets through with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swear? On your goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I swear on her soul. I\u2019ll make sure Westwood regrets taking a fang from a single vampire.\u201d Simon sounded convincing, and I believed him. I also believed Westwood hadn\u2019t heard any of this.</p><p>I let go and stepped back. Westwood collapsed on the grass, grabbing his crushed windpipe. I was sure he\u2019d curse me but not without some serious healing first.</p><p>\u201cTake off. We\u2019ll start filming here tomorrow night, midnight,\u201d Simon said, as a soaked Greg, moss dangling from his shoulder, emerged from the lake with the crossbow. Aggie would have loved the look and been all over him.</p><p>\u201cDamned thing sank to the bottom. Next time you want to make a point, Glory, throw it into the woods.\u201d He sloshed over and dropped it on the ground. \u201cI hate water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Join the club.\u201d I turned to Rafe. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need me to guide you?\u201d Greg pulled off his shirt, wringing it out, then did a double take when he saw Westwood struggling to his feet. \u201cWhat the hell happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d Simon smiled at me. \u201cYou\u2019d make an excellent Energy Vampire now, my dear. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, pretty sure I\u2019d just been insulted.</p> <p>\u201cWe can find our own way back. Come on, Glory.\u201d Rafe shifted into a bird, and I was right beside him. We flew as fast as we could back to our building.</p><p>By the time we hit the door to the apartment it was close to sunrise. I collapsed on the couch, exhausted and yet jazzed. I\u2019d kicked some butt out there. No, I didn\u2019t want to become an EV, but for Simon to say I was worthy was actually pretty awesome.</p><p>I jumped up, stalked into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of synthetic, chugging half of it before I hit the couch again. What the hell was the matter with me? Awesome? Clearly I was on a slippery slope sliding straight down to hell. Rafe grabbed a beer and opened it.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ask?\u201d Rafe took a drink. \u201cAbout your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I wasn\u2019t surprised by the red thing. Alesa\u2019s been talking to me, in here.\u201d I set my bottle on the table and tapped my forehead. \u201cStill not sure how she got inside, but I\u2019m desperate to get her out. Am I a damned demon now too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Alesa\u2019s in you?\u201d Rafe tugged me up and looked me over. \u201cThat has to be a pisser.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cUnderstatement of the year. She\u2019s irritating, prone to giving me heat attacks and even tries to order me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA typical demon.\u201d Rafe pulled me close. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m sorry. No, you\u2019re not a demon, just her vessel. How to get her out? Well, we\u2019ll have to work on that. As to how she got in, that\u2019s easy.\u201d Rafe settled us both on the couch face-to-face, lots of eye contact. \u201cYou were both wounded in that battle in the shop. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, bleeding heavily. Her blood was an icky black. Gross. Smelled like raw sewage.\u201d I put my hand on his knee. \u201cAm I infected? What\u2019s next? Horns and a tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a cartoon devil?\u201d Rafe grabbed my hand. \u201cHer blood must have entered your open wound. I should have realized ...\u201d He leaned in and sniffed, then smiled with a sad twist of his lips. \u201cRidiculous that something so nasty can smell so sweet. It\u2019s faint. Your vamp friends probably aren\u2019t even picking up on it, but of course you have the taint. Takes one to know one, as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Rafe.\u201d Tears filled my eyes. \u201cNo matter what I told Westwood, I\u2019m not a stone-cold killer. Only if it was them or me.\u201d I shook my head. I wasn\u2019t dredging up things from hundreds of years ago. Life then had been different for vampires. No synthetics, no security systems.</p> <p>\u201cI know that, Glory.\u201d Rafe wiped a tear from my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I drew her here. If it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m sure Alesa hates being inside you. You\u2019ve got the kind of good and decent soul she despises. That\u2019s why she wanted to kill you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered and leaned on him. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me too much credit. Tonight I could\u2019ve killed Westwood without a speck of remorse. Hell, I wanted to rip his head off.\u201d I sat back. \u201cI\u2019ve changed since that fight with Alesa. Said things without thinking, acted out in crazy ways. Even used the \u2018f\u2019 word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Blade would be shocked. You know he\u2019s rabid about treating you like a lady.\u201d Rafe leaned back and smiled.</p><p>I laughed and hit him. \u201cNot that \u2018f\u2019 word. Fat. I called a customer fat. Was mean to a couple more. I keep on like this, I won\u2019t have customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, totally a pisser.\u201d</p><p>I lost my smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like that, Rafe. Without a conscience.\u201d I sure wasn\u2019t telling him how I\u2019d offered to do the wild thing with Ray. I put that totally on the demon.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. And don\u2019t worry about what you did to Westwood. His death would be a public service.\u201d He kissed my forehead. \u201cYou look exhausted. Being a badass is hard work. I should know.\u201d</p><p>I surprised myself by giggling and felt him smile against my skin. \u201cI am tired. Thanks for being there for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this again when you wake up. Work on finding a way to cast out that demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking. If it wouldn\u2019t turn me to dust, I\u2019d bathe in holy water.\u201d I stood and pulled him up with me.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Richard about it.\u201d Rafe looked down at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Hope it\u2019s soon. Alesa doesn\u2019t worry about anything. She just urges me to act out. Then I have to deal with the fallout. Fun for all.\u201d I felt the dawn and the bone-deep exhaustion that came with it. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for more than a cuddle tonight, and I know we still have issues, but will you just hold me and let me conk out in your arms?\u201d</p><p>Rafe suddenly looked fierce. \u201cIssues be damned. Simon could have ended you tonight. No way am I wasting a second worrying about tomorrow. Forget Blade. I\u2019ll take what I can get now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rafe. I hope this doesn\u2019t end up hurting you.\u201d I saw what I wanted to see. A man who cared about me. Add that sensual vibe that pulled at me until I wanted to crawl all over him, and there was no way I was denying myself his comfort. Both of us demons. Bizarre and maybe a twist of fate, a sign. I pulled his head down and kissed him with everything I had.</p><p>One thing I knew. When I got up in the evening, I was going to church. If a demon could still pray, I was giving it a shot. Alesa kept her mouth shut. I figured that meant I was on the right track.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s lucky for a bride to go to church before her wedding,\u201d Flo announced as she waited for me to buckle my seat belt.</p><p>Rafe had been gone when I\u2019d gotten up at sunset. His note had promised we\u2019d see each other later, after he\u2019d taken care of some club business. So I\u2019d crammed myself into Flo\u2019s car with Richard and his mother. Mother Mainwaring wasn\u2019t Flo\u2019s biggest fan, and she stayed silent beside me in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cLove the new car.\u201d I didn\u2019t love the fact that I\u2019d had to climb into the tiny backseat in a pencil skirt. At least Flo had picked me up behind the shop, so only one homeless man and a stray cat had been witness to my cursing, inelegant effort to get aboard. \u201cI thought Richard gave you an SUV though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he did. I exchanged it for this.\u201d Flo blew him a kiss. \u201cHe meant well, but I must have a sexy car. S\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe SUV was a much safer choice and better for carrying passengers.\u201d Richard adjusted the seat and closed the passenger door before buckling himself in. \u201cThe way my dearest drives, I\u2019d have bought her a tank if it were permitted on these roadways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah! A tank is not sexy, Ricardo.\u201d Flo pulled away from the curb without looking, and there was a screech of brakes and a frantic horn honk.</p><p>\u201cFlorence! The rearview mirror is for more than checking your lipstick.\u201d Sarah Mainwaring squirmed, but she and I were jammed hip to hip in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cQuite a wedding present.\u201d I smiled at Richard\u2019s mother. Rumor had it she was the source of Richard\u2019s money.</p><p>\u201cI simply manage Richard\u2019s money, Gloriana, because I\u2019m so good at it. He\u2019s quite wealthy in his own right.\u201d Sarah smiled, then gasped. \u201cFlorence, you just forced a car to the shoulder of the road. Do you even look when you change lanes?\u201d She grabbed the back of his seat. \u201cRichard, why aren\u2019t you driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorence won\u2019t let me drive her new car, Mother.\u201d Richard had closed his eyes and gripped the door handle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. This is my pretty little car.\u201d Flo swerved to pass a tractor trailer truck, and we all braced ourselves. Except for Richard, who kept his eyes closed but murmured Hail Marys.</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief when we made it around the truck before the oncoming traffic hit us head on. Which was a miracle. I leaned forward to pat Richard on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the prayers. Keep it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare not stop.\u201d He never even peeked. \u201cJust tell me when we get there. But remember, darling, we have plenty of time. Church doesn\u2019t start for another half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But some people don\u2019t seem to know the speed limit, amante. It\u2019s not a suggestion. You must go that fast or get off the freeway!\u201d She yelled this and added a hand gesture at the car in front of her. \u201cAm I right?\u201d Flo turned to look at me.</p><p>\u201cUh, whatever. Just watch the road!\u201d I grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand as Flo swerved to pass the car she\u2019d decided was moving too slowly. My friend always drove fast. And tailgated. Now that she had a new convertible, she was even more reckless, convinced she had to \u201cblow out the carburetor,\u201d whatever that meant. Apparently it included gunning the engine at every light, so she could race the car beside her to the next corner. The new car was turbocharged, a fact Flo kept throwing into the conversation.</p><p>Tonight the top was up as a concession to Richard\u2019s mother, who always wore a hat and gloves to church. Flo had complained, always happy to stick a pin in stuffy Sarah Mainwaring, but I\u2019d jumped in and asked to keep the top up too, claiming I didn\u2019t want my hair blown because of a late date. I actually liked Richard\u2019s mom and took pity on her. Flo would be a tough daughter-in-law, a tough friend too. She almost put the top down anyway once she heard Jerry was still out of town.</p><p>\u201cFlo, I never told you how to run your love life, so I know you won\u2019t tell me how to run mine.\u201d I leaned forward since the traffic had cleared and we weren\u2019t in imminent danger. \u201cThanks for coming tonight, Richard. You always make me feel safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Glory, tell us why we are supposed to watch our backs. Are you and Simon Destiny feuding again?\u201d Flo poked Richard. \u201cLook at Glory. See what is happening with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, your backs are okay now. Keep praying, Richard.\u201d Sarah\u2019s nails dug into my palm. \u201cFlo, you just ran a stop sign. Uh, that truck almost hit us. Guess his engine isn\u2019t turbocharged, or he\u2019d have clipped Sarah\u2019s door back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah, missed us by a mile.\u201d She poked Richard again. \u201cPraying? I\u2019ve never had a single wreck, Ricardo, not in all the years I\u2019ve been driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably made a deal with the Devil,\u201d Sarah muttered.</p> <p>My own Devil\u2019s disciple muttered a profanity so vile I shuddered. I eased my hand from Sarah\u2019s. She had some serious mind-reading skills, and I didn\u2019t want her deep diving into my brain right now.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Flo? Even I\u2019ve had a few fender benders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you go too slow, Glory.\u201d Flo swerved around another car, barely missing it, and we heard a crunch as it scraped a guard rail behind us. \u201cSee? She is too slow and can\u2019t keep up with traffic. So she bends her fender. Idiota.\u201d</p><p>I looked back, sorry for the driver who\u2019d gotten in Flo\u2019s way. Time for another change of subject. \u201cFlo, I\u2019ve called everyone on the list for the bachelorette party. Looks like we\u2019ll have a great crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait. What are we going to do? Please, no silly games.\u201d Flo glanced at Richard. \u201cOpen your eyes, amante. I\u2019m pulling into the parking lot. See? You made it here alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd in record time.\u201d Richard crossed himself, and his mother murmured a \u201cThank you, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entertainment is a surprise, but I have a theme. Come dressed as your favorite seductress. How does that sound?\u201d I sat back and unbuckled my seat belt as we came to a rocking stop.</p><p>Flo laughed and put the car in park. \u201cI love it. Decisions, decisions. Wait a minute. Of course I\u2019m my own favorite seductress.\u201d She gave Richard a secret smile. \u201cWhat do you think, marito? Who is your favorite seductress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, darling. Who else?\u201d Richard glanced back at his mother, straightening her hat. \u201cMother, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, don\u2019t be hen-pecked. You\u2019ve had some very accomplished seductresses make runs at you through the years. My son is so handsome, you know, Florence. You\u2019re very lucky to have snared him this century.\u201d Sarah smiled when Flo\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019m all right. I\u2019ve survived much worse than Florence\u2019s driving. Though I believe I\u2019ll shift for myself in order to get home.\u201d His mother put her hand on my arm. \u201cGloriana, dear, surely you\u2019re going to invite me to this party. When and where?\u201d</p><p>I finally found my voice. \u201cWednesday night, ten o\u2019clock at Rafe\u2019s new club, N-V, on Sixth Street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it. I always fancied myself as Mata Hari, the World War I spy. She wore the most adorable jeweled bras.\u201d Sarah reached out her hand and let a startled Richard help her out of the backseat. Flo and I forced our mouths closed.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, see you there. I haven\u2019t decided on my own costume yet.\u201d I pulled myself out of the other side, trying not to flash thigh at the rest of the parking lot. The massive building that housed the Moonlight Church of Eternal Life and Joy loomed in front of us. I\u2019d always liked coming here for the positive message by Pastor John and the great music.</p><p>As I followed Flo and Sarah and a crowd of other worshippers from the parking lot toward the sanctuary, I began to hum to the soaring organ music coming from the speakers mounted on the outside of the building. Surely everything would be all right. I had good friends, had always tried to lead a fairly decent life, even after getting my fangs, and Richard, alert to any danger, was a comforting presence close by. But when we reached the arched doorway, flanked by two large gold crosses, I stumbled.</p><p>\u201cGlory? Is there a problem?\u201d Richard took my elbow, looking down in case I\u2019d broken a heel.</p><p>I\u2019d worn some great vintage pumps, four inches and crocodile, I\u2019d found in a thrift shop. They were holding up just fine. The brown went perfectly with my beige pencil skirt and red twinset. I carried a designer knockoff purse that you\u2019d need a magnifying glass to tell from the real deal. I looked pretty good if I do say so myself. But I suddenly didn\u2019t feel so great, and I really couldn\u2019t blame it on the skirt\u2019s tight waistband. I studied the church doorway and knew what my problem was. Hell\u2019s handhold twisted my tummy, and I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to go in there,\u201d Alesa growled.</p><p>Like I\u2019d let her stop me. Now I was determined. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d I sank down on a stone bench a few feet from the door. I opened my purse like I was searching for something. Maybe a tissue or Rolaids. Yeah, like a vampire ever carried those.</p><p>\u201cLadies, go on inside. Give us a minute. Save us seats.\u201d Richard smiled and waved Flo and Sarah away. \u201cSit near the back, right side on the aisle.\u201d Both his mother and Flo looked ready to argue, but after they glanced at me, they must have seen something that changed their minds.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I was shaky, like maybe I was going to throw up. The crosses . . . Guess Hell Girl didn\u2019t go for those. The closer I\u2019d gotten to them the queasier I\u2019d felt.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, talk.\u201d Richard sat beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I had a vintage hanky in my hand, one from the shop I\u2019d tucked into my bag. Good thing, because I\u2019d teared up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m infected, Richard. By that demon.\u201d I dabbed at my eyes. \u201cNow those crosses are making me sick.\u201d I gasped as Alesa hit me with heat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go inside the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Richard put his hand on my shoulder, then jerked it back. \u201cYou\u2019re hot. Is that . . . ? I can\u2019t believe it. I usually have a sense of these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear her, Richard. She speaks to me. Sends me these heat waves.\u201d I knew I owed it to Rafe not to share his demon secret. \u201cRafe says because I had an open wound and Alesa, the demon, was bleeding from her own injuries, I got infected by her blood when you, uh, put her down. I\u2019m tainted.\u201d I swallowed again, afraid I was going to be sick all over my pretty brown shoes.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard that can happen. Sending a demon back to hell is a tricky business. What I did was drastic, call it overkill. That demon isn\u2019t in hell. I thought I had annihilated her.\u201d Richard frowned, obviously thinking things over. \u201cI was careful to hit her head-on. Of course she\u2019d have tried to find a host, but I didn\u2019t think she had time. Surely whatever little bit you absorbed from her blood wouldn\u2019t be enough to make you a full-fledged demon. Remember, you were wearing a rosary that night with a cross. So you had some protection.\u201d Richard smiled encouragingly.</p><p>I looked at those enormous crosses. \u201cFull-fledged or not, I\u2019d hoped coming to church would help get rid of her. But now, feeling like this ...\u201d I pressed a hand to my heart. \u201cI can\u2019t get past those giant crosses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, and neither should you. You\u2019re good. That evil can surely be driven out if we work at it.\u201d Richard\u2019s voice was so kind I wanted to cry all over his expensive gray suit, handpicked by Flo, of course. His wife would be looking for him, might even come out here, and I\u2019d have to explain . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to hell, Richard.\u201d I blotted at my tears. \u201cAnd now I can\u2019t go inside my own church.\u201d I heard new music starting, one of my favorite songs. Was I doomed?</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I refuse to believe that a basically decent person can be corrupted by a simple accident. Come on.\u201d Richard put his hand under my elbow and hoisted me up. He\u2019d probably made a good priest back in the Dark Ages. Too bad he couldn\u2019t handle celibacy. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again, slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t want to fight with him, but the closer we got to those crosses, the worse I felt.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re going inside. Careful now. Don\u2019t look at the crosses. Look past them at the sanctuary. Focus on all the happy people singing. There\u2019s Pastor John, smiling and welcoming the congregation. His arms are open wide, and he wants you to join him.\u201d Richard eased me down the sidewalk. When I got next to those crosses, I fought a sudden horrifying urge to spit on them and jerked against his strong grip on my arm.</p><p>\u201cStop! This is wrong!\u201d Alesa gave one last jab at my forehead, and I went blind. I held on to Richard and kept going.</p><p>\u201cSteady. Straight ahead. Feel all that positive energy.\u201d Richard pulled me past the crosses and down the aisle.</p><p>Gradually the warm atmosphere of the place worked its magic. Alesa finally whimpered, and I felt her give up. Hallelujah! My vision cleared, the sickness eased, and I concentrated on the music, the joyful sound lifting the rock lodged against my heart. I found my place between Flo and Sarah, and a hymnal was thrust into my hands. When I\u2019d come to church before, I\u2019d enjoyed the music so much that I\u2019d sing along. I\u2019m not a great singer, and my habit of levitating with certain songs was pretty embarrassing. As the evening progressed, I hoped I\u2019d rise again. Sarah watched me, expecting it to happen. But my feet stayed planted firmly on the carpet. No heavenly pull for me.</p><p>By the time we piled back into Flo\u2019s car for the ride home, I was completely depressed. I did manage to get Richard aside when he helped me out of the car in front of the shop and ask him to keep the demon thing our secret. He glanced at Flo, who sat at the wheel with the motor running. He obviously hated to keep anything from his bride, but finally agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to get rid of this bitch.\u201d I held on to Richard\u2019s arm, feeling desperate.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, you pious pinhead.\u201d Alesa was back.</p><p>Richard patted my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll do research. Relax, Glory. You\u2019re not alone. You have lots of friends you can count on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I realized that sounded ungrateful. \u201cI mean, thanks, Richard.\u201d I saw that Flo had gotten out of the car after all and hummed \u201cHere Comes the Bride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flo grabbed Richard\u2019s arm. \u201cCome, amante, I want to hear about all these seductresses your mother said you\u2019ve known. Every detail.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cThank you for the bachelorette party, Glory. It will be great fun. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>I waved them off, laughing when Richard looked like he was being dragged off to the guillotine. I knew the feeling as I trudged upstairs to change for my video shoot.</p><p>\u201cGlory, if you don\u2019t want to do this video, say so. We\u2019ll ditch it and figure out a way to get Simon off our backs.\u201d Rafe came out of his room, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.</p> <p>\u201cJeez, Rafe. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t sense you were here.\u201d I kicked off my heels. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStress.\u201d He walked up and turned me around, gently massaging my knotted neck muscles. \u201cHow was church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA disaster. Alesa freaked.\u201d I told him about my reaction. \u201cDidn\u2019t I take you to church with me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I was a dog. I stayed outside. Remember?\u201d Rafe turned me around. \u201cGood thing because, since I\u2019ve got demon blood, crosses give me a bad case of \u2018No way.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I got inside, but it took some help from Richard. Alesa\u2019s making me pay for it.\u201d I winced when she stabbed me between the eyes for the fourth time in five minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d Rafe pulled me down to the couch. \u201cIf she makes you do things you don\u2019t like, fight her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI never suspected you had any demon in you. How do you control that side of yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget that I\u2019ve had a lifetime to learn to cope.\u201d Rafe slid his hand under my hair to trace my ear with a fingertip, his thumb on my jugular.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think a demon bodyguard might be cool in some cases.\u201d I eased away from the distracting fingertip. \u201cDid Blade know about your demon part when he hired you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rafe put his feet on the coffee table. He wore leather boots with his jeans and a vintage Harley T-shirt that molded to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I sat up straight. \u201cThat didn\u2019t bother him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe saw it as an asset. Which it can be.\u201d Rafe stared at his boots. \u201cWe met during a dustup with some rough characters in Europe. Blade and I ended up on the same side. He saw me take out the bad guys with my dark powers and was impressed. He wanted that kind of thing on his own payroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very vague.\u201d I needed to know more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you get, Glory.\u201d Rafe looked at me. \u201cBlade and I agree. I won\u2019t tell his secrets, he won\u2019t tell mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know almost everything about Jerry.\u201d I crossed my arms under my breasts.</p><p>Rafe smiled, a knowing smile that made me instantly uneasy. \u201cYou want to bet?\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and glared at him. \u201cWhat are you hinting at? Trying to drive a wedge between Jerry and me? You think I don\u2019t know he\u2019s had other women besides me? We take breaks, you know. When we\u2019re on a break, we can do who or what we please. Big freakin\u2019 deal. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest you go there.\u201d</p><p>That wiped the smile off his face. Too bad. I loved that smile and those dimples.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a shot. All\u2019s fair ...\u201d He was up now too. \u201cYou have Blade on a pedestal, Glory. He\u2019s just a man. A warrior. Like I am. We do what we\u2019ve got to do. And blow off steam any way we can.\u201d Rafe watched my face.</p> <p>I sat again. \u201cI can relate. Right now I\u2019m so stressed, I could use a way to release it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut Blade and I didn\u2019t exactly take a break when he left. Sure I\u2019ve had other lovers too when Blade and I have been apart. But this time . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can rationalize what we\u2019ve done, Rafe. It\u2019s cheating, and I feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rafe put his fingers over my lips. \u201cStop with the guilt trip. You didn\u2019t plan this. It just happened.\u201d He sank down next to me. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the woman I care about if this didn\u2019t bother you. But, Glory, what we did wasn\u2019t some casual lay and you know it.\u201d He pulled me close. \u201cYou ask me, this thing between us was long overdue.\u201d</p><p>I should get out of here. Stop things before they got even more complicated. But this was Rafe, and I knew he was right about one thing: What had happened had been building for a long time. I threaded my fingers through Rafe\u2019s silky hair and looked into his gleaming eyes. Desire. Is there anything sexier?</p><p>\u201cFinally. Forget that religious kick. This is what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about.\u201d Alesa slithered around in my midsection. It was almost enough to make me back off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to convince you that you\u2019ve wasted a lot of time on the wrong man?\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t rush me, just waited for me to make up my mind.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t ignore that look in Rafe\u2019s eyes. If Jerry was the wrong man, could Rafe be the right one?</p><p>\u201cConvince me, Rafe.\u201d I brushed my lips across his, just a tease, but that\u2019s all it took. He crushed me to him. I fell back on the sofa with him on top. That damned tight pencil skirt ripped when he pushed it up to slip his hand along my thigh.</p><p>I ran my hands under his T-shirt to touch his hot skin. He stopped kissing me long enough to pull off my sweaters, then helped me tug his cotton shirt up and off. His bare chest was beautiful, well muscled from a long lifetime of work.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the skirt,\u201d he murmured as he opened my bra and tossed it aside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I hated it.\u201d I moaned when he took my nipple into his mouth and gently bit it. \u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He finished the job on that poor skirt and threw the pieces of fabric on the floor, then drove one hand inside my bikini panties. I was damp for him and arched against his fingers as they slid inside me. I moved in time to his stroking and cried out as a quick orgasm shuddered through me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good.\u201d I pulled his hair, then kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cJust wait.\u201d He grinned and picked me up, carrying me to the bed. He laid me down gently on top of the chenille bedspread and looked me over, his dark eyes gleaming. Overhead light on. Too bad. But he had the same excellent night vision I had so it didn\u2019t matter. I wished I had something pretty and filmy to wear. My pink bikini panties did me no favors. Wide hips and thighs. They haven\u2019t been popular since way, way back in the day. I pulled at the spread, desperate to hide.</p><p>\u201cQuit looking like that. I told you once I love a woman with curves. You\u2019re just what I want, Glory. Don\u2019t cover a thing.\u201d He stripped off his boots and jeans, then stood in front of me, beautiful in a totally masculine way. \u201cI\u2019ve got scars. War wounds. Hell, look at my back.\u201d</p><p>He turned, I guess to show me some old injury, but all I saw was a perfect ass that begged to be touched. I sat up and gave it an open-mouthed kiss, making him sigh with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman. If you tell me to take a hike when Blade gets back, I may just have to kill both of you.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>I froze, my lips just inches from his warm skin. I did not just hear him threaten me. He\u2019d been kidding of course. A bad joke. I eased back onto the bed and glanced at the clock. We had an hour before we needed to head to the lake and the video shoot.</p><p>Rafe crawled onto the bed to lie beside me. He tugged on my hair, using a curl to tease one of my nipples, and I stared into his dark eyes, relieved that there was no trace of that evil red.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Glory.\u201d His voice was low, his smile offering me everything.</p><p>I shivered and stretched out my arms, my inhibitions floating away on a rising tide of lust. Had any man asked me that question and truly meant it? I swear if Alesa said one word now, I was going to drink holy water until she drowned. She got the message and stayed blessedly silent.</p><p>Rafe waited, clearly ready to satisfy my every desire even if he never got his. I savored the power, the absolutely delicious possibilities holding me still for a breathless moment.</p><p>\u201cRead my mind, Rafael, and I\u2019ll give you a play-by-play.\u201d I licked my lips. \u201cKiss me first. One of your \u2018I\u2019m your man and don\u2019t you forget it\u2019 kisses.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNews flash. Now that you\u2019re on demon turf, no one can read your mind except another demon. A nice perk. Me? No problem. Send me that playbook.\u201d He leaned in, his mouth easing over my mouth while he threaded his fingers through mine. Our arms were wide, our bare chests just brushing each other, the slight friction an erotic tease lifting me off the bed to seek more. That kiss did claim me and left no doubt that Rafe meant business.</p><p>I sent my first mental message, and he pushed one knee between my legs, starting a rhythm that he\u2019d match with his tongue and his cock before we were done. But not yet. First he\u2019d do clever things to every other part of my body, front to back and then front again. And let me drink from him. Then more of those soul kisses that made my body weep for him. Finally, I\u2019d let him come inside and take me hard and fast.</p><p>Of course I should have known Glory as tough bitch in charge wasn\u2019t going to fly for long. Because Rafe was too good. Before I got through half my erotic wish list, I fell apart.</p><p>\u201cNow, Rafe. I need you inside me now.\u201d I straddled him, sighing as he filled me. \u201cThat is so good.\u201d I closed my eyes and just enjoyed the moment. \u201cNow move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted this to last.\u201d Rafe smiled up at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lasted. Now get on with it.\u201d I sat up and felt the hard heat of him inside me. Mmm.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I\u2019ve got more pleasure in store for you, Glory. Much more.\u201d He lifted me off of him. \u201cLie back. Close your eyes. I think you\u2019ll like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, please.\u201d More pleasure? I couldn\u2019t imagine it. Of course my brain had left the building somewhere between orgasms number two and five. I\u2019d been kissed, nibbled and licked in spots that even Jerry hadn\u2019t discovered. But I wasn\u2019t about to wimp out now. I closed my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d The bed dipped. What was he doing? Getting a toy? I wouldn\u2019t mind that, though I wasn\u2019t into pain. Or at least the old Glory hadn\u2019t been. Alesa whispered that whips and chains and all sorts of erotic tortures were worth trying. I ignored her. The bed sagged again.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes closed. Now open your legs. No matter what you feel, don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to scare me? Not easy anymore, my friend.\u201d I smiled and opened my legs, excited and, okay, scared. I gasped when something cold slid inside me, followed immediately by the warmth of his flicking tongue. The thrill startled a shriek out of me, and I jerked against Rafe\u2019s steadying hands on my hips.</p> <p>\u201cHands. Whew. For a minute there I thought you\u2019d shifted into a snake or something.\u201d I shut up when I felt another jolt of cold. Ice? Soft, not hard. Whatever, it was crazy exciting. I quivered, and his clever tongue went to work again. Oh. My. God. So incredibly, um, good. Tremors shook my hips. One of Rafe\u2019s warm hands pressed on my tummy to keep me from bucking like a bronco. His mouth, so insanely talented. Chill, heat and I lost it, tossing my head and keening as I came.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes closed and open your mouth,\u201d Rafe ordered, sliding up my body and wrapping my legs around his waist so that his hard cock teased my unbelievably sensitive cleft.</p><p>Since I\u2019d forgotten how to form words, I did what he said. Cold again but against my tongue. I tasted . . . My eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrawberry ice cream. Figured you\u2019d be off chocolate after what Simon pulled.\u201d He slid a spoonful into my mouth, grinned, then drove into me.</p> <p>I swallowed, grabbing his hair to give him a kiss that would have devoured him if he hadn\u2019t been giving as good as he got. He tasted delicious, of sin and danger and everything a woman bound for hell could ever want. He rammed into me, the headboard banging against the wall. I wanted him, needed him, needed . . .</p><p>I inhaled. Oh, yes. My hands still in his hair, I jerked his head aside and struck like a cobra at that vein pulsing in his neck. I tore into it, not caring if I hurt him, and sucked at his life force. The hot jolt of energy pushed me over the edge again, and I released his hair to dig furrows into his back with my nails as I came, screaming his name in my head.</p><p>The heat and force of his release inside me finally brought me down to earth. I gasped and let go, dropping back to the bed to stare at his ruined throat in horror. Dear God, I think I would have killed him if I hadn\u2019t stopped just then.</p><p>\u201cRafe, I, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I waited to see how he\u2019d react, what he would do.</p><p>His hair was damp, his face pale as he opened his eyes and gazed down at me. Blood dripped from his wounded neck, and it was smeared across his shoulders. Then he grinned, those dimples deep and begging to be kissed.</p><p>\u201cDamnation, Glory. I believe that was the best sex I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean it.\u201d I reached up with a shaking hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I mean it.\u201d He kissed my fingertips. \u201cI told you I like it wild. A little of your healing touch, a rare burger and I\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my fingers to his wound, sealing the edges and thinking healing thoughts. He needed blood\u2014and not decorating his body. The rare burger and a shower were definitely in order.</p><p>He glanced at the clock. \u201cHop in the shower. We\u2019ll have to hurry if we want to get out to the lake by midnight.\u201d He stood and held out his hand. \u201cOr maybe we should make Destiny wait.\u201d</p><p>I enjoyed the view. Totally sexed out, aching in spots, sticky where I shouldn\u2019t be and still I wanted to smear the ice cream I could see melting in a bowl on the night stand all over his perfect body and lick it off. Mmmm.</p><p>\u201cTempting.\u201d I pulled him down to give him a deep and thorough kiss. \u201cThat was incredible for me too.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and nuzzled my breast. \u201cSo we ditch Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, better get this over with. Lots of wedding stuff coming up. Aggie\u2019s lingerie shower for Flo is tomorrow night. Got to keep Simon happy, so he\u2019ll leave things alone. With luck we can knock out this charade tonight, and that\u2019ll be that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuit giving me hot looks, then, lady.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cClean up. I\u2019m eating first, showering next. For some reason I\u2019m feeling a little weak.\u201d He pulled me out of bed, slid his hand down to my bottom and squeezed, then aimed me at the bathroom.</p><p>I watched him strut toward the kitchen. Oh, yeah, he was feeling pretty proud of himself. Can\u2019t say I blamed him. I stuffed my hair into a shower cap and stepped under the warm spray. Best sex he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>I sagged against the tile wall. Oh, God. Jerry. Jeremiah. Couldn\u2019t blame steam from the ancient water heater for the room blurring before I pressed my face into a washcloth to muffle my sobs. How many times had Jerry and I made love? A thousand? Two? Ten thousand times? On furs in front of a fire in a cave in the Highlands. In a luxury suite in Paris on silk sheets. The place never mattered. To Jerry I was always a goddess, his beloved.</p><p>No beloved here. Not a single word of love had been spoken on that bed where we\u2019d gone at it like animals. I scrubbed my aching thighs and heaved the washcloth across the bathroom where it landed in the sink. Luck was with me, and it didn\u2019t break anything, or Rafe would have come running. What had I done? Sure I loved Rafe. He was a friend who\u2019d always been there for me.</p><p>Get a clue, Glory. There was a paycheck involved, and he wanted what Jerry was getting.</p><p>I turned the water to cold and punished myself, holding my face under the spray to reduce the swelling on my eyes. Makeup would have to do the rest. I was going to have to untangle myself from this mess I\u2019d made of my life. Nice if I could blame the impulse that had made me invite Rafe into my bed on \u201cThe Devil made me do it.\u201d Would Jerry buy it? Not in a million years. To be honest, I\u2019d been attracted to Rafe and sending \u201cCome and get me\u201d signals long before Alesa jumped on board.</p><p>And what about Rafe? Would he be willing to go back to friendship now? Pretend this \u201cfling\u201d as I\u2019d called it to Flo had never happened? He was more likely to take the murder route.</p><p>I was so screwed. And not in the super-cool multiorgasmic way either.</p><p>\u201cI should have known you\u2019d figure out a way to spoil the afterglow. Toss the halo, numbnut, and join the dark side. You just had a sample of the fun here.\u201d Alesa gave a throaty chuckle. So she\u2019d gotten her rocks off too. I grabbed my toothbrush and attacked my teeth, wondering if I\u2019d ever feel clean again.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>We were about to head out to the lake when my cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cRehearsal is canceled. It\u2019s raining at the lake, and I don\u2019t want my camera equipment to get wet. I\u2019m sending you a copy of the script. Look it over and get back to me.\u201d Simon didn\u2019t wait for my response, just hung up.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief. No rehearsal.\u201d I smiled at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me to the club? I\u2019ve got plenty to do there.\u201d Rafe leaned against my dresser while I brushed my hair.</p><p>I glanced at the clock. Still hours till dawn. Why not? I had an idea for the bachelorette party and wanted to talk to some of his hired help. It would also do me no good to avoid Rafe. I had to figure a way to wiggle out of this friends-with-benefits deal while keeping the friendship. I slapped on a smile along with some \u201cKiss and Tell\u201d lipstick.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m almost ready. Would you grab a bottle of synthetic for me out of the fridge while I do something with this makeup?\u201d I reached for my eye shadow.</p><p>\u201cGot to warn you. Ray will probably be there, rehearsing and getting a feel for the stage.\u201d Rafe watched me for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cHave to face him again sometime. Better in a private setting and not at the wedding, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I never missed a beat and moved on to eyeliner. I was a star-quality actress. Inside, my gut knotted. Showing up on Rafe\u2019s arm was bound to trigger a scene. Rafe just nodded and headed for the kitchen. Maybe I was giving myself too much credit. Ray was probably all into Nadia now.</p><p>I finished my makeup, downed the blood substitute while trying not to cast longing glances at Rafe\u2019s neck, then left for the club. The rain had stopped here, and Austin\u2019s Sixth Street had been washed clean. I glanced in the shop window. Everything was locked up tight like it should be on a Sunday night.</p><p>We walked around to the back of N-V and heard the deep bass of one of Ray\u2019s rock hits. So he was here practicing. Rafe unlocked the back door, and we eased inside, keeping to the edge of the dance floor and enjoying the music as Ray and the band tore into it. Colored lights pulsed with the beat. Nice effect. The song ended with a final crash of drums, and the small work crew clapped and whistled.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Ray waved, then turned to confer with the band members before they began packing up their gear. \u201cRoll out the piano before you leave, Steve. Then take off too. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Steve, with the help of another of Ray\u2019s road crew, pushed out a baby grand piano then walked off the stage.</p><p>Ray sat on the bench and played a few chords before he turned and pinned Rafe and me with a sober stare.</p><p>\u201cKnew you were there from the moment you hit the door. Didn\u2019t think my guys needed to hear this.\u201d He slammed down the lid on the piano.</p><p>\u201cMy guys don\u2019t either. Come into my office.\u201d Rafe gestured to a room next to the stage.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ray stood and walked in that direction.</p><p>\u201cListen, you both need to cool off.\u201d Understatement. I could feel the heat of Ray\u2019s anger from the twenty feet separating us. Rafe\u2019s was starting to catch up.</p><p>Ray stopped and turned to smile at me. That turned the thermostat down, way down to glacier level. \u201cWe\u2019re cool, Glory. Just need to clear the air. You want to wait out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d I stalked up to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you try to start something with Rafe, Israel Caine. Who I do or don\u2019t do is nobody\u2019s business but mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d Ray looked me over. \u201cI so get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this out of the public eye.\u201d Rafe grabbed my elbow. \u201cMy crew is loyal, but big bucks from a tabloid would be a temptation I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone here to resist.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twitched. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough tabloid headlines to last me a century.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComes with the territory. You don\u2019t want to go public with the V-man, Glo? Can\u2019t say I blame ya.\u201d Ray gave Rafe a sneering inspection. \u201cWhat do they say? Lie down with dogs, get up with fleas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a\u2014\u201d Rafe pushed Ray toward the office door, which I managed to open just in time for them to stumble through.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d I shoved between them after I got the door closed. \u201cI know you\u2019re not fighting about me, because you\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not worth it. Right, Ray?\u201d I had my back against Rafe and could feel his tension.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never say that, babe. But I took your advice, got with someone willing to show me the vampire ropes.\u201d Ray grinned and winked. \u201cAll the ropes. And chains and even a few gadgets I\u2019d never heard of before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoo. I really like this guy. Come on, Glo. Can\u2019t we do him too?\u201d Alesa urged me toward Ray. I told her to stuff it. That earned me a stab to the eye and a hot flash.</p> <p>\u201cNadia. Yeah, she\u2019s been around and won\u2019t get hurt when you take your show on the road.\u201d Rafe backed up. \u201cWhich you always do. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in a hurry to see me leave, shifter?\u201d Ray kept smiling. \u201cFeeling threatened, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d Rafe slipped his arm around my waist. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in action, remember? Seen Nadia\u2019s action too. You\u2019re a matched set. A lot of fun and games, and then \u2018See you around, sucker.\u2019\u201d Rafe tightened his hold on me.</p><p>\u201cNadia said you\u2019d been there, done that.\u201d Ray sat on the edge of a crowded desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who gets bored first, won\u2019t we?\u201d He smiled with a hint of fang. \u201cHope that doesn\u2019t tie your tail in a knot, Valdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNadia and I are just business partners. Go for it.\u201d Rafe released me and walked over to open a laptop. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re off the hook, Glory. Nadia can mentor your fledgling now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having fun.\u201d Yeah, right. My hell-bound side wanted every hot guy I knew to stay mine all mine, but I stuffed her back down again. \u201cBut I\u2019ll always be here for you, if you need me.\u201d I ignored Rafe\u2019s grumble. \u201cFor mentoring.\u201d Oh, I was so good. Alesa gagged.</p> <p>\u201cOffer a trade. You give him vamp tips, and he can show us those ropes and chains.\u201d Alesa really liked Ray.</p><p>\u201cSure. I get it.\u201d Ray looked from me to Rafe. \u201cCan\u2019t wait till Blade gets back in town. I want a front-row seat.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was by my side again, his frown ferocious. \u201cGlory, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to talk to some of the guys out there about working for you Wednesday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I fake smiled at Ray, who was way too easy to read. If it wasn\u2019t for Nadia, he\u2019d have already told Rafe to forget the club opening. Distraction time. \u201cI\u2019m throwing Flo\u2019s bachelorette party here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate said you propositioned him. You hiring male dancers?\u201d Ray began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cHow about me? I can bump and grind. I\u2019ll even audition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I laughed, couldn\u2019t help it. A famous rock star strutting his stuff would make my party impossible for Aggie to top.</p><p>Alesa was all over it. \u201cHe can bump and grind me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s got the entertainment covered. She\u2019s looking for waiters and bar help.\u201d Rafe really wanted to toss Ray through a wall. Didn\u2019t take mind reading to see that.</p> <p>\u201cThen maybe I can stop by and sing a song.\u201d Ray hadn\u2019t rebuttoned a single button. Such a yummy chest.</p><p>\u201cFlo would love that, if she\u2019s sober enough to remember it.\u201d I grinned just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cOh? How\u2019re you getting a vampire drunk?\u201d Ray was suddenly really interested.</p><p>Uh-oh. Ray had been a week away from rehab for alcoholism when he\u2019d been turned vampire. Besides sunlight, the thing he\u2019d missed most since his vamp initiation had been booze.</p><p>\u201cI really hate to tell you this, as your mentor and all, but there\u2019s a synthetic blood, several actually, with an alcoholic kick. Blott-O, Undead Drunk, to name a couple. You can get a pretty decent high.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cLike the Vampire Viagra, they also make you horny. We\u2019re going to have plenty of it at the party, courtesy of Damian, Flo\u2019s brother. He\u2019s a local supplier. I didn\u2019t realize it before, because it\u2019s not in my budget, but apparently he\u2019ll sell to anybody who\u2019s got the cash to order an exotic brand. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t discover it in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChip probably made sure I didn\u2019t. I have way too many people in my life who try to run it. You know what I mean?\u201d Ray moved close despite Rafe\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cYou bet I do.\u201d I smiled because Ray and I were friends in that moment. \u201cBut we just want you to take care of yourself, Ray.\u201d I put my hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d He ignored Rafe, who was looking dangerous and ready to pounce. \u201cI appreciate it, sometimes. Right now I\u2019m going to practice my acoustic number on the piano, then I\u2019m heading out. I\u2019ll let you know if I decide to drop by Wednesday. But anytime you need me, Glory, you have my number. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d He slid his thumb down my cheek, then opened the door and walked out.</p><p>\u201cAlways makes a move, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Rafe glared after him.</p><p>\u201cWas that a move? Didn\u2019t notice.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut I hated turning him on to the blood with alcohol. He\u2019s going to run straight to Damian, I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy, Glory. If he gets addicted, tough shit.\u201d Rafe settled at his desk again. \u201cLet me know which guys agree to work Wednesday night. I\u2019ll send the bills directly to Flo. You did say she\u2019s paying, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and sat on the edge of the desk. \u201cYes. I hate that I can\u2019t afford to do this for her on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the way it is. Not many working stiffs could. She wants everything first-class, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s getting. It\u2019s making her happy so just relax and enjoy. You\u2019re arranging some neat things. If getting asshole Ray to dance in the buff would make the party better, hell, call him and say come on.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll take pictures and sell them to the tabloids. Make us both some serious coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Alesa would say go for it, but don\u2019t you dare.\u201d I heard the piano and Ray\u2019s sexy voice start in the other room. \u201cGreat acoustics, Rafe. Just listen to that sound. Ray\u2019ll make this club opening a tremendous success. I doubt it\u2019s in your best interests to throw him to those tabloid wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I hate when you make sense.\u201d Rafe stood and kissed me. \u201cGo on out there. You know you\u2019re dying to listen. I\u2019ve got paperwork. Just keep your distance. Now that you\u2019re mine, I\u2019m not sharing.\u201d</p><p>I eased out of his arms when he tried to make the kiss into foreplay. So possessive. Man, was I in deep. I should call him on it, but then I\u2019d miss hearing Ray. So I just smiled and walked out to sit and listen while Ray did a complete set, much more than he\u2019d do for the opening. He\u2019d always been able to seduce me with his music. It was all a fantasy, of course. He\u2019d pulled his shirt out of his pants, and it was open over a chest still and forever bronzed from when he\u2019d been a sun-worshipping human, prefangs. He sang of love found and love lost and lovers who needed each other.</p><p>I sighed and just drank him in, lost in the whole Israel Caine mystique. I could have had him once. Yeah, right, Glory. And he would probably already be tired of you by now. Rafe was right about that. Ray has a pattern. You made a study of the rock star. Remember? That was my own common sense talking. Alesa was silent, just soaking up Ray\u2019s sexy singing.</p><p>When he\u2019d sung the last note, Ray just got up, nodded in my direction without even a smile and walked away. I heard the back door click shut behind him. Israel Caine. If I\u2019d had this bit of demon in me back then, there was no way I would have put him off and not sampled every bit of what he had to offer. A little heartburn later would have been so worth it.</p><p>Rafe came out of his office, took one look at my dreamy face and stomped back inside, slamming the door hard enough to make glasses rattle behind the bar. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but a little space between us right now wasn\u2019t a bad thing.</p><p>I got up and approached Jimmy, who\u2019d been busy setting up shelves. Flo\u2019s party had to be priority one for now, and sighing over lost opportunities got me zilch. Guess that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t beat myself up for what had happened with Rafe. I had always wondered. Now I knew. It had been incredible. And if Jerry hadn\u2019t already owned my heart, I could probably be perfectly happy with Rafe. I doubted that would be much consolation for my shifter. I just hoped I could find a way to fix things so we could still be friends.</p><p>Alesa cackled and heated me to near boiling. \u201cGood luck with that, sister. My money\u2019s on my demon honey. Somehow I doubt this Jerry can beat him in the love department.\u201d</p><p>I asked Jimmy for a glass of ice and rubbed it on my face. Alesa was so wrong. But I hoped she was long gone before Jerry got back. Had to be. This torture had to stop.</p><p>Alingerie shower. And of course Flo wanted to drive me out there in her new car. How could I say no? I sure didn\u2019t want to drive that horrible old car Westwood had given me. It started, but when I\u2019d used the window defroster, there\u2019d been a terrible smell, like maybe a small animal had died inside the dashboard. Eww. Add a weird whistling noise, and you had creepy and eww. The driver\u2019s seat had a loose spring. Hit a bump and you were spanked. I was not accepting the junker. Either Simon or Westwood were buying me a new car. Alesa cheered me on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flo and I zoomed over the hills with the top down toward Aggie\u2019s shower at a famous Mexican restaurant with a view of the lake. I was determined to enjoy it since I\u2019d gotten a call from Simon that we\u2019d be taping the video later tonight.</p><p>\u201cLove this car,\u201d I shouted as we did a curve at eighty miles an hour. What can I say? I\u2019m immortal, and the front view was way better than the one from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s perfetto. How you like the red?\u201d Flo grinned and slammed on the brakes. \u201cSorry, but did you see the deer? I cannot bring myself to dent my fender on such a creature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood driving. I love the color. It\u2019s you. Matches your lipstick.\u201d I sighed as she took off again. Turbocharged. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I added it to my list of features.</p><p>\u201cMatches yours too.\u201d Flo turned into the parking lot. \u201cI hope Aggie knows what she\u2019s doing with this shower. Nice setting.\u201d She gestured at the half-empty lot. \u201cBut where are the people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, the restaurant is closed on Mondays. We have the whole place to ourselves. Good call for our Siren.\u201d I unbuckled my seat belt and pulled a brush out of my purse. \u201cHold on a minute. Let me untangle this mess.\u201d I went to work on my hair. \u201cAnd, second, some of your guests obviously will shift to get here. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Flo stopped in the middle of her own hair brushing. \u201cNot with a package for me. But maybe they carpool. For a moment I had a doubt. Am I not popular?\u201d She put her hand on my arm. \u201cI know one thing. Until I came here, I never had a real girlfriend. Men? Pfft. I could always get men. But I didn\u2019t get really close to other women until you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I reached across and hugged her. \u201cI love you, Flo. You\u2019re like the sister I never had, only Italian.\u201d I laughed and sat back. \u201cHey, why so serious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing for me. With the wedding.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cIt means everything to me, mia amica.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, all the emotions I\u2019d been stuffing down lately welling up. I\u2019d like to tell her how mixed up I was about Rafe and Jerry, even Ray. I hated hurting any of them but saw no way around it. Ray had been hit first, and it had killed me to see his pain. I knew now that I\u2019d have to let Rafe down too. And he was my best friend. How could I reject him like that? And when Jerry found out what Rafe and I had done . . . I didn\u2019t deserve Flo\u2019s love. Didn\u2019t deserve anyone\u2019s. God, but I was tempted to lay my head on Flo\u2019s shoulder and sob. But she was the bride, and this was her week to have no worries at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you have Richard, Flo. And that he makes you happy. I just want this wedding to be perfect for you.\u201d I hugged her again. \u201cNow we\u2019d better fix our makeup and get inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ec, I want to see who Aggie dragged out here for this.\u201d Flo pulled out her makeup bag.</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves you, Flo.\u201d I grinned at her. \u201cWell, except maybe your mother-in-law. Aggie says even she\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m dreading this thing.\u201d Flo finished powdering her nose, then opened her car door.</p> <p>\u201cOne more thing to dread. We\u2019re playing games.\u201d I got out of the car and faced her across the open top. \u201cPlease be nice and go along with it. Aggie\u2019s never done this sort of thing before. You want more gal pals? Pretend to have fun. There will be booze. Drown your dislike of games. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooze?\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou mean blood with a kick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s get hammered.\u201d I walked around the car and linked my arm through hers. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll play Aggie\u2019s stupid games. This place faces the lake. How about we throw her off the balcony at the end of the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend, I can suffer through anything if I have that to look forward to. I\u2019ve never forgotten how that Siren turned me into a statue.\u201d Flo laughed and pulled me toward the door. \u201cPayback time. And lots of new lingerie. What could be better?\u201d</p><p>Aggie greeted us at the door. She looked gorgeous in a designer dress that I\u2019d never be able to afford. The green print matched her eyes, and her blond hair was pulled back with a silver clip that looked like a piece of sculpture. Wow. My own red pantsuit screamed end-of-year clearance.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s our guest of honor now!\u201d Aggie gushed. She thrust a basket at us. \u201cPick a number. We\u2019re playing a team game or two, so you\u2019ll need to see which team you\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a folded paper. One. Flo showed me she\u2019d drawn a two. Opposite teams. Oh, well.</p><p>\u201cGrab a drink. Would you believe I found margarita-flavored blood on the Internet? Try it and tell me what you think.\u201d Aggie nodded, and a waiter in a serape came forward with a tray. He was obviously human and terrified, the glasses shaking and rattling. His name tag said Rudolpho. Aggie patted him on the shoulder. \u201cWould you relax? I told you. No worries. These ladies are harmless.\u201d Aggie turned to me and winked. \u201cAB negative, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>I snagged a glass and sipped. Okay, I could get used to this. It definitely kicked. Another waiter came by with the EV chips and salsa. I dove in. My kind of party.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, Florence. Darlings, I don\u2019t know where you met this Siren, but she throws a great party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiCi!\u201d I grabbed my dear friend and surrogate mother, Countess Cecilia von Repsdorph, and hugged her. Flo claimed her next. CiCi had been in Paris for months but had flown in for the wedding with her son and his partner. I desperately needed her sane advice but couldn\u2019t drag her off to burden her with my angst now. Not when there were margaritas on hand.</p><p>It seemed like every paranormal female in Austin, and quite a few from Europe, had shown up for this shower. I added a few to my guest list for Wednesday night. Flo was thrilled, especially by the large table full of wrapped packages.</p><p>Aggie clapped her hands for attention. \u201cLadies, please get into your teams now. There are four of them.\u201d</p><p>I was on margarita number three and eyeing Rudolpho for a nightcap. Hmmm. Definitely feeling a buzz, and my hellish side was picking up steam.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and snack on the waiter. Hell girls don\u2019t hold back.\u201d Alesa giggled, obviously feeling the buzz too.</p><p>\u201cFirst game. Check your purses. Here\u2019s a list of oddball items. You have ten minutes, and the team that finds the most things on that list in their purses wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWins what?\u201d I shouted, definitely thinking Rudolpho would make a nice prize. Three other vamps on my team noticed where I was staring and grinned.</p><p>\u201cEach team member gets a choice of a case of margarita Blud-Lite or a one-hundred-dollar gift card at the mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoo-hoo! Game on!\u201d Lacy was on my team, and she grabbed a copy of the list from Aggie.</p><p>\u201cTime starts now.\u201d Aggie looked at her Rolex.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the list, Lacy?\u201d I could go for some Blud-Lite to take home.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re toast. This is stupid. Who carries a corkscrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got one.\u201d This from Erin, one of my night clerks. Hmm. \u201cIs there a flask on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but how about a box of condoms?\u201d</p><p>The shifter who cut my and Flo\u2019s hair offered up one of those in a jumbo size that raised a few eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHurry, my dear. Team three has six items already.\u201d CiCi snatched the list. \u201cEloise, get over here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d met Eloise Duval briefly. She was a witch who Flo and CiCi knew from Europe. Apparently she\u2019d come in with the countess and had been happy to jump in on all the wedding festivities. I smiled because I knew we were set to win now. Eloise was the only witch here, and she glanced around the circle at her teammates. We all nodded, not a conscience among us.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it!\u201d Alesa crowed. And didn\u2019t that make me think through my alcoholic haze.</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d Eloise cried, digging into her black patent designer tote. \u201cI have an empty beer can and a jock strap.\u201d</p><p>That last one cracked me up, and she threw it at me. I caught it and dropped it next to the box of condoms.</p><p>\u201cWhat luck! It\u2019s jumbo too.\u201d We all laughed.</p><p>\u201cTwo-minute warning. Team three is ahead with six items. Who knew that Diana carried around a sex manual in her purse?\u201d Aggie danced around with excitement in her Louboutin pumps while team three high-fived each other. Team two, with Flo complaining bitterly that she should have carried her tote instead of the cute little clutch, dug frantically in their purses. Team four had settled into heavy drinking and eating, obviously not competitive.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eloise. What else ya got?\u201d I grabbed another drink from Waiter Boy, setting my empty on his tray and inhaling his blood type. I flashed fang, and he ran as fast as his loaded tray would let him.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have a hotel room key.\u201d Lacy pulled it out of her hobo bag. She grinned. \u201cSouvenir of a great weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got the massage oil.\u201d The beautician tossed it on the pile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re tied!\u201d Maybe I\u2019d check my purse. Sure Eloise could conjure up a dead cat if we needed one, but winning by cheating wouldn\u2019t be all that satisfying. When Alesa jeered, I realized I still had enough conscience left to want to play fair. There was a squeal as team two reached six items.</p><p>\u201cOne more minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCD of love songs!\u201d I threw it on the pile. I\u2019d planned to use it in my beater to try to drown out the weird sounds. No luck. The Hell Hauler, as I\u2019d dubbed it, only had a tape player.</p><p>\u201cWow, here\u2019s a tube of lube.\u201d I flushed as all eyes on me widened. \u201cNot for me, of course. A joke for Flo, at the bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>One more grab into my designer knockoff, and I jumped up, the room spinning. \u201cPicture of naked man, full frontal. Another bachelorette thing!\u201d I tossed it on the pile just as Aggie called, \u201cTime!\u201d My team leaped to its feet, and I was rushed and crushed in a group hug.</p><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d Lacy threw herself at Aggie, waving the list. \u201cBlew them out of the water!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flo gave Eloise a narrow-eyed look. Her friend threw up her hands.</p><p>\u201cFair and square, ch\u00e9ri. Gloriana\u2019s purse is a den of iniquity, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I fell onto a chair, truly blitzed. \u201cI want my stuff back as soon as Aggie\u2019s done the official count.\u201d I crooked my finger at my favorite waiter, but he rushed off in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\u201cWhen do I open my presents?\u201d Flo had clearly had enough of games. She didn\u2019t take losing well.</p><p>\u201cEveryone out on the patio. Achy wants to do his thing.\u201d Aggie grimaced, but her look begged us not to complain.</p><p>\u201cSure, can\u2019t wait.\u201d I helped her herd the gang outside. \u201cThe Storm God\u2019s gonna light up the sky. No rain, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I asked him to hold the waterworks.\u201d Aggie smiled.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Flo grabbed my arm. \u201cLook at that.\u201d The lightning display was awesome. Thunder shook the building, and the lights flickered but never went out. For about fifteen minutes we saw a truly spectacular and colorful show in the night sky. The capper was the waterspout that narrowly missed the balcony.</p> <p>\u201cThat was great, Aggie. Tell your boss he\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>Aggie made a face. \u201cOh, I do. Nightly. It\u2019s all part of my, um, job.\u201d She gestured for us to go inside.</p><p>\u201cGifts now?\u201d Flo started toward the loaded table.</p><p>\u201cOne more game, Flo.\u201d Aggie grabbed Flo\u2019s arm but released it when she got a death glare. \u201cCome on, sweetie. That last one was fun, admit it.\u201d</p><p>Flo picked up the picture I\u2019d printed off the Internet. \u201cGlory, this man looks a lot like my Ricardo. You aren\u2019t secretly lusting for my man, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Hell, no.\u201d I stumbled up to her. I\u2019d had two more margaritas during the light show. \u201cIt was for a joke at the bachelorette party. Does look sort of like him, doesn\u2019t it? Of course Rich is way better looking than this guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLadies, please. This is unseemly. This man is naked.\u201d Sarah Mainwaring had arrived fashionably late. She practically tore it out of Flo\u2019s hands and returned it to me facedown.</p><p>I stuck it in my purse and grabbed another margarita for each of us. \u201cFlo, I\u2019d sure never go after my best friend\u2019s man, no matter how wonderful he is. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She smiled at her mother-in-law. \u201cNo more games, Aggie. Time to open gifts. I can\u2019t wait to see what you brought me, Mother Mainwaring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d Sarah looked ready for the queen\u2019s garden party in a demure cornflower blue shirtwaist dress, panty hose and pumps, but the look in her eyes promised a surprise Flo wouldn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever the bride wants.\u201d Aggie grabbed Flo and hauled her toward the laden table. \u201cTime to open presents.\u201d</p><p>Flo tore into her first gift and exclaimed over a black bra and panty set. Lacy came to stand beside me to watch, then glanced at the buffet table laden with Mexican food where the shifters from team four had congregated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to eat. Great food, too bad you can\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the vamp treats. Aggie\u2019s done a terrific job. Didn\u2019t think she had it in her.\u201d I saw Flo hold up the vintage bustier I\u2019d promised her, and CiCi exclaimed over it. Trust my old friend to appreciate a fine piece.</p> <p>Lacy nodded. \u201cNice present you gave her. Are we still closing the store Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? I can do it once in a while. I want all of you to come to the bachelorette party. I promise it\u2019ll be fun. Remember, come as your favorite seductress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019ve been thinking about that. May have to borrow something from the shop to wear.\u201d Lacy bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d Ah, my waiter was back. I snagged another Blud-Lite and winked at him. Off he ran. Then I watched Flo open more presents. I glanced at my watch. This had to be my last drink. I hated to think about it, but I was going to have to head to the video shoot later. Showing up soused wouldn\u2019t help me there.</p><p>Flo held up a long white cotton nightgown that would cover every inch of her. One guess who\u2019d given her that. I jumped in front of Sarah before Flo could toss her off the balcony. What a party. I\u2019d have to go some to top it. I hit speed dial.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey, how\u2019d you like to dance naked for a bunch of drunk ladies?\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>\u201cGloriana? What the hell is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Oops. What had I done? I looked at my phone like it had betrayed me. Nope, it had been my fumbling fingers that had hit Jerry\u2019s number instead of Ray\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi, Jerry.\u201d I laughed and walked away from the squeals and laughter as Flo held up a pair of crotchless panties from Lacy.</p><p>\u201cDance naked for drunken ladies?\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice dropped into a low and sexy growl. \u201cI\u2019m not much for dancing, but if it\u2019s just you and me, I\u2019m more than willing to give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>My inner thermostat jumped a few hundred degrees. Whoa, but I\u2019d underestimated my guy. I spotted a chair behind a tall plant.</p><p>\u201cI admit I\u2019ve always liked your horizontal moves.\u201d I heard my husky laugh like an out-of-body experience. \u201cYour dancing? Strip you down and who\u2019d notice whether you had rhythm. Forget sharing. Blame that suggestion on this stuff I\u2019ve been drinking.\u201d I polished off my last, I swear it, margarita.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? And why are you wasting a good buzz when I\u2019m not there for the payoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Flo\u2019s lingerie shower. Aggie\u2019s supplied some blood with a kick. I\u2019m kicking pretty good. Wish you were here.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the naked part.\u201d Jerry\u2019s chuckle made my thighs clench. \u201cYou\u2019re there too. Naked, of course, and stretched out on my bed. Touch yourself. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone sex? This guy has potential.\u201d Alesa giggled. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d I sagged onto the chair and looked around. Coast was clear. I slid one hand between my legs. Too much fabric and no Jerry. \u201cNot good enough. When are you coming home?\u201d Refused to think about what would happen then.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. When\u2019s the bachelorette party with the dancing naked men?\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice hardened from sexy to serious. \u201cAnd who the hell are these men if I\u2019m not one of them? Which you\u2019ve got to know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just killed my mood.\u201d I sat up straight. \u201cWednesday night. I\u2019ve got some shifters lined up who claim they can shake their butts. No big deal. Not really naked. It\u2019s standard fare for bachelorette parties, Jer. A bride\u2019s last chance to check out other guys. Don\u2019t stress over it.\u201d The laughter and cheers got louder in the next room. Must have been something really special.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t just be Florence checking out those men. I know you, Gloriana. You\u2019ve always had an eye for a well-built man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it, big guy,\u201d I purred. \u201cCome on home, and I\u2019ll show you how I appreciate a Scottish warrior\u2019s, um, build.\u201d I slid my hand between my legs again and moaned.</p><p>\u201cBy God, Gloriana, I\u2019d be in the air right now if I could.\u201d Jerry sounded desperate. \u201cWednesday night. That\u2019s as soon as I can manage it. Probably close to dawn. Save me Thursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHee, hee, hee. And if he and Rafe meet up then? Bloodbath. My favorite kind.\u201d Alesa poked me in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cThursday?\u201d My voice cracked. \u201cThat\u2019s Rafe\u2019s club opening, Jerry. He\u2019s counting on our support. Nadia\u2019s reserved a special table for us, Flo and Richard. CiCi\u2019s in town, with Freddy and Derek. We could make a party out of it.\u201d Safety in numbers. Witnesses. Whatever. As an extra added attraction, Ray there singing and dying to let Jerry know what I\u2019d been up to while my Scot had been out of town. \u201cWe can have a private party of our own later.\u201d If any of us survived. Or were in a partying mood.</p><p>\u201cIf we must. But it\u2019ll be the private part I\u2019ll look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. See you Thursday, then, Jer. Can\u2019t wait. Now I\u2019ve got to go. Flo\u2019s opening her presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Wedding duties. I\u2019ve arranged for Richard\u2019s bachelor party on Friday night. Seems I\u2019ll need a naked woman now for that.\u201d Jerry laughed when I snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair. But I\u2019m sure as hell not asking you to stand in for that. I keep my woman all to myself.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue. Another possessive male. I loved and hated that about Jerry. I really shouldn\u2019t have had that last margarita. The room was a blur, and I wanted to strip off and do nasty things to Rudolpho while I drained him dry. I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t my demonic urges calling the shots either.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Finally, you admit you\u2019ve got your own bad girl. So let\u2019s par-tay.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and gripped the phone. Focus. \u201cStick to poker and cigars. I\u2019ve heard Flo\u2019s lethal when she\u2019s jealous. Me too.\u201d My fuzzy head flopped back, and I stared at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be jealous, Gloriana. I am and always will be yours. Thursday, after the opening, I\u2019ll show you what a good boy I can be.\u201d Jerry hung up.</p><p>My mind filled in the blanks. Mmm. Rudolpho made the mistake of coming too close. I squeezed his ass, then snagged another drink. What the hell? I was way past drunk as a skunk and had the damned video to look forward to. I figured I was probably a better actress sloshed anyway. And of course Rafe the great protector would go out there with me.</p><p>A damned shame that I was going to break up with him before Jerry got home. I tossed back the drink and wished it would knock me unconscious. This week looked to be the worst in my life. Alesa laughed hysterically, more than high herself and looking forward to every painful moment of it.</p><p>I staggered out to the gift area in time to see Flo hold up a pair of tiny panties that wouldn\u2019t have fit me after the age of ten. I smiled and propped myself up against a wall. Couldn\u2019t hate her. Loved her. She\u2019d tell me to do whatever it took to keep Jerry and Rafe happy. Alesa was right there with her and flashed me with hellfire to prove it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. I ripped off my jacket and grabbed a handful of ice from the bowl of boiled shrimp on the buffet table. I shoved it down my bra until I chilled out. A handful on my cheeks went a long way toward getting me sober again. Or at least less shit-faced. The party was winding down. Flo tore into the last package, a sheer apple green silk teddy and panty set that made my mouth water. Not close to my size, of course.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aggie, and thanks for a great shower.\u201d Flo actually hugged the blushing Siren. \u201cGuess Glory and I won\u2019t toss you into the lake after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? That would be the perfect ending to this night.\u201d Aggie reached back and unzipped her dress, then stepped out of it and kicked off her shoes. \u201cAnyone else up for a moonlight swim?\u201d She looked trim and perfect in an emerald green bra and matching bikini panties.</p> <p>To my amazement several shifters shouted \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d and began stripping off to go with her.</p><p>\u201cGreat party, Aggie.\u201d I got to her as she was climbing up on the stone wall that circled the patio facing the lake. The water was at least a hundred yards below, and there were some pretty treacherous rocks near the shore. One shifter had already made a squealing leap off the cliff, though, and had landed safely beyond the rocks. Now she was egging on the rest to hurry up. Immortals. What did they have to lose?</p><p>\u201cThanks, Glory. The party favors are by the door. Each vampire gets to take home a case of Blud-Lite.\u201d She grinned and stood poised to dive.</p><p>\u201cWow! Thanks.\u201d Obviously Aggie had spared no expense. \u201cSee you Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d Then she took off, her feet changing into her mermaid\u2019s tail in midair.</p> <p>I heard a crash and turned to see Rudolpho slouched on the floor, hyperventilating with his head between his knees and surrounded by broken glasses. Guess he\u2019d finally seen enough.</p><p>\u201cQuite an interesting woman.\u201d CiCi stood next to me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone had better do the whammy on the mortal waitstaff, Glory.\u201d Lacy crammed her gift card, a naked-man picture and enough food to feed her entire were-cat family into her tote. She reached forward and plucked something out of my cleavage. \u201cNice accessory, but that\u2019s kitty food.\u201d She popped a boiled shrimp into her mouth.</p><p>CiCi gave me a funny look. \u201cAre you all right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. Tell you later.\u201d I pulled out my damp tank top and peered down my bra. \u201cSorry, Lacy, but that\u2019s it.\u201d I glanced at the empty buffet. \u201cYou\u2019re shrimp out of luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Aggie put out a generous spread, but you know shifters. Fast metabolisms. Of course you see how we eat, hanging with Rafe now and all.\u201d Lacy smiled at CiCi. \u201cGlad you\u2019re back, CiCi. Glory needs a friend. Flo\u2019s been way too busy with this wedding to help her.\u201d She glanced at the door. \u201cOops. Got to jet.\u201d She ran to join two other were-cats with bulging tote bags for a kitty car pool.</p> <p>\u201cYou and Rafe? I can\u2019t read your thoughts. Who is this Rafe?\u201d CiCi touched my arm. \u201cCan we sit and talk now, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry but I\u2019ve got to go. Seriously.\u201d I glanced at my watch. \u201cLate date. Rafe is Valdez. You remember my shape-shifter, the dog. He\u2019s done with his contract as my bodyguard, and now he\u2019s in human form. Hot human form. He and I . . .\u201d I grabbed my purse and my case of Blud-Lite. \u201cWell, we got together.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at CiCi. She was solidly in Jerry\u2019s camp, like most of the ancient vampires in Austin would be. Seems they thought vamps should stick with vamps. Some people would say that\u2019s racist. I wasn\u2019t about to start that debate.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jeremiah broke up?\u201d CiCi was on my heels all the way to the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, not officially. Not at all, actually. But ...\u201d I sent CiCi what I figured was a desperate look. \u201cCan you come by tomorrow night? Maybe you can help me figure things out. I\u2019ve got a hell of a mess on my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, girlfriend.\u201d Flo was suddenly right next to CiCi. \u201cWe\u2019ll both be there. I don\u2019t care what wedding stuff is going down. Your friends are here for you. See you right after sunset in your apartment. Am I right, CiCi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And don\u2019t worry about the waitstaff.\u201d CiCi watched a wild-eyed Rudolpho scurry past, his tray full of debris. \u201cI like that one\u2019s type. I\u2019ll take care of him and the rest. Glory, are you going to help Florence with her gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrazie. But that\u2019s not necessary. There are too many, and my convertible is too small. I called Ricardo to pick me up in his big car.\u201d Flo glanced back at the huge pile of gifts. \u201cA great haul, eh? But now I need a favor, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, anything.\u201d My buzz really was fading, and I needed to get moving. I wondered if Flo would take my case of drinks since I was going to have to shift to meet Rafe at his club.</p> <p>\u201cWill you drive my car back to your apartment? You can take your prize and just keep the keys for now. I\u2019ll get them tomorrow.\u201d Flo dropped them into my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to drive your car? Your new car?\u201d I stared down at the keys. \u201cI can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thanks. Pick up an extra case of the Blud-Lite. Aggie had plenty.\u201d Flo licked her lips. \u201cDelicious. I\u2019m ordering some.\u201d She picked up a sheer flame red nightgown. \u201cIt\u2019s made me very amorous too. I told Ricardo to hurry. Tonight we start a new honeymoon.\u201d Flo turned to speak to a departing guest.</p><p>I sighed, totally jealous. I\u2019d been fighting my own hunger for something more than EV nachos since I\u2019d started knocking back those margaritas. Jerry\u2019s phone call had made it worse. But I couldn\u2019t just use Rafe to scratch an itch.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Men live to be used like that, honey. Admit it, you want him again. The man knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>No way. I pushed my good versus evil war to the back burner and hugged Flo.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll be super careful with the car. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Run along. I bet Rafael is waiting for you. Am I right?\u201d Flo glanced at CiCi. \u201cDon\u2019t frown at me. Glory can have a little fun with a handsome man. Remember the time you . . .\u201d</p><p>I left them arguing about CiCi\u2019s affairs in Paris and ran out to the car. I popped the trunk and carefully stowed my two cases in the back, then settled into the driver\u2019s seat, adjusting it until my feet touched the pedals just right. The car started with a roar.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>I paused with my hand on the gearshift. \u201cLooks like it.\u201d I grinned. \u201cWant to ride with me to Rafe\u2019s club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay to drive? Someone told me you\u2019ve been hitting the joy juice pretty hard. Don\u2019t blame ya. It was good stuff.\u201d Ray laughed and jumped into the passenger seat. \u201cSweet ride. Tell me you finally gave up on that junker you were drivin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. This is Flo\u2019s, but I\u2019ve got one on order for myself.\u201d I put the car into reverse and backed out of the parking spot. \u201cLooks like you tried the joy juice yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. They even have a Scotch-flavored blood. I\u2019m feeling no pain.\u201d Ray leaned back and grinned.</p><p>\u201cMy buzz is fading fast, but if you\u2019re scared to ride with me, jump out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve always liked to live on the edge.\u201d He did buckle his seat belt.</p><p>\u201cHang on. Let\u2019s see what this baby\u2019s got.\u201d I put it in drive and hit the accelerator. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMet with the owner. He\u2019s a shifter. My record label is throwing a party here. Part of the music festival.\u201d Ray didn\u2019t have to shout over the wind noise; our vamp hearing did its job.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great venue.\u201d I was on the open road now and having trouble concentrating on what Ray was saying. The car drove like a dream.</p><p>\u201cLooked like you girls were havin\u2019 a good time. Felt sorry for the mortal waiters. I saw one of them being taken down a pint out by the Dumpster and two other vamps in line.\u201d Ray put his hands in the air to feel the breeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah, one tempted me. AB neg.\u201d I was really rolling now, taking curves like I was practicing for the Indy 500. Ray put his hand on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cPull over. That stuff I drank made me horny as hell. You still up for a pity play?\u201d</p><p>Boy, was my hell side ready to rock and roll. Guess my buzz was still there too because I actually thought about it for a second. But a second was all. My rational side knew better than to start something with Ray now. Not fair to him, definitely not fair to Rafe or Jerry. And even if I could get my conscience to take a hike, showing up to meet Rafe with rocker sex all over me was suicidal.</p><p>\u201cGee, Glory, take the stick out of your ass and say yes. Ever hear of a bath? Air freshener? Perfume? Rafe\u2019ll never know. Rocker boy can scratch that itch. Pull over and get with it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, not about to let my demon have her day, er, night. I managed to shake my head.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ray. As flattering as that offer is, I\u2019ll have to pass. Obviously that ship has sailed. Right now I\u2019ve got to go out to the lake. We\u2019re remaking Titanic only without the ocean liner. Simon\u2019s directing.\u201d Nice water thing going here. My demon screeched, ready to drown me in the nearest puddle.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ray flinched when I almost clipped a guardrail. Someone had pulled the car toward a rest stop for that scratching session.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I fought it back to the road.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful. Dent her new car, and Flo would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me if she could find me. I\u2019d know better than to make it easy.\u201d The car swerved again before I dragged my eyes from Ray\u2019s pretty blue eyes and hot body. Tonight he had on a black silk shirt, unbuttoned low, and snug jeans. Horny? I squirmed in my leather bucket seat.</p><p>\u201cTitanic? Simon?\u201d Ray kept his hand on my neck, one finger sliding up and down my jugular. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\u201d\u2014I had to clear my throat\u2014\u201cuh, we\u2019re making a video so it\u2019ll seem like we staged Westwood\u2019s death. Then the hunter\u2019ll hop up at the end and show he never died. Confess he didn\u2019t really kill any vampires. That all the stuff on his Web site is bogus. He\u2019s going to take the video to his kids and get access to his money again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRise from the dead.\u201d Ray let his hand graze my breast. \u201cWhy\u2019re you helping him? He threatenin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d I plucked his hand off of me. Fumes. Ray had really hit the alcoholic blood hard. \u201cSimon\u2019s the one with the threats. He\u2019s got video of me with Rafe. Says he\u2019ll send it to Jerry if I don\u2019t cooperate.\u201d We were out of the hills and into a populated area now, and I stopped at a red light. \u201cI can\u2019t hurt Jerry that way. If I want to tell him about Rafe, I will. But to have it just show up in an e-mail ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s cold.\u201d Ray yawned when the light turned green. \u201cSo Simon\u2019s got you. Bastard. But then he\u2019s always been one. No news there.\u201d He dropped his hand on my knee. \u201cSorry, babe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a script in my purse.\u201d A messenger had dropped it off right after Simon\u2019s call. \u201cCheck it out. Simon\u2019s got us talking like we\u2019re in a bad horror flick.\u201d</p><p>Ray pulled my purse from the backseat and found a picture first. \u201cNaked man? Obviously these guys you hang with aren\u2019t taking care of you right.\u201d He slid his hand up my thigh. \u201cGlory, baby, don\u2019t you know you can call, anytime, and I\u2019ll be glad to give you the real deal?\u201d</p><p>I shivered and managed to lift his hand off despite Alesa\u2019s screeches in my head calling me all kinds of an idiot.</p><p>\u201cThat picture\u2019s part of a bachelorette game. Not going to use it now. No games at the party. Flo really hates them.\u201d I\u2019d printed half a dozen. I was surprised Lacy had left me one. Ray naked. Oh, boy, did I remember the perfection of his body. \u201cGrab the thick pack of papers, Ray.\u201d</p><p>He skimmed it, laughing. \u201cNo one talks like this. \u2018You\u2019ll rue the day you ever killed a vampire, you evil monster.\u2019\u201d Ray laughed. \u201cSorry, honey, but seems more likely you\u2019d have called him a sack of shit. Don\u2019t remember what the hell you said that night, but Destiny would do better to make it a silent picture than have you spout junk like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s a good idea. Westwood can say the audio went out.\u201d I turned onto Sixth Street. \u201cThanks for being a friend, Ray. I mean it. I needed to just talk about this. I haven\u2019t been able to with anybody except Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Dog Breath is all about being the big protector, am I right?\u201d Ray rubbed my knee. \u201cLet me out here, a few blocks from the club. I\u2019ll walk the rest of the way. Need to clear my head before rehearsal. I admit that blood with a kick knocked me for a loop. I sure as hell don\u2019t feel like another face-off with your furry friend when I\u2019m not in top form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe is my protector. Being out there in the middle of a bunch of Energy Vampires isn\u2019t easy. Rafe makes me feel safe.\u201d I pulled over and stopped.</p><p>\u201cBut does he make you feel this?\u201d Ray leaned in and kissed me, one of his deep and searching kisses that never failed to heat me from head to toe. Spots in between lit up like he\u2019d put a torch to them. The booze cooperated, and I clutched his silky shirt, then ran one hand inside to stroke his cool skin.</p><p>\u201cWoo-hoo! This cowgirl could take this stallion for a ride tonight. What are we waiting for, Glo? Turn the car around and head for the nearest horizontal surface.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t listen to Alesa, who, for a change, seemed to make sense.</p> <p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t feel sorry for me tonight, Glory girl?\u201d Ray whispered as he palmed my breast and licked my jugular. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe that dog your loyalty, now do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman would have to be a fool to feel sorry for you, Israel Caine.\u201d I eased back and took a breath I didn\u2019t need. Alesa shrieked so loudly my ears rang. \u201cNot saying you aren\u2019t temptation wrapped in a hot body, but my life is way too complicated already.\u201d I sighed. Yep, my life was so far off the rails now, I couldn\u2019t even imagine fixing things.</p><p>Ray stared at me, trying to read my mind. No luck of course. \u201cI thought I had you there for a moment. I swear I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re good. No doubt about it. But this is where you get out.\u201d I smiled and ran my hand over his cheek, rough with an early-morning beard.</p><p>The look on Ray\u2019s face made me yank my hand away. I closed my eyes against the dare in his. Suddenly I felt his fangs drift across my jugular, and my eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cRelax, babe. I\u2019ll make it great for you. Turn off the engine, and we\u2019ll ditch the car. Go somewhere private. No one will ever have to know.\u201d He stared down at me, willing me to forget everything and go for it.</p><p>Go for it. Alesa urged me to go for it too, and it took everything in me to ignore her screams to take Ray up on his offer.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019d know. I\u2019m not doing this, Ray, and when you sober up, you\u2019ll realize you didn\u2019t want it this way either.\u201d I shoved at him gently. Damned demon. Damned alcohol. I never should have kissed him back, but something in me couldn\u2019t seem to resist him. The world swam as tears filled my eyes. Ray didn\u2019t deserve my \u201cnow she wants me, now she doesn\u2019t\u201d act. He proved it when he didn\u2019t force the issue but leaped out of the car.</p> <p>\u201cGuess I did drink too much \u2019cause I\u2019d told myself I\u2019d never beg you for it again. Do me a favor and forget this happened. I just made a damn fool of myself.\u201d He shrugged, his smile crooked. \u201cGood luck with your men, Glory girl. Count me out of the panting pack. Israel Caine is finally movin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>He whirled and became a hawk, silently flying out over the rooftops, away from Rafe\u2019s club. Hopefully the flight would sober him up. I sighed, pulled my clothes together and pressed my head against the steering wheel. No way could I drive yet. Not with tears blurring the street in front of me and my hands shaking. I had the sick feeling that I\u2019d lost Ray forever this time.</p><p>I should have known Alesa would feel the need to comment.</p><p>\u201cYou are the dumbest dipshit I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune to inhabit. Now don\u2019t screw up things with this next guy, or I\u2019ll really make your life a living hell.\u201d One final jab with what felt like a stiletto heel right between the eyes made the street go out of focus for a moment. Then she settled back for the ride.</p><p>I tried to think about what had just happened. Ray had always just been a fantasy man, the rock star I\u2019d been lucky enough to attract by accident. Dumb me didn\u2019t know what to do with a man who treated me as an equal from the get-go. A twentieth-century male.</p><p>Ancient males. Yep, that was my type. Always had been. Then I bitched and moaned about the reality of their bossiness and possessive attitudes. Jerry and Rafe were just the current members of the club. I banged my head on the steering wheel until I realized I might damage it and couldn\u2019t afford the repairs. Time to make a move.</p><p>I pulled up in front of the club minutes later. Rafe stood out front. His eyes widened when he saw what I was driving.</p><p>\u201cFlo\u2019s car?\u201d He leaned in and looked it over. I saw him sniffing the air but ignored it. He didn\u2019t ask about Ray so maybe he assumed Flo had taken him for a ride recently.</p><p>\u201cI have to put it in back of the shop. Are we shifting out to the lake?\u201d I dreaded it. The weather was cool and clear, a perfect Austin spring night. But shifting was one more stress I didn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll drive. I\u2019m parked behind your shop. Meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I gunned the motor, almost hitting a car traveling down the street. Great. I had to get a grip and pay attention. By the time I\u2019d settled into the passenger seat in Rafe\u2019s SUV, I was calm enough and had a story ready if he asked about Ray. He didn\u2019t. Which worried me.</p><p>\u201cHow was the shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper. Flo got lots of presents, and Aggie was a good hostess. She and some shifters jumped in the lake when it was all over.\u201d I opened the window and let the night air hit me, desperate to get rid of Ray\u2019s scent. Rafe\u2019s nose twitched from time to time, but he hadn\u2019t called me on it.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s already planning how he\u2019ll rip Ray\u2019s head off and use it for batting practice right after his club opening. That\u2019s how a demon takes care of a rival.\u201d</p><p>Thanks for the info, Alesa. I swallowed, all those margaritas and chips I\u2019d devoured suddenly fighting with each other for a chance to see moonlight.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Did you get a chance to work on that script?\u201d Rafe never took his eyes off the road. We were on a twisty route that did require some concentration but not that much. Was he mad? I eased closer and put my hand on his thigh. To my relief, he smiled.</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s hopeless. Simon should shoot the video without sound. Think about it. That night the camera would have had to have been far away. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s better.\u201d Rafe put his hand over mine and rubbed his leg with it, easing it toward his zipper. Uh-oh. \u201cThis whole thing is stupid and dangerous. No way am I letting Westwood point a loaded crossbow at you.\u201d Rafe\u2019s hand tightened on mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy about the idea either. But how are we going to make it look realistic?\u201d I glanced out the window. It took a lot longer to get to the site when we had to drive. We were late. But Simon hadn\u2019t called. Or had he? I dug in my purse, which was a good excuse to get my hand back. I\u2019d turned off my phone after talking to Jerry because my battery was almost dead. I turned it on. Yep, missed call from the great unknown. Simon, of course. I didn\u2019t bother to listen. I was on my way. What more could I do?</p><p>\u201cScrew realistic. All Westwood\u2019s kids have to see is that their dad is alive, this video with a supposed vampire and a crossbow was a setup. That\u2019s it. This elaborate film is just pandering to Simon\u2019s ego. I say whatever gets taped tonight is it. End of story.\u201d Rafe\u2019s jaw was set. I sure wouldn\u2019t want to argue with him. Of course what did he have on the line?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens when we get there.\u201d Finally I saw the road where we turned off into the woods. I did want to wrap this up tonight. After that, I hoped I never saw Brent Westwood again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon was all business as he directed his cameraman and blocked out the shot next to the lake. The wind had picked up, and the water was rough.</p><p>\u201cValdez, since you insisted on tagging along, you may as well do your dog thing. I\u2019ll play the part of Israel Caine, since I can make myself look just like him.\u201d Simon smiled and ran his fingers through his thin hair.</p><p>That boast would have made me gag except it was the truth. What I couldn\u2019t figure out was why Simon didn\u2019t put on a better looking fa\u00e7ade all the time. Right now he was in his regular weasel face. Oops, a face Rafe had pushed too close to.</p> <p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m not here to play dog. I\u2019m here to keep Glory safe.\u201d Rafe frowned down at my hand on his arm. \u201cRelax, sweetheart, this fanged Spielberg wannabe and I will get this straight. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got other shifters or vamps who can do the dog thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana is perfectly safe as long as she plays her part. As to the dog . . . ? Fine. Kaplan can do it.\u201d Simon snapped his fingers twice, and Greg strolled out from the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou need me, boss?\u201d Greg smiled at me. \u201cReady to get started, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d Now I smiled because I knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll play the dog, Kaplan.\u201d Simon pointed at the lake. \u201cThe three of us will crawl out of the water and confront Westwood.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed as Greg\u2019s face fell. \u201cBut we need Ray\u2019s bodyguard, Brittany, a shape-shifter. She flew overhead, shifted, then walked up with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Guess Greg can be Brittany, who\u2019s tall, stacked and blond, or the dog. Take your pick, bud.\u201d Rafe looked Greg over.</p><p>\u201cAnother character. Did she have lines, Gloriana?\u201d Simon made a note on his clipboard. \u201cWhat about wardrobe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say a thing. She was just ready to rip apart anyone who got near Ray.\u201d I glanced at Greg. \u201cWore jeans and a T-shirt. What\u2019s it going to be, Greg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the damned dog. I don\u2019t do women.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cExcept when I do women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBevis, get out here.\u201d Simon paced until the man walked up. \u201cYou\u2019ll shift into a tall blond female. Caine\u2019s bodyguard. What you\u2019re wearing should do for the role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis\u2019ll be choice. Two women with hot bodies in wet T-shirts. This goes on my Facebook page.\u201d Greg gasped when I grabbed his ear.</p><p>\u201cPost one second of anything with me in it, and I\u2019ll make sure you never \u2018do\u2019 a woman again. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Simon clapped. \u201cWell said, Gloriana. Listen to her, Gregory. Our work here is for my private use and Westwood\u2019s.\u201d Simon turned to glare at a whining Bevis. \u201cYou have your orders. Get with it or have a private meeting with the goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Suddenly Bevis was Brittany. Only not so much.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes!\u201d Rafe pulled out sunglasses. Of course none of the vampires even owned a pair, but we wished we did.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Beev. Could you go for a little less bride of Frankenstein and a little more Britney Spears?\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to hide my smile. We all watched Bevis tweak his look.</p><p>\u201cOh, give it up. No one is going to ask you to the prom, fella. You\u2019d better stay behind Simon a.k.a. Ray when we shoot.\u201d Greg shook his head. \u201cBut, for the record, nice chimichangas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaplan, show Valdez and Gloriana your dog. See if they approve.\u201d Simon sat in a director\u2019s chair with his name stenciled on the back. Definitely channeling Spielberg.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember how you looked, Valdez. Shift and show me the real deal.\u201d Greg smirked at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cNot interested. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Rafe crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d Greg huffed, then changed. His dog was a black Labrador retriever. All wrong.</p><p>\u201cI was a Labradoodle. Curl the hair.\u201d Rafe glanced at me. \u201cWhat else, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were much cuter, of course.\u201d I tugged at Greg\u2019s ears. \u201cHairier and rounder ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown eyes. Roll over and let me see your package. Or have you been fixed?\u201d Rafe\u2019s dimples were showing.</p><p>\u201cThat does it.\u201d Greg was back to his human form again. \u201cI figure I was close enough to pass. And I\u2019m not showing you my package, asshole. Ask Glory. I have definitely not been fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I don\u2019t remember a thing. Which means what you have must be highly forgettable.\u201d I put my arm around Rafe\u2019s waist. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Greg. It was dark during the face-off. You and Brittany Ugly will be in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get serious here.\u201d Simon was back with his clipboard. \u201cGloriana, are you satisfied that Gregory can do the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a dog? Oh, yes, he has a natural talent for it.\u201d I smiled at Greg.</p><p>\u201cYour costume is in the tent. I bought several sizes.\u201d Simon looked me over in a creepy way that made Alesa giggle and me want to hurl. \u201cI think I\u2019m a pretty good judge of what you might wear. Go change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I followed a man to a large tent, Rafe right behind me. \u201cCan you believe Alesa has the hots for Simon?\u201d I said as soon as we were inside.</p><p>\u201cFigures. Destiny\u2019s probably got a straight line to Lucifer. Alesa knows and loves evil. You saw her real face, didn\u2019t you? Looks attract her but aren\u2019t everything. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside that counts. The nastier, the better for her.\u201d Rafe pulled my sweater off over my head.</p><p>\u201cMy honey gets me. Isn\u2019t he sweet? I think you two have time for a quickie, Glo. Get with it.\u201d Alesa shoved me toward him.</p><p>I staggered and stepped back. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel good about having her in me, you know.\u201d I sifted through my costume choices. Simon had my sizes all right. I ignored his creepy underwear choices, sticking with my own.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you don\u2019t have to do this. We can shift out of here. Think of something ...\u201d Rafe put his hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. But let\u2019s just get this done.\u201d I sighed. He had no idea how Simon was forcing me to play this game. If Jerry got a steamy video of Rafe and me together while he was in Florida . . . Well, I was not going to let that happen. End of story.</p><p>We came out to find Simon dabbing fake soot on his face. I refused to do it.</p><p>\u201cI know we had just escaped from a burning building, but I\u2019m going to be wet. It\u2019ll probably wash off anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be right. We\u2019ll see. This will just be a dress rehearsal.\u201d He signaled the cameraman. \u201cNow let\u2019s swim out a few yards, then come in parallel to the beach. We\u2019ll crawl out, exhausted.\u201d Simon panted like he\u2019d struggled ashore. \u201cGloriana, you were an actress once. Can you do this realistically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I lived it, remember?\u201d I shivered as the wind gusted. Honestly, Simon\u2019s Ray looked right, but he had the acting skills of a jack-o\u2019-lantern.</p><p>\u201cWestwood will be waiting for us onshore with the crossbow. But we won\u2019t worry about that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm this for real, Simon. I\u2019m not jumping in that water twice.\u201d I saw that Rafe was standing next to a glowering Westwood and had taken charge of the crossbow. Good.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m not crazy about swimming in that lake either. Kaplan, are you ready?\u201d Simon looked around, and Greg as Valdez trotted out and jumped in when we did.</p><p>The cold water was a shock, and it was rough enough to be tough going. I hated the creepy, crawly things that brushed my bare feet and legs as I swam the yards I needed before we started back. I remembered then that Ray had held me because I\u2019m such a poor swimmer, but I didn\u2019t mention it. No way was I letting Simon touch me. I managed to keep from drowning long enough to get to where my feet touched bottom again. I wasn\u2019t acting as I staggered and fell to my knees, crawling out to the strip of rocky shore.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Simon shouted as we stood next to each other out of the water. At least he had liked the \u201cno audio\u201d idea, so we were saved from having to learn lines. A subdued Westwood approached us carrying his crossbow. Now Rafe had the arrow.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell is this going to work? The shifter won\u2019t give me back my arrow,\u201d Westwood whined.</p><p>\u201cThe camera is far enough away that it won\u2019t matter.\u201d Simon was losing patience. \u201cJust stand there and pretend to yell at Gloriana like I\u2019m sure you did that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump over to you, grab the crossbow and aim it at your heart.\u201d I leaped until I was in front of Westwood.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Simon nodded to the cameraman. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop shooting, Valdez can hand you the arrow, and you\u2019ll fall down with it stuck between your body and your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work. Vampires aren\u2019t real in this film, remember?\u201d Greg pressed against my leg, and I had a feeling he was trying to see up my skirt. I kicked him away. \u201cOuch. Anyway, you\u2019ll have to run up like a mortal girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m going to come across like I\u2019m an ass, bested by a woman.\u201d Westwood threw down his crossbow. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to fool anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarth to Westwood. You are an ass.\u201d Rafe strolled up, kicked the crossbow out of reach and handed him the arrow. \u201cNow fall down and show us death throes. We\u2019re all anxious to see you dead.\u201d Every vampire there smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of this. Where\u2019s the respect? I could buy and sell the lot of you.\u201d Westwood cut his eyes toward Simon, who was conferring with the cameraman. \u201cExcept for Simon of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Rafe smiled. \u201cWe have no respect for you, Westwood. You killed friends. Terrorized innocent people. You\u2019re surrounded by people who want you dead. Feel lucky you haven\u2019t had your head handed to you on a plate yet.\u201d</p><p>I admired the way Rafe intimidated the billionaire who\u2019d backed up a few steps.</p><p>\u201cAnd the way Rafe looks in those jeans? He deserves a reward, don\u2019t ya think? No way are you breaking up with him yet. The hell-raiser deserves a little more hell fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, but I\u2019m sick of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, Glory. That wind\u2019s damn cold.\u201d Greg stood too close again. \u201cSimon, can\u2019t we finish this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ve figured this out.\u201d Simon, still looking like Ray, strode to my side again. \u201cPlaces, everyone. We\u2019ll use a wide angle to get the group of us here on the beach and Westwood. Then follow Glory as she attacks. Valdez, move and take that arrow with you.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe snatched the arrow and got behind the cameraman.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, shout at Westwood, I don\u2019t care what. Without audio we\u2019ll just be seeing that you\u2019re steamed and reaming him out. Then charge and snatch the crossbow. We won\u2019t show his face until after the arrow\u2019s in, then zoom in for the kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only.\u201d I waited until the cameraman gave me the go ahead. \u201cYou murdering slimeball! I hate you. You killed Jerry\u2019s best friend, and he never did a damned thing to you. I\u2019m going to tear out your throat.\u201d I ran up to him in what felt like slow motion but was probably normal human speed and ripped the crossbow out of his hands. My own hands shook as I aimed it at his heart.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Simon clapped his hands. \u201cPerfect. Real emotion. You\u2019re a fine actress, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was acting?\u201d I jabbed Westwood with the crossbow until he doubled over. \u201cI hate this son of a bitch. Give me the arrow, and I\u2019ll finish him for real this time.\u201d I heard Alesa cheering and saying something about murder being terrific foreplay.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Simon stalked over to Rafe and took the arrow. \u201cMan up, Westwood, and take this.\u201d Westwood had been swearing and threatening to get even with me. \u201cNow fall on the ground and play dead. We\u2019ll edit the film to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will work. Load the crossbow and let\u2019s start over.\u201d Westwood had a gleam in his eyes and forgot to block his thoughts. He wanted to kill me. Now that he was vampire, he thought he could do it right this time.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d Rafe was right there, standing between Westwood and the crossbow, the arrow in his hand. There was a crack and the arrow broke into two pieces.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. That was my last arrow. I had those custom made, you know.\u201d Westwood stomped his foot.</p><p>\u201cSave your tantrum. We\u2019re not impressed.\u201d Simon nodded at Rafe. \u201cGood idea. Use the feathered end. Gloriana, pick up the crossbow and stand over him. Here\u2019s your motivation. You probably felt glad Westwood was dead but horrified too. Because you\u2019re not usually a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, I was there, remember? And this is a home movie, not in the running for an Oscar.\u201d But I did think about that night and how I\u2019d felt. Sick, relieved to have rid the world of a sadistic vampire hunter but in shock too.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make a shoddy product, Gloriana. Work with me here.\u201d Simon stood stiffly beside the cameraman.</p><p>\u201cFine. I didn\u2019t laugh and dance on his body, but I wasn\u2019t sorry either.\u201d I picked up the weapon. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this so I can go home. Dawn is too damned close, and I\u2019m feeling it.\u201d I was also coming way down from whatever high I\u2019d enjoyed from all those margaritas. I was wet and cold and sick of everyone around me except for Rafe, who looked ready to body-slam anyone who touched me. I smiled at him gratefully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all feeling the dawn, but we have more than an hour left, plenty of time to get this right.\u201d Simon shouted out directions and everyone stepped out of the scene except for Westwood and me. \u201cAction!\u201d</p><p>I held the crossbow against Westwood\u2019s body and looked him in the eye. \u201cI hate you. That fang necklace you wore taunted every vampire who saw it. I hope you die at the hands of a hunter someday and that the last face you see is someone who treats you like an animal instead of a human. Now die, you son of a bitch!\u201d I shoved the crossbow into his stomach.</p><p>He overacted, of course, falling back with the piece of arrow clutched to his chest and making squawking sounds. I smiled and looked down at his twitching body, kicked him for good measure, then tossed the crossbow at his head. I turned and walked away, not sparing him another glance.</p><p>The other vampires in the crew clapped. Greg, who\u2019d gone back to human form and was wrapped in a towel, even whistled.</p><p>Rafe tried to pull me into his arms, but I was too fired up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. We\u2019re done, right?\u201d I saw Westwood stand and brush off his clothes, the piece of arrow in his hand.</p> <p>\u201cWith your part of the filming? Yes. Take off. You did well. I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d Simon looked at me with the promise that Westwood would pay for everything he\u2019d done as soon as his money was safely in EV hands.</p><p>\u201cRed convertible. Add turbocharged to my list of options.\u201d I smiled and headed for the tent. I\u2019d had enough. Whatever Westwood did with his stupid video, I wanted no part of it. Just my reward. I wasn\u2019t being greedy.</p><p>Alesa called me stupid and started listing all the things I should have asked for. I let her yammer on. At least she wasn\u2019t tap dancing on my brain for a change. Noise, I could tune out.</p><p>Rafe was quiet as we walked to his car. I knew some kind of showdown was coming. My stomach lurched as I climbed into his SUV. For once I wished the dawn would come quickly. If I fell into my death sleep, Rafe couldn\u2019t expect me to talk about what he was waiting to get into. I\u2019d changed back into clothes that reeked of Ray. Oh, man.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Rafe pulled into a deserted scenic overlook and parked. He turned off the engine, then looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou have something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what makes you think that?\u201d We were in the middle of nowhere. Well, not exactly. From this hilltop, I could see the lights of downtown Austin in the distance. Things got dicey, I could shift out of here and fly home.</p><p>\u201cWuss. Things get dicey, you get naked and show the man what you\u2019ve got. He\u2019ll forget his mad, and we\u2019ll have some fun.\u201d Sex. Alesa\u2019s solution for everything.</p><p>Rafe opened his car door and got out. He strode over to stare at the city. Keys in the ignition. I was so tempted to just hop into the driver\u2019s seat and put the pedal to the metal. Nope, I owed him this. I resigned myself to a confrontation and followed him.</p><p>\u201cYou stink of Israel Caine. You going to deny being with him tonight?\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t look at me, just stayed focused on the incredible view. A romantic setting. What a waste.</p><p>\u201cI gave him a ride from the party. He was checking out the place for his record label. They\u2019re having a thing out there.\u201d I put my hand on Rafe\u2019s back. \u201cHe was drunk on high-octane blood. It stirs you up, so he made a move. I just happened to be handy. Any woman would have gotten the same treatment. I said no.\u201d</p><p>Rafe finally turned to study me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t the right man.\u201d Honesty. I couldn\u2019t fake a smile because I knew what came next was bound to hurt him. God, I hated that.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s mouth firmed. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t have to ask who you think is right. You\u2019ve been uncomfortable around me ever since our last time together.\u201d He picked up a rock and threw it into the darkness below, then turned to give me a crooked smile. \u201cGuess I wasn\u2019t convincing enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe. You know me better than I know myself sometimes.\u201d I sat on a large boulder a few feet away from the edge of the cliff. I didn\u2019t want to be the next thing he threw. \u201cYou were great. Wonderful. Most of this is my problem. But you\u2019ve changed since we became lovers.\u201d I sighed. \u201cReally since you dropped the guard-dog act. You never call me Blondie. Never tease me like you used to.\u201d I saw his fists clench. Obviously I was hitting one of his hot buttons. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Rafe? I hardly know you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss your guard dog? Shit, Glory. You never did know the real me.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cYeah, I called you Blondie and used a voice I heard in a movie once. It was a persona I put on with the dog body.\u201d</p><p>I stood and reached out to take his hand. \u201cDamn it, Rafe. You know I never looked down on you. Certainly never treated you like a dog. We were best friends. I was comfortable with you. Always.\u201d</p><p>Rafe sat on the boulder and pulled me down beside him. \u201cNo, you treated me with respect. One of the many reasons I fell for you, I guess. You have any idea how much I hated staying a freakin\u2019 dog around you? You did it for five minutes. Try five years. The wisecracks helped keep me sane.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIf I am, after all that time with four legs and fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you sign up for the gig if you hated it so much?\u201d I leaned against him, comfortable again. This Rafe I knew.</p><p>\u201cBlade. We had a contract. It\u2019s a deal he made with my grandfather, and it became a matter of honor. I couldn\u2019t let the old man down by breaking it.\u201d Rafe shook his head. \u201cNo way was Blade giving me a break and letting me out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a businessman. A contract is a contract to him.\u201d What else could I say? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe. But you\u2019re off the hook now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Blade claims I still owe him. Like there\u2019s a loophole I didn\u2019t jump through. Back to the honor thing. I don\u2019t want Blade complaining to Gramps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family means a lot to you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cA shifter\u2019s family is a lot like a Highlander\u2019s clan. We\u2019re tight, loyal.\u201d Rafe hit our clasped hands on his hard thigh. \u201cI served my time, Blondie, but your sire made it clear in L.A. that we weren\u2019t done. Seems he didn\u2019t like the way I helped you keep secrets from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were being loyal to me!\u201d I bumped against him. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him, Rafe. This isn\u2019t fair.\u201d Easy to promise, but could I deliver? Especially when he found out . . .</p><p>\u201cSave your breath. At least he paid me. When Blade calls in his next favor, I\u2019ll handle it and we\u2019ll be even.\u201d Rafe pulled my hand to his lips. \u201cWhen\u2019s he coming back?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThursday, for your opening.\u201d My insides quaked. \u201cGod, Rafe, what\u2019s he going to do when he finds out we were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t own you. But you mean a hell of a lot to him. Let him know that if he kills me, you\u2019ll never forgive him. Am I right, Blondie?\u201d Rafe grinned, showing those dimples I loved, and ran his tongue across my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, you\u2019re right. But I wonder if he\u2019d care what I thought after such a wound to his pride.\u201d I put my free hand on Rafe\u2019s chest. \u201cMaybe it would be safer if we took a break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSafer for who? I\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d Rafe\u2019s eyes narrowed, and his grip tightened. \u201cHe\u2019s never hurt you, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But I won\u2019t be responsible for anything happening to you, Rafe. Look at this great opportunity you\u2019ve got with the club. A new life.\u201d I ignored Alesa stabbing me in the forehead. This was the right and kind thing to do.</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Stab. Stab.</p><p>\u201cThis is it? You\u2019re done with me?\u201d Rafe jumped to his feet, dragging me with him. \u201cWhy am I surprised? Friends. Comfortable friends. Shit.\u201d He stared down at me. \u201cAnd the hot sex? Was that just friends with benefits?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled my eyes. \u201cRafe, I love you, you know that. But I think we do make better friends than lovers.\u201d I felt a tear slide down my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think I can go back to just sitting at your feet, Glory. I love you too. But it\u2019s way more than as a pal.\u201d He looked away for a moment, his chest heaving as he took a breath. When he looked back, his eyes were glowing red. \u201cDamn it, it\u2019s always been him. Your Mr. Right. I know where this is going. You\u2019re going back to Blade, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s eyes threw off a heat that made me back up a step. He spun, and a bush across the clearing burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cRafe!\u201d I jumped toward the car. Before I\u2019d gone two feet, he was beside me, holding me, the bush just a charred, smoking stump and pile of cinders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. Say you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d His eyes were back to brown. \u201cThe Scot doesn\u2019t deserve you. And what we have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tears spilled down my cheeks. I hated to hurt him. \u201cWe, uh, had a fling. You\u2019re a wonderful lover. But Jerry ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget Jerry. He\u2019s a bad habit. Give me more time to show you that what we have together can be so much better. You love me, Glory, and not just as a friend. Friends don\u2019t scorch the sheets like we did.\u201d Rafe jerked me closer.</p><p>\u201cThat was just sex, Rafe. I don\u2019t deny you lived up to your reputation. Like Nadia said, you\u2019re talented. But you know how I feel about Jerry. Listened to me whine about it often enough.\u201d I touched where his dimples would show when he smiled. Please, please, smile again. Not happening. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay friends with you if we can. I miss laughing together, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can laugh again.\u201d He turned his head and captured my thumb with his lips, gently sucking it into his mouth.</p><p>Yeah, I let him do it too. What was the matter with me?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting with the program. Remember how this guy was in the sack, kiddo.\u201d Alesa sighed. That was enough to get me to jerk my hand away from Rafe\u2019s incredibly sexy mouth.</p><p>\u201cStop this. You\u2019re only going to get hurt, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. Don\u2019t you see? What we have now is so much better than before. We can be friends and lovers. I love you, Glory.\u201d He tried to kiss me, but I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI know that, Rafe, and it means the world to me. But this won\u2019t work. And what was with the red eye?\u201d I pushed him back with my hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou scared me just now. You burned a freakin\u2019 bush to the ground. What happens if you get mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt you. Surely you know that.\u201d Rafe slid his hands around me. \u201cYou can trust me, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always have. But then I didn\u2019t know you had demonic powers.\u201d I shivered. \u201cI know pure hellfire when I see it. I feel heat myself when Alesa wants to jerk my chain.\u201d I ripped off my jacket and tossed it to the ground when Alesa blasted me to prove the point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. I won\u2019t do that again. I\u2019m usually more in control than that, but you blindsided me.\u201d Rafe looked around. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m surprised this whole hilltop didn\u2019t go up in flames. The thought of you with Blade again ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not happen. I\u2019m going to have to tell him about us. His pride may not allow him to take me back after that.\u201d I could see that thought cheered up Rafe. Me? I felt my heart tear and my gut twist. Not Alesa\u2019s doing either. She could care less about Jerry. But then she didn\u2019t know him. Didn\u2019t have a clue about love and our history. Jerry had said he didn\u2019t want to live forever in a world without me. How much worse would it be to live in a world with him in it but know he wanted nothing to do with me? I shuddered and realized Rafe had read my thoughts. He slid his arm around me and gave me a hug I needed badly. Still my friend. Impossible.</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it, but from where I sat for five years, seemed to me you could usually bring Blade around.\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t smile, but he wasn\u2019t giving off hell heat now either.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d I dredged up a smile. \u201cThanks, Rafe. Is it any wonder I love you?\u201d I made myself put some space between us. \u201cCan I do what you just did? Flame something?\u201d Might come in handy. As long as I was stuck with Alesa, I should get something out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou could. And turn people into crispy critters too.\u201d Rafe clearly struggled to stay in friend mode.</p><p>\u201cCool. Wish I\u2019d known that. I\u2019d have loved to set Westwood\u2019s hair on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, promise me you won\u2019t ever do anything like that.\u201d Rafe grabbed me, his hands biting into my arms. \u201cEvery time you use one of your powers, you remind Lucifer you\u2019re up here. Hate to think he\u2019d send a minion to see what\u2019s up.\u201d He let me go and looked around, doing a three-sixty of the view. \u201cDamned dumb of me to remind him I\u2019m around. I\u2019ve had to do a couple of jobs for him. They\u2019re a bitch.\u201d He shook his head and turned back to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe.\u201d Now I was really freaked out.</p><p>\u201cAw, Glory, this just makes him more interesting. Don\u2019t dump the guy. Kiss and make up.\u201d Alesa poked me in a few places to make her point.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll never try to flame anyone or anything. You hear me?\u201d Rafe pulled me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear. I\u2019ve got enough problems with Hell Girl here. I sure don\u2019t need a visit from her buddies down below.\u201d I leaned against him. My legs felt heavy, and the sky seemed to be lighter in the east.</p><p>Rafe noticed. \u201cI\u2019d better get you home. Ray didn\u2019t score any points with you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. The pass was more of a kneejerk reaction than a serious effort. Anyway, drunk or sober, he\u2019s done.\u201d I sighed and slipped away toward the car.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fool, then. Because I\u2019m not.\u201d Rafe beat me to the SUV and opened the passenger door. He pressed me against the steel frame, his arms blocking me in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots going for us, Glory. When Blade finds out about us, you\u2019ll need a friend. That\u2019s me. Here for you, always.\u201d</p><p>His hard body felt good against me, and I tried not to react to it. Too bad I remembered how we\u2019d been together.</p><p>\u201cThis guy is a keeper. Don\u2019t be stupid, Glory.\u201d Alesa pushed me closer, but I wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell Jerry about us, will you?\u201d My heart dropped to my toes, then bounced around my body a few times before landing in my throat, a bowling ball in a pin-ball machine.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s on you. But too many people have seen us together. If you don\u2019t want him to find out the hard way, you\u2019d better get to him quick.\u201d Rafe slid his hand down my arm, reminding me that we did have chemistry. My demon girl shouted a \u201cHell, yes!\u201d</p><p>I slid into the seat, feeling that tinge of morning in the air weighing me down and dread smothering me. Rafe slammed my door, then got into the driver\u2019s seat and started the engine.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all going to come out. Nice of you to stand by ready to play catch when Jerry kicks me to the curb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m your man, Blondie, and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Westwood\u2019s ranch and arrange for the children to meet at your shop tonight at midnight.\u201d Simon wasn\u2019t asking, as usual.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I glanced at Flo and CiCi, who\u2019d just arrived at my apartment. They were here for moral support and good gossip. I\u2019d just handed out some Blud-Lite and wasn\u2019t in the mood for Simon the dictator.</p><p>\u201cThe video\u2019s ready. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to get this done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll make the call. Hope they can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them you have positive proof that\u2019ll help them get their father\u2019s estate settled by end of business tomorrow. That should light a fire under them.\u201d Simon laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in your back room at half past eleven to fill you in on the story we\u2019re using. I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. Everything to do with this has been a laugh riot. If they can\u2019t make it, how do I\u2014\u201d I was talking to dead air. Okay, I guess Simon was counting on them to jump on this and counting on me to do his bidding.</p><p>\u201cSorry, ladies, I\u2019ve got to make this call.\u201d I\u2019d programmed in David Westwood\u2019s number and hit speed dial.</p><p>\u201cWestwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, this is Gloriana St. Clair. You asked me to call if I had proof your father is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Are you telling me you found something?\u201d David sounded excited, not grief stricken. He obviously realized it. \u201cI mean, of course we hoped the old man would be found okay, but either way, we need to know what happened, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI get it, David. Can you meet me at my shop tonight at midnight? I have commitments before then.\u201d If I\u2019d had a father like Brent Westwood, I\u2019d be shooting off fireworks at his funeral.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll bring my sister with me.\u201d David cleared his throat. \u201cYou really have something? The lawyers keep putting us off, and we\u2019re stuck here on the ranch with this ridiculously inadequate allowance. You wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bring that reward you mentioned because I\u2019m going to have proof that will help you settle the estate by tomorrow.\u201d I ignored the questioning looks I was getting from CiCi and Flo.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! Finally!\u201d David couldn\u2019t hide his relief. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there. Midnight.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call, then turned to face the music.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about, Glory?\u201d CiCi put her glass on the coffee table. \u201cWestwood? And I heard Simon Destiny\u2019s voice on that first call. What are you doing consorting with that creep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems Brent Westwood\u2019s now a vampire. I didn\u2019t kill him after all. Simon\u2019s got him out at the EV camp. He wants Brent\u2019s money. We made a video so it looks like Brent\u2019s whole vamp-hunting Web site thing was bogus. He\u2019ll reveal himself to his kids tonight so he can gain access to his money. Simon will get it, then Brent is going to pay in more ways than one.\u201d Whew. How was that in a nutshell? I collapsed on the couch.</p><p>Flo sat next to me and hugged me. \u201cSo stressful. How did this video go? Was Rafael with you every minute?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d Tears. Of course he had been. Like he always was. Why was I dumping him? Oh, yeah, in a desperate effort to keep Jerry, the love of my life. As if a prideful Scot would want me once he found out I\u2019d cheated.</p><p>If only we could have a sizzling reunion first. A night that would convince him Glory was still his girl no matter who else she . . . Oh, hell. I knew better. Jerry would have his broadsword out and up Rafe\u2019s butt before I could stop him. Then he\u2019d drop me like a hot rock. My friends were staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a video. What\u2019s in it?\u201d CiCi sat on my other side. Her presence was a great comfort. I wanted to bawl.</p><p>\u201cI pretend to kill Westwood again, but he jumps up afterward.\u201d I sighed. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll show the kids the video. Westwood will appear and confess to being a lying loser and a nutjob. Not sure how Simon is setting up this scenario.\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cSimon\u2019s rewarding me, so it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to do this. Why\u2019d you go through with it?\u201d Flo frowned. \u201cNo reward is worth it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlackmail. Simon hid a video camera in the back room. He has tape of me confessing my fling with Rafe. Then another of Rafe and me kissing, making it obvious we were lovers. He threatened to send it to Jerry while he was in Florida. I couldn\u2019t hurt Jerry that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard!\u201d CiCi hugged me. \u201cNo wonder you were drinking so heavily at the shower. Drowning your sorrows. Did you have to work on that video last night too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! And that\u2019s not all.\u201d I let some tears fall. \u201cI\u2019m possessed! Richard tried to kill a demon in my shop, but he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s inside me. It talks to me, urges me to do bad things. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why I slept with Rafe in the first place.\u201d I knew as soon as I said it that I was lying. At least about Rafe. I\u2019d had fantasies about him way before Alesa had moved in.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You wanted that hottie first. But giving him up was stupid. No demon would ever do that. You\u2019ve been one tough nut to crack.\u201d</p><p>Exhausted by Alesa\u2019s nonstop harping on the subject, not to mention my own agonizing over the hurt I\u2019d caused Rafe, I sobbed and fell against CiCi\u2019s shoulder. Oh, probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. She had on a nice cream Chanel jacket that my mascara was ruining. But when I tried to pull back, she held me firmly against her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hysterical, Gloriana. Calm down. That\u2019s probably just your conscience talking to you. Cheating on Jeremiah with a shifter. That\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiCi, I think she\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d Flo patted my shoulder. \u201cRicardo chased a demon in her shop. He said prayers, threw the holy water on it. But I guess it\u2019s possible it climbed into our Glory\u2019s body. Aye, Dio!\u201d Flo crossed herself. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Richard.\u201d CiCi said firmly. \u201cObviously we need an exorcism or something.\u201d She crossed herself too and pushed me back to study me. \u201cStill, we can\u2019t rule out guilt. What were you thinking, Gloriana? You had Jeremiah, such a fine man, wrapped around your little finger when I left here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHah! That man can\u2019t be wrapped.\u201d I sighed. \u201cWhat I mean is, I love him, but Rafe, well, we got really close. And he\u2019s a fine man too.\u201d I looked to Flo for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cHe is. He saved our lives, CiCi. And he\u2019s handsome.\u201d Flo kissed her fingertips in a classic Italian gesture. \u201cGlory wanted a little something extra. Who can blame her? He lives in this very apartment in my old bedroom. Temptation, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA recipe for disaster.\u201d CiCi disapproved.</p><p>\u201cOr for amore, right, Glory?\u201d Flo winked.</p><p>I sat up, wiped my eyes and decided to come clean with them and myself. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning toward disaster. I can\u2019t blame the demon for this. Rafe is sexy, made moves, and I let it happen. But now I\u2019ve decided Jerry\u2019s my guy, and I want to be with him. If he\u2019ll still have me. As for the demon, I\u2019m dealing with her. She hurts me sometimes, but I\u2019ve got her under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl? As if, bitch. Someday I\u2019ll show you what I can really do.\u201d A megahot flash had me bolting for the kitchen. I opened both refrigerator doors and stuck my head in the freezer until a blast of cold air hit my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d CiCi and Flo had run after me.</p><p>\u201cThe demon\u2014Alesa is her name\u2014punishes me by giving me these heat waves.\u201d I grabbed a handful of ice from the icemaker and shoved it down my bra. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right in a minute. Sit. Finish your drinks. I\u2019ve got to go down to the shop in a little while, and we haven\u2019t figured a way out of my man trouble yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when is Jeremiah coming back?\u201d Trust CiCi to get back to the issue at hand.</p><p>\u201cLate tomorrow night, but I won\u2019t see him until Thursday. We\u2019ll all be at the opening of Rafe\u2019s club. Rafe and Nadia have arranged a special table for us on one of their balconies.\u201d I sighed, hoping that part of the evening went smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI saw the ad in the newspaper. Israel Caine is performing.\u201d CiCi raised an eyebrow. \u201cThe tabloids had you engaged to him. Interesting story there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as interesting as it should have been.\u201d I polished off my bottle of Blud-Lite, a tingling awareness reminding me of its side effect that would torture me for the rest of the evening. \u201cIf Jerry\u2019s it for me, I can\u2019t go messing around with every guy who makes a pass, now can I?\u201d I turned to Flo. \u201cFlo, you can understand. It\u2019s like you are with Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonogamy. Yes. I admit I\u2019m surprised I am in it. But a man like Ricardo? He\u2019s enough for me.\u201d Flo waved her hand with the diamond ring on it. \u201cSo arrivederci, Israel. What about Rafael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him we\u2019re done too. He\u2019s not happy, but he\u2019s accepted that we can only be friends again.\u201d I said it but wasn\u2019t sure I believed it. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just going along so he can pick up my pieces when Jerry explodes and dumps me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think when Jeremiah finds out that you and Rafael . . .\u201d Flo stared down at her hands.</p><p>I grabbed one of them. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make Richard keep his mouth shut, Flo! At least until I can tell Jerry myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to stall him, but, Glory, Ricardo is determined to tell Jeremiah as soon as he sees him. His conscience is bothering him.\u201d Flo looked up, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, mia amica, but you\u2019d better hurry up and spill the garbanzos. The merda is about to hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestwood\u2019s staying in the back room, and we\u2019ll bring his children here for the reunion.\u201d Simon rubbed his hands together, clearly in high spirits. \u201cYou\u2019ll love the story we\u2019ve cooked up for the time their father\u2019s been missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love any part of this.\u201d I opened the door and glanced into the shop. I did have a business to run and should get out there and help Erin deal with customers.</p><p>Greg grinned. \u201cBrent\u2019s been in rehab.\u201d He slapped Westwood on the back.</p><p>That got my attention. The former hunter had been silent since they\u2019d arrived at my back door promptly at eleven thirty. Guess he was nervous about seeing his kids after months of making them think he was dead. Serve him right if Viv brought her crossbow and plugged him herself for the deception.</p><p>\u201cRehab? Drugs? Alcohol? Oh, wait, sex addiction. That\u2019s a trendy one.\u201d I looked him up and down. \u201cBut a tough sell.\u201d</p><p>That earned me the first spark of life from old Brent.</p><p>\u201cBitch. I\u2019ve had many beautiful women. I wouldn\u2019t waste my time on a fat ass\u2014\u201d Brent shut up because he had Greg\u2019s fist in his mouth. Wow, who knew?</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThanks, Gregory. What brought that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you and I hooked up. The man insulted my taste in women. Can\u2019t have that.\u201d Greg shoved Westwood toward the bathroom. \u201cStay inside until Simon calls you out. Shut the hell up until you\u2019re told to speak. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother hot guy you did? Wow, Glory. Let\u2019s do him again.\u201d</p><p>I ignored my horny demon and Brent\u2019s glare when he wiped his bleeding mouth with his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cGee, Brent, look. You\u2019re bleeding, and my fangs can\u2019t even work up interest. Bet you had to pay top dollar for those beautiful women.\u201d I grinned when he growled but just stomped into the bathroom without another word. \u201cWhat have you done to him, Simon? Shown him the energy vacuum pump?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAmong other things. He has to realize he\u2019s a fledgling in our world.\u201d Simon smiled. \u201cI\u2019m keeping my offer open, Gloriana. Female Energy Vampires are unheard of, but I may make an exception in your case.\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder. I blamed my demon for letting it stay there. \u201cI sense an interesting new element in you.\u201d</p><p>I stared into his eyes and let the red show. How I could do it on demand I didn\u2019t know, but the heat shooting up into my eyeballs told me it worked. Simon\u2019s hand slid off. Oh, he tried to hide the freak-out, but I wanted to high-five myself for giving him a scare.</p><p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s a snowstorm in Hades, I\u2019ll be in touch. For now, you know where to shove that offer.\u201d I strolled over to the door and opened it. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the shop and let you know when the Westwoods get here.\u201d I strutted out of the room, shutting the door with an emphatic click.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s showing him, girlfriend. You join any club, it\u2019ll be the one downstairs with my boss.\u201d</p><p>Oh, swell. Now I had Alesa\u2019s approval. Which convinced me telling Simon off wasn\u2019t my smartest move, since I still wanted that car. But it had been so worth it for the look on his loathsome face. Bet he couldn\u2019t read my mind now either. Hah.</p><p>I\u2019d love a chance to go mano a mano with the EV leader now. Even if I had to try on my new demonic powers, it would be great to grind that SOB into dust, flame him into ashes or\u2014</p><p>Oops. The Westwoods were here. Vivien wore a turquoise print wrap dress and heels straight from Paris. Her purse cost more than my entire shop inventory. Guess she\u2019d bought it before the pitiful allowance edict. David didn\u2019t hurt my eyes either, getting most of his looks from his mother\u2019s side. He wore snug hand-distressed jeans and a vintage T-shirt, obviously not seeing this as the formal occasion Viv did. Or maybe Sis was just desperate for a place to show off and figured a vintage-clothing dealer would give her duds the respect they deserved. I did a quick mind scan. Yep, got it.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, you two. Glad to see you\u2019re not swathed in depressing black.\u201d I smiled. David\u2019s shirt was a faded red.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? It won\u2019t bring Dad back.\u201d Viv brought a lace hanky to her eyes. Oh, how fake was that? \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got, Ms. St. Clair? It\u2019s late. This better not be a lame attempt to shake us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViv, ease up. Glory . . . if I may call you that.\u201d David smiled at me when I nodded. \u201cGlory is helping us. I told you she thinks this will get things settled quickly.\u201d David looked around. There were two customers browsing the dress rack, and Erin, of course, obviously interested in our conversation. \u201cIs there somewhere we can speak privately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back room. Follow me. I have something to show you there anyway.\u201d I led the way. How easy was this? Of course both of them balked when they saw Simon and Greg waiting.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d David put his hand protectively on his sister\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Simon, and this is my associate, Mr. Kaplan. We\u2019re sorry you\u2019ve been going through this trying time.\u201d Simon was all concern and sympathy. It worked with the kindly face he\u2019d put on. He looked middle-aged and had silver hair. He\u2019d even slipped on a white doctor\u2019s coat while I\u2019d been in the shop.</p><p>\u201cA doctor? What does this have to do with Dad\u2019s disappearance?\u201d Vivien looked at me. \u201cWas Daddy sick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Simon nodded to me. \u201cGloriana, why don\u2019t you show the children the video their father made right before he \u2018died.\u2019\u201d He gestured toward my laptop set up on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw a crazy video one of his bodyguards took with Dad being shot by one of those so-called vampires. One that looked a lot like Glory here.\u201d David smiled at me. \u201cNonsense of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit now it was me. He asked me to play vampire that night to his hunter. I tell you it was just the last straw. Watch this, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d I walked over and pushed the button to play the DVD. We all gathered around. I had to admit this was a five-star production. All that was missing was the swelling music and credits. Instead we got a scan of the lake as swimmers came into view.</p><p>There we were\u2014me, the Ray look-alike and Valdez the dog. We crawled out onto the beach, and Brittany came into the picture. Westwood stalked up, ranting about something. He was clearly agitated and totally overacting before he aimed that crossbow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dad!\u201d Vivien leaned closer. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to shoot you, Glory. That\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. And the lake was freezing. I was shivering.\u201d</p><p>David leaned in. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you were cold.\u201d He was trying to hide a grin, and I wanted to smack him. This from a grieving son? Of course I knew how to rock a wet T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cJust keep watching your father.\u201d I moved back so David could get a closer look when I ran up to confront Westwood. The camera came in for a tight shot of my face and those boobs. I jammed the crossbow into Brent\u2019s stomach. Then he was down, rolling around with the arrow until he gasped and \u201cdied.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d David paled. \u201cThat\u2019s the proof we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Davy. That\u2019s Daddy lying there.\u201d Vivien was crying for real now, mopping at her tears with that piece of lace. I grabbed a paper towel and handed it to her. Who knew she had a heart under that sophisticated veneer?</p><p>\u201cKeep watching, you two.\u201d Simon kept a sympathetic face, but he practically quivered with excitement.</p><p>David and Viv leaned closer. We all saw me throw down the crossbow, kick Westwood, then strut away, Valdez and Ray already out of the shot. The camera stayed on Westwood\u2019s body. Suddenly Brent sat up, tossed away the arrow and brushed off the dirt and leaves. He looked directly into the camera, gave it a thumb\u2019s up and made a cut motion with his hand across his throat. The screen went black.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d David looked at Vivien, then at me. \u201cGlory? Did you or did you not kill my father?\u201d</p><p>Greg opened the bathroom door, and Westwood stumbled out.</p><p>\u201cShe did not.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Vivien rushed into his arms, sobbing. He hugged her, his own face wet.</p><p>David didn\u2019t join in the family reunion, clearly unsure what he was feeling. I put my hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt was a setup, David. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you sooner, but I was sworn to secrecy. Insane, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s this all about?\u201d Vivien was drying up fast and pushed back, remembering she\u2019d been jerked around by this act.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been, Dad?\u201d David stared at his father, still not making a move to get closer.</p><p>\u201cUh, rehab.\u201d He looked at Simon. \u201cThe doctor here has been helping me figure out some things. I\u2019m sorry you were worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried? We thought you were dead!\u201d David looked ready to smash my laptop. I grabbed him before he could start.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. Hit him, hit your dad, but not my hardware.\u201d I aimed him at Westwood. \u201cThis is his fault. He wouldn\u2019t let his own children know he was alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? And what\u2019s the rehab for? Drugs? Alcohol?\u201d Viv put a good distance between her and her father, clutching David\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSexual dysfunction.\u201d I saw Westwood jerk like he\u2019d taken a hit from Simon\u2019s Taser. \u201cAfter Brent made his billions and sold the company, his problem got worse. So he set himself up as a great hunter to feel powerful. Overcompensating, the doctor said.\u201d I strolled over to slide a fingernail along Brent\u2019s collar. I felt hatred coming off him in waves, but he was struck dumb, courtesy of Simon. I loved it. \u201cThe vampire thing? Well, you know what they say about the fine line between genius and insanity.\u201d Uh-oh. Brent was close to stroking out.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d the doctor tell you this?\u201d David looked from me to Simon.</p><p>\u201cGloriana was trying to help your father. They were in a relationship that clearly wasn\u2019t working. She\u2019s the one who got him to seek help after the night of the video.\u201d Simon was nothing if not quick. \u201cYour father agreed but hoped for a magic pill.\u201d Simon shook his head. \u201cNot everything can be fixed with medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy vampires? That\u2019s so weird.\u201d Viv obviously couldn\u2019t wrap her head around this. \u201cReally, Daddy, what were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Simon steepled his fingers. \u201cVampires are a classic phallic symbol. Powerful, eternal. By pretending to kill them, your father acted out a sexual fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Greg nodded, happy to get in on this. \u201cEven using the crossbow is significant, isn\u2019t it, Dr. Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Simon was clearly on a roll. \u201cThe penetration\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d David flushed and looked everywhere but at his father. \u201cI wish you\u2019d come to one of us, Dad.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cGlory, I guess we should thank you for sticking with him.\u201d</p><p>Viv scanned me from head to toe. I had on my usual uniform of slimming black pants and a colorful top, this one purple with a deep V-neck that made the most of my assets. None of it was expensive, but I didn\u2019t look like a pauper either. Easy to read her thoughts. I may be four hundred plus, but I look early twenties. Shopkeeper looking for a sugar daddy hooks up with middle-aged billionaire?</p><p>\u201cI never took a dime from Brent, did I, baby?\u201d I dared him to disagree.</p><p>\u201cNo. Hell, no. Else why would she still be working in this dump?\u201d Brent, allowed to speak, showed some of his old spark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a dump, Brent.\u201d I turned back to Viv. \u201cSorry, but this mess has ruined our relationship. That stupid video did it for me. His plan was to kill me acting like a vampire, but I couldn\u2019t stand it. So I stuck it to him. I\u2019d had enough.\u201d I felt Brent tense, but he knew better than to argue with Simon in command.</p><p>Simon and Greg nodded solemnly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I confronted Brent later, he broke down and admitted he needed help and let me call the doctor. I\u2019m sorry, but your father decided he\u2019d rather you think him dead than acting so crazy. Especially if he never got better. Isn\u2019t that right, sugar lump?\u201d Brent nodded when I jerked his hair.</p><p>\u201cDaddy? Are you better now?\u201d Viv eased closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Totally over that vampire shit.\u201d Brent elbowed me, and I let him go. It had been gross touching him anyway.</p> <p>\u201cSee? All better.\u201d I smiled at Viv. \u201cBut he and I are history. Brent never respected my devotion to vintage and classic clothes. Love what you\u2019re wearing. Paris?\u201d</p><p>Viv\u2019s face lit up. \u201cYes! From the cutest little shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Vivien. David, did you alert the lawyers that things are going to be settled soon?\u201d Brent shot Simon an anxious look, obviously told to get down to business.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We didn\u2019t know ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, son. Glory\u2019s correct. I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. But I\u2019m ready to get my life back now.\u201d</p> <p>Westwood glanced at Simon, who gave him a nod of approval. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve made remarkable progress.\u201d Simon smiled.</p><p>Brent turned back to his children, who looked shell-shocked. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the ranch tomorrow night to meet with the lawyers. I\u2019m sorry I put you two through this. Wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Obviously.\u201d He walked over to Simon. \u201cI\u2019ll need more time in Dr. Simon\u2019s hospital. It\u2019s an excellent facility right outside of Austin, and where I\u2019ve been staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know that now, Dad.\u201d David had moved from shock to bitterness.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start over, son. I\u2019ll see that you both have a generous increase in allowance. David, you can have that yacht you wanted and, Vivi, that Swiss chalet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Daddy.\u201d Viv hugged him and kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>David held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad. Vivi and I talked about your Web site. It didn\u2019t make sense coming from the dad we knew. We should have come to you. Tried to help you ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Westwood clasped his son\u2019s hand. \u201cWell, it\u2019s over now. No more vampire talk. You two can go back to your lives, and I\u2019ll go back to the hospital till I get my head on completely straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual dysfunction?\u201d Viv glanced at me. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you really don\u2019t want to know.\u201d I smiled and opened the door into the shop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Viv looked at David. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Dad, we\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. You can\u2019t come with us now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tomorrow. Have the lawyers there. I want access to my money.\u201d Brent smiled at Simon. \u201cSo I can make a donation to the hospital. They\u2019re miracle workers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Will do.\u201d David finally hugged his father. \u201cGlad you\u2019re back, Dad.\u201d He pulled an envelope out of his pocket. \u201cSince you knew where he was all along, Glory, I don\u2019t think you should get this check.\u201d He smiled and ripped it in half.</p><p>\u201cThat was rude.\u201d I watched them hurry out of the shop. Bet they couldn\u2019t wait to discuss dear old dad and his \u201ccondition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d</p> <p>I turned and shut the door to the shop. Wouldn\u2019t want the customers to see the weirdos in the back room.</p><p>\u201cYes, Brent?\u201d I smiled. \u201cOr should I say, sugar lump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual dysfunction? Was that necessary?\u201d Brent\u2019s hands were fisted.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guess that was a low blow.\u201d I laughed when Brent lunged, but Greg caught him in a headlock. I turned my back on him. \u201cDr. Simon, I hope you\u2019re satisfied and that we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Well satisfied. Your reward will be in the alley tomorrow night. Red, you said?\u201d Simon gave me an approving look.</p><p>I grinned. \u201cTurbocharged. I\u2019d kiss you, Doctor, but I haven\u2019t had a tetanus shot. Please spare my customers and leave by the back door. Good night.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the shop, so relieved to see the last of that crew I wanted to cry. Just being in the same room with Westwood and pretending to tolerate him had taken all my acting skills. I felt drained and sank down on the stool behind the counter. Alesa whined and complained, clearly hot for Simon. No surprise there. If anyone was marked for hell, it was Simon Destiny.</p><p>Flo\u2019s bachelorette party. Favorite seductress. Too bad I\u2019d been so busy I hadn\u2019t figured out who mine was. Luckily owning a vintage-clothing store gave me a treasure trove of costumes to choose from. After taking care of all the last-minute details for the party and a trip to the alley to sigh over my beautiful new car, I threw together an outfit.</p><p>By the time I strolled into Rafe\u2019s club, I knew I looked pretty good and felt in full seductress mode. I was early so I could supervise the setup. The music was on and booming through Rafe\u2019s awesome sound system. Great choice, the kind of tune that made you want to bump and grind into a hard body. I grinned when a hunk in a loincloth, his perfect body oiled, showed up on cue with a tray of Blott-O.</p><p>\u201cNice job, Trey.\u201d I took a glass. \u201cAnd the costume is perfect. Tarzan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to get Rafe to put up a vine. Don\u2019t you think the ladies would go for a jungle yell and me swinging their drinks to them?\u201d The shifter grinned and flexed his pecs.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d have loved it. But this works. Just watch your neck.\u201d I sipped my cocktail and checked out the scene. The club looked great, the lights dim with colored spots highlighting the tables. I\u2019d arranged for centerpieces, and they\u2019d been delivered during the day. I strolled over to inspect the bouquets of Flo\u2019s favorite red roses decorated with party favors of lipsticks and nail polishes in all the colors my friend loved.</p><p>\u201cNice arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe!\u201d I turned and sighed when I saw him. No loincloth for him. He was elegant in a tux and white satin shirt. Not a button or stud held that shirt closed, exposing his very fine tanned chest down to where the shirt was tucked into slim black tux pants. Yum. I knew it was a bad idea but couldn\u2019t resist moving in to kiss his smile.</p><p>\u201cYour club looks fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He hauled me against him. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done in such a short time.\u201d He slid his hand down to cup my bottom. \u201cLike the costume. Seductress. Who are you, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman I knew during my gold rush days in California. She could have any man she wanted. Sang in the saloons and couldn\u2019t carry a tune.\u201d I smiled and ran a finger down that delicious band of bare chest. Not wise. Didn\u2019t care. I was into my seductress role, and Alesa egged me on. \u201cNo one noticed. She\u2019d flash lots of cleavage and some leg, and guys fell at her feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like someone I know.\u201d He grinned, then backed up. \u201cYou dumped me. Quit teasing.\u201d He looked me over and frowned. \u201cThat dress was any lower, you\u2019d be showing nipple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I swished my red silk skirt. \u201cHow do you like my garter?\u201d I was playing a dangerous game but couldn\u2019t seem to give a damn. Seductress. I\u2019d never been one, but a girl could dream.</p><p>\u201cHey, together we can get any man we want. Go for it, girlfriend.\u201d Alesa had a point. I\u2019d noticed she was getting more powerful and harder to resist.</p><p>I put my foot on a chair and slid my skirt up to show Rafe the red and black garter high on my thigh. I didn\u2019t need it to hold up my black fishnet panty hose. But what made him swallow was the fact that I hadn\u2019t worn panties under those hose.</p><p>Rafe had his warm hand on my leg before I could have a second thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you tonight? You said you\u2019re going back to Blade. Tomorrow night. What is this? An invitation for a farewell\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his mouth. \u201cNo. Forget it. I\u2019m obviously out of my mind. But I can\u2019t stand the idea of never being with you again either.\u201d I sighed when he moved between my legs, shielding me if one of the waiters came by. \u201cI\u2019m going crazy, Rafe. Alesa\u2019s gigging me with hard, pointy objects whenever I try to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to like her. And I wouldn\u2019t mind gigging you with something hard myself right now.\u201d Rafe bent his head to tease my lips open, barely tracing them with his tongue. His fingers were doing the same, tracking along an erotic path where the seam of those hose hugged the damp crease between my legs.</p><p>I sighed into his mouth. \u201cI . . . can\u2019t, Rafe. You know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d He pulled me toward his office, making me stumble as my leg fell off the chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few minutes, and we\u2019ve proved we can have a lot of fun in a few minutes. I\u2019ll take a farewell quickie.\u201d</p><p>I balked at the door. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew fair.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cNo, screw me instead.\u201d He coaxed me inside and shut the door. Before I could stop him, he had me against it, kissing me like there was no tomorrow. Wait. There was no tomorrow. Not for us. I shoved, and he lifted his head, giving me a look that promised endless pleasure. This whole scene was so on Alesa. I had to figure out how to get rid of her. Fast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Rafe. This is not happening. Now I\u2019ve got to go. My guests will be here soon.\u201d I jerked open the door and made my escape. I couldn\u2019t look back. Didn\u2019t want to know what he was thinking. Stupid costume. And damned stupid demon. A wave of heat hit me, and I gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s a cheap shot, Hell Girl,\u201d I muttered and headed to the bar for a glass of ice. \u201cHeat me all you want. Set my hair on fire. I don\u2019t give a damn. I\u2019m not playing with any more men. Tonight\u2019s about Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the most amazing party ever.\u201d Aggie was a Siren, of course. The ultimate seductress. She\u2019d left the fish tail at home, not good on dry land. Her tiny top was made of mother of pearl, and her blond hair flowed to her waist. Her low-riding mini was made of more mother of pearl scales. The tiny starfish nestled in her hair were actually alive. Sort of an ick, but cute too when they waved at you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour party was really the gold standard.\u201d I belted back more of the hard stuff, hoping it would lift my mood. My fake smile was wearing thin. At least everyone else seemed to be having a good time. Cleopatras, Marie Antoinettes and several Marilyn Monroes scarfed down drinks, flirted with the waiters and hit the lavish buffet. Diana was Scarlett O\u2019Hara, and CiCi had come as Catherine the Great.</p><p>\u201cI love your waiters.\u201d Flo was channeling, well, Flo. Only she\u2019d dragged out a vintage Flo. I loved her roaring-twenties flapper dress. The iridescent beads were a brilliant red and gold. She wore the dress with new high heels and had already persuaded a waiter in a tiny toga to dance with her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one. Did you see Richard\u2019s mother?\u201d I grabbed a refill from Jimmy the bartender, who kept jumping over the bar and strolling through the ladies in his Speedo and a gold medal that looked like the real deal. He and the waiters had large bills in their waistbands even though the drinks were on the house. I didn\u2019t ask how they earned their tips.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Flo laughed. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got something on her. Let Mother Mainwaring try calling me out again, I tell you. I\u2019ll threaten to tell her son how she acts around hot guys.\u201d Flo clinked glasses with me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been gone a long time. And I\u2019m sure not paying that shiftless shifter for those hours.\u201d I\u2019d noticed Mata Hari a.k.a. Sarah Mainwaring in her beaded bra and harem pants slip away to one of the balconies with a waiter in tight bike shorts over an hour ago. I actually thought she was lucky to have someone to take care of the urges this Blott-O stirred in all of us.</p><p>\u201cShould have done Rafe.\u201d Alesa sounded a little drunk and didn\u2019t bother to throw heat at me. I ignored her.</p><p>\u201cAre we playing games?\u201d Aggie was getting antsy, and I didn\u2019t blame her. Standing around drinking and listening to music wasn\u2019t cutting it. Then the lights dimmed.</p><p>\u201cLadies, gather close to the stage. The entertainment is about to begin.\u201d The male voice was achingly familiar. Was Rafe going to dance after all? Did I want him to? For this crowd?</p> <p>\u201cOf course we do. Take it off!\u201d Alesa started a chant that rattled my brain.</p><p>\u201cEntertainment?\u201d Flo grabbed my arm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see.\u201d I was caught up in the sea of women\u2014there were about fifty of us with all the out of towners\u2014and we surged toward the stage. The lights were down to pitch black when a throbbing beat started. Sex, that\u2019s what it sounded like, throbbing, pounding, skin-to-skin, hot and sweaty sex. A spotlight hit the man on center stage, and my heart stalled. He wore a black satin mask, but I knew who filled out that tux.</p><p>He moved and the women sighed. Those hips. No surprise that they handled the beat perfectly. All that blood with a kick I\u2019d gulped pooled right where I knew it would. I wanted to jump on that stage and drag him away by his dark hair. Oh, yeah.</p><p>Mine. No, he wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d rejected him. As a lover anyway. He danced close to the edge, daring us to touch him and using those hips to toy with us. When a vamp from France tried to grab him, I wanted to rip off her arm and beat her with the bloody end. Rafe just grinned and danced out of reach.</p><p>Oh, God, give me strength. The place smelled like lust, every woman there screaming for him to come and get her. My mouth was dry, my fangs down while I gripped the rim of the stage, flanked by Flo and CiCi. They both looked as fired up as I felt. His shoes were shiny black and caught the light as he turned so we could see his super fine butt flex in tight black pants after he tossed away his jacket.</p> <p>\u201cAhh.\u201d The ladies loved the butt action.</p><p>He\u2019d worn a loose bow tie around his neck. Now he jerked it off, twirled it and tossed it to CiCi in the crowd. Another grin and his dimples forced a moan from me. CiCi clutched the tie like she\u2019d won a big prize.</p><p>\u201cTake it off. Take it all off,\u201d my elegant friend crowed.</p><p>I wanted to slap her.</p><p>He just winked and toed off his shoes, kicking them aside before he ripped his belt out of his pants and cracked it like a bullwhip. One of the werewolves in the crowd howled and begged him to crack it her way. He flicked it twice more before he threw it behind him and slowly unbuttoned his cuffs.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Keep going, generoso.\u201d Flo looked like she wanted to crawl onto the stage and bump and grind against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would Richard say?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>He pulled his shirt out of his pants, then turned his back on us again. Oh, yeah, teasing. He shimmied and shook the shirt off until it puddled on the floor. We yelled as his back flexed and he raised his arms to show off his muscles.</p><p>\u201cGawd, I like a man who knows what he\u2019s got.\u201d Aggie leaned closer and lost a starfish. She didn\u2019t even bother to pick it up.</p><p>He turned to face us again and unbuttoned his waistband. Except for the throbbing music you could have heard a pin drop. I swear none of the vampires bothered to breathe. And when the zipper slid down? Every woman there leaned forward, me included. I should have put up a barbed wire barrier. One of Lacy\u2019s were-cat friends looked ready to spring.</p><p>Black satin briefs. Very skimpy briefs. Oh, my. Yes, I\u2019d seen what stretched that satin, but none of the others here needed to. My guy was turned on doing this. Yes, he was. He stared at me, his eyes dark and intent. Like we were alone in this enormous room surrounded by women who whooped and hollered like they\u2019d managed something wonderful. There were high fives all around. I wanted to clear the room and take Rafe where he stood. I licked my lips and felt Flo and CiCi bump against me, dancing to the music. Reality check.</p><p>\u201cKeep goin\u2019, big guy.\u201d CiCi did not just say that.</p><p>Suddenly the lights went dark, total blackout, and the shock kept even the vampires from seeing. When the lights came back up a minute later, we all stared at the stage, empty except for a pair of black satin briefs.</p><p>\u201cOh, mio Dio, but I need a drink.\u201d Flo leaned against me on one side, CiCi on the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat a floor show.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cThat guy was so totally hot. I\u2019d like to know where he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he\u2019s not dessert on the menu.\u201d I tried for a smile but failed, finally handing Aggie her starfish and gesturing toward the buffet I\u2019d ordered for the paranormals who could eat. As usual, it was getting heavy play. Lacy and Erin flirted with two of the waiters as they filled plates and fanned their flushed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I recognized him.\u201d Flo gave me a side-long glance. \u201cBut I won\u2019t say anything. Any more surprises, Glory?\u201d</p><p>The lights flickered, then dimmed again. \u201cLadies, here to perform for his special friend and the bride, Ms. Florence da Vinci, N-V presents Israel Caine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooo.\u201d Loud squeals, and there was a stampede toward the stage again.</p><p>Tears pricked my eyelids as I followed a thrilled Flo and CiCi. That Ray would do this for her . . . Especially after the way we\u2019d parted. He walked to the edge of the stage and leaned down to kiss Flo on the lips. He waved to the crowd, then winked at me.</p><p>\u201cLadies, I hope you brought your dancing shoes. The band is with me, and we\u2019ll run through our set. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d There were cheers and squeals, and Lacy actually cartwheeled around the room like a kitty on a catnip high.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Flo, get up here. Sit next to me for this first number. I seem to remember this song is one of your favorites.\u201d Ray walked to the edge of the stage and held out his hand. My sophisticated friend blushed as she let him help her to the piano bench. He settled her next to him, then sang a ballad she\u2019d asked for the night she\u2019d announced her first marriage to Richard. There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the place.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. You\u2019re an idiot to let that one get away. Tell me we\u2019re dumping the Scot and going for him.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Alesa didn\u2019t get it. If you had a soul mate, you held on to him. It didn\u2019t always make sense. It just was. But gestures like this were why Ray would always be dear to me.</p><p>He and the band rocked the house. We all danced, the waiters dragged into partnering on some of the slow ones. And wasn\u2019t that a treat with their skimpy costumes? I longed for Rafe to come out of hiding and dance with me, but he was too smart for that. The less face time he and Ray had before the club opening, the better.</p><p>Ray\u2019s set was almost finished when Aggie spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Candy Caine, what about that duet you sang at the Grammys? Aren\u2019t you going to sing that for us?\u201d There were encouraging cheers and whistles.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Aggie, but Sienna Star\u2019s not here tonight. Glory didn\u2019t invite her.\u201d Ray grinned at me. \u201cWonder why?\u201d</p><p>I grinned back. \u201cI like Sienna, but decided she really didn\u2019t know Flo and her special friends well enough.\u201d Translation: The mortal would have ended up on the buffet.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about you let me take Sienna\u2019s place? Willing to give it a try?\u201d Aggie held out her hand.</p><p>Ray laughed and glanced back at his band, all mortal and without a clue that they were surrounded by paranormals. \u201cWhy the hell not? You\u2019re dressed as a Siren, right? Let\u2019s see if you\u2019ve got the pipes of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrepare to be amazed, sweet cheeks.\u201d Aggie leaped onto the stage, then perched on the closed grand piano. She made quite a picture in her mini and tiny top with that awesome hair. The waiters quit serving just to watch. When the song started, not a male in the house could have been kept away. Even Rafe hovered in the wings. Much to my relief, he\u2019d changed into jeans to keep his identity a secret.</p><p>The duet was a love song of course. Aggie\u2019s voice was hypnotic, and the band didn\u2019t play, just let Ray do the acoustic thing with the piano as he and Aggie sang together. It was a showstopper and we froze until the last golden notes hit the air.</p><p>Aggie and Ray smiled at each other, then Aggie looked out at the crowd. Clearly she could have her pick of any man and several of the women there.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tarzan!\u201d She ran her finger down the middle of her outfit. \u201cHow\u2019d you like to swim in my . . . lake?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A jungle yell, then Trey leaped on the stage, threw Aggie over his shoulder and carried her laughing out of the club. That seemed a fitting end to the party. Everyone clapped and pronounced the event a roaring success. I was exhausted and exhilarated. I jumped on the stage to thank Ray as he accepted a final kiss on the cheek from Flo.</p><p>\u201cThanks for this, Ray.\u201d I sat next to him on the piano bench after waving good-bye to my euphoric friend.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We needed to run through the set before the opening. Actually found a few things that need adjusting that the crew can fix today while I\u2019m asleep. I told the guys to hurry out of here, but I have a feeling a few of them are going to get a tumble with a vamp woman tonight. Don\u2019t think they\u2019ll mind or even remember it.\u201d Ray bumped shoulders with me. \u201cHot costume. I like.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down. Yeah, I bet he liked. I\u2019d burst out of the top. Too much dancing. I shoved down one of my boobs.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Flo was thrilled that you did this, but I guess you could tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved the whole party. Saw your shifter doing his thing from the wings before we played. That was quite a show.\u201d Ray played a bit from the song \u201cThe Stripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. No one knows who the mystery man was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have something on him now.\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cExcellent. Guy danced like a pro.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been around hundreds of years. Maybe he\u2019s done it before.\u201d I yawned. \u201cDawn\u2019s coming. I just wanted to say thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do this for you. I told you, I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d Ray played some drama music, and it sounded ominous as hell. \u201cI did it for Flo and access to the club tonight. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I get it. But you\u2019re a good guy, don\u2019t try to deny it. \u2019Night.\u201d I stood and started to walk away but was jerked to a stop by his hand on my skirt.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with the shifter. Nadia\u2019s dropped some hints. He\u2019s got a dark side.\u201d Ray lifted my skirt, looked under it and grinned. \u201cDamn, girl. Forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t appreciate a fine ass when I see one.\u201d He winked, then got serious again. \u201cRemember what I said. You and me? I get it, not happening. But that doesn\u2019t mean I want to see you hurt. Just keep your eyes open is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I jerked my skirt out of his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt either. Nadia\u2019s been around a long time. Keep your eyes open too.\u201d</p><p>Ray laughed. \u201cBabe, I can handle women, even vamp ones. But I\u2019ll be around, and you can see for yourself. Chip\u2019s studio here is where I\u2019ll be recording my new album. My throat\u2019s better in Austin for some reason. Don\u2019t know why but something in L.A. messes with my voice.\u201d</p><p>I started to reach for him, worried that he\u2019d had problems, but stopped myself. \u201cOkay, then. See you around. And don\u2019t worry about me. I can take care of myself. Just tell Nadia to stay out of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d Nadia strolled up from the wings. \u201cNo problem, Glory. Ray and I just thought you should know a few things, but you\u2019re a big girl.\u201d She looked me up and down. \u201cA very big girl. We\u2019ll butt out of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d I started to stomp off but made myself take a moment. \u201cAnd thanks for the use of the club, Nadia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be getting a bill. Or at least your friend Florence will. Rafael may want to do you favors, but I\u2019m strictly business and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d Nadia had her hand on Ray\u2019s shoulder. She slid it up to touch his jugular in an intimate gesture I couldn\u2019t possibly miss.</p><p>\u201cRight. Good night.\u201d I started to stalk off the stage, then stopped and turned. Nadia had crawled into Ray\u2019s lap and had her tongue down his throat. \u201cOh, Ray.\u201d</p><p>He came up for air. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better, and remember, I\u2019ll always be your friend.\u201d I was rewarded by Nadia\u2019s frown. \u201c\u2019Night.\u201d I smiled and sashayed over to the bar where I picked up one more glass of Blott-O and drained it.</p><p>\u201cWoo-hoo! Way to shove it in that bitch\u2019s face!\u201d Alesa crowed.</p><p>I looked around for Rafe, anxious to talk to him about that dance and Nadia\u2019s insinuations. Was it his demon side that bothered her? Hell, I could handle that. I looked back to where she had her hands all over Ray again. I felt a hitch in my heart. Not right. He was a free agent, but that didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have the urge to fry her where she sat. Too bad it would torch Ray too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s test those powers. You could wipe out this whole place with a look, hot stuff.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Not going there. Alesa wanted it too badly. And wasn\u2019t that something to think about when I wasn\u2019t drunk on my butt? I hit the door, and the cool night air sobered me a bit. Dawn was still over an hour away, but I was tired.</p><p>\u201cBuy you a drink, pretty lady?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and faced the man lounging next to the door. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had more than enough. But you can carry me home.\u201d I glanced down. \u201cMy feet hurt. New shoes.\u201d</p><p>Jerry stepped out of the shadows and pulled me up into his arms. \u201cI would have come inside, but I think I\u2019m overdressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019d have been a big hit in your kilt though.\u201d He had on jeans and a dark shirt. His hair was windblown, like maybe he\u2019d come straight here from Florida. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d I pulled his head down to kiss him. Oh, yes, this was my man. He tasted right, fit perfectly against me. But we were in front of Rafe\u2019s club, and he could come out any moment. I pushed back. \u201cYou bring your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right down the street.\u201d Jerry ran a finger along the edge of my bodice. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a seductress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201d He held me tighter.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours is closer.\u201d Jerry started walking down the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cRafe might come in. He lives there too, you know. Let\u2019s go to yours.\u201d I saw Jerry\u2019s Mercedes and nodded toward it. \u201cWe need privacy if I\u2019m going to show you my cancan. I\u2019m a dance-hall girl, you know.\u201d I ran a fingertip around his ear. \u201cWe\u2019re notorious for our . . . dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you . . . dance.\u201d He grinned and stopped next to the car. After he unlocked it, he settled me inside. \u201cNot much time tonight, but we\u2019ll have more when we wake in the evening, won\u2019t we?\u201d He kissed me, then slammed the door, getting us going in record time.</p><p>My stomach knotted. When we woke, I was going to have to tell him about Rafe. I listened to Jerry\u2019s report on his Florida trip while he sped through the deserted streets. He was happy, glad to be back and eager to be with me.</p><p>I felt like the lowest kind of slut, unworthy of his trust. He had no clue what I\u2019d been up to while he\u2019d been gone. And did I have any doubt he\u2019d been faithful in Florida? Not one bit. I knew Jerry. He assumed we were together and that meant we were exclusive. Oh, God, but I\u2019d ruined everything. For once I could see no way to fix the mess I\u2019d gotten myself into.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s see this cancan.\u201d Jerry lounged on his king-size bed, stripped down to his briefs.</p><p>I savored the sight of his rough-hewn body. I\u2019d explored every inch of it at one time or another yet never tired of the journey. He was so unabashedly male.</p><p>\u201cForget the dance.\u201d I flipped my skirt at him. \u201cCome here, lover.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, and he sat up to pull me between his legs. \u201cI like it when you call me that. Now let me see what\u2019s under that skirt.\u201d He drew it up, just as Rafe had. No, no, no. Had to get that name out of my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? You\u2019re a bold lass.\u201d He took the garter between his teeth, sliding his hand under my leg to pull it up next to his hard thigh. He worked the garter down, his warm lips grazing my skin.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you call me that.\u201d I combed my fingers through his thick hair, terrified he\u2019d wonder . . . It didn\u2019t take long. He made it to my knee before he released the black elastic with a snap.</p><p>\u201cYou wore this to Valdez\u2019s club tonight.\u201d He gazed into my eyes, probing. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA seductress wouldn\u2019t wear panties, now would she? And I hoped you\u2019d make it back before dawn.\u201d I shamelessly reached between us to slide my hand inside his briefs. \u201cI was right, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Distraction. Of course it worked. I hadn\u2019t lived four hundred years for nothing, and I was fighting for my future. I wanted Jerry to have a wonderful night before I gave him my confession.</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl. Whatever it takes. This man is yummy.\u201d Oh, God, was I going to have Alesa in this bed too? I couldn\u2019t stand it. I ordered her to close her eyes and shut the hell up. \u201cIn your dreams, sunshine.\u201d Her laughter mocked me.</p><p>\u201cGloriana,\u201d Jerry groaned, then he ripped off the hose before flinging me onto the bed.</p><p>I looked up at him and realized I couldn\u2019t do it. Couldn\u2019t make love and pretend nothing had happened while he\u2019d been gone. I put my hand on his chest when he tried to come down on top of me.</p><p>\u201cNo. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? When dawn is so close?\u201d Jerry smiled and palmed my breast. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. I hated to do this. Hated to ruin what we had, and this would do it too.</p><p>Jerry pulled me into his arms and nuzzled my neck. \u201cI brought us something from L.A. to share later. Look on the nightstand.\u201d</p><p>I recognized the bottles instantly. \u201cIan\u2019s daylight drug.\u201d The Campbell enemy made the potion that allowed vampires to stay awake for a little while past dawn. My heart stalled. \u201cOh, Jerry, I\u2019d love to see a sunrise with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHad the Devil\u2019s own time getting it, but I\u2019ve always wanted to make love to you as the sun came up.\u201d Jerry kissed me. \u201cStop now, no tears. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Would we? I knew that after I told him about Rafe, making love would be the last thing on Jerry\u2019s mind. I managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that. But we can\u2019t skip the club opening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? Spending an evening watching Israel Caine isn\u2019t my idea of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to the club tonight and sang for Flo. It was so sweet.\u201d I eased out of Jerry\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cSweet? Doubt that.\u201d Jerry frowned. \u201cProbably trying to score points with you. Did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on his radar, Jerry. Ray\u2019s into Nadia now. He just did it for Flo, and so he could practice his set. We have to go tomorrow night. Flo and CiCi are looking forward to it. Think of it as a wedding party.\u201d I pushed him away and sat up. \u201cI\u2019m serious. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the bed.\u201d Jerry grinned. \u201cWhatever you say, lover.\u201d</p> <p>I stood and stepped back. \u201cThis is serious, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Talk.\u201d He still smiled, obviously thinking I was playing.</p><p>\u201cYou knew that Rafe is part demon and didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d I lifted my chin. \u201cDidn\u2019t it occur to you I should have been clued in about that when you made him my bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jerry jumped up. \u201cDid he use his powers around you?\u201d He put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear your thoughts? Damn it, quit blocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blocking you, Jerry. No one can hear my thoughts now.\u201d I sighed. \u201cSit and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on, Gloriana?\u201d Jerry touched my cheek, his concern so real, so complete, I wanted to throw myself into his arms and sob.</p> <p>\u201cI had a couple of visits in the shop from a she-demon who claimed to be married to Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaimed? I am married to that cheating asshole. The Mayori\u2019s annulment is a nonstarter. It\u2019s till death do us part, sweet cheeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Jerry put his arms around me. \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe attacked me. I called in Richard, and he did some things to try to get rid of her. He thought he\u2019d obliterated the bitch. But instead, she slithered inside me.\u201d I took a watery breath.</p><p>\u201cBitch? Take this, bloodsucker.\u201d Alesa hit me so hard I collapsed, a wave of nausea and heat sucking the life right out of me. Anything she\u2019d done before seemed like a love tap.</p><p>\u201cGloriana? What\u2019s the matter? Love?\u201d Jerry laid me on the bed. He patted my cheeks, then bit his wrist and held it to my lips. A drink from him and I finally came back from wherever I\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWhen Alesa gets mad, she hits me with heat. That was worse than usual.\u201d I sat up with Jerry\u2019s help, but the room spun.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, that\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d Alesa huffed and puffed, so maybe a serious hit took something out of her too.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it. You mean she\u2019s still inside you?\u201d Jerry paced the rug next to the bed after I nodded. \u201cCan\u2019t Richard do something about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked him about it. He\u2019s researching. Maybe he\u2019ll know something tomorrow night.\u201d I sighed. \u201cShe talks inside my head, Jerry. It\u2019s a running commentary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Jerry stopped in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. She\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Jerry pulled me to my feet to hold me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this guy. He\u2019s hot. So quit talking and get with it.\u201d Alesa just had to remind me she was on board.</p><p>If I bitch slapped myself, would she feel it? I almost tried it.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, this is intolerable. I never should have hired a demon to guard you.\u201d Jerry stroked my hair, his arms strong around me.</p><p>\u201cYou had no way of knowing this could happen.\u201d I sighed and pushed back to sit on the bed again. \u201cBut maybe this is a sign. You should let him off the hook. Rafe told me all about it.\u201d</p><p>Jerry frowned at me. \u201cWhat is this? Best buds sharing secrets? That\u2019s why he still owes me, Gloriana. Valdez\u2019s first loyalty should have been to me. A demon bride. Damn it, I guess it\u2019s a miracle he kept you safe for five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d die for me, Jerry. You know that. He\u2019s proved it more than once. Give him a break.\u201d I reached for his hand.</p><p>\u201cThis is between Valdez and me, Gloriana. I\u2019m worried about this demon. You say Richard will be at the club tomorrow night? I want his take on the situation. We\u2019ll get rid of this demon for you. No matter what it takes.\u201d Jerry ran a hand through his hair, his sure sign of agitation.</p><p>It was now or never, and never wasn\u2019t really an option. \u201cI have something else to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jerry sat beside me. \u201cSomething about the demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s . . . well, maybe it\u2019s connected to the demon.\u201d I took a breath and tried to unclench my fists. Couldn\u2019t do it. Oh, God, but I hated to hurt Jerry. \u201cWhile you were gone, I, well, Rafe and I hooked up.\u201d</p><p>Jerry moved fast, like only an ancient vampire could. He suddenly stood across the room, his hands fisted, his back to me. His nearly naked body trembled with rage.</p><p>\u201cHooked up.\u201d He said it so quietly only vamp hearing could have picked it up. \u201cThat\u2019s modern slang. It means ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe slept together.\u201d</p><p>He turned in a blur and pinned me with blazing eyes. I squirmed and wanted to disappear.</p><p>\u201cTell it like it is, Gloriana. Vampires don\u2019t \u2018sleep together.\u2019 Sleep is death to us. Vampires fuck. You fucked Rafe. He fucked you. Is that right?\u201d His voice was cold, hard.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I picked at the bedspread. Tears filled my eyes and spilled down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He stared at me like he was trying to figure me out, this woman he couldn\u2019t read and no longer knew. I shuddered with a chill and for once wished Alesa would throw me some heat. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you. It was a mistake. Rafe is my friend. I was a fool, thinking what I felt for him was more than friendship. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice that you found that out by screwing him first.\u201d Jerry\u2019s laugh killed me. \u201cHow was it with the shifter? Did he do it doggie-style?\u201d He streaked across the room and lifted me by my shoulders. \u201cDid he? Was this the first time? Or did he shift into human form when he was with you before for five long years. Your dear friend. How close were you, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, Jeremiah, it wasn\u2019t until after Alesa got inside me that I gave in to the urge\u2014\u201d I shut up. Too late.</p><p>\u201cSo the urge was there, but then the Devil made you do it. What a convenient excuse. And then I left town so you didn\u2019t have to sneak around.\u201d Jerry released me, and I fell back to the bed. \u201cObviously you didn\u2019t bother since I\u2019m sure Richard knows and Flo, of course. Who else?\u201d Jerry\u2019s dark eyes bored into me. \u201cChrist, is every vampire in Austin laughing at me because my woman lifted her skirts for a damned dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not defend him to me, Gloriana!\u201d Jerry roared, yes, roared until plates in the downstairs china cabinet rattled.</p><p>\u201cPlease, calm down. I love you, Jeremiah, only you. I will never be with Rafe again. I told him that. That it was a mistake.\u201d I wanted to touch him, to melt some of the steel out of his jaw with a kiss. But the blaze in his eyes and stiff posture warned me away. He didn\u2019t say another word, his face hard. Just stalked into his closet and grabbed black trousers, stepping into them and zipping them up. Next came a white shirt that he buttoned while he slipped into black loafers.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Gloriana. You can find your way. Go to your lover. He is still living with you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jerry\u2019s gaze scraped over me, brutal as a fist, as he waited for my nod. \u201cHow . . . convenient.\u201d He picked up his wallet and cell phone and strode out of the room. Then I heard the back door slam. A plate shattered in the dining room. Too many vibrations.</p><p>I sat there for a minute or maybe five. I didn\u2019t bother to check a clock. I was numb. Well, not exactly. Numb would have been way better. This ache radiated from my chest. Like I\u2019d been body-slammed into a concrete wall.</p><p>What had I expected? I\u2019d cheated and, even worse, betrayed him with a shape-shifter he\u2019d trusted. Jerry\u2019s pride was hurt, and I\u2019d acted like the lowborn slut his mother had always called me. Mag Campbell would love this.</p><p>I jumped up, suddenly scared that Jerry had left here with violence in mind. He could be hurt, or worse, going up against a man with demon skills. I tried to call Rafe to warn him but got voice mail. I left a two-word message. \u201cJerry knows.\u201d It was enough. Surely Rafe knew I\u2019d never forgive him if he killed Jerry. Then I ran to the closet. Broadsword still there. Stupid, of course it was. I think I would have noticed if Jerry had gone charging out of here with it.</p><p>He had two. I hurried down the stairs and sighed with relief to see his spare hanging over the mantel, where it belonged. Okay, he was using his fists and fangs, not his usual weapon of choice. Then again, maybe he wasn\u2019t going after Rafe at all. Maybe he\u2019d decided I wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to take that. Jerry\u2019s disdain was what I deserved. But to never be with him again . . . Worse. To lose his love and respect. I fell to the floor in front of the fireplace and gave in to the sobs that had been building inside me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back. He was hot for you before, he\u2019ll be hot for you again. I\u2019ll give you pointers.\u201d Alesa\u2019s voice hit my last nerve.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you stupid bitch. Don\u2019t even pretend to understand an honorable man.\u201d I slammed my head against the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the best thing I had in my life.\u201d Jerry. God, I hated what I\u2019d done. Didn\u2019t see any way he\u2019d ever forgive me. Alesa stayed silent, rightly figuring I\u2019d reached my limit with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shuddered and wiped my eyes on my petticoat. I had to get going, and indulging in tears wasn\u2019t getting me anything but swollen eyes. I let myself out of Jerry\u2019s house, leaving my key on the kitchen counter. It was the right thing to do, but it started the waterworks again. So, as I shifted and flew home to change, it was a crying mockingbird that flew through the night toward Sixth Street.</p><p>N-V was packed, with a long line of ticket holders eager to hear Israel Caine at the door. Not that I had to wait in a line. I whammied my way to the front and was ushered inside, a special guest of the owners. Nadia greeted me, radiant in a red mini. She was actually friendly, obviously certain I was no competition, and claimed Rafe was busy in the back. Just as well. I didn\u2019t have a clue what to say to him except to ask him to hide from Jerry, and I doubted he\u2019d do that.</p><p>I settled into my chair at our reserved table. Flo and Richard were there, along with CiCi, Freddy and Derek. Damian arrived with Diana on his arm, causing all of us to wonder if that old affair might be heating up again. The empty chair next to me caused comment, which I waved away with a vague mention of Jerry\u2019s business problems.</p> <p>\u201cRichard, do you have a minute?\u201d I smiled at him and nodded toward the hall.</p><p>He glanced around the table. \u201cDarling, Gloriana and I will be right back. Need anything?\u201d He kissed Flo on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo, take care of my friend. Tell her about your conversation with Jeremiah earlier.\u201d Flo smiled at me, but I could tell she was worried.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d I touched Flo\u2019s shoulder. She looked gorgeous as usual in a bright blue designer dress with a fabulous diamond pin holding up one shoulder. Her dark hair was pulled back, and she glowed with happiness, except when she looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. You\u2019re the bride. Enjoy this week. Promise not to let my messes worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will fix your messes, I hope. Last night\u2019s party was the best.\u201d She stood and hugged me, then shooed Richard away. \u201cGo, take care of my BFF.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Richard smiled and took my elbow. He found a storage room, and we stepped inside, then shut the door.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me get rid of this demon, Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Like this pious asshole can help you. Remember who got us together in the first place?\u201d Alesa turned up the thermostat, and I grabbed a pamphlet to fan myself.</p><p>\u201cI brought my things. When the show is over, we can go to your place and try an exorcism.\u201d Richard put his hand on my shoulder, then snatched it away. \u201cGod, Glory, you\u2019re burning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. Alesa shoots me with hellfire on a regular basis.\u201d I wished for ice and looked around. A vent was overhead, and I stood under it. Thank God Rafe had the air-conditioning going.</p><p>\u201cI have to warn you, Gloriana, this demon is stronger than any I\u2019ve dealt with before. The very fact that she was able to get inside you after what I did in the shop proves that.\u201d Richard took the paper I handed him and began to fan me too. \u201cObviously you\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d I sighed. \u201cJust do your best, Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. Let him try. I\u2019m not afraid of his puny holy water routine.\u201d Alesa cackled, and the hairs on my arms stood up. \u201cBy the time I get through with you, Glory St. Clair, you\u2019ll be Lucifer\u2019s sock puppet. Just wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo said . . . You talked to Jerry?\u201d I realized Richard wasn\u2019t meeting my gaze. \u201cI told him about Rafe. He lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He came by the house. I tried to calm him down. Put the blame on this demon. It seemed as good a reason as any for you and Rafe.\u201d Richard\u2019s smile was wry. \u201cMy bride told him the same thing. Flo will do anything to make you happy, Gloriana, and thinks you want to be with Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Flo\u2019s the best.\u201d I sniffed but refused to cry again. I usually healed fast, but too much drinking and demon were taking a toll, and I knew I looked like hell. I\u2019d pulled out a low-cut red dress to distract but had a feeling my fake smile wasn\u2019t fooling anyone.</p><p>\u201cI hated hurting Jerry, but what\u2019s done is done. I just hope Jerry can look past it and we can figure out a way to move on.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks for trying, Richard. I know he\u2019s your friend, and I don\u2019t want you caught in the middle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t happen. Flo and I are leaving on our honeymoon right after the wedding. We hope you two will resolve things before we get back.\u201d Richard tried to touch my shoulder again but shook his head. \u201cThe heat. Still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it.\u201d I headed back to our table. Jerry was there, looking so good and so completely unconcerned that I\u2019d arrived that my heart broke. He was laughing with CiCi and the rest of the crew, then signaled the waiter for another round before he stood to hold out my chair, always the gentleman. As soon as I was seated, he turned back to Damian.</p> <p>\u201cBachelor party tomorrow night at my house to give Richard a proper send-off.\u201d He smiled at Freddy and Derek. \u201cYou two\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d Freddy glanced at me. \u201cGlory, can you send over that male stripper you had here? Mother won\u2019t quit raving about him. The rest of the guys won\u2019t appreciate him, but Derek and I\u2019d like a peek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, that was a onetime deal.\u201d I grinned at them. \u201cFlo, you allowing Richard to have a female stripper at his party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowing?\u201d Jerry finally looked at me. \u201cSurely Richard doesn\u2019t ask permission to do as he pleases. Do you, Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Florence is free to pursue her interests, and I\u2019m free to\u2014\u201d Richard grunted. \u201cWell, maybe not.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI have a very expensive shoe pointing . . . Well, gentlemen, since I hope to enjoy my honeymoon, we\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, and the waiter arrived with refills of the Blott-O Nadia had available for vampires who came to the club.</p><p>By the time the show started, the place was packed, standing room only. We settled back to watch the show, a great Israel Caine performance. Ray coaxed Sienna Star from another balcony table to sing their famous duet, and they brought down the house. When the lights finally went up, I turned to say something to Jerry, but he was gone. He\u2019d shown up just long enough to greet old friends, and that was all. Damn.</p><p>We said good-bye to the rest, then Flo, Richard and I headed to my apartment. To my surprise, CiCi insisted on coming along.</p><p>\u201cI have some things to try if Richard\u2019s exorcism doesn\u2019t work. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d CiCi pulled a tote bag from her car, parked at the curb near my shop.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I just hope I don\u2019t need anything else.\u201d I turned to Richard, who had his own bag of tricks with him.</p><p>\u201cRelax, mia amica. Ricardo has done this before.\u201d Flo slipped off her shoes and settled on my living room couch.</p><p>\u201cYes, but exorcisms are tricky. No guarantees. And I\u2019m no longer a priest, you know. I can bring you one, if you wish.\u201d Richard took my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019d have to whammy a real priest, and he\u2019d be freaked by the whole vampire thing anyway.\u201d I squeezed his hand. \u201cI think you\u2019re my best shot, Richard. Where do you want me?\u201d</p><p>He pointed toward the bedroom. \u201cIn there. Florence, you two wait out here. I don\u2019t need an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d CiCi opened my laptop. \u201cDo you mind if I do a little research, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d I followed Richard into my bedroom. I admit I was scared. What would Alesa do during this? She\u2019d hit me pretty hard just for calling her a bitch.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, honey. So get ready. Priest Boy\u2019s going down.\u201d Alesa sounded gleeful.</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cAlesa\u2019s gearing up. Please promise you\u2019ll stop if it looks like my head\u2019s going to explode or spin like a top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no point in exorcising the demon if I kill you doing it.\u201d Richard patted my hand. \u201cNow you feel cool. That\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr really bad.\u201d I looked toward Heaven. \u201cOh, Lord, give me strength.\u201d I crossed myself even though I\u2019d never been Catholic.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shoes and lie on the bed. Close your eyes and let me do my thing. No matter what, try to lie still and not fight me.\u201d Richard sounded so serious my stomach flipped.</p><p>My eyes snapped open. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t hurt yourself. Flo would never forgive me. Promise. If it looks like Alesa is trying to jump into you, stop. I\u2019ll keep her if I have to.\u201d</p><p>I heard a trill of hysterical laughter that shredded my nerves. \u201cAre you kidding me? Inhabit that uptight prick? I\u2019d as soon live inside your beat-up dresser, numbnut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes. Here goes.\u201d Richard began reciting prayers and sprinkling me with what I figured was holy water. I hissed as heat seared me and the water sizzled. Great. I\u2019d turned into a damned griddle. Sweat ran down my sides, and I cursed myself for not changing out of that cute red dress. Forget dresses. When my head blew and my brains hit the ceiling, what I wore wouldn\u2019t matter. My arms twitched and my feet drummed the mattress, but I knew Alesa was still on board.</p><p>Richard\u2019s voice got louder and more desperate. I was so drenched now that I appreciated my waterproof mattress pad. He touched my shoulder and my forehead, then jerked his hands away with a yell. I figured Alesa had given him a jolt of electricity. Running feet and the door crashed open.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Flo\u2019s voice. \u201cMio amante! Look at your hands.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open, and I sat up. Flo cradled Richard\u2019s blackened and charred hands.</p><p>\u201cRichard, no! We\u2019re stopping this.\u201d I fell back.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201d Richard croaked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no, it didn\u2019t work. How\u2019d you like that demo, Glory? You could do that. Scorch anyone who touched you. Or flame them with a look. Talk about power. Major buzz, baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still here, and she\u2019s gloating. Give it up, Richard.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with her forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not giving up.\u201d CiCi held some printed pages. \u201cFlo, give your husband a drink, heal him, and then send him home. Time for plan B. Glory, are you game?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhat can it hurt? Right now I\u2019m Alesa\u2019s bitch. Couldn\u2019t get much worse.\u201d Or at least I hoped not.</p> <p>Twenty-three</p><p>I jumped in the shower while Flo gave Richard some of her juice, then sent him protesting on his way. She and CiCi decided to start with a clean slate. CiCi changed the sheets while I was in the bathroom. I came out in my robe ready for whatever.</p><p>\u201cBefore we start, I want to be clear. Don\u2019t risk yourself, CiCi. I won\u2019t let you or Flo sacrifice\u2014\u201d</p><p>CiCi held up her hand. \u201cFlorence and I are perfectly safe.\u201d She pulled out two beautiful jeweled rosaries with large crosses. \u201cBlessed by a saint and two Holy Fathers. There\u2019s also a small piece of the ankle bone of a sainted nun hidden in a compartment in the back of each cross.\u201d She pressed on one to reveal a tiny opening in the gold. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. But still . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished. Florence sleeps with Richard, who this demon hates, and I am from a long line of priests, popes and cardinals.\u201d She stepped close to me and poked me in the chest. \u201cListen to me, demon. You dare to jump into me, and I\u2019ll run straight to the Vatican. How would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaaa! Get this pious bitch away from me. She\u2019s giving me the hives.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cAlesa got the message. We\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now we use logic. We make the host intolerable to the demon. Glory, Alesa\u2019s from hell. What would she absolutely hate?\u201d CiCi had a notepad, hell\u2019s secretary.</p><p>\u201cLet me think.\u201d I sat on the bed.</p><p>\u201cSwell. When she\u2019s done, she can write Exorcisms for Dummies .\u201d Alesa was all snark.</p> <p>I smiled at CiCi. Desperate times and all that. Maybe the very fact that Alesa was making fun meant she was afraid. \u201cShe\u2019s from down below.\u201d I nodded to CiCi. \u201cSo I say we go high. What do you say, Alesa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeights?\u201d A few octaves higher than usual. \u201cNo problem for me. No, sirree.\u201d We were definitely onto something.</p><p>I nodded at CiCi and mouthed \u201cWrite it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Your Hellness. You\u2019re so crazy about heat. How do you feel about cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not the cold. Even Lucifer can\u2019t get me to Siberia or the poles. Not even with insulated underwear and no matter how many souls I could snatch there. I\u2019m not freezing my ass off.\u201d Alesa poked me until I doubled over. \u201cI mean it, vampire. You pull something with cold, and you\u2019ll regret it. I swear that on Lucifer\u2019s crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooo. I\u2019m scared. Seems cold is freaking her out.\u201d I hugged my pillow. \u201cWell, CiCi, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we go to the roof first.\u201d CiCi grinned. \u201cYou able to get dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I sucked it up and jumped into jeans and a T-shirt. How high could I fly? Would it be enough to make Alesa jump out? Where would she go? Did I care? Bottom line, could she if she tried? Oh, no, I had to believe . . . Anyway, Flo was all for going with me, and we shifted into birds.</p> <p>We flew straight up until we hit clouds. Alesa screeched and singed my feathers. Flo finally made me head down when I started smoking. We landed on the tallest building in Austin.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Glory?\u201d Flo was a pretty blue bird while my mockingbird had pitiful blackened wing tips.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still here so look out below!\u201d We jumped off the ledge, dive-bombing the sidewalk. I heard some nasty language inside my head, but all that got me was a roaring headache and flop sweat before we pulled up at the last minute.</p><p>\u201cGlory, that\u2019s one stubborn demon you have there.\u201d CiCi met us as we shifted back in the alley near Rafe\u2019s club, which had closed for the night. \u201cYou look like hell. Can you keep going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. What\u2019s next?\u201d I leaned against the brick wall, my head pounding, my clothes soaked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d CiCi put her finger over her lips. \u201cRafe is letting us in. Here he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, ladies?\u201d Rafe frowned at me. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d He looked up at the cloudless night sky. \u201cGet caught in a sprinkler system or a car wash? Or did you get run over by one of those street-cleaning trucks?\u201d He took my arm and helped me inside. \u201cSeriously, you look terrible, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I was grateful for his support. \u201cAlesa\u2019s been busting my chops. We\u2019re working on our own exorcism since Richard\u2019s didn\u2019t do the trick.\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t seem to mind that I was getting him wet as I sagged against him. \u201cOpening seemed to go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great. Nadia\u2019s pleased. We\u2019re well on our way.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cSo what\u2019s this about my walk-in cooler? If this hadn\u2019t been a restaurant once, we wouldn\u2019t even have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon hates the cold, Rafael. We\u2019re going to freeze her out, eh, Glory?\u201d Flo tugged me toward the kitchen when Alesa balked and made my legs go limp.</p><p>I would have hit the floor if Rafe hadn\u2019t grabbed me and picked me up.</p><p>\u201cI hope this is worth it. In wet clothes?\u201d I clung to Rafe as we got to the cooler door.</p><p>\u201cYou can change into my extra shirt.\u201d Rafe winked at Flo. \u201cNot very warm though. White satin.\u201d</p><p>CiCi gasped. \u201cYou were the one! The dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, CiCi. I did it for Flo.\u201d Rafe looked from CiCi to Flo. \u201cWhat did you think, ladies? How\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d CiCi bumped her hip against his. \u201cYou get lonely, you know where I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiCi! Remember why we\u2019re here? Demon on board.\u201d I wanted to scratch her eyes out but knew I had no right to be jealous. Flo murmured something to Rafe in Italian, which he answered as he kissed her cheek. I noticed he avoided touching those crosses the ladies wore. My semidemon friend. I didn\u2019t have time to waste worrying about Rafe just now, but I bet he\u2019d had many issues to deal with in his long life.</p><p>\u201cAlesa\u2019s revving up again.\u201d My wet clothes started to steam, and she kept stabbing me viciously.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. You go into that cooler, and I\u2019ll give you hell with a side order of fried Glory.\u201d She stabbed me again, right between the eyes, then turned up the heat. I gasped.</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Rafe winced, obviously feeling my fire as he held me.</p><p>\u201cAlesa really doesn\u2019t want to go in there. Hurry inside. Now.\u201d I couldn\u2019t open my eyes against the pain. \u201cAnd put me down before you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can deal. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Rafe carried me. Flo and CiCi followed, slamming the door shut.</p><p>The chill hit me hard, and my teeth started chattering. Ridiculous. Vampires usually handled temps better than this. Damned demon influence.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sing church songs. She should hate that.\u201d CiCi broke into a tune from the Moonlight Church. Rafe must know it from sitting outside waiting for me, but I didn\u2019t hear him join in. The demon in him? I finally managed to slide to my feet but held on to his hand. His grip was tight. So this was hard for him too. My wet clothes crackled as I turned into an ice sculpture. No more inner heat. I guess the cold was getting to Alesa.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy. Glory\u2019s lips are turning blue.\u201d Rafe pulled off his shirt and wrapped it around me. \u201cCome on. Out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-j-just a l-l-little l-l-longer.\u201d I shuddered and icicles broke off the ends of my wet hair.</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s gone from blue to purple. She\u2019s had enough.\u201d Rafe looked uncomfortable too and not just because I wore his shirt. Flo sang \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d at the top of her lungs.</p><p>\u201cY-y-yes, out. N-n-now.\u201d I collapsed in a heap.</p><p>Rafe picked me up and carried me out. He pulled a tablecloth off a table and wrapped it around me, then held me tight. Flo and CiCi each grabbed their own tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cIs she still in there?\u201d Flo put her hand on my arm. \u201cYou feel cold. Isn\u2019t that a good sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, and I\u2019ll fry your friend\u2019s hand if she touches you again.\u201d Alesa sounded hoarse.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here and she\u2019s mad.\u201d I reluctantly let go of Rafe, warming up fast. \u201cToo bad I can\u2019t parachute over the North Pole singing the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d</p><p>Flo and CiCi nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWe could charter a plane,\u201d Flo said.</p><p>CiCi patted my shoulder. \u201cGood idea. My treat.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head and looked at Rafe. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think we can blast this thing out until she\u2019s ready to go.\u201d I handed Rafe back his shirt. \u201cCongratulations on the opening. It was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Sorry you\u2019re stuck.\u201d He glanced at my friends. \u201cI\u2019ll be home before dawn. Maybe we can talk.\u201d He slid his hand down my arm in a comforting gesture.</p><p>\u201cNow he can touch us anytime.\u201d Alesa sounded stronger.</p><p>\u201cTalk. Yes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d I wondered if Rafe had ever tried to obliterate his demon side. I didn\u2019t dare mention it in front of Flo and CiCi.</p><p>Back at the apartment my friends had one more thing they wanted to try.</p><p>\u201cThis is called \u2018Soul Walking.\u2019\u201d CiCi opened her tote bag. \u201cFlorence, did you bring what I asked you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Flo looked sheepish. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t risk my best pair of shoes. What if they got stained? Have you seen the way Glory sweats? We\u2019re talking vintage Chanel, CiCi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend are you?\u201d CiCi pulled out a pair of lilac satin pumps so exquisite my eyes watered. They had to be several hundred years old with genuine diamond buckles on the toes. \u201cThis must be done right. What did you bring, cheapskate?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou call me cheap? Look at those things you dragged in here. I happen to know the buckles are paste. Didn\u2019t you sell the diamonds during the terror?\u201d Flo stood toe-to-toe with CiCi.</p><p>\u201cI replaced them with diamonds again during Victoria\u2019s reign, smart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass? I brought some beautiful pumps that are irreplaceable. They were handmade in Italia by a master crafts-man who\u2019s been dead for over a hundred years. To get these shoes I had to sleep with him, and he with only one eye and a hunch back.\u201d Flo\u2019s face was pink.</p> <p>\u201cLadies, please. What\u2019s the plan? Is this an exorcism or a costume ball?\u201d I bit my lip. If I laughed, I\u2019d be hit with a tote bag. Not a shoe\u2014there was the danger of staining.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, we had a plan. We knew you probably wouldn\u2019t go for the cleansing ritual.\u201d CiCi pulled out an ominous length of tubing and a rubber bag. \u201cThis was to be filled with more holy water, and the tube goes you know where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, oh, hell no.\u201d I backed away. \u201cLet\u2019s stick to the shoes. How does that one go? And don\u2019t say you know where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Soul Walk,\u2019 as I said.\u201d CiCi sat down to slip on her shoes. They really were beautiful. \u201cFlo, put on yours. Glory, you lie on the floor, facedown, and we walk on you and we chant, of course.\u201d She handed Flo several sheets of paper. \u201cStart with the one highlighted in yellow, Florence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re going to walk on my back with those pointy heels?\u201d I eyed them. CiCi\u2019s might be old, but they\u2019d have made a decent secret weapon in King Louis\u2019s court. And Flo\u2019s? Her one-eyed cobbler had a thing for metal because her heels were sheathed in copper and would leave cuts wherever they landed. Ouch!</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so bad. I could have brought some of my new shoes, with the thin high heels. I did you a favor. I think if we don\u2019t hurt this demon, what will be the point?\u201d Flo looked at CiCi, and they both laughed. \u201cOh, I made a little joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very little joke. I get to lie here with the pedestrian parade on my back. Where\u2019d you get this idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Internet. It\u2019s a fount of information. Shirley Mac-Laine did a soul trek through Spain. It totally focused her and brought her peace, closer to God. A demon will hate it, right?\u201d CiCi looked so hopeful I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her what I really thought, which was that she needed to check into Dr. Simon\u2019s hospital to have her head examined.</p><p>\u201cYour friends are a hoot but great shoes. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to let them do this.\u201d Alesa wasn\u2019t encouraging it, so maybe there was hope.</p><p>\u201cI think you have sole and soul mixed up, but try it. Chant away, just tread carefully. I\u2019ve had a rough night.\u201d I moved the coffee table out of way and lay facedown on the area rug in front of the couch.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here goes. Close your eyes, Glory. Florence, on three.\u201d CiCi counted down. \u201cDemon, demon, go away. The fires of hell are where you play. Glory says you cannot stay. Demon, demon, go away.\u201d CiCi chanted this three times as she trod over my body, her sharp heels doing a number on my back and thighs. I groaned while Alesa laughed hysterically. So much for that.</p> <p>Then it was Flo\u2019s turn. \u201cDemon, demon, servant of hell. My soul doesn\u2019t want you or wish you well. Go back, go back, you I do expel. In my body you cannot dwell.\u201d Flo really put some oomph into it, forgetting that her friend lay under her as she stomped in each word. I gritted my teeth and took it because I liked that chant.</p><p>\u201cSay it again, Flo. Alesa\u2019s quiet and no heat. CiCi, jump on board.\u201d I could smell my own blood and agony would be an improvement, but if this got rid of Alesa, it was so worth it.</p><p>We chanted, louder and stronger as CiCi and Flo pounded me into the rug. By the time the door into the apartment burst open, we\u2019d worked ourselves into a frenzy of beat the hell out of Glory, er, her demon.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Rafe shouted from the doorway.</p><p>CiCi and Flo froze. CiCi had one foot planted on each thigh. Flo stood on my shoulders. I drifted somewhere between hell and unconsciousness. Alesa was silent, and I prayed that meant she\u2019d left. Since neither of my friends had screamed or stopped chanting, I figured they hadn\u2019t been invaded. If Alesa had run to that dresser in my bedroom, she could have it. I\u2019d get Rafe to haul it to the Dumpster and burn it as soon as I could speak again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Look at her.\u201d</p><p>Flo and CiCi cried out. \u201cNo! Glory, we didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. I\u2019ll take care of her. Dawn\u2019s coming, and you both need to get home.\u201d Rafe must have looked pretty scary because they just grabbed their things and left without another word.</p> <p>\u201cGlory, baby.\u201d Rafe scooped me into his arms and carried me into the bathroom. He carefully peeled off my shredded clothes and gently cleaned my wounds. I was too hurt to be embarrassed. \u201cDrink. So you can heal.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t argue, just sank my fangs into his wrist. I needed it. When I figured I\u2019d had enough, I released him. At some point, he laid me on the bed and dressed me in a nightgown.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I walk in on?\u201d Rafe touched my cheek, the only part of me not sore.</p><p>\u201cAnother version of an exorcism. I think it worked, Rafe. I think she\u2019s gone.\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cTotally worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that dumb stunt, bitch.\u201d Alesa blasted me with so much heat and pain that I leaned over and threw up on Rafe\u2019s shoes.</p><p>The next two nights I gave in to the inevitable and just did my routine. Rafe and I talked, but he admitted that his demon thing was in his blood so there was no exorcism that could possibly work on him. No one in his family had ever even tried. And I had to give it up. At least for now.</p><p>Alesa wasn\u2019t making it easy. After the first night in the shop with her hell-bent on insulting every customer I came in contact with, Lacy and Erin begged me to just stay in the back room and work on paperwork. To say I had a ticked-off demon inside was an understatement.</p><p>Flo and CiCi both came by to apologize for going overboard. I wanted to pretend for their sakes that they\u2019d cured me, but Alesa wouldn\u2019t have it, blasting me with enough heat that their attempted hugs scorched them. Damn, I hated that demon bitch.</p><p>At least Flo had decided she could skip one bridal tradition, and I didn\u2019t have to endure a rehearsal and rehearsal dinner on Friday night. Instead, she just e-mailed everyone some general instructions. It was a relief not to have to see Jerry. I figured he needed a cooling-off period. But by the time Saturday night came around, I was pretty depressed.</p><p>Simon called just as I was ready to close the shop at midnight. Flo and Richard\u2019s wedding was at three, just hours away, and I was headed to Damian\u2019s to change into my bridesmaid dress as soon as I locked up.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Gloriana. How do you like your new car?\u201d Simon sounded smug. I decided to tolerate it.</p><p>\u201cI love it. Is Westwood suffering as promised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m teaching him his place, never doubt it.\u201d Simon chuckled. \u201cHe got his finances straightened out. It\u2019s amazing what billions can buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I wouldn\u2019t know about that.\u201d I sat on a stool and looked around the back room. My inventory was low, which was a good thing. We\u2019d been busy with the music festival crowd in town. I needed to shop but couldn\u2019t work up much enthusiasm. My laptop was open, and I\u2019d made a few halfhearted bids on an online site. All I could think about was Jerry and that he hadn\u2019t called or picked up when I\u2019d called him. Hadn\u2019t responded to my desperate voice mails either. I couldn\u2019t blame him, but that didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t frantic for some kind of sign that he was willing to give me another chance.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, are you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Drives like a dream.\u201d I think Simon had asked about the car while I\u2019d been off on Planet Angst.</p><p>\u201cDid you look in the glove box?\u201d Simon sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? Did you hide a tarantula in there or something? To remind me of my place?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t put it past him. Simon always wanted the upper hand, and I\u2019d been pretty bold with him.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. I\u2019m courting you. To get you to join my band of merry men.\u201d Simon laughed, his creepy straight-from-the-dungeon chuckle. \u201cGet the Robin Hood reference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to be stupid to miss it. Oh, yeah, rob from the rich and give to poor little old me. Thanks a bunch.\u201d I opened the door to the alley to stare at my pretty car. Maybe a smart woman would send it back. Courting me? I choked back a gag.</p><p>\u201cLoosen up, Glory. This guy just got a billionaire to give him his stash. Brilliant.\u201d Alesa sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now I really had to wonder if the car was jinxed. I walked out and hit the remote to unlock it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out to check the glove compartment. What am I going to find exactly?\u201d I popped it open and saw the owner\u2019s manual and a few papers that included my title and a year\u2019s worth of paid insurance. Wow. Unexpected bonus. I hadn\u2019t called my agent yet, dreading how the premiums would jump.</p><p>\u201cLook inside the leather case for the owner\u2019s manual.\u201d Simon was clearly excited. \u201cIt\u2019s a little gift. Besides the insurance. Did you notice that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d I snapped open the case. There, nestled next to the book with the famous logo, was a plastic gas card. \u201cI see a credit card. Are you kidding me? You\u2019re giving me gas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. Use it. Premium. As much as you need. The bills come to me. You\u2019ll never have to buy gas again, Gloriana.\u201d Simon said this firmly, and my eyes teared up. Oh, man, I could see how people were seduced to give up their souls. The Devil couldn\u2019t have done a better job.</p><p>Alesa happy danced on my kidneys. \u201cI love this guy. He actually has you thinking about it. I\u2019m in the presence of a master. Well, not in his presence, but you know what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted her to shut the hell up so I could think. Wait, not thinking. I wasn\u2019t going to become an EV, end of story. Use the gas card? Why not? It was Westwood\u2019s money paying for it, and he owed me after all the vampires he\u2019d killed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Simon. As for your courting thing? Forget it. I\u2019ll never, repeat, never be interested in anything you\u2019ve got going out there. Leave me the hell alone. We\u2019re done. Get it? Done.\u201d I snapped the phone shut.</p><p>\u201cDumb ass. He could do you a lot of good.\u201d Alesa jabbed me between the eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShut up. I\u2019m going to a wedding. If I want your opinion on anything, I\u2019ll ask for it.\u201d I grabbed my purse out of the back room, locked the door and got into the car. Insurance and a gas card. That bastard. He really knew the way to a woman\u2019s heart.</p><p>I headed for Damian\u2019s. What Simon didn\u2019t know was that my heart had been ripped apart this week and only Jerry could put it back together. We\u2019d be standing at the altar on either side of the bride and groom in a little while. I hoped seeing Flo and Richard so in love and the vision of me in my beautiful bridesmaid dress would soften Jerry toward me. It was worth a shot.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>\u201cI \u2019m so sorry, Glory. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Flo fluttered around me. \u201cI gave the operator your measurements.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cHow did you know my measurements?\u201d I sure never let her within a foot of me with a tape.</p> <p>\u201cI guessed.\u201d Flo moved out of range. Wise woman.</p><p>\u201cI think you got confused with meters and feet, chickie.\u201d Aggie looked perfect in her purple bridesmaid dress that fit like a dream.</p><p>\u201cFeet?\u201d I shrieked, then fought for control. Alesa loved it, though I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be quite so thrilled if she could have seen us. I had on a purple tent. It was supposed to be an elegant off the shoulder gown with a fitted bodice. My bodice didn\u2019t fit anywhere, and a family of five could have hidden under the skirt. I wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cPins. We need pins. A tuck here and there, and it will be perfect.\u201d CiCi had come into the upstairs bedroom where we were getting dressed. Lacy rushed out in search.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, CiCi. The only thing that can fix this nightmare is a stick of dynamite.\u201d I plopped on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wrinkle it.\u201d Flo hadn\u2019t put on her dress yet.</p> <p>I jumped up even though I wanted nothing more than to let Alesa take over and scream curses. Nope, my best bud was getting married. My demon jabbed and stabbed, but I swallowed my bile.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d There went my dreams of a big reconciliation scene with Jerry. I was an enormous eggplant while the rest of the five bridesmaids were visions of loveliness. He\u2019d take one look at me coming down the aisle and think celibacy beat the hell out of sex with a giant vegetable.</p><p>\u201cLet CiCi pin it. I\u2019m so so sorry.\u201d Flo grabbed my hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be too tight, and I guess I went overboard. I need you to be by my side down there.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare cry and ruin your makeup.\u201d I hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m sure CiCi will be able to fix it. Go, make yourself more beautiful. Richard will be stunned and realize he\u2019s the luckiest man on the planet.\u201d Especially when he saw her next to the purple monster acting as maid of honor. I patted her shoulder, then shoved her toward the bedroom where I knew her wedding dress waited.</p><p>\u201cBut this is a disastro!\u201d Flo brushed at the fabric.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure something out. And my shoes fit. Love them.\u201d Flo had given us each gorgeous designer shoes to match our dresses.</p><p>When Flo was out of sight, I turned to CiCi. \u201cWell? Any hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut and pin.\u201d She pulled scissors out of her bag. \u201cBut don\u2019t go wild on the dance floor. This is a temporary fix.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I just need to look presentable coming down the aisle.\u201d I sighed when Lacy hurried back in.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Bachelor\u2019s house. The only pins I could find were corsage pins from the florist.\u201d She handed CiCi a box.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to do.\u201d CiCi used my strapless bra as a base. But she was right, the pearl-tipped straight pins were definitely temporary. Sudden moves caused jabs that made even Alesa gasp.</p><p>The music started and we assembled at the top of the stairs. Flo stood behind me, Damian at her side to give her away. My best friend glowed with happiness. Her designer gown had cost a mint and looked worth every penny.</p><p>Richard waited at the bottom of the stairs, and he had eyes only for his bride. The actual ceremony was to take place outside, and we proceeded out there to the music of a string quartet. Jerry, looking much too handsome in a black tux, white shirt and bow tie, was lined up with the other groomsmen in front of an altar covered in white roses and green leaves. Another ex-priest, a friend of Richard\u2019s, waited to seal the deal though this ceremony was a renewal of vows. My friends had done the real thing in the catacombs under the Vatican.</p><p>When we came to a stop, Ray\u2019s voice filled the night with a beautiful song about eternal love. I looked over and saw him at a piano. He didn\u2019t glance at me, only at the happy couple. Eternal love. I studied Jerry, praying he\u2019d feel compelled to look my way and remember what we had. But he stared into the assembled crowd sitting in chairs facing the makeshift altar. Who was he watching?</p><p>I searched the onlookers and saw many familiar faces, friends I\u2019d known for years. Then I spotted a woman sitting next to Jerry\u2019s daughter. Oh, no, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGlory, your heartbeat just doubled, and you\u2019re generating your own heat. Ooo, hate. That beats the hell out of this lovefest. What\u2019s up?\u201d Alesa would have to wait. The ceremony had started.</p><p>I took Flo\u2019s bouquet, gripping it so hard I crushed a delicate orchid. Aggie gasped and jerked it out of my hand. Luckily Flo didn\u2019t notice as she said her vows. The endless ceremony droned on until they paused for Ray to sing another sweet love song. Sappy, sentimental tripe.</p><p>\u201cOookay, Glory. Something\u2019s up. You usually like rocker boy\u2019s stuff. What\u2019s the deal? Who you got the hate on for? I get it\u2019s a woman. Cat fight. Oh, yeah. Destroying this wedding would make my night.\u201d Alesa gave me a tiny heat flash to get me to answer. Nothing doing. We all knelt for the final prayer and blessing. A pin popped under my arm. Ventilation. Thank you, God. Alesa growled and heated me some more. She didn\u2019t like prayers or the \u201cG\u201d word.</p><p>Time to walk back down the aisle. Aggie handed off the bouquet, and I thrust it at Flo. She didn\u2019t notice that it was a little worse for wear. She just gazed at Richard. I gave Jerry a look that should have blown him right out of his black socks. He smirked and offered his arm. I took it, and we strode down the aisle after the bride and groom. I felt another pin go. Fine. I was burning up, and the breeze under my arms was welcome.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you brought her to this wedding,\u201d I hissed at Jerry as soon as we left the aisle.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it, Jerry.\u201d I felt my face flush and the room blurred. Oh, no. Hang on to your mad, Glory. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t cry. Needless to say, Alesa was horrified at the thought. I blinked rapidly and held on to Jerry\u2019s arm. \u201cDamn it, Jerry, that was so . . . mean.\u201d I rounded on him as we reached the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a warrior, Gloriana. When I\u2019m hit, I use what weapons I have at hand to hit back.\u201d He glanced at Mara, who\u2019d come to stand in the doorway, and smiled. \u201cGood to know I landed a blow.\u201d He lifted my hand off his arm and strode over to Richard, slapping his back and offering congratulations like he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you two?\u201d Flo grabbed my arm. \u201cGlory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photographer\u2019s calling for us, Flo.\u201d Aggie, who\u2019d obviously seen and heard the whole thing, gave me a shut-up look. \u201cPicture time? Don\u2019t we have to go get photos made at the altar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, she\u2019s right.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to unload my drama on the bride, so I helped hustle Flo and Richard back toward the altar. I looked down and saw some pins on the floor behind me. Great. I would be down to my underwear before Flo cut the cake. A waiter came by with pink champagne. I took a flute and sniffed. Wow. Joy juice of the vampire kind, and did I need it. The joy, that is. I downed it and grabbed a refill, then moved to my place in line for the photographer, a shifter who\u2019d been hired for the occasion.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Aggie reached over and tucked some of my top into my bra. \u201cYou\u2019re coming apart,\u201d she whispered in my ear.</p><p>I glanced at Jerry, who was ignoring me. \u201cYou are so right.\u201d</p><p>Aggie gave me an inquiring look, but we were soon in the middle of a whirlwind as the poses began. By the time we were finally cut loose for the reception, I\u2019d gone from hurt to furious to homicidal to numb. Alesa was doing backflips with glee. Nothing like a meltdown to keep a demon happy.</p><p>A band had set up and music started. The leader announced that Mr. and Mrs. Mainwaring were going to have their first dance. Everyone clapped as Flo and Richard took the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet.\u201d</p><p>I turned slowly, knowing exactly who hadn\u2019t waited a minute to rub my nose in the fact that Jerry had brought her here.</p><p>\u201cMara. Did Flo invite you?\u201d I knew my friend certainly hadn\u2019t. Flo would never invite the mother of Jerry\u2019s child here. My friend knew I hated Mara because she\u2019d never made her pursuit of Jerry a secret.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jeremiah asked me to come as his date and to see our daughter, of course.\u201d Mara smiled at Jerry, who was hurrying toward us. What? Did he think I was going to get violent? He should have thought of that before he\u2019d brought the bitch here.</p><p>\u201cHow . . . interesting. Did you wonder why the last-minute invitation?\u201d I looked up as Jerry stepped between us.</p><p>Jerry threw his arm around Mara. \u201cMara is an old and dear friend, Gloriana. Naturally I\u2019d want to reconnect with the mother of my child.\u201d He smiled down at Mara, and she leaned into him, clearly willing to do whatever it took to latch on to him permanently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aggie grabbed my arm while I still reeled from Blade\u2019s sucker punch. \u201cCome on, you two. The wedding party is supposed to be on the floor.\u201d She shoved me at Jerry. \u201cBlade, the best man has to dance with the maid of honor.\u201d She was pressed against the tall English vampire Richard had imported as one of his groomsmen.</p><p>Jerry kissed Mara\u2019s pale cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Then he swept me into his arms.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I let him get away with it, then noticed Flo and Richard beaming at us. I forced a smile for their sakes. \u201cThank God this is a slow one. Even you can handle that.\u201d</p> <p>Jerry looked down at me, not bothering to smile. \u201cCheap shot. Just shut up and dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I smiled as he swore and pulled a pin from his palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this? Your dress is a damned mine field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d I intended to dance in silence but couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cMara, Jerry? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He glanced back to where she stood next to Lily. \u201cWe have a history, a daughter together, and she was more than happy to come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I stared at his snowy shirt front with the gold and onyx studs I\u2019d given him one Christmas. I\u2019d saved for them for months. I felt a lump in my throat and more tears behind my eyes. Would this music ever end?</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be surprised, Gloriana. Clearly we are taking a break. I was just the last to know.\u201d Jerry stepped back. Music over. He strode away, his shoulders broad, his stride still that of a warrior.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have a crying jag here in the middle of Flo\u2019s wedding reception. I grabbed a glass of champagne, looked around and focused on the enormous wedding cake. The vamps wouldn\u2019t be eating it, but Flo had insisted on the tradition, and the shifters would make short work of it.</p><p>The band started a tango, Damian\u2019s favorite, and he and Diana swept onto the floor to the applause of the guests. Show-offs. Several other couples had also taken up the challenge.</p><p>\u201cDance?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my study of the bottom of my empty glass to meet Rafe\u2019s eyes. \u201cAre you kidding? Why would you even ask me after the way we left things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see an opportunity here. Blade\u2019s obviously moving on. Seems like that clears the way for you to do the same.\u201d Rafe nodded toward where Mara stood close to Jerry, her hands on his chest.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t deny I was tempted. The music was sensual and throbbed with desires barely leashed. I loved to dance and knew Rafe was a man with some moves, but . . . \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I smiled to take the sting out of my refusal. \u201cNot playing those games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d Rafe swung me into his arms until we were pressed together hip to hip, breast to hard chest. He grinned. \u201cBlade is patting his pockets like he\u2019s checking for a dagger to throw. At the very least we could make him jealous. I don\u2019t mind being used as long as I get to hold you like this.\u201d</p><p>Oh, his body felt good against mine. And I\u2019d never forget how we\u2019d been together. Neither would Alesa. She was trying to glue me to Rafe. Nope, not happening. I wasn\u2019t about to make a scene, but I also wasn\u2019t going to join the couples doing Latin dirty dancing in the center of the floor.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Rafe. I won\u2019t use you, and I\u2019m in a dress that\u2019s a few pins away from self-destructing.\u201d</p><p>He looked down and grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d He tucked a piece of fabric into my bra with a familiarity that was probably being duly noted across the room. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d I sighed and gently shoved him away. \u201cQuit acting loverlike and hit the buffet. I hear it\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stepped back, releasing everything but my hand. \u201cMight as well. It\u2019s clear I\u2019m wasting my time tonight. But, just so you know, I meant it when I said I\u2019m not giving up. No pressure. But I\u2019m here for you, Glory. Whatever you need, whenever you need it.\u201d Then he turned and strode away into the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Go after him. A dance with him would be as hot as the seventh level of hell.\u201d Alesa growled. \u201cI swear I\u2019m getting out my pitchfork again.\u201d She popped me with some heat.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, look at you. Pull yourself together.\u201d CiCi grabbed my arm before Alesa could push me after him. \u201cSeriously. Your bra is showing. Let me try to pin this back in order.\u201d She dragged me into the powder room and did what she could.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m having a hard time caring. Did you see who Jerry brought to the wedding, CiCi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMara.\u201d CiCi frowned. \u201cI have never liked that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taking dead aim at Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her. He watched you talk to the shifter. He was clearly jealous. You were smart to rub his nose in that relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been using Rafe.</p><p>\u201cHell Boy can take it. Get over it and go after him and dance this time.\u201d Alesa wasn\u2019t worried about a thing. I think the champagne had taken her edge off.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Glory. They\u2019re cutting the cake.\u201d CiCi pulled me toward the crowd again.</p><p>\u201cInteresting dress. How\u2019s my little devil tonight?\u201d Greg Kaplan held out two glasses of champagne.</p><p>I took one. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. I heard you\u2019ve got a demon thing going on. No wonder you\u2019re shooting the red eye and standing up to Simon.\u201d Greg sipped his champagne. \u201cI\u2019ve already texted my fearless leader about it. He\u2019s thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re nuts. No demon thing here.\u201d I drained my glass and felt a nice buzz. \u201cWho let you in, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEVs are catering. The champagne is one of our newest items. Rocks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Greg polished his off and signaled a waiter for more. \u201cJoin our crew, and you\u2019ll have unlimited access to these kinds of goodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Who told you about this fictional demon?\u201d I accepted yet another glass. Why not? It was a celebration of love. Flo had just cut the cake and smashed a bite into Richard\u2019s lips. Another precious moment for the photographer. Gag me. I couldn\u2019t believe this was me, not Alesa, being so cynical and uncaring. Then I saw Jerry laugh at something Mara said as they drank champagne together. Cozy. Nothing Alesa could do to me hurt like the pain of seeing the man I loved with another woman. I couldn\u2019t stand to watch and focused on Greg.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Aggie found out from Flo, who apparently did her best to stomp the bejesus out of the demon, which has taken up residence in her BFF.\u201d Greg winked. \u201cStill denying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Greg. Flo and Richard are about to take off. They\u2019re calling all singles to catch the bouquet or garter. You still single?\u201d I cast an eye over the eager women gathered near Flo. Mara was there, of course. And Aggie. Even Nadia, who\u2019d danced with Ray and made no secret of her claim on him. A few men had been dragged by Damian for the garter toss, Blade among them. Ray just leaned against the piano and drank some of Damian\u2019s blood with a kick. That worried me.</p><p>\u201cEternally. Never could see any reason to tie myself down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I polished off my drink. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better go over there and be a good sport for Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maid of honor.\u201d Greg winked. \u201cRemember. Simon wants you, and he always gets what he wants. He could even help you with your demon problem. Hook you up to the energy pump and give our goddess a new plaything.\u201d</p><p>Now that actually made me stop and think for a nanosecond. Alesa stayed quiet. Which made me think for another nanosecond.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Greg. Nothing could get me to hook up with anything or anyone\u201d\u2014I looked him up and down\u2014\u201cconnected to the EVs. Tell Simon to give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. He kills the messenger.\u201d Greg steered me toward the gathering ladies. \u201cDon\u2019t sell Simon short. Next time you\u2019re in your car, check the trunk. You won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Another gift? That bastard. He couldn\u2019t buy me. I wasn\u2019t going over to the dark side. Alesa torched me just then to show she wasn\u2019t happy with my goody-two-shoes attitude.</p><p>\u201cGlory, your face is red. Are you all right?\u201d Blade\u2019s daughter, Lily, took my arm.</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks. Just a little overheated.\u201d I patted her hand. Lily really didn\u2019t deserve her mother.</p><p>\u201cStill shagging the bodyguard, Gloriana?\u201d Mara, smiling of course, appeared next to her daughter. \u201cThank you. You finally got Jeremiah to see you for the slut you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo stake yourself, Mara.\u201d I faced Flo, who was waving her bouquet and trying to catch my eye. My poor friend had no clue of the meltdown I was trying desperately to avoid. \u201cJust because Jerry and I are done doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be satisfied with you.\u201d I smiled at Lily. \u201cSorry, sweetie, but your mother and I have issues.\u201d</p><p>Lily frowned at her mother. \u201cNo problem. Mother and I have issues too. Don\u2019t give up on Dad, Glory. You can work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, what is this?\u201d Mara plucked out a pin. \u201cAnd this?\u201d Before I could stop her, she\u2019d managed to pull out half a dozen critical pins. \u201cWhat did they have to do, put two dresses together to get one big enough to fit you?\u201d She laughed.</p><p>I growled and slapped a hand across my chest to keep up the fabric. Alesa offered a few choice suggestions along the lines of \u201ckill the bitch.\u201d Tempting.</p><p>\u201cLadies, get ready to catch the bouquet,\u201d the band leader announced, and there was a flourish and drums.</p><p>Flo had a good right arm, and the flowers sailed straight at me. I didn\u2019t want them but couldn\u2019t let them hit the ground. I reached up when Mara made a leap and snatched that bouquet out of midair. She landed next to me, the flowers clutched in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, looks like we have the next bride.\u201d The band broke into \u201cThe Wedding March.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d Mara said. She patted her small evening bag. \u201cGuess what I found next to Jeremiah\u2019s bed. A drug from Los Angeles that will allow us to see the sunrise together. I think I\u2019ll persuade Jeremiah to share it with me tonight after the wedding. It will be so romantic.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. What had she been doing in Jerry\u2019s bedroom? And how would she even know about the drug unless Jerry had told her?</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Lily steered me away from her mother. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019ll say anything to get together with Dad again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, well. I get it.\u201d Oh, did I get it. But maybe Jerry\u2019s mother had told Mara about the drug. And maybe Mara had sneaked into the bedroom. And maybe I was making excuses for Jerry. He might be perfectly happy to have a romantic evening with another woman. My head swam, and I held on to Lily.</p><p>\u201cSit, Glory, you don\u2019t look good.\u201d Lily helped me into a chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m fine. Too much champagne I guess.\u201d I saw Mara make a beeline for Blade and thrust the bouquet under his nose. He threw his arm around her and leaned close to listen, then laughed. Oh, but I hated her. And him. Yes, I\u2019d hurt him, but to zoom into her arms . . . What was he thinking? Hah. What was he thinking with?</p><p>\u201cLet her have him. Hell Boy is still ours.\u201d Alesa hiccupped. A drunk demon. Wasn\u2019t that a scary thought?</p><p>\u201cTime for the happy couple to leave on their honeymoon. You\u2019ll find bags of confetti on the tables. Let\u2019s send them off in a blizzard.\u201d</p> <p>Flo ran up and gave me a hug. \u201cTake care of yourself, Glory. Don\u2019t let that bitch worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich bitch? That one or the one inside me?\u201d I glanced at Mara, then down where I\u2019d shoved fabric into my bra again.</p><p>\u201cAny of them. I\u2019ll help you when we get back. We\u2019ll figure things out. I love you.\u201d Flo ran back to Richard, and we showered them with confetti in the shape of tiny bats. A clich\u00e9, but Flo couldn\u2019t talk Aggie and me into cutting out thousands of tiny fangs.</p><p>I sighed and looked around. The party was still going strong, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Everyone except me, that is. The band started to play a song I recognized, a romantic ballad I\u2019d considered my song with Jerry. We\u2019d had lots of those over the centuries, this was one of them. It was the slow kind, an excuse to make love on the dance floor, and we\u2019d danced to it not long ago.</p><p>The lights dimmed, then I saw Mara leading Jerry to the dance floor. No. She was stealing my life. Every bit of it. My man. My sunrise. Even my damned dance.</p><p>She glanced back at me over her shoulder, her smile so superior and so triumphant, I felt my own hellfire rise inside me. People around me gasped, and I knew my eyes had gone red. Jerry\u2019s horrified glare brought me down to earth, and I spun on my heel before I could let the fire fly.</p> <p>I had to get out of there. My dress was losing the battle, and I finally ripped it off in the parking lot. Not smart. My purse was upstairs, along with the clothes I\u2019d worn to Damian\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Rafe appeared out of the darkness, took off his coat and wrapped it around me. \u201cWhat now, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have flamed her. Roasted her where she stood.\u201d I sighed and leaned against my car.</p><p>\u201cWould have been a fine ending to the wedding, but I already warned you about the consequences of that so I\u2019m glad you restrained yourself.\u201d He put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cYou need me to go grab some things from upstairs?\u201d He tugged at the lapels of that jacket. \u201cOr do you want a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways taking care of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I pushed away from the car. \u201cThanks, Rafe. I mean it. But you\u2019re off the clock now, and there\u2019s an upstairs window open. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d I handed him his coat. I didn\u2019t wait to see his reaction, just shifted into a bird and, with a flutter of wings, headed up to get my things. It felt good. No man rescuing me, just Glory taking care of herself. That sense of purpose and fine feeling lasted until I managed to sneak out of the house again and out to my car. I drove out of the lot in a shower of gravel.</p><p>The tears I\u2019d been holding back hit me about a block away, and I had to pull over because I couldn\u2019t see to drive. I leaned against the steering wheel and let it all out\u2014the pain, the humiliation and the fury. Yes, I was mad at Jerry, but at myself too. What was up with this sleazy behavior? Sure, I\u2019d been attracted to Rafe, but it wasn\u2019t like me to jump into bed with a man unless Jerry and I were on a break. Alesa. This was all Alesa\u2019s fault.</p><p>I hit my chest. \u201cYou damned bitch. You turned me into an amoral hell-bound cheater. I could have had an affair with Rafe if I\u2019d just waited for Jerry to get back in town. Then I could have calmly sat down with him and told him I thought we needed to take a break. We\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Alesa cackled. \u201cThe man who just waved his little skinny bitch in your face tonight would have calmly accepted that you wanted a break? So you could bang your shifter roommate?\u201d Now Alesa was hitting high C with her laughter. \u201cHoney, do you really know this man?\u201d</p> <p>Okay, maybe the demon had a point. But sneaking around and doing the wild thing behind Jerry\u2019s back wasn\u2019t my style. If I was ever going to have a relationship with Jerry again, I was going to have to make that clear to him. I was the Glory he\u2019d known for years. The Glory he usually could trust. So what had changed? Oh, yeah. Demon on board.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, honey. And you\u2019ve had a hell of a ride, haven\u2019t you? Don\u2019t go telling me you\u2019re sorry for it. Rafe is a fine man, a great lover and has that demon thing going on.\u201d Alesa sighed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep him on a string, you\u2019re even dumber than you look, Blondie.\u201d</p><p>I finally pulled myself together and put the car in gear. I had serious work to do, not the least of which was to get rid of this damned demon once and for all. But how?</p><p>I spent the next forty-eight hours holed up in my apartment consoling myself with EV snacks left over from the bachelorette party and the case of Nadia\u2019s premium synthetic she\u2019d left as a thank-you. I didn\u2019t bother to get out of the granny gown I\u2019d put on for comfort or even brush my hair. There was a Lifetime movie marathon on TV, and the three-hanky sob stories suited my mood.</p><p>When the knock came on the door, I tried to ignore it, but Flo\u2019s voice shocked me off the couch. I flung open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you two were going to be gone for a couple of weeks. On your honeymoon.\u201d I stepped back as Flo pushed inside, followed by Richard.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you in this mess, mia amica. So I said to Ricardo that we must go to New Orleans, to a woman I know. She will tell us how to send this demon screaming back to hell, eh?\u201d Flo grabbed me and hugged me, then wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou are a mess. Go, clean up, get dressed. You are about to have company.\u201d</p><p>I held on to Flo\u2019s arm. \u201cBut what about this woman? Did she have the answer? Are we going to be able to get rid of Alesa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, vampire. In mine too. You think I like watching you pine away here like a lost little girl? Gag me. And you let Rafe just stroll off to work without so much as a good-bye kiss. Stupid.\u201d Alesa gave me a poke and some heat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. We\u2019re going to use the power of love.\u201d Flo began pulling things out of a tote bag Richard handed her. \u201cGo take a shower. Make yourself pretty. Everyone I could find who loves you will be here in fifteen minutes.\u201d Flo nodded toward the bathroom.</p><p>Everyone who loved me. That was a pretty short list. Was CiCi going to help again? Had Flo called Rafe to come back from the club? I\u2019d asked Rafe to look for a new place to live, so he wasn\u2019t exactly feeling the love right now. But he still seemed to care for me. He\u2019d even gone down to check my trunk for Simon\u2019s latest surprise. He\u2019d brought up three pairs of designer shoes that had made my eyes water. Oh, the EV king was diabolical. I\u2019d built a shrine to those shoes on my dresser.</p><p>Another exorcism. I knew this was probably one more wasted effort, but who could resist Flo when she was in top form? And I was desperate anyway. I allowed myself the tiniest glimmer of hope as I rushed through making myself presentable, slapping on makeup and pulling on a sweater in Blade\u2019s favorite blue. Talk about hope. Would he show up? Knowing Flo, she\u2019d called him, asked him to help poor pitiful Glory. Would four hundred years of history be enough to persuade him to help rid me of this demon?</p><p>Poor pitiful Glory would be pathetically grateful if he did agree to help. It would mean I hadn\u2019t killed every bit of the love we\u2019d once had. The power of love. One of the movies I\u2019d watched had proved it could do everything from cure disease to end wars. Maybe shoving out a demon wasn\u2019t such a stretch.</p><p>\u201cSentimental crap. Get a grip, Glory. In hell, we know it\u2019s lust that counts. Love is a useful tool that Heaven has sold for millennia. Saps fall for it, live and die for it. But it\u2019s all a fairy tale.\u201d Alesa laughed like a hyena. \u201cTell Flo to bring it on. This is going to be the biggest joke yet.\u201d</p><p>I dragged myself out to the living room, which had been transformed while I\u2019d been dressing. Red candles were everywhere, perfuming the air with the scent of roses. A tablecloth with a giant gold cupid covered the couch. Flo had draped a gold shawl with red hearts on it over her shoulders, and CiCi wore one too as she hugged me. Rafe arrived.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you out of that blanket you call a gown.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cShowered too. One more day and I was going to hose you down myself.\u201d</p><p>I socked him on the arm. \u201cI\u2019m allowed a little wallowing, aren\u2019t I? My heart is broken.\u201d</p><p>Alesa gagged. \u201cNo more TV for you unless it\u2019s a brutal action flick or porn.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door, and I saw Rafe stiffen. One whiff and I knew why. I hurried to throw open the door.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I smiled and stepped aside to let him in. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlorence told me we have a chance to rid you of this demon.

So many people love you. Viola said that for this to work, we must use all the love we can bring together. Friends, lovers.\u201d She ignored Jerry\u2019s growl and Rafe\u2019s move that had Richard suddenly standing between the two men. She covered my shoulders in a shawl like her own.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have found more of your friends, but I didn\u2019t think you wanted to close your shop. Lacy is working, and Erin didn\u2019t answer her phone.\u201d Flo shook her head. \u201cDamian should be here. I know he loves you like a brother, but he has disappeared again. Council business, I think.\u201d She settled a gaudy heart pendant over my head.</p> <p>\u201cGee, Flo, this isn\u2019t your usual fashion statement.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help noticing her own diamond and ruby heart pendant and matching earrings.</p><p>\u201cViola sold it to me. It has a secret compartment with special herbs inside. Ricardo, bring in the bags from the kitchen.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t know, but she did a ceremony. Powerful stuff to a goddess. Put it next to your own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorence, are you sure about this?\u201d Richard was back and handed Flo two bags of Cheetos.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Flo?\u201d I gasped as she ripped open the bags and started flinging Cheetos into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou love these things. Am I right?\u201d Flo scattered cheese puffs on the floor around me. \u201cWe have the people, the things, and we will have the music. Before we are done, that demon bitch will think she is one inch away from the heavenly gates. She will run straight down to hell to get away from such a lovefest.\u201d Flo beamed at me.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you your bud there is nuttier than the snack aisle at Wally World?\u201d Alesa snickered. \u201cNice shoes, though.\u201d</p><p>I looked down. Sure enough, Flo\u2019s red pumps had hearts on them.</p><p>\u201cFreddy and Derek would be here, but they\u2019d already left for Houston. A little road trip.\u201d CiCi squeezed my hand. \u201cBut you know they love you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, CiCi, thanks for coming.\u201d I smiled at Flo and Richard. \u201cYou two are amazing, breaking up your honeymoon for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo would not go with me to see Viola.\u201d Flo sniffed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo.\u201d Richard held a Bible. \u201cI\u2019ll go along with this because of the love angle, but if Flo brings out a doll with stick pins, I\u2019m out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRicardo, you are stereotyping. Shame on you.\u201d Flo pulled a CD from the tote and stuck it in the player. \u201cNow we need to surround Glory with love. Rafael, you will hold one of her hands.\u201d</p><p>Rafe had been ominously quiet since Jerry had come into the room. Now he grabbed my hand, his stare warning Jerry not to try to interfere.</p><p>\u201cOf course I love Glory, she knows that.\u201d He plucked one of the Cheetos out of my hair with his other hand. \u201cI would do anything to keep her from getting hurt. Anything.\u201d His eyes swept over Jerry, eyes hard with the promise of dire consequences if Jerry did anything else to cause me pain.</p><p>\u201cPerfetto.\u201d Flo beamed and pulled a silent Jerry to my other side. \u201cAnd you, Jeremiah, will hold her other hand. You did tell me that you still love our Glory. Am I right?\u201d Her eyes darted from me to Jerry, and she licked her lips. Flo? Nervous?</p><p>\u201cI think Gloriana knows that I have always loved her. Some centuries more than others.\u201d Jerry gripped my hand and looked down at me.</p><p>My eyes filled with tears. \u201cJerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever necessary to keep her safe from the fires of hell and their spawn.\u201d He gave Rafe the force of his gaze now, then looked at Flo. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Ricardo, you put your hand on Glory\u2019s shoulder, just there, and use the Bible, it cannot hurt.\u201d Flo bustled around, placing CiCi and deciding where she would stand. Then she picked up the remote so she could turn on the CD player.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so lame it isn\u2019t funny.\u201d Alesa cackled. \u201c\u2018I am your lady\u2019? Yeah, right. Which man is it, Glory? You\u2019ve got two to choose from. Of course you know I\u2019d keep both.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t listening to her. I was letting the music and the warmth from the bodies around me heal my wounded soul. Celine Dion\u2019s pure voice soared, and I looked at Flo. How had I ever found such a loyal friend? Her eyes were damp. And her husband beside her? He murmured prayers for me, crossing himself as he prayed. They believed in my goodness even when I wasn\u2019t so sure I had any decency left in me.</p><p>I turned to Rafe. He stared at me, willing me to look at him. I sent him a mental message that I did love him, as a friend that I would always treasure. He got it. He realized he could either have me as a friend or distance himself. But the lover thing wasn\u2019t going to work for us. I saw a flash of his pain before he quickly hid it behind a firm jaw and a solemn expression. I wondered if he believed me. So far he\u2019d been in denial, sure he could still win me away from Jerry.</p><p>Jerry. I sighed and turned to him. As if he sensed my gaze, he stared down at me. So much between us. He was easy to read after all our years together. I asked him in my mind if he was with Mara now. He let me know he\u2019d sent her on her way, sorry that he\u2019d used her to hurt me. I could almost pity Mara. Almost. I sent Jerry yet another apology, yet another groveling message asking for another chance. Silence.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take words to know that Jerry wasn\u2019t ready to forgive me yet, that the pain was too fresh and the wound to his pride too deep. The miracle was that he still seemed to love me, even when I wasn\u2019t very lovable. He\u2019d proved it by coming here and clasping my hand in his.</p><p>The music was reaching a crescendo. \u201cI am your lady and you are my man.\u201d I let the truth of that message show in my eyes as I kept staring at Jerry. The power of love. Hands on me were warm with it as love poured into me. The heart amulet heated against my breast, and Alesa screamed.</p><p>\u201cLucifer, save me! I can\u2019t stand this!\u201d She sobbed, and I felt her writhe inside me. I gasped at the pain, and the amulet got hotter. I tightened my hold on Jerry and Rafe, and the others gripped my shoulders as if sensing that something was finally happening. It was all I could do to stand as Alesa kicked and clawed, vile curses making my ears ring and my head pound.</p><p>Clear notes shimmered in the air as Celine came to her soaring conclusion. I shivered as I felt a chill, so welcome after weeks of hellish heat.</p><p>Alesa wailed and sobbed. \u201cLucifer, by all the fires of the damned, if you ever cared for me, get me the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, with a rippling tear that almost knocked me to my knees, I was free. I knew it. I felt empty, wonderfully, totally empty. Nobody home but Glory. The last notes faded away. Flo hit the off button on the remote, and everyone stared at me.</p><p>\u201cGloriana?\u201d Jerry drew me toward him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak for a moment, gasping as I leaned against him. Finally I looked up and touched the now cool amulet between my breasts.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone, Jerry. We finally did it. We drove Alesa out with the power of love.\u201d I laughed and hugged him, then Flo grabbed me.</p><p>\u201cYou did it, Flo. You are a genius, a hero!\u201d I hugged her, and we both shed a few tears. There was laughter and more hugs all around before I collapsed on the couch, suddenly completely drained.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you need to rest. Obviously this was hard on you.\u201d Flo shooed CiCi toward the door, dragging Richard with her. \u201cWe have left a mess, I\u2019m afraid, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll clean it later. Totally worth it.\u201d I smiled at Flo and threw her a kiss. There were crushed Cheetos everywhere, and the place reeked of roses and smoke since Flo had blown out the candles. I could deal with that. I was so relieved to be rid of Alesa, I felt giddy if weak in the knees.</p><p>\u201cI still say it wouldn\u2019t have worked without the Bible and the prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Richard.\u201d I sighed and leaned back. \u201cGod\u2019s love is powerful too. Am I right, Flo?\u201d I sent her a mental message to be smart.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Flo kissed Richard\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re going to our real honeymoon now. See you in a few weeks.\u201d She glanced at Rafe, who\u2019d stepped over to the couch and put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cRafael, you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be at the club if you need me, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks, Rafe.\u201d I smiled at him and squeezed his hand.</p><p>Rafe gave Blade a warning look, then followed them out the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving too?\u201d I saw Jerry lean next to that door as if he was thinking about it. \u201cI wish you would stay. As a friend. I still feel a little shaky. What if she comes back?\u201d</p><p>He shut the door and walked over to sit beside me on the couch. \u201cWhat did she say when she left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called on Lucifer to get her the hell out of me.\u201d I smiled. \u201cFlo was right. The lovefest was too much for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019d better make sure you keep that love alive, then.\u201d Jerry picked up my hand. \u201cThis is hard for me, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Jerry, I know. I am so, so sorry. And grateful that you came tonight. I know you probably didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away. I\u2019d never see you hurt, no matter how you hurt me.\u201d He squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me. Mara at the wedding?\u201d I got up and walked over to my DVD player.</p><p>\u201cA flesh wound only. Now if I\u2019d shagged her ...\u201d He watched me sift through my movies.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d I held up a DVD.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have blamed you if you did.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI know that what I did was wrong. I admit I love Rafe, as a friend. And that I\u2019ve been attracted to him.\u201d</p><p>I saw Jerry frown, his body stiffen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust listen, please. I have to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening. Can\u2019t say I like what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to clear the air. Tell the truth.\u201d I faced him, my hands behind my back. \u201cI\u2019ve been attracted to Rafe, but I know you and I have a relationship, an exclusive relationship. Then this demon got inside me, and somehow I lost control.\u201d I held up my hand when Jerry started to speak. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to say the Devil made me do it. I\u2019m the one who decided to sneak around and, as Mara said, \u2018shag the bodyguard.\u2019\u201d I winced when I saw Jerry\u2019s expression harden. \u201cBut, Jerry, I can\u2019t believe that was normal Glory behavior. Sure, Rafe is hot. And sure, Rafe made moves, but I usually have some resistance. And the ability to remain true to the man I love.\u201d</p> <p>I shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cThat demon inside me did something to me, always whispering in my ear, urging me on. And I was on fire for any guy I saw. Honestly?\u201d I looked Jerry up and down. \u201cI wish you\u2019d been here so you could have had the benefit of those hormonal surges or whatever the hell they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Glory, I don\u2019t think I can listen to much more of this.\u201d Jerry leaned forward, his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much more.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cI know it\u2019s going to take a while for you to get over this. To forget what I did. To forgive what I did. But while you\u2019re working through it, can we declare a truce?\u201d</p><p>Jerry stared at me for a long few minutes, his dark eyes giving away none of his thoughts. I held my breath, wondering whether he was going to walk out the door and out of my life or give us another chance. Finally, finally, he leaned back and stretched out his long legs, propping his boots on my coffee table.</p><p>\u201cA truce, you say. Depends. What movie are you holding there? Not one of those English things with country houses and men forever taking tea, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBraveheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well. Truce it is, then.\u201d Jerry smiled and patted the seat next to him. \u201cWill there be benefits with this truce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to work out the terms, won\u2019t we?\u201d I put in the film and settled beside him.</p><p>\u201cGuess we will, lass. Guess we will.\u201d</p><p>I handed him the remote. I knew my guy. </p> </body></html>"]
