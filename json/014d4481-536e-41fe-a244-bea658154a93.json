Her mind blanked. She\u2019d been so outraged. She\u2019d mustered up an angry speech, repeating it with increasing gusto on the car drive over. But apparently all it took was this lone example of magnificent male tushery to make her go dumb.</p><p>The ladder squeaked as the man shifted and looked down, and Laura caught sight of just whose ruggedly handsome face was attached to said magnificence.</p><p>She felt every muscle in her body stiffen. It was a Jessup. She was allergic to Jessups. Eddie Jessup, to be precise. The worst and most allergenic of them all.</p> <p>He smiled broadly. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Her morning hadn\u2019t started bad like this. It\u2019d started pretty great, actually, helping out with a bustling breakfast crowd. Her family\u2019s business was booming\u2014visitors to the Big Bear Lodge were up, which meant diners aplenty at the tavern, and she was riding high as the new manager overseeing it all.</p><p>Over the past several months, she\u2019d thrown herself into her work. When her sister discovered a cache of letters dating from the gold rush era, Laura had used her expertise and Bay Area contacts to capitalize on the find. They\u2019d begun to get a little press, not to mention visits by some tweedy historical types. Which meant even more visitors and more success for their family lodge.</p><p>But not if Eddie Jessup and his cursed Jessup Brothers Construction were doing what she\u2019d heard they were doing.</p><p>It was a clear June day, and she shielded her eyes against the glare, watching as he climbed down the ladder. She was definitely not noticing the way his white T-shirt clung in places under the hot sun.</p> <p>\u201cYou got something to say, or did you just come to ogle?\u201d</p><p>That broke her silence. \u201cI\u2019ve got better things to do than ogle you, Eddie Jessup.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the easy confidence of it made her cheeks burn. She shot her eyes down, making like she needed to check a text on her cell phone.</p><p>He jumped from the last few rungs, dusted off his hands, and faced her with a smile. \u201cWell, darlin\u2019? To what do I owe the honor?\u201d</p><p>This particular Jessup had been getting under her skin since high school, but she was past that now. Back then, she\u2019d looked only ahead, longing for the day she could hightail it out of Sierra Falls. Somehow Eddie had sensed it, and he\u2019d upped his torment, always coaxing, teasing, and challenging her. It was a habit he\u2019d never gotten over.</p><p>But she was over it. Big-time.</p> <p>In fact, she liked to consider herself Jessup-proof. She was a college-educated, formerly incredibly successful Silicon Valley marketing professional who\u2019d moved back home as a full-grown woman simply to get some perspective. She wanted only a change of scenery. No men\u2014Jessup or otherwise.</p><p>She\u2019d sworn off dating, just as she\u2019d sworn off her old life in the city. She had an ex-fianc\u00e9 she didn\u2019t miss and an old job she\u2019d pushed from her mind, and yet she\u2019d once spent so much time chasing both. But why and for what?</p><p>She\u2019d come home to figure out the answers. To determine what it was she wanted from life, what made her happy. Because she\u2019d learned the hard way that a man and a successful career didn\u2019t always go together in harmony.</p><p>She reminded herself that she was self-assured. Self-reliant. Self-made. She put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not your darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an assessing look. \u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to adjust her clothes under the intensity of that stare. \u201cSo don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He\u2019d said it with mock gravity, touching a finger to an imaginary hat. Before she could demand that he not ma\u2019am her, either, he continued, \u201cSo what would bring a fine, not-your-darlin\u2019 city girl like you to a construction site? Because I can see on that pretty face of yours\u2014you\u2019ve got something to say.\u201d</p><p>Fine...pretty. She refused to register the comments. Eddie probably spoke like that to every female within a ten-mile radius. And what had she come to say? It was in her brain somewhere.</p> <p>It took a moment for the arguments she\u2019d rehearsed in the car to shoot to the forefront of her mind, but then she demanded, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He got an innocent look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m fixing a storm drain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. I mean, what are you doing?\u201d She swept her arm, taking in the abandoned house and surrounding ranch property. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He met her eyes, and for once he looked serious. \u201cYou heard the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard about your Golden Slumbers Ranchlandia.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s Sleepy Hills Resort and Spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She waved an impatient hand. \u201cSounds like a cemetery to me. Fitting, seeing as you\u2019re about to bury the Bailey family business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no intention of burying your business,\u201d he said, his tone annoyingly kind. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for the whole town. Fairview Properties contracted the Jessups. We buy our supplies from Tom\u2019s hardware store. Soon we\u2019ll hire local workers. Workers who\u2019ll then go eat at your tavern. An influx of money all around.\u201d</p><p>She tapped a finger on her chin. \u201cAnd hmm...let\u2019s see. Who do you think the big winners are in this whole thing? Fairview, that\u2019s who. Because apparently they can just go wherever they want and install their giant resorts, meanwhile mowing down whatever stands in their way.\u201d Mowing down her family\u2019s lodge. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, another Trump Tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Laura. I\u2019m not the bad guy here.\u201d</p><p>His soothing tone had the opposite effect on her\u2014it always did\u2014and she stabbed her finger into his chest. \u201cHow about we kick the Kidd sisters out of their house and turn it into a Holiday Inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody was kicked out. You know full well how those dot-com people abandoned this place for a swanky Sausalito condo years ago. It\u2019ll be good to fix it up.\u201d He took and held her finger, giving it a soft squeeze. \u201cLook, Laura. I run a small business. We\u2019re working hard to get by, just like the rest of the town. We\u2019ve got to take our jobs as we get them.\u201d Eddie\u2019s hand was callused, and warm, and aggravatingly gentle.</p><p>She pulled her finger free. \u201cHow about our business? The lodge will never be able to compete with this.\u201d She glared at the traditional ranch house. It was a rambling one-story affair, with several timber beams in need of patching, and electrical and plumbing systems that probably needed replacing. \u201cIt\u2019s a dump, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing the Jessup boys can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you get overrun by raccoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d He stood behind her, putting his hands on her shoulders, staring at the property with her. \u201cLook, you see the size of the place. It\u2019s smaller than a regular hotel. The Fairview guys want it to be a boutique spa resort. High-end, aimed at people who like to think they hike but wouldn\u2019t know a day pack from a day planner.\u201d He gave her shoulders a squeeze. \u201cBut you guys, your lodge is authentic. Tourists will always love it. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, stepping away before he had a chance to reach out and touch her again. The last time a man had told her you\u2019ll be fine, she\u2019d ended up losing her job. \u201cEternal Slumbers here could put us out of business, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s face fell. His expression looked like he was genuinely considering it, and she didn\u2019t trust it for an instant. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get back into that ridiculous vehicle of yours, and call Fairview, and send them back to wherever it is they came from. Then they can go menace some other small town instead, and you can slide back under whatever rock you crawled from.\u201d</p><p>Instead of rising to the bait, he smiled an exasperating smile. \u201cNot a fan of the pickup, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re compensating.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cLook, Laura. I\u2019m sorry. I really am. But if we hadn\u2019t been the ones hired for the job, it would\u2019ve been someone else. Probably some out-of-town development company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they would\u2019ve needed a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d He checked his watch, looking distracted.</p><p>\u201cAm I boring you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot up, and he gave her that cocky grin she hated. \u201cNever you. I\u2019ve gotta run, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the bars opening soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me better than that,\u201d he said, sounding oddly serious.</p><p>\u201cWell, what if I\u2019m not done talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we can take it up later,\u201d he said suggestively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re maddening.\u201d She stormed past him, back to her car. He probably had a mistress out there waiting for him. Some noontime booty call.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really be angry,\u201d he said, following her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d No matter how quickly she walked, his long strides kept up.</p><p>\u201cI really believe this\u2019ll be good for the town. More rooms can accommodate more visitors. More visitors means more diners\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me.\u201d She hopped into a half jog, annoyed that he was following, and without so much as breaking a sweat. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop you.\u201d</p><p>He slowed, and if she didn\u2019t know his type better, she\u2019d have thought she heard actual sympathy in his voice. \u201cCome on, Laura. Let\u2019s discuss this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d messed up a job before, and she wouldn\u2019t fail again. She would show her family that she could be trusted with the business. Better than that, she\u2019d be more successful than they\u2019d ever dreamed. Which meant she needed to stop Fairview Properties from building a competing hotel. And it all began with Eddie.</p><p>She flung open the door to her little BMW sedan. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be back all right. I\u2019m about to become your worst nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Eddie watched Laura drive away. When she\u2019d first arrived, silently assessing him, he\u2019d had a moment\u2019s fantasy that maybe she\u2019d come to see him. That maybe he could take her hand, haul her into the empty house, and have her in one of the many thousands of ways he\u2019d fantasized about since their high school days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Laura Bailey wasn\u2019t for having. She was cold and prickly and focused on only one thing: herself.</p><p>But she was also smart and funny, always surprising him, catching him off guard since they\u2019d been kids. And now she\u2019d grown up so fine, into this sexy woman with a tight-as-hell body that taunted him.</p><p>He scraped his hand through his hair, cooling the dampness. Where the hell had those Sierra breezes gone?</p> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered. It wasn\u2019t just that sexy tank top with the pink bra straps peeping out that had him bothered. What she\u2019d said niggled at the back of his mind. Would the Sleepy Hills project put the Big Bear Lodge under? He had no doubts that a big conglomerate like Fairview would happily watch as they drove a family-owned enterprise out of business.</p><p>But then again, Laura was probably just being Laura. Needing to be in control. The Expert. Truth of it was, they needed this\u2014the future of his own family business was at stake. This job brought Jessup Brothers Construction onto the brink of something bigger. They could continue as they\u2019d been, doing handyman work and the occasional bigger job around Sierra Falls, or they could grow into the construction company developers called to build things in Silver City, or Reno even.</p><p>His cell buzzed, pulling him from his thoughts. He looked at the screen. It was Hunter Fox, aka Mister Fairview himself. He wasn\u2019t the CEO, but he was close\u2014he was the one who\u2019d contracted Jessup Brothers Construction in the first place. Hunter was the man who signed Eddie\u2019s paychecks, and in this economy, that was all that mattered.</p><p>Eddie wandered under the awning to take the call. Sierra days never got too hot, but it was a clear June afternoon, and hard work, the hot sun\u2014and one hot Bailey sister\u2014had him eager to seek out a shady breeze. \u201cMister Fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie,\u201d a jovial voice greeted him. Hunter Fox might have been built like a refrigerator, but he was probably greasy enough to slip through the eye of a keyhole. \u201cI\u2019ve told you a thousand times, it\u2019s Hunter. Fairview might be a big company, but we\u2019ve got small-town spirit. That\u2019s why I hired you boys.\u201d</p> <p>Sure it was. Sure, it had nothing to do with the fact that a town as close-knit as Sierra Falls would look skeptically at a bunch of strangers coming in and bulldozing their land.</p><p>But Eddie wasn\u2019t stupid enough to say any of that. He might\u2019ve sometimes played up that good-old-boy vibe, but it was because it made work easier\u2014it was what people expected of him.</p><p>People. He blew out a sigh. People underestimated him. People like Laura. What was the word she liked to call him...Neanderthal? She saw him as nothing more than a hick in a red truck, ready for Miller time. It\u2019d gotten to the point where it was easier just to let her believe that clich\u00e9d idea of him. It was all she was willing to see, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Eddie said with forced ease. He\u2019d rely on the easygoing good-guy voice for the Fairview suits, too. \u201cThe Jessups welcome Fairview to Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, young man, when are we gonna break ground?\u201d</p><p>Ah, the royal we. But Eddie knew how to play the game, and it was time to get his head in it. \u201cI\u2019m here now, taking a look around the property. She\u2019s an old girl, this ranch house, but nothing we Jessups can\u2019t handle. Outside is mostly cosmetic stuff\u2014weather, wear and tear, that sort of thing. But the rest of it\u201d\u2014he stepped inside to get a better look\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll need to go down to the studs. Replace the old plumbing with copper. And then there\u2019s the electric. She\u2019s still got the old knob-and-tube wiring that\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling,\u201d Hunter interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s been a slight change in plans.\u201d</p><p>Eddie went on alert. \u201cWhat sort of change?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s rolling laugh reached him over the cell. \u201cDon\u2019t get scared off, Edward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d It was Edwin, but Eddie never told anyone that. He was sure it was a fine name for some other guy, but he was just plain Eddie. The last person to call him Edwin had been his kindergarten teacher, and even then, he\u2019d so hated it, the epic silent treatment he\u2019d given the woman had made it just Eddie ever since. Only his family knew, and his brothers understood that spilling the beans brought with it pain of death. \u201cJessups don\u2019t scare easy, so all due respect, just spit it out, sir.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed again, only this time it had a canny edge to it. \u201cI get it. You\u2019ve got mettle. I like that. So I\u2019ll shoot straight. With the town\u2019s proximity to Sacramento and the Bay Area, we need to be thinking bigger. There are a lot of deep pockets in San Francisco. Those city folk do like their mud baths and salt scrubs.\u201d</p><p>Eddie bristled at the man\u2019s folksy way of talking\u2014it was too contrived\u2014but he played along nonetheless. \u201cBigger, sure. We can think bigger.\u201d Here came the trickiest part of his job: translating client-speak. \u201cBut...bigger how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPop on another story. Add a solarium. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Solarium? He nudged a loose floorboard with his boot. Damned if Laura\u2019s concerns didn\u2019t jump back into his head. \u201cI thought you wanted a traditional ranch house. Boutique spa experience\u2014weren\u2019t those your words? Boutiques and ranch properties tend to be single stories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSingle story. Did I hear you right, Edward?\u201d</p><p>Edwin. \u201cEdward\u201d was a teenybopper vampire.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. You wanted an authentic ranch experience.\u201d He stepped outside to look at the fa\u00e7ade. It was an old building, dating to the late 1800s. Hell, it was probably on some historical register somewhere. And even though it had only one floor, it wasn\u2019t short on space. \u201cI think we can expand, while keeping to the original spirit of the plan.\u201d I think we can do this without crushing the Baileys in the process. \u201cThis place is sprawling, as is. Adding another floor will double the work time. Change your bottom line. We\u2019ll need a whole new set of plans. And the engineer will need to come back out, recheck the foundation, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had our architect do up another set of drawings. Permits are a go.\u201d There was a moment\u2019s silence on the other end of the line. \u201cMy only obstacle now is you. Are you able to do the work?\u201d</p><p>Life shot into his veins. \u201cOf course we can do the work.\u201d They couldn\u2019t lose this job. Not only did they need the money, but he was sure Fairview could have some big-city builder out tomorrow, razing the building to the ground, and probably for twice the money. \u201cI just want to make sure I understand what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want, Edward, is to be the destination resort of the Sierra Nevada.\u201d</p><p>Those grand words were echoing in Eddie\u2019s mind as he hopped into his truck. His family business needed to prosper. He could be responsible and do the work without crushing the rest of Sierra Falls in the process. He and his brother were the best men for the job\u2014in fact, it was a boon that they had the work and not some uncaring out-of-town operation.</p><p>A new hotel wouldn\u2019t put Bear out of business\u2014his lodge was only so big, anyway, able to take in only so many visitors. Besides, a big-time resort and spa might attract even more tourists to the lodge and tavern. Not that he\u2019d ever say any of that to Laura. Not that he\u2019d even try.</p><p>He was being a smart businessman. He wasn\u2019t being a jerk.</p><p>So why\u2019d he feel like one?</p><p>Eddie revved the engine and took off to his favorite trailhead. Nothing like a hilly run to clear the mind of everything\u2014and everyone.</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cI need to look at the registry,\u201d Laura said before the Town Hall door had even clicked shut. She\u2019d been sitting in her car, waiting. The place wasn\u2019t exactly run like a Swiss watch and was open only according to a bewildering schedule of bimonthly evening meetings, alternate Tuesday mornings, first and third Monday and Wednesday afternoons, and whichever Friday hours the community volunteers could make.</p><p>She eyed those two volunteers now: Ruby and Pearl Kidd, the elderly doyennes of Sierra Falls. They\u2019d been in the process of settling in for the day when she\u2019d burst in. They gaped at her, looking alarmingly startled by her sudden appearance.</p><p>What was wrong with her? The Kidd sisters were in their eighties. Laura wanted information, not heart attacks.</p><p>She took a deep breath to steady herself. She wasn\u2019t in the city anymore, and sudden was not the way to get things done around Sierra Falls. \u201cI mean, hi,\u201d she said, smiling and trying not to look quite so much like a madwoman. \u201cHow are things with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as exciting as it seems to be for you, I fear.\u201d Ruby took Pearl\u2019s purse to stash with the rest of their things beneath the reception desk.</p><p>Pearl\u2019s eyes were a little more judgmental when she said, \u201cI know Edith taught you better manners than that, dear.\u201d They were both spinsters who\u2019d been raised by a fire-and-brimstone father and didn\u2019t hold back when it came to sharp-tongued censure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she replied with a sigh. \u201cI apologize. It\u2019s just...I\u2019m a little...upset.\u201d She suddenly felt choked up in front of these two women she\u2019d grown up with, and she gritted her teeth. She was an adult now, taking charge. Take-charge women didn\u2019t break down.</p><p>But Ruby sensed it and told her gently, \u201cSit for a while.\u201d</p><p>Laura was pressed for time but decided that taking a minute would be a necessary means to an end. Pearl began to teeter to standing, but she beat the woman to it, hopping up and grabbing an old ladder-back chair from the corner.</p><p>Pearl smiled and patted her hand. \u201cTell us what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>She dove right in. \u201cHave you heard what the Jessups are doing to the old ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ranch?\u201d Pearl directed the question at her sister instead of to Laura.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll mean that old place on Timber Creek, I imagine.\u201d Ruby\u2019s voice wavered with age.</p><p>Pearl\u2019s eyes widened with recognition. \u201cThe old Wexler homestead?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that who\u2014\u201d Laura began.</p><p>\u201cThose Interweb people let it go to pot,\u201d Ruby interrupted, and both sisters scowled with distaste and mistrust.</p><p>\u201cThey bought it and then just left it with a never-you-mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard they paid cash.\u201d</p><p>Laura scooted forward in her chair. \u201cThe thing is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s abandoned.\u201d Pearl shook her head in dismay.</p><p>\u201cAll sorts of critters running around in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame.\u201d Pearl tsked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll attract drifters, if they\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Laura just decided to let the women\u2019s conversation peter out.</p><p>Ruby was the first to bring her attention back. \u201cWhat are our grandnephews up to, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got plans to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do hope they fix it up,\u201d Pearl said brightly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good at that.

They have their own business, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre they going to fix it?\u201d Pearl asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow drifters into Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I came to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr vagrants,\u201d Ruby said with a gasp under her breath.</p><p>\u201cA big hotel hired them,\u201d Laura interjected quickly and loudly. She was trying to keep her cool, but she felt like she\u2019d burst from frustration.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that exciting?\u201d Pearl cooed. \u201cBig-city types coming all the way out here to vacation.\u201d</p><p>Ruby agreed. \u201cExciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Laura snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s not exciting.\u201d She softened her tone. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say. I mean, tourists are good, but they\u2019re going to put our lodge out of business.\u201d</p><p>The ladies\u2019 expressions grew grim. \u201cOhh,\u201d they said in tandem.</p> <p>Ruby wrung her hands. \u201cSurely our boys don\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d</p><p>Laura breathed a quick sigh. They\u2019d finally heard her. \u201cWhether they mean to or not, it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Pearl frowned and looked at Ruby as she said, \u201cOur Eddie and Jack would never try to put Bear out of business.\u201d</p><p>Laura sensed their bias wavering and was quick to amend, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t, no, of course not. But this big corporation is powerful\u2014they\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll put us under. They\u2019re making it a resort and could add, well, anything. A pool, greenhouse, gym, spa...\u201d She racked her brain for what might most horrify ladies of the historical society. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be new, modern construction. All steel and glass.\u201d</p><p>That got the sisters, and they frowned, aghast.</p><p>\u201cHow can we help?\u201d Pearl asked.</p><p>\u201cThe historical society keeps the town records, right?\u201d At their nod, Laura continued, \u201cI thought maybe if the ranch was on the registry, we could halt construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe registry?\u201d Pearl asked Ruby.</p><p>Ruby looked to Laura. \u201cWhich registry?\u201d</p><p>She forced a calm smile. Patience. \u201cYou know, the historic registry.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on their faces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. That ranch is old, but it\u2019s not historic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, could you check maybe?\u201d Laura\u2019s jaw was beginning to ache from forcing the pleasant smile.</p><p>The sisters disappeared into the records room, and she fought her impatience. She really should\u2019ve been home, working. Discreetly, she checked the time on her phone. She could make a call to the California Historical Society\u2014that was where she should\u2019ve started, not here.</p><p>Just as she began to debate whether it\u2019d be rude to find the number while she waited, the women reemerged with a tattered manila folder.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Laura shoved her cell back in her purse. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe records were pulled recently.\u201d Ruby settled back in her chair and began to riffle through the stacks of paper. There were yellowed photographs, old survey maps, and notes on scraps from a steno pad that looked to be older than Laura.</p><p>She felt a knot in her shoulders begin to release. \u201cSo it is on the registry.\u201d</p><p>Pearl reached over her sister\u2019s shoulder and plucked a fresher-looking page from the pile. She shook her head, tsking. \u201cAdaptive reuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She scooted to the edge of her chair to get a look at the paper in Pearl\u2019s hand. It was on Fairview letterhead and bore an official-looking stamp with a signature scrawled over the blurred purple ink. \u201cWhat do you mean? What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fight that,\u201d Ruby said.</p><p>Pearl nodded. \u201cHappened in South Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old Valhalla boathouse.\u201d</p><p>Laura interjected, \u201cWhat did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear they put on shows there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Laura looked from one to the other. \u201cWhat shows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlays, dear. In South Lake. One of these days we\u2019ll get out there.\u201d</p><p>The sisters shared a smile. \u201cEmerald would\u2019ve loved to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about South Lake,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>Pearl\u2019s eyes got misty. \u201cThere\u2019s no tomorrow. Only today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and think of our Emmy.\u201d Ruby reached over and patted her sister\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is adaptive reuse?\u201d Laura\u2019s voice came out louder than she\u2019d anticipated, and the older women flinched.</p><p>Ruby sat up rigidly, looking offended by the interruption. \u201cYour ranch is historic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ve got a permit,\u201d Pearl added, beginning another back-and-forth between sisters.</p><p>\u201cAdaptive reuse they call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the builders keep the character of the building\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they can change it and use it for something else.\u201d</p><p>Dead end. Laura\u2019s throat tightened, and she went into autopilot, thanking the women, wishing them well, inviting them out to the tavern, all the while barely holding herself together.</p><p>This was it. Failure. Again. There\u2019d be no fighting it.</p><p>She was halfway out the door, convulsively swallowing back the emotion, when she felt a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cWait, dear.\u201d It was Pearl. \u201cIf there are any problems with the permit, any problems at all,\u201d she added meaningfully, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to go back to square one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She looked from Pearl to Ruby, who\u2019d appeared at her shoulder. \u201cAre there problems with the permit?\u201d</p><p>The other sister leaned in, a conspiratorial gleam in her eyes, and whispered, \u201cMake our boys double-check the property lines.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>It was the annual Fourth of July bash, and Laura should\u2019ve been excited. This year, the Baileys had been hired to cater. This year, it was the Big Bear Lodge that was hosting the chili cook-off, with the Thirsty Bear Tavern providing bottles of beer, soda, and water from several ice chests they\u2019d set up under a tent. Her sister, Sorrow, was a master of comfort foods like four-cheese mac and cheese, grilled corn on the cob, and homemade apple pie. The mouthwatering food was bringing in hungry revelers\u2014and with hungry revelers came cash. Lots of it.</p><p>She smoothed some of that cash, shoving the growing pile of ones into the cash box.</p><p>No, Laura should\u2019ve been happy, but instead all she could do was think about how next year, it\u2019d probably be Fairview setting up shop on the picnic grounds. Their tent would be giant, some air-conditioned outdoor pavilion that\u2019d dwarf the Bailey family setup and draw all their patrons, too.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Laura,\u201d said the kid in front of her, and she tuned in to see the line that\u2019d appeared in the several seconds it\u2019d taken for her to zone out. \u201cCome in, Laura,\u201d his small, dirt-encrusted companion shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Helen\u2019s kids, right?\u201d She handed the older one a few bottles of water and took his money with narrowed eyes. \u201cOkay, smarty-pants. Just because your mom works at the tavern doesn\u2019t mean you can sass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little help here?\u201d Sorrow said from behind her. She was balancing a foil-covered tray of corn, hot off the grill, and a handful of cold beers, the bottles sweating with condensation. \u201cI\u2019m losing it.\u201d</p><p>Billy swept into the tent, snagging the bottles and hot tray before it all crashed to the dirt. \u201cThat\u2019s what fianc\u00e9s are for.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow wiped her hands on her shorts, a broad grin instantly brightening her face. \u201cHey, Sheriff. Where\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sensed a maiden in peril.\u201d He peeked under the foil and smiled. \u201cI thought Sierra Falls was all about barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we serve at the spring festival,\u201d Laura said distractedly. Though next year, Fairview would probably have something fancy, like...quiches or something.</p><p>Sorrow tucked the foil back in place. \u201cFor Independence Day, it\u2019s all chili, all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, if you\u2019re the one working the magic, it\u2019s all good.\u201d He planted a firm kiss on Sorrow\u2019s cheek and a loving pat on her rump.</p><p>Laura turned away. She was happy for her sister, really she was. Not jealous at all. She\u2019d sworn off men. Men were a recipe for disaster and failure.</p><p>So why the pang in her chest?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to rescue you,\u201d Billy said, then smiled Laura\u2019s way. \u201cBoth of you. I brought backup.\u201d</p><p>Helen Haskell, their tavern waitress and bartender, ducked into the tent, slinging her purse atop one of the coolers.</p><p>\u201cHey, Helen.\u201d Sorrow greeted her with a smile.</p><p>Laura, though, was feeling a little more impatient. \u201cThat\u2019s not a great spot for your bag.\u201d</p><p>She credited her mom with keeping the woman employed despite the fact that she was an inveterate flirt who was a bit scatterbrained, with a cranky attitude that was sometimes only thinly veiled.</p><p>It was clear Helen had more problems than she let on. But Laura didn\u2019t want to hear it\u2014work was work. Her mom disagreed, though. Edith Bailey wasn\u2019t one to judge, nor would she stand by as another woman struggled alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Helen ignored the comment and shouldered her way behind the folding table. \u201cI got it, I got it,\u201d she said, snatching the quarters from Laura\u2019s hand to make change for a young couple grabbing some Sprites.</p><p>Laura stepped back, sharing a quick look with her sister. Helen wasn\u2019t generally warm with her, but this was a new low. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up for this?\u201d</p><p>Helen watched as the couple felt their tepid cans. \u201cThat\u2019s as cold as they get,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d Then she dismissed them with a brittle smile and turned to the Baileys. \u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I? Though I\u2019m still not quite sure how your sheriff convinced me to take an extra shift.\u201d She\u2019d grumbled the words but pasted a smile on her face, and it struck Laura as only half-playful.</p> <p>It was good enough for Billy, though. He stood tall, straightening his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s the uniform,\u201d he said proudly. They were playing the nearby town of Paley Pines in their annual softball game, and this year Up Country Hardware had sprung for team shirts emblazoned with a hideous royal-blue version of the Up Country logo on garish yellow. \u201cIt gets the ladies every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGets them what?\u201d Laura asked. \u201cBlinded?\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s attention was in the distance, pinned on two of her three kids, roughhousing. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d she shouted. \u201cI told you to feed her.\u201d She and her husband had still been teens when she\u2019d gotten pregnant. They\u2019d married, and two more kids had followed, though lately Helen was always grumbling how she might as well have been a single mom.</p><p>It gave Laura chills. There\u2019d be no men for her, she resolved. No way, nohow.</p><p>Just then a dirt-scuffed little girl appeared, waving her corncob like a greasy baton. \u201cI am eating, Mama.\u201d</p> <p>Laura didn\u2019t know kids well, but she had a feeling they were supposed to be cleaner than this. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up for working the tent? If you need to watch your kids, really, I don\u2019t care about the stupid softball game.\u201d</p><p>Helen swung on her. \u201cAre you kidding? Working the tent is a break for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid?\u201d Billy exclaimed, still hung up on her dissing the big game. \u201cSoftball is a sport of great consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Laura.\u201d Sorrow gave her a nudge, moving her along. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an eye on the kids, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, troops.\u201d Billy swung the little girl onto his shoulders, grease and all. \u201cLet\u2019s go kick some butt.\u201d</p><p>The man was a natural with kids\u2014and of course he was. He\u2019d bought her sister a ring, had just bought her a house, and Laura was sure it\u2019d only be a matter of time before Sorrow popped out a whole softball team of children, probably all strapping dark-eyed boys like their father.</p> <p>The pang returned to Laura\u2019s chest, sharper now. She wasn\u2019t jealous, she told herself, not even a little. She didn\u2019t want a man, and she definitely didn\u2019t want a passel of dirty kids.</p><p>Billy walked ahead, and Laura wondered just who was going to watch said kids while he was in the outfield. The prospect of serving a bunch of hungry picnickers in the hot sun suddenly seemed preferable. She turned back to Helen, calling, \u201cYou sure you want to miss the game? Isn\u2019t Rob playing shortstop this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me,\u201d Helen said bitterly, suddenly intent on counting the ones in the cash box. \u201cI don\u2019t know where my husband has got to.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a stab of sympathy and womanly fellowship, she walked closer, asking quietly, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Helen shot back. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to stay.\u201d Her mimicking tone was as flat as her eyes.</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cAll righty then. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t offer.\u201d</p><p>The baseball diamond was at the far end of the picnic grounds, and as they headed there, Sorrow and Billy entertained the kids while Laura trailed behind, trying to turn her mood around. Watching all these smiling faces, Sierra Falls felt more like home than ever. And yet she\u2019d fought it for so long, fantasizing about any place but here.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy weathering her teen years in a small boondock town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada\u2014particularly as she\u2019d had to do it in the shadow of a sports-star brother and the family-pet little sister. She\u2019d grown up feeling underestimated, underappreciated, and overlooked and had taken off for San Francisco the moment she graduated high school. At the time, she\u2019d vowed not to return until she had a fast car, a killer body, and lots of money\u2014anything to finally get some attention.</p> <p>But the trouble with chasing those sorts of goals was that, for years, she\u2019d only looked outward to feel good about herself. A high-paying marketing job had bought her that car, a personal trainer, and all the respect she\u2019d craved, but it hadn\u2019t been enough to fulfill her. When she hit her twenty-eighth birthday, she\u2019d panicked. Her fianc\u00e9 had dumped her and she\u2019d lost her job because of that same man, and yet, once she recovered from the blows to her pride, it was a shock to realize how little she missed either of them.</p><p>She\u2019d been going through the motions, and it was time to look inward and figure out why her life felt so empty. She knew she could find another fianc\u00e9 and another job, but she was terrified that if she did, she\u2019d wake up ten years later and still feel unfulfilled. She was tired of pretending she was someone she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She needed to unlock the clues to herself and track down how and why things began to go wrong. What did she really want from life? And why did she always feel like she had something to prove? She knew the answers waited for her in Sierra Falls.</p><p>So she\u2019d returned home, and she wanted it to be for good, too. She was done with the city and done with men\u2014the two went hand-in-hand, anyway, seeing as she had no interest in the guys of Sierra Falls, lawmen and laborers all of them.</p><p>Laura was surprised to be discovering a friendship with her formerly estranged baby sister, and getting respect from her normally crotchety dad. They\u2019d handed her management of the lodge, and she wanted to do everyone proud. Wanted to turn the place around, to have her family business succeed.</p><p>And, more than wanting it, she needed it, with a desperation that surprised her. She\u2019d had so many personal failures, but this would be her chance at redemption.</p><p>She knew she could do it, too. She was no good at the great outdoors, but the fact that their home was out in the middle of nowhere was just an added challenge. She wasn\u2019t a big hiker and definitely had no interest in fishing, but there was one thing she was good at, and it was business. Marketing, to be specific. And she had big plans about how to use those talents and turn the Big Bear Lodge into a quaint destination resort. Besides, having spent the past several years test-driving every spa, winery, and B&amp;B in Northern California, Laura considered herself something of an expert.</p><p>Miraculously, her dad was staying out of her hair, too. He\u2019d been walking on air ever since they discovered gold on Bailey family land. Not that it was going to make them rich or anything\u2014the vein wasn\u2019t easily accessible and would cost too much to mine. But still, as a family, it felt like they were at a turning point. Everyone was putting their trust in her\u2014eyes were on her for what felt like the first time\u2014and she couldn\u2019t fail.</p><p>Which made Eddie\u2019s development project all the more infuriating.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t dumb\u2014she knew that if it hadn\u2019t been the Jessups, Fairview would\u2019ve hired some other construction outfit to do the work. But it was Jack and Eddie who\u2019d been hired, and it should\u2019ve been a stroke of luck. They were born and raised in Sierra Falls. They had the ears of the Fairview execs\u2014they should\u2019ve been talking sense into them. Finding a way to persuade them to leave the town and take their soulless hotel conglomerate elsewhere. But instead, Eddie was acting the yes man and going ahead with construction, without asking a single question.</p><p>Boutique spa resort. She scowled. As if. Fairview marketed themselves as some community-oriented, eco-friendly company, but really she knew they\u2019d bulldoze the whole town if they thought it\u2019d make them a buck.</p><p>She would not stand by as the Jessup brothers helped nurture to life a competing business. And Fairview wasn\u2019t just friendly competition\u2014they had bottomless pockets, and she was sure they\u2019d use them to either absorb or squash the Baileys.</p><p>A man had stood in her way once before. She wouldn\u2019t let it happen again. Never again was her mantra as she rounded the back of the bleachers. Never again, she repeated over and over in her head, and she was so caught up in her thoughts, she nearly stormed right into her sister.</p><p>She caught herself on Sorrow\u2019s back and walked around, and who was standing there with a grin on his face? Eddie.</p><p>A wicked glint darkened his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s coming in hot.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Laura put her hands on her hips, looking ready to do battle. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Eddie had seen the fury on her face. He knew why she was upset. He knew he should leave well enough alone. But knowing and doing were two different things.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s think about that.\u201d He tilted his head, admiring her. \u201cComin\u2019 in hot. Lots of levels at work there, I think. You\u2019re hot. You\u2019re clearly on a rampage. As for coming\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessups,\u201d she said with disgust as she shouldered by him.</p><p>\u201cLovers\u2019 quarrel?\u201d his brother Jack muttered, and Laura shot him a look that could kill.</p><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d Eddie punched his brother on the arm, then jogged to catch up to her on the bleachers. \u201cYou sure are pretty when you\u2019re wound up,\u201d he said to her back. He couldn\u2019t help it\u2014he loved nothing more than to bait Laura Bailey.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t wind me up.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, a thousand one-liners popping into his head.</p><p>She put up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it.\u201d He\u2019d been going there with her for as long as he could remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust naturally repellent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly trying to make you smile.\u201d</p><p>She paused, turning slowly. \u201cHonestly?\u201d A wicked gleam had appeared in her eyes. \u201cYou really want me to smile?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He put his hand up in a vow. He was dying to know where she was headed. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want you to remeasure the property line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to...what?\u201d It\u2019d taken him a moment to register what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis again?\u201d He should\u2019ve known that hoping for anything else would\u2019ve been in vain.</p> <p>\u201cYes, this again. This is far from over.\u201d</p><p>What did she care about the property line, of all things? \u201cJack will think I\u2019ve lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You want me to measure, I\u2019ll come out Saturday with my survey gear.\u201d That property was gorgeous\u2014he dreamed of owning land just like it someday. He\u2019d be happy to spend a summer afternoon trekking in the woods, measuring. \u201cNo skin off my back.\u201d</p><p>She looked taken aback, and it gave him a flash of satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to. Want to join me? We could take a little skinny-dip in the creek after.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes went flat. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be measuring alone this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it, but it won\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p><p>She huffed\u2014the girl actually huffed\u2014and spun to find a seat in the stands.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was promised a smile.\u201d He took the bleachers two at a time to catch up\u2014the girl had long legs\u2014but he was enjoying the view all the same. \u201cYou gonna choose a seat, \u2019cause I could chase you all day.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Ever since high school, she\u2019d been his catnip. And just as in high school, the girl still thought she was better than the rest of them. She had the fancy car, the gym body, and the designer clothes to prove it. He happened to be an accomplished businessman, but she was too caught up in her prejudices ever to see that.</p><p>Finally she stopped and sat. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo chasing, huh?\u201d He cracked a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say. Just give me that smile.\u201d</p><p>What she flashed him was more a teeth-baring than a genuine smile.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBigger,\u201d he insisted, and she tried to glare, but he saw it wavering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll smile as big as you want if you tell me you\u2019re stopping your stupid Fairview project.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d He plopped next to her and scooted close.</p><p>She scooted away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>She gestured to the field. \u201cJust go play your game, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re the one playing games.\u201d An idea hit him, and before she could snap back, he said, \u201cFunny you should mention playing.\u201d He peered at her feet. \u201cBecause I see you\u2019ve got your running shoes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>His brother Scott shouted at him from the field. \u201cYou ask her?\u201d</p><p>She inched farther away, looking wary. \u201cIs he talking about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all I talk about.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSpare me.\u201d</p><p>He watched her, waiting for her to look back at him. He was a patient man.</p><p>Finally she gave him a tentative glance. \u201cOkay, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need another player.\u201d He wasn\u2019t lying\u2014they were short a man. Or rather, short a woman. The league had rules about how many women and men there were per team, and Rob Haskell wasn\u2019t the only person who\u2019d bailed on the game; a couple of girls from his nephew\u2019s high school had skipped out as well.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re not asking me to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on the team.\u201d</p><p>His team had all assembled on the bench below, and they were clearly growing antsy. Shielding his eyes from the sun, Mike Haskell found him and shouted, \u201cC\u2019mon, Jessup. Batter up!\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Laura, amused by her look of terror. \u201cWhaddya think?\u201d</p><p>She was staring at the field, aghast. \u201cYou want me to play softball?\u201d She gave him an incredulous look. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an inspired idea. Just think, you can work out all your anger on the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger.\u201d She huffed. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can show me what-for on the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t played softball since eighth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you\u2019ll be like a fresh lump of clay.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop himself from wrapping his arm around her shoulders to give her a squeeze. \u201cAll the better to mold you.\u201d</p><p>She flinched away. \u201cYou are not molding me, Eddie Jessup. Why don\u2019t you ask Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>They scanned the field at the same time, finding the youngest Bailey sister. She\u2019d just bought Helen\u2019s kids snow cones, and they were already covered in sugary streaks of electric blue.</p><p>He bit back a smile, knowing he had her. \u201cCool,\u201d he said with a straight face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ll have Sorrow play instead, and you can watch Helen\u2019s brood.\u201d</p><p>Her flat look told him he had her. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cYou play, then tomorrow you come by the job site, and we\u2019ll discuss this problem of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem of mine? If Sierra Falls is destroyed by some international corporation, it\u2019ll be more than just my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou taking my offer or what?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his thighs, watching the other players warm up, making like he didn\u2019t care. He let Laura have her tense few moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said finally. She stood, but instead of edging by him, she made her way down the center of the bleachers. \u201cI\u2019ll play,\u201d she called over her shoulder, \u201cbut you\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><p>And pay he did, but not in the way she imagined.</p><p>Playing with Laura would be the death of him.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t the only person who\u2019d noticed her in her sassy little short-shorts. After the third inning, he caught up to Jack as they walked from the outfield. Snagging the collar of his brother\u2019s shirt, he said, \u201cNeed I remind you, you\u2019re a married man?\u201d</p><p>Jack flinched away. \u201cEasy, little brother. I\u2019m married, not blind. Your woman\u2019s something else to look at.\u201d</p><p>Eddie grinned\u2014he liked the sound of his woman. He wished. It wasn\u2019t like she was consciously putting on a show or anything, but she was so cute out there, so into the game, jumping up and down as she cheered. He kept catching glimpses of pale belly as she reached her arms up to stretch, her face lit by the sort of smiles he longed to tease from her himself. It was killing him.</p><p>And then, after he\u2019d gotten a base hit, he\u2019d caught her staring at him. She\u2019d glanced away quickly, but it\u2019d been enough to tell him that she was as curious about him as he was about her.</p><p>It was enough to drive a man to distraction.</p><p>To complicate matters was the fact that Eddie was a competitive guy, and their new sheriff, Billy Preston, was turning out to be a surprisingly good athlete. Eddie was determined to be the best man on the field, but it was hard to keep his mind in the game when his eyes kept drifting to Laura.</p><p>Paley Pines was at bat, and he forced himself to pay attention. Billy was manning second, and he\u2019d just turned a double play. One more out was all they needed, and Eddie was determined it\u2019d be his out.</p><p>He was playing shortstop, and they\u2019d parked Laura in left field\u2014the Paley players weren\u2019t exactly sluggers, and the outfield seemed a safe enough spot for someone who wasn\u2019t dying for action\u2014but that meant he couldn\u2019t watch her. He\u2019d turned once to steal a glimpse, and she\u2019d looked bored out of her mind. She caught him looking immediately, and he swung his head back around, forcing himself to keep his gaze pinned straight ahead.</p><p>Was she bored out there? Would she occupy her time by watching him? They sure did seem to catch each other looking a lot. Not that it was anything new\u2014they\u2019d been catching each other looking since puberty. Remembering it now, he wondered how much of his adolescent acting-out had actually been to get Laura\u2019s attention. He readjusted his ball cap, forcing himself not to think about it.</p><p>The sharp crack of bat on ball shocked him back into the moment. A hit. He shaded his eyes, jogging backward. It was a pop fly...headed right for Laura. Her expression of sheer terror told him she wasn\u2019t pleased about the development.</p><p>Eddie spun and hauled ass into left field.</p><p>Laura was backing up, her wide, panicked eyes glued on the ball coming straight for her. She put up her hands, looking like she wanted to duck but was too proud. \u201cCan you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeads up.\u201d He flung himself toward her, his body slamming into the dirt, and grinned to feel the satisfyingly sharp slap of the ball in his mitt. He rolled to his feet, certain he\u2019d finally be greeted by her smile. And with the ridiculously athletic maneuver he\u2019d just pulled, he hoped it might even be a fawning and appreciative one.</p><p>But when their eyes met, she was colder than ever. \u201cThanks,\u201d was all she said, and then she strode past him back to the bleachers.</p><p>How was it possible she\u2019d gotten even angrier in the past thirty minutes? He hadn\u2019t done anything.</p><p>He pulled off his cap, raked a hand through his sweat-dampened hair, then settled the cap firmly back on his head. Softball wasn\u2019t the only game he refused to lose. He jogged to catch up to her. \u201cWhy so angry, pretty lady?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d She took off her mitt and tucked it firmly into her crossed arms as though it might act as a shield.</p><p>He saw it as an invitation to goad her. \u201cYou mad I caught the ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know men like you had balls.\u201d</p> <p>A laugh exploded from him. She always had known how to catch him off guard. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get the one-up on me, it\u2019s not working. But if this is your way of flirting...\u201d</p><p>She upped her pace before he could finish, making a beeline for the bleachers, where she squished between two other players. \u201cI was not flirting,\u201d she muttered angrily. She kept her arms tightly crossed as she glowered straight ahead.</p><p>With one look from Eddie, the other players instantly scooted, making room for him to sit next to her. He chuckled as he settled beside her. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Billy,\u201d he called. \u201cMy bag?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff tossed Eddie his duffel, and he dug through for his bottle of water. He cracked it open and offered it to Laura first.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He guzzled the whole thing down and caught her glimpsing him out of the corner of her eye. It was a hot day, and the girl was bound to be thirsty. He unzipped the side pocket and pulled out his stuff until he found another bottle to hand to her. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>She took it, but her focus was on the contents of his bag. It was the usual gym bag assortment\u2014car keys, towel, fresh shirt\u2014but she smirked when she spotted his book. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, by Edmund Morris. It\u2019d won a Pulitzer. Not exactly smirkworthy. He raised his brows, giving her a challenging look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Neanderthals could read.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, tucking everything back in the bag, feeling suddenly tired. She really refused to see him.</p><p>Fine, then. If Laura thought he was nothing more than an oversexed, sports-playing, joke-cracking townie, then that was how he\u2019d show himself to her. She wanted Neanderthal; he\u2019d give her Neanderthal.</p> <p>He raised his eyes to hers, raking her body with a slow, sizzling look. \u201cI\u2019ve got a brain, darlin\u2019. I just prefer to use my body.\u201d</p><p>She gaped, and for a satisfying moment, her shocked eyes remained locked with his. He was the first to look away, making like he was watching their teammates up at bat. He shifted, making sure his thigh brushed against hers, even though he kept his eyes glued to home plate.</p><p>He felt her tense and fidget in a way that told him she was mustering a response. Finally she found her voice and whispered angrily, \u201cYou can do whatever you want with your body. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re as much of a womanizer as you\u2019ve always been. Just keep away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomanizer?\u201d he exclaimed, unthinking. It was the last word he\u2019d use to describe himself.</p><p>But then he thought about how he must seem. He flirted, sure. And he dated. He was easy and fun, and women always liked that. So what if he was a ladies\u2019 man\u2014it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t respect them. Quite the opposite.</p><p>His problem was, he was holding out for the full package, waiting for The One. He wanted true love, a wife to grow old with, a bunch of kids, and the white picket fence, too. But guys didn\u2019t go around bragging about stuff like that. And so he bided his time, flirting and having fun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no womanizer,\u201d he grumbled, unable to muster a more clever response than that.</p><p>He wondered what it was Laura wanted out of life\u2014aside from him and Fairview disappearing off the face of the earth.</p> <p>Fairview. They were a wily bunch. Secretly, he\u2019d done as she\u2019d asked and triple-checked their paperwork\u2014not that he\u2019d give Laura the satisfaction of telling her as much. He\u2019d reviewed their permits, combed through the building plans. It was all clear. They had a green light to begin work. It was time to break ground.</p><p>So why was he still delaying? He\u2019d been postponing, finding little things to hold them up, telling Hunter and the suits how their fixtures were back-ordered, how his subs were tied up till next week. All true, of course. Only normally, Eddie would\u2019ve kicked some ass and gotten the fixtures elsewhere or told his subcontractors it was now or never. Workers, sadly, were easy to find in this economy.</p><p>But he was up against it now. There was no more delaying. Come Monday, it\u2019d be time to get going. He hated the thought that he wouldn\u2019t just be building a second story onto the old rancher\u2014he\u2019d be building a wedge that would permanently separate him from Laura.</p><p>Billy was up at bat, and Eddie made himself focus. The sheriff was obviously close to the Bailey family\u2014being engaged to the youngest daughter had a way of doing that\u2014and he found himself oddly competitive, oddly jealous.</p><p>Preston hit a grounder in the gap to right and ran to first. Nice and solid. Eddie flexed his hands, scrutinizing every move the pitcher made. He wanted to do better than nice and solid.</p><p>Meantime, it was Laura\u2019s turn. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Suddenly, she looked stricken.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen her appear anything but confident and on top of her world. \u201cAm I seeing what I think I\u2019m seeing? The Laura Bailey, nervous?\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t laugh. Instead, she just looked ill. \u201cI haven\u2019t batted since eighth-grade gym class.\u201d</p><p>She really was having trouble. Without thinking, he put a hand on her knee. \u201cHey, it\u2019s just a game, okay? Nothing to make yourself sick over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. Can\u2019t you...what is it...pinch-hit for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how we play.\u201d He nudged her. \u201cJust give it a shot. This can\u2019t be your first real softball game.\u201d He peered at her, and when she didn\u2019t respond, he exclaimed, \u201cIt is. City girl\u2019s never played ball before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She stood abruptly, and damn if he hadn\u2019t spotted a flash of genuine hurt in her eyes.</p><p>He stood and, with a hand on her lower back, led her to the plate. \u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019ll help you. It\u2019s easy. Just gotta keep your eye on the ball.\u201d</p><p>They reached the plate, and she hesitated, like she was unsure she even knew where to stand.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know how to do this, do you?\u201d He guided her shoulders, and her feet followed. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now bend your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust play the damn game,\u201d someone shouted from the stands.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Sorrow shouted back, \u201clet him help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Taylor,\u201d Billy called from first base. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to write you up for public intoxication, you\u2019ll give the lady a moment.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow came to stand behind the catcher, her fingers twined in the chain-link fence. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him,\u201d she told her sister quietly. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>Seeing how Laura\u2019s hands were all wrong, Eddie said, \u201cYou almost got it. Now just choke up on the bat a little.\u201d When she did the opposite, he simply wrapped his arms around her, nestling her body snug against his. He\u2019d have sworn the touch of her skin on his brought an electric shock. She must\u2019ve felt it, too, because she sucked in a breath that reverberated through his chest. He\u2019d have liked to find a million different ways to take her breath away, and in that moment, he fantasized about a good half dozen.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Scott shouted.</p><p>She stiffened, and he made a mental note to strangle his brother later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ass. Ignore him.\u201d He bobbed his arms gently, trying to get her shoulders to loosen.</p><p>Women in the crowd began to cheer her on. \u201cCome on, Laura!\u201d</p><p>Bringing his mouth to her ear, he whispered, \u201cRelax. Nice and easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am relaxed,\u201d she said, sounding far from it.</p><p>He pressed more closely against her. \u201cDo I make you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d Her overly chirpy tone told him otherwise. \u201cI got it from here. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and made like he was simply studying her form as he let his eyes linger over those sleek, tanned legs and that tight butt, sticking out in the most adorable batting stance ever.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d he said, meaning every word. \u201cEyes on the ball and swing.\u201d</p><p>And God love her, but she swung and she hit that damned ball. The pitcher was too surprised to catch it, and it barreled to his right, and by the time the shortstop scooped it up, Laura had made it to first.</p><p>Eddie punched a fist in the air, whooping for her. Laura looked his way, and that beautiful face was beaming...right at him.</p><p>His heart swelled in his chest. Finally, finally, he\u2019d won a smile. He grinned back, giving her a big thumbs-up.</p><p>She did a cute little bounce and wave, but it was that smile.</p><p>Her smile did him in.</p><p>Six</p><p>Helen was running late, and of course she was. She did this drill every morning. It would\u2019ve been easier to herd cats than get her kids into the car on time. She\u2019d wrangled the two youngest outside, but her oldest was still missing. With a quick check to her watch, she opened the screen door and leaned back inside.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d she shouted. \u201cGet down here right now. I\u2019m gonna be late for work.\u201d She waited. \u201cDo you hear me? I\u2019m leaving.\u201d She pretended to shut the door, then paused. Nothing. She didn\u2019t know why she even tried that one anymore\u2014it never worked. She had a better idea. \u201cGet down here this instant or I\u2019ll tell Bear that it\u2019s your fault I\u2019m late. Maybe he can scold you instead of me.\u201d</p><p>That brought his feet galloping down the stairs.</p><p>Luke appeared, and Helen\u2019s breath caught. Though her oldest was only fifteen, something had happened in the past year. Where once there was a boy, she now saw the shadow of the man he\u2019d be. And that man would be the spitting image of his father. She felt a pang, realizing their son wasn\u2019t too much younger than Rob had been when they\u2019d first met.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom. Ellie stopped up the toilet.\u201d</p><p>She scowled and tossed down her purse. If she told that girl once, she\u2019d told her a thousand times: not too much paper. \u201cYou get in the car. I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d The last thing she needed was coming home to an overflowed toilet and flooded bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom. I dealt.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI would\u2019ve come down, but I wanted to fix it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much,\u201d she said, suddenly choked with emotion. Her boy might\u2019ve looked like his dad, but he sure didn\u2019t act like him, and thank heaven for that. Her Luke was always the caretaker, the peacekeeper, though sometimes it made her heart ache. She wanted him to be a boy\u2014to have fun and get dirty. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I made us late.\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed her purse. \u201cAre you kidding? Don\u2019t you give it a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t really tell Bear on me, will you?\u201d</p><p>She had to reach up to scruff his hair. \u201cIf Bear doesn\u2019t like it, he can lump it.\u201d</p><p>It saddened her, knowing how hard it was to focus on being just a boy when you had a no-good absentee dad. As the oldest, he saw more, noticed more. He remembered more, too, from before, when Rob had actually spent time around the house. When he\u2019d been a real father. A real husband.</p><p>Her other boy, Emmett, pushed inside. \u201cI forgot something.\u201d</p> <p>She caught his collar, stopping him. Her stern-mom tone came back with a vengeance. \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. We\u2019re almost out of here. Get back in the car.\u201d</p><p>Emmett flinched free, and she could see the machinations clear on his face. He\u2019d just turned eleven, and there was something about that age that had him trying rebellion on for size. \u201cBut I wanted to bring my canteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a water bottle already packed for you.\u201d She aimed him back in the direction of the minivan. \u201cNow go.\u201d</p><p>She followed him outside, and just as she was about to lock up, she got a good look at her youngest. Helen cursed under her breath. \u201cEllie Lynn Haskell, stop right there. Where are your shoes?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter waggled her foot, showing off a strappy Cinderella sandal with a big Lucite heel covered in silver glitter. \u201cI\u2019ve got shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are dress-up shoes. Go inside and get your sneakers on.\u201d With a quick check over her shoulder to make sure the boys were getting in the car, she pointed Ellie inside. \u201cYou know Uncle Mike is taking you for a hike. There\u2019s no way you can trek to the falls in those.\u201d</p> <p>The little girl dug in her heels. \u201cHe puts me on his shoulders when I don\u2019t feel like walking.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s response was instant. \u201cI am not raising myself any princesses.\u201d She prodded her daughter back inside. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong girl, and you\u2019re going to walk on your own two feet if I have tell your Uncle Mike myself.\u201d</p><p>As Ellie slipped on her sneakers, Helen fumed. It was hard enough watching the Bailey sisters live out their fairy-tale lives every day; she was not raising herself a girl who expected to be carried by a man. She knew the truth\u2014there were no such thing as princes, and she\u2019d not raise Ellie to have any delusions.</p><p>Finally, the girl sprang out, sneakers on, and Helen locked the door behind them. \u201cHallelujah.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the kids off, thanking heaven for her in-laws. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d mused how she\u2019d married the wrong brother. But Mike was a good ten years older and hadn\u2019t been nearly as cute as Rob, and when you were seventeen as she\u2019d been, not much had mattered more than cute.</p><p>Mike was happily married now, though there\u2019d been some tough times when he and Judy had been unable to have kids of their own. Eventually, they\u2019d stopped trying, but Helen still caught the wistful looks the couple shot her own kids, and it was always a reminder\u2014in the worst of times and during the hardest of days, she had to thank heaven she had three beautiful children. And God bless Judy and Mike, for there wasn\u2019t a resentful bone in either of their bodies. Instead, they\u2019d spelled her more than the average uncle and aunt would. Maybe Mike felt guilty about his no-good baby brother, but he especially looked out for the kids, taking them on hikes, for bike rides, or to ice cream.</p><p>Things their own father should\u2019ve been doing.</p><p>But how could Rob be there for their kids when he hadn\u2019t even come home last night?</p> <p>It\u2019d been happening more and more lately. When he pulled stunts like that, she had no clue where he slept. Maybe he had a hottie on the side\u2014who knew? All she knew was that most nights, by the time her shift ended, he was gone from the house. He\u2019d always leave clues to his existence behind\u2014a plate in the sink, mussed pillows on the couch\u2014and it was those little signs of life that were the hardest to take.</p><p>She was pensive as she pulled into the lot of the Thirsty Bear Tavern, and once she slammed the minivan into park, she couldn\u2019t help but peek at her cell, even though she knew what she\u2019d find: nothing. No calls from her husband. No texts, no voice mails. But still, she always checked. And damn her soul for trying.</p><p>She tossed the silly thing back into her purse, unbuckled, and sneaked a peek at herself in the rearview mirror. At least she still had her looks, not that anyone cared. The good men of Sierra Falls wouldn\u2019t touch her with a ten-foot pole, and she had no use for the bad ones\u2014not that she\u2019d let anyone touch her, not really. She had some fool notion that her husband might wake up one day and decide he liked her enough to want to start showing up to their marriage every now and again.</p><p>And so she kept on trying, just in case. If she kept up her looks, maybe Rob would stop looking for whatever it was he thought he was missing. She flipped the visor mirror shut, feeling an inexplicable flicker of hope. She was looking good, if she did say so herself. Her red hair was saucy as ever and still free of gray\u2014thank you, Grandma\u2019s good genes. Plus, she\u2019d saved up her tips and splurged on the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog, buying a sexy little bra that did wonders for her sagging, mother-of-three assets.</p><p>What the hell, she thought, as she dug back in her purse for her phone.</p><p>Maybe this would be the day Robbie would answer. Sometimes he did. Maybe this time something had happened, and maybe he was worried she was mad and was too nervous to call. Maybe he needed her to make the first move. She dialed.</p><p>It went straight to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cStupid.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cNo princes in my world.\u201d</p><p>Holding her purse on her lap, she stared at the tavern\u2019s front door, gathering herself. Forget her favorite new bra\u2014some days she wished she had a full suit of armor to face the place. It was getting to feel like a real love nest.</p><p>The new sheriff was so smitten with Sorrow, you\u2019d have thought she was the only woman on earth. And then, just a couple of weeks ago, Sully had taken off with Marlene, though Helen had a hard time resenting that. She didn\u2019t know Marlene well, and the woman hadn\u2019t always been exactly warm with her, but it was hard to resent someone whose husband had ditched her for his mistress.</p><p>Though, maybe if Rob ditched her, she could get on with her life. She was only thirty-two, after all.</p><p>She frowned. What was she thinking? She was stuck. As stuck as stuck could be.</p><p>And now Laura Bailey was back in town, acting bossier than ever, making her life a nightmare. Control freak, exercise freak, diet freak...the girl was wound up tight, not that anyone judged those things. If anything, every man in a sixty-mile radius was coming by to ogle her, though Laura probably had her head so far up her own butt she didn\u2019t even register the attention.</p><p>What Helen wouldn\u2019t do to be noticed. She didn\u2019t want any of those other men, though. She just wanted her husband to step up. She\u2019d been a hot number in her day\u2014not that she was so ancient now\u2014and Rob had once looked at her like that, with all those hungry, lusty looks. All she wanted was for him to be there, with her, just once in a while.</p><p>Nobody knew where he went when he disappeared, or if anybody did, they weren\u2019t telling. He still had his job at the hardware store, miracle of miracles, but the paycheck was erratic at best. It seemed the man showed up for work even less frequently than he showed up in their bed.</p><p>It certainly didn\u2019t make him enough to be able to provide alimony. Not enough cushion for her to break out and support the kids on her own.</p><p>Someone rapped on her hood, and she startled. It was Bear, the tavern owner. She glowered at him through the windshield.</p><p>\u201cGotta work to earn that break time,\u201d he hollered from outside.</p><p>With a roll of her eyes and one last sigh, she got out. \u201cEasy, boss.\u201d She made an elaborate show of checking the time on her cell. \u201cI\u2019ve still got two minutes before I have to clock in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis always happens on the holiday weekends,\u201d he said, beginning the same rant she\u2019d heard a dozen times over the years. \u201cAll those fireworks and beers. People get too loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did two things yesterday.\u201d She held up a hand to count it out for him. \u201cOne: I minded my kids. And two: I minded your tent. So don\u2019t talk to me about beers. And anyway, maybe you should try a little loosening up. Might do you some good.\u201d She passed him, headed into the tavern, and didn\u2019t need to look back to imagine the scowl on his face.</p><p>She tucked her purse behind the bar, doing a quick scan of the place. A few men sipped coffee at the counter. An elderly couple sat in one of the booths, working on their breakfast specials. Eddie Jessup was there, too, taking up a whole booth himself, sipping coffee, reading some book\u2014and wasn\u2019t that odd?</p><p>The clattering of pans got her attention, and she peeked at the pass-through window, into the kitchen. Glimpses of two blond heads told her she had both Bailey sisters to contend with today.</p><p>Helen snagged her apron, tying it on with a sigh. Catching the eye of one of the men at the bar, she said, \u201cAnother day, another dollar, huh?\u201d</p><p>Her autopilot kicked on, and she did her usual morning jobs\u2014refilling coffees, putting up a fresh pot of decaf and one regular, wiping down the bar, filling a pitcher of water and topping off the tables\u2014eventually making her way into the kitchen to continue her routine in there.</p><p>The Bailey sisters spoke over each other, saying, \u201cMorning, Helen.\u201d And, \u201cHi, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning yourselves.\u201d She emptied a fresh bag of English muffins into the bread bin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorrow stood at the stove, frying up hash browns. She might\u2019ve had a talent for making fancy gourmet stuff, but sometimes people just wanted good, old-fashioned home cooking\u2014especially at breakfast.</p><p>\u201cThat for Eddie?\u201d Helen asked, with a nod toward the frying pan.</p><p>Laura narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy. He\u2019s a man. Men like big breakfasts. Especially the Jessups.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help goading the girl and smiled to herself as she ducked into the fridge to snag a jug of OJ. \u201cHe\u2019ll be having a large juice, too, if I know our Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Eddie. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Helen smirked. \u201cYou sure seem prickly on the topic of Jessups. Especially the youngest one.\u201d</p><p>She and Laura weren\u2019t too far apart in age, but while Laura drove a fancy car and wore fancy clothes, she spent her days dealing with stubborn kids and stopped-up toilets. The girl was acting like a child. It was a wonder how she\u2019d ever gotten so successful.</p><p>Laura grabbed the sponge and attacked the counter with aggressive strokes. \u201cI am not prickly.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded at the spray cleaner in Laura\u2019s hand. \u201cThat counter\u2019s cleaned already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cleaned enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose stains are permanent.\u201d There were a million things that needed doing, not to mention several customers who needed attending, and here was Laura, wasting her energy on counters nobody could see. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, tell your dad to refinish the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow took the spray from her sister and put it back below the counter, giving her a gentle hint. \u201cWhat are you up to today?\u201d she asked brightly, in a blatant effort to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cI need to make some calls to the El Dorado Hills City Council.\u201d</p><p>Helen stopped what she was doing to gape. \u201cEl Dorado Hills?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. El Dorado Hills. I have a question about building codes.\u201d Laura gave her a quick side-eyed look, apparently deciding she wasn\u2019t good enough to hear details. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>Calls. All the girl had to do today was make calls.</p><p>She had to bite her tongue. She\u2019d always thought of herself as a can-do woman, but maybe she should\u2019ve acted needier. It sure worked for Laura, who did as she pleased. Would that she could\u2019ve stayed home today, sitting around, gabbing on the phone, making calls. Instead, here she was, filling a dozen tiny white ceramic pitchers with half-and-half.</p><p>Laura shouldered in to scrutinize. \u201cWhat are you doing? Wouldn\u2019t regular milk be cheaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are called creamers,\u201d she said, not stopping her task for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a waste.\u201d Laura turned to Sorrow. \u201cDoes she do this every morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Laura.\u201d Sorrow scraped the hash browns onto the plate, slid the whole thing under the warmer, and quickly set to scrambling up three eggs in the leftover oil. \u201cI like to serve real cream for the coffee. Now, Helen, would you please pop one of those English muffins in the toaster for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maple syrups also need topping off,\u201d Laura said with an edge in her voice.</p> <p>Helen froze. Slowly she faced the oldest Bailey sister. \u201cMy job is out there on the floor. The manager\u2019s job is back here. Seems to me, the maple syrup is back here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, ladies.\u201d Sorrow made a little chuffing sound as she used her sleeve to wipe the sweat from her brow. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019ve got customers out there.\u201d She slid the eggs onto the plate. \u201cHelen, order up. You know who gets it.\u201d</p><p>As Helen brought Eddie his breakfast, she tried not to fume. Laura had returned from the big city, and she\u2019d brought a pile of Louis Vuitton bags and loads of attitude with her. Word had it, she was here to stay. Helen hoped the attitude wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what\u2019d brought the girl back. Didn\u2019t care to know, frankly. She\u2019d never had much interaction with Laura, anyway, but Bear had anointed her manager, and like that, the woman was acting like she owned the place\u2014though Helen supposed she sort of did own it\u2014partly, at least. \u201cIt\u2019s no excuse to act like a know-it-all,\u201d she muttered to herself.</p><p>Eddie looked up from his book. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Her frown flipped into a smile. That Eddie Jessup sure was easy on the eyes. \u201cI said, eggs like you like them, Eddie. Scrambled hard.\u201d Her smile turned flirty.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever pursue anything with a man other than her husband. Sometimes it just felt good to remember how it felt to be noticed.</p><p>He lifted his book, making room for the plate. \u201cThanks, Helen,\u201d he said, ignoring her saucy innuendo.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexier than a man who reads,\u201d she said, trying even harder, bringing her smile up a notch. Though she was unclear why she made the effort. Eddie was a good-looking guy, a guy\u2019s guy. He\u2019d have no interest in a married woman like her. She was all used up. Too many kids, too many bills, and one husband too many.</p><p>But still, she tried\u2014she always tried. It was all perfectly innocent. Mostly, she craved the attention. She longed for someone, some man, some adult, to give her a friendly smile and a pat on the back every once in a while.</p><p>And maybe someday her flirting would capture the attention of the man she craved most of all: her husband.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why you women are all so surprised to see a guy with a book,\u201d Eddie said, laughing off her comment. And of course he did\u2014a guy like him would be used to flirty comments. \u201cWe can read, you know. It\u2019s not all SportsCenter and Skinemax.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She hadn\u2019t made him uncomfortable at all, and he hadn\u2019t blown her off like some men did, either. He was friendly and normal, and it made her feel friendly and normal, too. The whole exchange put a temporary patch on the giant hole in her heart.</p><p>But then he met her eyes and asked, \u201cHow are you doing, Helen, really?\u201d His tone was overly earnest, and she suddenly felt pathetic.</p><p>Everybody knew her situation. She supposed that, around town, she\u2019d become either a butt of jokes, an object of gossip, or both. Hell, she supposed maybe she was pathetic.</p><p>That hole in her chest tore right back open.</p><p>Her smile felt stiff, and she went back into automatic. \u201cDoing fine, doing fine,\u201d she said, feeling brittle enough to shatter. \u201cNine-to-five, gotta survive, right?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment was burning through her. She wanted to walk away, to forget who she was, but Eddie wouldn\u2019t let her walk away.</p><p>Instead he said, \u201cYou got that right,\u201d and he was smiling and shaking his head with the neighborly wisdom of it. \u201cThose kids of yours can\u2019t be cheap.\u201d His complete attention was on his food as he squirted a big glop of ketchup on his plate and dragged a forkful of hash browns through it. \u201cHow\u2019s Luke? He playing fall ball this year?\u201d He shoveled the bite into his mouth.</p><p>Helen might not be proud of herself, but she sure was proud of her son. Her oldest boy had quite the pitching arm, and it made her smile. \u201cYeah. You know he wouldn\u2019t miss it. The kid thinks the major league will be calling any day now.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d scoffed, but Eddie only shrugged. \u201cWho knows?\u201d he mused. \u201cSomeday, maybe they will.\u201d</p><p>It was a charitable and generous thing to say. Oddly, although the comment made Eddie soar in her estimation, the fact of it made her feel lonelier than ever. He was a good man, and what she wouldn\u2019t do for a good man.</p><p>\u201cThat boy\u2019s got an arm on him,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou let me know if you want me to throw the ball around with him. I\u2019d be happy to teach him my fastball. I call it the Jessup Special.\u201d Eddie mimicked a slow pitch with an elaborate flourish to his wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the release.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sad smile. Ball practice was supposed to be for dads. But she gave him an appreciative nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, Eddie. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Laura practically leapt on her the moment she returned to the kitchen. \u201cHe still out there?\u201d she demanded in an angry whisper.</p><p>Something about it annoyed Helen, and she intentionally answered in a normal volume, \u201cWho, Eddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Laura stole a peek through the pass-through, staring in his direction for more than a few seconds. \u201cGood Lord, how many coffees can one man drink?\u201d</p><p>Helen took a step toward the door. \u201cWant me to go ask?\u201d</p><p>Laura swung to face her, pinning her with a flat stare. \u201cDo you have a problem?\u201d</p><p>Helen feigned confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we girls were supposed to stick together.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at the concept as she went to unload the industrial dishwasher. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize we were on the same team.\u201d She had to step back to avoid the cloud of scalding hot steam\u2014some women went to the spa for facials; Helen unloaded dishes.</p><p>Laura looked momentarily flustered. \u201cWell...we are. On the same team.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow chimed in, \u201cGive him a break. I\u2019m pretty sure Eddie\u2019s bad-boy days are way behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Laura said, \u201cI try to steer clear of men like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm,\u201d Helen acknowledged, but it was mostly to be polite. She didn\u2019t look away from the sturdy white dinner plates as she got into a rhythm, systematically drying and stacking them in the cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Laura\u2019s voice came out a squeak.</p><p>Helen thought on it a moment. She was concentrating on her work. The comment hadn\u2019t meant anything, not really. And anyway, since when did what she thought matter one bit to Laura Bailey? Helen was way too tired and full of her own problems to craft double meanings or spend her time psychoanalyzing the girl. Seemed like Laura made drama for herself, while there she was, drowning in crises not of her own making.</p><p>Stay away from men like that. Eddie was a good and simple man, and just then, good and simple seemed like heaven. She put down her dishrag, and, letting out a gusty sigh, she met Laura\u2019s eyes. \u201cHoney, what I wouldn\u2019t do for a man like Eddie.\u201d When the Bailey girl shuddered, she gave her a wicked smile. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s cute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not cute,\u201d Laura said vehemently.</p><p>She raised her brows and gave the girl a pointed look. \u201cCome.

But he\u2019s, like, twelve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s your age.\u201d She swallowed her real comment, which went a little something like, You might be special, but the clock ticks for you as much as it does for the rest of us. The whole thing made her want to needle the girl, so she added in a feminine purr, \u201cPlus, he\u2019s some ball player. Did you see the home run yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Laura took over dish duty, which spoke volumes to Helen. If the older Bailey girl was resorting to manual labor without being asked, she really was troubled by something. \u201cYes, I saw that home run,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>Helen couldn\u2019t help it; she decided to bait her. \u201cOf course you did. It took them five minutes to find the ball in the bushes. He\u2019s so good at all the outdoor sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people call that a ski bum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his own business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, one that\u2019s trying to take us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like your mind\u2019s made up,\u201d Helen said, but what she thought was, what she wouldn\u2019t do for a ski bum.</p><p>Forget cute. If she could find herself a bum half as reliable as Eddie Jessup, she\u2019d be on him like white on rice.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Crossing the border into Nevada, a man didn\u2019t need to travel far till he spotted his first casino. They were everywhere, especially once you hit the bigger towns, a common sight on street corners, with signs that cried LOOSEST SLOTS IN NEVADA! and TEN DOLLAR PRIME RIB. Those slot machines were as prevalent as ATMs\u2014in grocery stores, motel lounges, strip malls.</p><p>There was no end of ways to lose money in Nevada, and Rob Haskell had tried every one.</p> <p>He sat at the table at one of the seedier joints outside Reno. Usually his game was Texas Hold \u2019Em, but he\u2019d gotten a feeling about Seven Stud, and the Seven Stud table was where he\u2019d sat since nine o\u2019clock the night before. The last time he checked his watch it\u2019d been two A.M. It was when he\u2019d gotten his thousand-dollar marker. Actually, not a marker\u2014an investment. His luck was just that close, he could taste it.</p><p>Going home hadn\u2019t even occurred to him.</p><p>Oddly, home was what drove him. His wife was such a hot number\u2014always had been. And somehow, even after all these years, he\u2019d never felt good enough for her. He\u2019d seen how the men at the tavern flirted with her. Even that Damien Simmons did double takes whenever she was around. Some day he\u2019d be as rich as Damien. He\u2019d be the one driving around in the hot car, wearing the nice suits, not the crappy Up Country Hardware apron he had to put on for work.</p><p>Smoke choked the room. He thought he was probably hungry. Thirsty, too. He\u2019d finished his last Scotch and soda hours ago\u2014he\u2019d nursed four of them over several hours, having calibrated his exact tolerance through the years. But these things registered only at a distance. Mostly he was aware of one thing and one thing only: the cards in his hands.</p><p>Dealers and players came and went around him, but they were also a blur, a parade of cowboy hats, cigars, toothpicks, and garish pinky rings on beefy fingers. There were women, too, in a procession of faces and ages and races, manicured fingers glittering with overlarge gemstones, hair sprayed into perfectly dyed helmets, and eyes schooled into careful blanks behind large-framed glasses.</p><p>He shifted in his chair. He sensed it was morning, and it was hard to ignore his fatigue. Distantly, he thought of Helen, and shoved her image from his mind. It just made him feel like a failure, and there was no room for failure. He had to imagine himself a winner. And so, although he knew in his head he should\u2019ve been getting on home, he sat in that chair, and if something didn\u2019t happen for him in the next hand, it\u2019d be coffee for him till something did.</p><p>It\u2019d been this same Seven Stud table all night, and with his blurring vision, the cards swam over green felt. But he couldn\u2019t leave now\u2014he was still riding that hunch.</p><p>Plus there was the marker to consider. One G. That was one thousand dollars that needed to go to the mortgage. To food. To whatever it was Helen spent their money on. As it was, they\u2019d needed to deal with the unexpected expense that was her new minivan when she\u2019d totaled the Dodge by slamming it into Phoebe Simmons\u2019s Mercedes on a patch of black ice.</p> <p>That was his luck these days\u2014a big, dead patch of black ice.</p><p>But not tonight. Tonight, when he\u2019d gotten in the car, the clock had read 7:07, and it was a sign. Sevens. He\u2019d been itching for some Seven Stud, and this would be the night he\u2019d come away a big winner.</p><p>The game was dealt two cards down, four up, and the last one down, and it was time for that last card. Everyone but him and some woman had folded. It\u2019d been an epic game, and there had to be at least a thousand in the pot, probably closer to two. After he paid his marker, it\u2019d be a tidy chunk of change. He\u2019d had better nights, but there\u2019d been much worse, too.</p><p>It was time to bet. He eyed the woman\u2019s hand. She had a pair of eights showing, but he had no clue what else she might be hiding. He knew what he had, though\u2014he had a winner. He was sitting on the proverbial ace in the hole, working an inside straight. Not much beat a straight, ace-high.</p><p>The woman eyed his cards, eyed him, then put a blue hundred-dollar chip in the pot.</p><p>With a silent nod, he called her bet, put in his own chip. He was in. He hesitated a moment, then raised her a hundred.</p><p>As he always did, he slid his hand in his pocket and rubbed his old buffalo nickel between thumb and finger. Forget rabbit\u2019s feet or lucky pennies\u2014his lucky charm was a nickel, the same one he\u2019d had in his pocket the day he met Helen.</p><p>The dealer kept up a monotone patter as he doled out the last card. Rob had a ten hiding next to his ace, plus a queen, a pair of twos, and a king showing. All he needed was a jack, and that pot would be his. That pile of chips was a car payment. Maybe he\u2019d even take Helen out to celebrate. All that money could be a leg up to a fresh start.</p><p>The dealer eyed his hand, drawing out the moment. \u201cThe man\u2019s got a lady, a pair of deuces, and one cowboy showing.\u201d He dealt the final card, and it made a crisp flick sound as it was placed before him. It was the sound of hope. \u201cDown and dirty. Good luck, people.\u201d</p><p>He put his fingers atop the card, rubbing it on the felt, willing it to be the card. He\u2019d seen only one other jack, and he liked his odds. He peeled up the corner, peeking.</p><p>A seven. A damned seven. Was that what all those signs had meant? That he\u2019d be screwed by a seven? All he had was a pair of twos, and he wasn\u2019t beating anyone with a pair of damned twos.</p><p>He kept his poker face but wanted to scream. He wanted to punch a hole in the table. To collapse onto the felt, hiding his face in his hands.</p><p>He was desperate. He owed a thousand-dollar marker. He had no choice. He had to bluff. He wouldn\u2019t be scaring anybody with a pair of twos, but if he bluffed well enough...Maybe the woman didn\u2019t get her card, either. Maybe if he went balls-out, bluffing with a pair of deuces, she\u2019d fold. Maybe.</p><p>He shoved the rest of his chips to the center of the table and gave her a slow nod, thinking maybe it\u2019d scare her off. All in. She met him there.</p><p>\u201cTime to show me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d the dealer said.</p><p>The woman flipped over her cards. It was a full house\u2014three eights and two sixes. And all he had was a pair of damned twos.</p><p>\u201cEights over sixes,\u201d the dealer said in his monotone, sweeping the chips her way. \u201cThe boat wins it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned a yellow tobacco smile as she began to stack Rob\u2019s chips into neat, color-coded piles.</p><p>He was bust. It hadn\u2019t been luck he\u2019d had a premonition of\u2014it was disaster. He was done. Nothing left. As it was, he\u2019d need to figure out how to talk his way into a credit for that marker. He calculated his next paycheck\u2014one week till he could pay it all back. What would he do in the meantime? Maybe dip into Helen\u2019s purse\u2014he\u2019d done it before, God help him.</p><p>He checked his watch. Ten A.M. Damn. How had that happened?</p><p>The kids would be in school. Or would they? No, it was summer. His oldest would be home doing whatever he did, while Emmett and Ellie Lynn would be at daycare.</p><p>Was that right? He tracked his mind back to yesterday. He\u2019d had his shift at the hardware store till seven, which meant it\u2019d been Friday, which made today Saturday\u2014Helen would be working at the tavern, and the kids would be...somewhere.</p><p>It meant he needed to get home and get to sleep before she got off her shift and the rest of them returned, one loud bunch, clueless to his crisis. He couldn\u2019t bear to face any of them, and sweet sleep was the easiest road away from the shame. He\u2019d go home and strip and crawl into bed, where he could fall into blackness.</p><p>Someday he\u2019d hit his big pot, and then he\u2019d stop. Someday he\u2019d show Helen he was a winner.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Laura reached the parking lot, panting hard. She\u2019d pushed herself that morning, doing a hilly seven-mile run rather than her usual leisurely four, but not even the scenic route to the old fire road and down around Granite Lake was enough to clear her mind. She slammed her heel onto one of the posts that lined the driveway and leaned over to stretch out her hamstrings.</p><p>Eddie. Cute, cocky Eddie. His face swam in her vision, making it go red.</p><p>He\u2019d been getting the best of her since they were kids, and here he was again. Him and his construction project. It would put her family\u2019s business under. He claimed it wouldn\u2019t, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. Sure, it might bring new people at first, but eventually Fairview would add a darling gift shop, and then would come the old-timey saloon, and finally they\u2019d build a folksy little diner that felt homey but was really run by the corporation, and eventually tourists would forget the Big Bear Lodge even existed.</p><p>But would Eddie listen? No. He only laughed it off. He had that attitude, that guy attitude, the kind that came with being easy and well-liked and hot.</p><p>Damn his hot.</p><p>She stood tall and grabbed her foot, stretching it behind her to get her quads. Her muscles trembled, and still it wasn\u2019t enough. Because, in addition to her worries about the family business, it was Eddie\u2019s hot she couldn\u2019t get out of her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019d been like that for as long as she could remember. Him flirting with her\u2014flustering her.</p><p>The stupid softball game had only reminded her. She hadn\u2019t wanted to play in the first place, and she definitely hadn\u2019t planned on watching him play. What a mistake that had been. She should\u2019ve stayed in the tent, serving beers and slopping out helpings of chili. Helen was a pain, but she was better than Eddie.</p><p>He\u2019d always been cute in his bad-boy way, but something had happened on that field, like light shifting through a prism, and all of a sudden there he was...hot. Disarmingly so.</p> <p>Athletic guys weren\u2019t supposed to be her thing. If she were going to have a man in her life\u2014which she wasn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019d be a millionaire software engineer. Or maybe a high-powered business exec in an Armani suit. Not Eddie in his tool belt.</p><p>After all these years, she hadn\u2019t expected to still find him so attractive, but now she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him, and it annoyed her. It was the last thing she needed. She\u2019d tried to blow it off, thinking how it was just one of those phenomena\u2014put a guy on a field with a ball, or on a stage with a guitar, or in a uniform with pretty much anything, and boom...instant hot.</p><p>But then he\u2019d stood behind her at bat.</p><p>Her breath hitched at the memory. She did not still feel those solid legs cradling hers, and she definitely didn\u2019t feel that hard stomach at her back, or the tickle of his breath in her ear, his voice a low and sexy rasp...</p><p>\u201cAw, hell.\u201d She squatted and rose and squatted and rose, feeling the burn in her butt. Exercise was what she needed. It\u2019d been forever and a day since she\u2019d been with a man, and that was the only reason remembering his touch made her feel this strange...tug.</p> <p>He\u2019d wrapped his hands around hers as she\u2019d held the bat. They were large and tanned and strong and callused from laboring on houses all day. \u201cDammit.\u201d There it was again...the tug.</p><p>She straightened her legs and flopped in half to touch her toes. With a sharp exhale, she fought to reach her palms all the way to the ground. The stretch danced on the edge of painful, but she pushed it\u2014all she needed was to work out her muscles harder than before and she\u2019d get these traitorous urges out of her system.</p><p>A guy was the last thing she needed\u2014especially this guy. She\u2019d put the softball game behind her. She was playing a different game now, and she needed to get her head in it. She\u2019d messed up a job before, and she wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.</p><p>\u201cWho am I kidding?\u201d she muttered, thinking she hadn\u2019t just messed up in San Francisco, she\u2019d screwed up royally. And it\u2019d all been because of a man.</p><p>Against her better judgment, she\u2019d hooked up with a guy from work. Before she knew it, he had a set of her keys and she had a carat on her finger. But then the job had gotten in the way. She\u2019d been the acting interim vice president, and when a prized client came their way, she\u2019d let her fianc\u00e9 talk her into letting him take the account. She\u2019d wanted it, but he claimed to have wanted it more.</p><p>Then promotion time came and he was the one given the permanent VP position, not her. She\u2019d thought she was a shoo-in for the job and still wondered if it\u2019d been their CEO\u2019s way of punishing her for having a work relationship. Not that Patrick had gotten in trouble for it. Rather, it was almost like he\u2019d been rewarded instead.</p> <p>But her fianc\u00e9 had tried to make it okay for her, kind of. He\u2019d said he needed money to take her on the honeymoon of her dreams. But then the economy busted, and layoffs came, and guess whose name was on the list? Hers.</p><p>She got fired, and her fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t go to bat for her. That was when she\u2019d begun to doubt whether he\u2019d ever really respected her at all. Professionally, at least. It also marked the end of their engagement.</p><p>\u201cNo more men.\u201d She stretched an arm across her chest, tugging at her triceps. \u201cNo more screw ups. No do-overs.\u201d In managing the lodge and tavern, she had a second chance to earn people\u2019s respect, and she was going to get it right. \u201cNo third chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the zombie hordes have finally arrived.\u201d It was Sorrow, heading from the lodge to her shift at the tavern. At Laura\u2019s perplexed look, she clarified, \u201cYou\u2019re bathed in sweat, looking like you just outran an angry mob, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went for a run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Sorrow stopped at the door, peering hard at her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething happened. Look at you. You\u2019re wearing one of my scrunchies in your hair. If you\u2019re preoccupied enough to wear a scrunchie, the apocalypse truly is nigh.\u201d</p> <p>She put a hand to the back of her head. \u201cAm I that predictable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only because I love you.\u201d Sorrow stepped closer, giving her a bolstering smile. \u201cNow tell old Doc Sorrow what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I am a little out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little? I haven\u2019t seen you this sweaty since Chip Merriweather asked that Sandra girl to the prom instead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Sandra girl was a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sorrow put up a hand, cutting her off. \u201cThat Sandra girl had her own problems\u2014and there but for the grace of God go I, as the Kidd ladies would say.\u201d She added mischievously, \u201cYou know you were always cuter, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She smirked\u2014her sister was good medicine.</p><p>Sorrow took her arm and steered her toward the door. \u201cNow you need to take a breather. Come in, hang out with me a while. I\u2019ll make you a coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coffee we brew is real, dummy. But yes, I\u2019ll make you one of your fancy-shmancy French press coffees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Laura said, sounding more resigned than she felt. A coffee would be good, and some talk, too. This thing with Eddie and the hotel was feeling big, and it was time to confide in her family about it. \u201cWe need to talk, anyway. I\u2019ve got news.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been putting off telling them about the construction project, hoping she could deal with it herself. Though they\u2019d probably already gotten wind of it\u2014after all, their tavern was ground zero for Sierra Falls gossip. But she was sure they had yet to understand the full extent.</p><p>She sat on the kitchen counter, sipping her French press coffee, watching her kid sister work. She\u2019d just finished telling Sorrow the full story, and the girl looked thoughtful as she was systematically chopping veggies and sweeping them into a big soup pot...chopping and sweeping, chopping and sweeping.</p><p>\u201cYou look so Zen,\u201d Laura told her, \u201cdoing what you do. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because I\u2019m good at chopping onions? Believe me, more than once I\u2019ve regretted how my therapy is cooking and eating.\u201d She put down her knife. \u201cYou want jealous? If I could\u2019ve gotten your genes instead, using running to get my mind off things\u201d\u2014she patted at her waist\u2014\u201cthen maybe I wouldn\u2019t have these.\u201d</p><p>Laura had always envied how content her sister seemed with her body. To hear this now was a surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean...these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, love handles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like your sheriff has a single problem with your love handles.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow blushed as a knowing and secret pleasure flashed in her eyes. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Laura felt a flicker of envy and put down her mug with a sharp clack. \u201cOkay, back to business. What are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, about? Get your mind off your fianc\u00e9. We were talking about what we\u2019re going to do about that, that...Eternal Rest Hotel and Spa.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow laughed. \u201cOh, Laura. Is it that bad? Maybe Eddie\u2019s right. Maybe a fancy spa could bring in more business for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the support, but yes, it is so bad.\u201d Her throat clenched a little as she said it.</p><p>Sorrow paused to look\u2014really look\u2014at her. \u201cYou\u2019re really upset. All right. I hear you. Tell you what. I need to finish up here, and the lunch crowd will be here soon, but once it thins out there, we can talk, okay? Make a plan.\u201d She grabbed another handful of veggies from the fridge and began to wash them. \u201cWhen times get rough, I recommend soup. Go take a hot shower. This\u2019ll be done in an hour. You\u2019ll think better with a full stomach.\u201d</p><p>She looked longingly at the pot. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t.\u201d When things felt out of control like they did now, she always liked to be extra careful of her diet.</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest, Laura. You can. Soup and salad can\u2019t be more than, what, five hundred calories, max.\u201d</p><p>Bear burst into the kitchen, the door swinging on its hinges. \u201cWhat\u2019s keeping you girls?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow didn\u2019t even pause what she was doing. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job, Dad. You know, making lunch?\u201d How her sister had become so bulletproof to the man\u2019s moods was a wonder.</p><p>Unable to get a rise from Sorrow, their father swung his gaze her way. He eyed her with a frown. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Her shirt was still damp and cool with sweat, and she peeled it from her body to air it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you people? Can\u2019t a girl go for a run without getting the third degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dripping on the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not dripping on the counter.\u201d She hopped down.</p><p>Bear\u2019s eyes narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cAin\u2019t those shorts a little...short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad,\u201d Sorrow said blandly, coming to her rescue. \u201cIt\u2019s why they call them shorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, dry yourself off before you get out there,\u201d he said with a wave to the pass-through window. The low hum of chatter had already begun, diners come early for lunch. Some liked to bring the newspaper and park at the counter for hours.</p><p>Laura gave him an incredulous look. \u201cWho says I\u2019m going out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody needs to man the tables.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorrow met her eyes with a mischievous twinkle. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean woman the tables, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who does it. All I know is Helen\u2019s not here yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen needs to step up,\u201d Laura said at once. Their waitress fought her on everything, and while she didn\u2019t need her employees to bow at her feet, Helen\u2019s attitude verged on downright disrespectful. \u201cWe pay her good money. If she\u2019s not going to work for it, then we should find someone who will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not exactly friends,\u201d Sorrow began.</p><p>\u201cNot friends? Not hardly. Does she even have any friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just fire her,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cShe\u2019s got kids.\u201d</p><p>Bear shrugged. \u201cYour mother won\u2019t hear of it anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she needs to at least attempt to be on time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cTry to give her a break. I feel bad for the woman. Her husband\u2019s never around.\u201d</p><p>Laura did a mental scan. \u201cShe\u2019s married to that Rob guy, from the hardware store, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dad nodded. \u201cReal piece of work, that one.\u201d</p><p>Women too hung up on their men...as far as Laura was concerned, everyone should take a page from her book and swear off the male sex completely. \u201cNot my problem.\u201d She went to put her coffee cup in the sink. \u201cAll I know is, business is up, and we\u2019re relying on her more than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sorrow exclaimed, and her knife froze midchop, \u201cwhat\u2019s up with hiring another person? Dad, didn\u2019t you say we could get some more help around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he asked, looking a little like a trapped animal.</p> <p>Sorrow smiled. \u201cOh, you did. You told Billy, remember? How we could get someone to help with the cleaning and front desk stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Hired help?\u201d Laura perked up, joining her sister. \u201cThat\u2019d be awesome. I totally need help managing reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about any hiring.\u201d Their father looked panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t be getting ahead of yourselves.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been momentarily light-headed with excitement, and then her mood dipped lower than ever. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, anyway. We won\u2019t even be able to afford Helen once we go under.\u201d</p><p>Dad swung to face her. \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard about Eddie\u2019s construction project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou mean that rundown ranch what\u2019s on the old logging creek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p> <p>He waved it off. \u201cYeah, Jessup told me about it. He says sprucing it up could be good for the town. Damned if those dot-commers ever did anything with the place. Fat waste that was. Good people could\u2019ve been living there all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody is going to live there,\u201d Laura said. \u201cHis project is to turn it into a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d She looked to her sister for support.</p><p>Sorrow took over in more even tones, telling him, \u201cLaura\u2019s worried because of who the developer is. Fairview Properties isn\u2019t exactly small potatoes. They\u2019ve got plans to turn the ranch into a resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they mostly run those little hippie places, where they charge rich people an arm and a leg to eat nuts and berries, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey run world-class resorts,\u201d she protested. \u201cThey\u2019ll be touting this as a world-class resort.\u201d</p><p>Bear looked back and forth between the two of them, clearly not getting it. \u201cThat little place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re building up that little place,\u201d Laura said. \u201cThey\u2019re turning it into a spa thing, like Forever Sleepy Resort or something ridiculous like that. Whatever. What I do know is that once they finish, it\u2019ll be just a matter of time before they put us out of business.\u201d</p><p>Their dad thought on that for a moment but finally brushed it off. \u201cI don\u2019t care how big they are, that old ranch is small potatoes, and small potatoes ain\u2019t gonna bring us down. Not with Sorrow in the kitchen now.\u201d He gave his youngest a wink.</p><p>\u201cHow times change,\u201d Sorrow murmured with a smirk. Just a year ago, Sully had been in charge of the food, and it was meat loafs and meat pies all around.</p><p>\u201cWell, some things don\u2019t change,\u201d Bear asserted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that old rancher go from hand to hand since I was a kid. Trust me. Nobody\u2019s gonna bend over backward to stay there.\u201d</p><p>The girls\u2019 eyes met. There was no convincing Dad when he didn\u2019t want to be convinced. At least her sister would be able to enjoy several months of cooking before they went under.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Sorrow mouthed to her as she went to the sink to fill the pot with water.</p><p>Bear followed and peered over her shoulder. \u201cWhat the heck are you making?\u201d Suspicion was thick in his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just busting out her famous toxic witch\u2019s brew,\u201d Laura deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Dad, it\u2019s soup.\u201d Sorrow gave a swirl to the water with her spoon.</p><p>\u201cLooks watery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s done,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.</p><p>He peered closer, picking up a particularly long leaf. \u201cWhat the heck is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA leek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plumbing problem, not a vegetable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Sorrow spun and waggled her fingers at him. \u201cShoo! Out of my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad.\u201d Laura put her arm through his. \u201cI hear zombie hordes might be coming to the tavern today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d her father exclaimed as she ushered him into the dining room. \u201cZombie-whats? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>But she barely heard him. All she registered was the sight of Eddie, folding his long, strong body into a booth. \u201cApocalypse,\u201d he said in his deep voice. \u201cSounds bad. Should I go get my gun?\u201d</p><p>She stopped short, glaring. \u201cEddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh, tiger.\u201d He gave her a slow smile. \u201cJust in time, too. You\u2019ll need somebody around to help propagate the species.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Bear looked his way. \u201cWe were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Laura said in a flat voice. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d The way it came out, one would have thought he was actual evil-spawn.</p><p>Eddie touched a hand to his forehead. \u201cWhat? Are my horns showing?\u201d</p><p>She bustled by without sparing him another glance, headed behind the bar. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at your job site? You know, sawing, hammering, crushing the hopes of others, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Bear sauntered over to join him in his the booth. \u201cI got something to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d He kept the easy smile on his face, but inside he braced. Laura looked ready to snap, and it gave him an inkling of what her father wanted to discuss.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re trying to put us out of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such thing, Bear. I regret your daughter has a problem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Laura exclaimed.</p><p>Here it came.</p><p>He ignored her to lean forward and talk fast. \u201cWith respect, sir, so long as Fairview plays by the rules\u2014and I\u2019ve got a permit in my truck that says they are\u2014then I\u2019ve got a responsibility to grow my business.\u201d</p><p>Bear liked the sir. He gave a gruff nod. \u201cA man\u2019s got to look out for his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe this\u2019ll only bring more tourists to Sierra Falls. That rancher can only hold so many guests.\u201d It\u2019d be more guests once they added a second story, but he\u2019d work up to that part. \u201cPeople coming to visit the spa will need someplace to stay...\u201d He cocked his head in the direction of the lodge, letting Bear do the math. And he honestly believed it, too. A night at the Fairview property would probably run about four times what a night at the lodge cost.</p><p>Sure enough, the man gave him a slow smile as he rose from his seat. \u201cThat was my notion exactly. I like how you think.\u201d He went to the bar, pausing to smack a hand on the counter. \u201cCan\u2019t fight progress, girl.\u201d</p><p>Laura looked unusually deflated. Quietly, she said, \u201cThey\u2019ll put us out of business, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prissy health farm is going to put us Baileys out of business. Seems to me you\u2019ve got enough to fret about, so get back to it.\u201d Bear shook his head as he settled onto a far stool, muttering, \u201cSpa Jacuzzi city folk prissiness.\u201d</p><p>Laura automatically poured her dad a cup of coffee. Eddie had known the man for years, and he knew to let him sip and sit with this latest development for a while before he broke the rest of his news. It took baby steps with Bear Bailey.</p><p>And besides, something else was demanding his attention at the moment. Laura had begun to crash around behind the bar, slamming the coffeemaker open and shut, rattling cups in the bus tray, breaking up the ice in the freezer bin. To someone else, she might\u2019ve looked angry, but Eddie saw something in the way her mouth was drawn. A pinched look to her eyes that made it seem like she was damming back some emotion.</p><p>He hated it. Hated to be the bad guy in those eyes.</p><p>He popped up from the booth and joined her behind the bar.</p><p>She grew utterly still, watching as he poured himself a cup of coffee. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came for coffee, so I\u2019m getting myself some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He could tell she wanted to tear into him, but how could she fault his helping himself? Their waitress wasn\u2019t in yet, so serving fell to the family. \u201cJust trying to help a pretty lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen rip up Fairview\u2019s check.\u201d</p><p>He topped off Bear\u2019s cup, then walked back around and grabbed a stool at the bar. \u201cSeems our goals are mutually exclusive.\u201d As he leaned his elbows on the counter, he couldn\u2019t help but eye her tight body in that skimpy workout getup. \u201cAlthough...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlthough, what?\u201d</p><p>He shot a glance at Bear, chin-deep in a copy of yesterday\u2019s paper, and whispered, \u201cAlthough it seems like one of your goals is a good workout. I could always help by racing you around in those little hot pants of yours.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, she stood erect, putting her hands on her hips, doing her best to look put out. \u201cThey are not hot pants. They\u2019re running shorts.\u201d</p> <p>He let his gaze rove along those sleek thighs, and when he brought his eyes back to hers, something gratifying awaited him there. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d he said with genuine surprise.</p><p>\u201cI am not blushing.\u201d She turned her back on him to wipe down a part of the bar that didn\u2019t need wiping. \u201cI\u2019m just flushed from my workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, you let me know if you need a running partner. Because seriously, I\u2019m available for chasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream on, Jessup.\u201d She threw the rag into a bin under the counter. \u201cNow, do you have a reason to be here, or is it just to plague me?\u201d</p><p>He was working up the guts to break it to her about the rancher\u2019s second story, so for now it was pretty much the plague-her thing. He had an appointment to keep in Reno, but instead he found himself reaching for a menu. \u201cWhat\u2019s today\u2019s special?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSoup, but it won\u2019t be ready for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the soup,\u201d Bear said. He put his paper down and shot a thumb in the direction of the windows. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta finish the screens.\u201d</p><p>Eddie popped up to take a look. \u201cI did finish, good and solid.\u201d He helped the Baileys out with small jobs, and it wasn\u2019t like him to mess something up. \u201cHere\u2019s your problem,\u201d he said, seeing it immediately. One of the pegs holding the screen in place had broken, leaving a gap wide enough to let bugs in. \u201cI told you, Bear, you get what you pay for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told me these were perfectly good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you they\u2019re perfect crap. These cheap ones can\u2019t take any wear.\u201d He wedged the screen back into place. \u201cHey, sugar,\u201d he called to Laura, \u201cyou got a toothpick behind that bar?\u201d She gave him a frosty look in reply, so he added, \u201cI need something tiny to pick out the broken bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things came with a bag of extra parts,\u201d Bear said, headed to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the garage, see if I can find them.\u201d</p> <p>Laura brought him a few plastic cocktail spears, and instead of returning to the bar, she stayed to watch as he used a toothpick to jiggle the piece free. \u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He found her interest oddly gratifying. \u201cIt was probably some little kid, sitting in the booth, fiddling with it. Snapped the head of it right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can\u2019t you just snap it back on again? It\u2019s letting in a ton of mosquitoes.\u201d She put a knee on the bench of the booth to get a closer look, and the fake leather upholstery crunched as she leaned in.</p><p>The piece popped free, and he dropped it into her hand. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I worked the evening shift yesterday and was practically nibbled to death.\u201d</p><p>Her thigh was tanned and smooth, and he had a good idea of what he\u2019d like a nibble of. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you taste mighty good, too.\u201d</p><p>Too good. He had to turn his back to her, giving himself a second to cool it.</p><p>But then she made an exasperated sound, and he just had to get a look at her expression, so he stood. He moved sooner than she\u2019d expected, though, because as he did he practically bumped into her.</p> <p>Stepping back, she made a little \u201cOh\u201d sound. Her eyes were wide and lips parted, making her look as heated as he felt.</p><p>\u201cIs there something the matter?\u201d He stepped closer, touching a finger to her chin. \u201cBecause, sweet thing, you\u2019re looking flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fix it and be done, Jessup.\u201d She shifted her chin, evading his touch, but she didn\u2019t move outright, which he took as an excellent sign.</p><p>He inched even closer to her. \u201cYou want me to fix it?\u201d</p><p>She took another step backward, looking a little unsteady. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. All you had to do was say please.\u201d</p><p>Bear reappeared with a tiny, clear plastic bag. \u201cGot \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you\u2019d installed it right the first time,\u201d Laura said flatly.</p><p>He smirked to himself, wondering if she was this saucy in all areas of her life. \u201cI did install it right the first time.\u201d He emptied the parts into his palm, looking for the right little black peg. \u201cMaybe if the manager of this place hadn\u2019t been so stingy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not stingy,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d It took Eddie just a second to click the part into place.</p><p>Bear hooted a laugh as he headed to the bar, mumbling, \u201cI need coffee for this.\u201d The man walked slowly since a stroke had left him with a bum leg, but damned if he hadn\u2019t been moving around better ever since Sorrow\u2019d had her emergency down at the old mine.</p><p>Bear gave the coffee a sniff, and, despite his grimace, he poured himself a mug. \u201cWell, kids, if that\u2019s it on this whole ranch nonsense\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Eddie interrupted, \u201cthere\u2019s one other thing.\u201d It was now or never. He settled on a stool, bracing himself for the fight he knew was coming.</p><p>Laura froze. \u201cI knew it.\u201d She looked at her father. \u201cHere it comes. The part about how he\u2019s going to destroy Sierra Falls and all the rest of us with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear the man out,\u201d Bear said. He turned to Eddie, adding, \u201cIgnore her. I told my girl it\u2019s just a little rancher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Laura muttered. \u201cIgnore the girl.\u201d</p><p>Her dad pretended not to hear as he stirred a couple of spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee. \u201cNo old, beat-up one-story hotel is gonna put the Big Bear Lodge out of business. Ain\u2019t that right, Jessup?\u201d</p><p>Eddie didn\u2019t smile along, though. The churn in his gut made such a thing impossible. \u201cWell, funny thing that. It turns out Fairview wants more than just a one-story rancher.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s expression shattered\u2014it was what he had been dreading most. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked, her voice gone hushed.</p><p>His attention was only on her as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laura. I tried. They want to build up, not just out. We\u2019ve got to take the place up a floor. But,\u201d he quickly added, \u201cwhat I said still stands. They\u2019re building a spa in there, too, and once they add things like treatment rooms, there won\u2019t be all that much space left for guest rooms. I honestly can\u2019t see how it\u2019ll put you guys under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuild up?\u201d she exclaimed, clearly not agreeing with his assessment. \u201cHow can they do that?\u201d The hollow look in her eyes gutted him. But then her pain sharpened to fury. \u201cHow can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Everything about her\u2014her tone, her words, and the accusation in those eyes\u2014put him on the defensive. \u201cBecause I need to put food on the table, Laura. Forget me, how about Jack? He\u2019s got Craig and Tina to think about. If it hadn\u2019t been us hired to do the job, it would\u2019ve been some other outfit. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you think about it. Your swanky new hotel isn\u2019t just going to put the Bailey family out of business\u2014it\u2019ll change everything about Sierra Falls. Corporations who don\u2019t give a damn about the town or the people who live here, they\u2019ll come in and build their big chain stores and chain hotels and chain restaurants, and it\u2019ll put the rest of us\u2014the residents, the heart and soul of this town\u2014out of business.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand through his hair. Did she think these things hadn\u2019t occurred to him? All he could do was try to remain optimistic. \u201cI can\u2019t stop it,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>He checked his watch. His other commitment was calling him. Construction wasn\u2019t the only thing in his life\u2014not by a long shot\u2014and it was a long drive to Reno.</p><p>\u201cAre we keeping you?\u201d she asked in a voice like acid.</p><p>He slid from his stool in answer.</p><p>She glared. \u201cWhere do you have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReno.\u201d Like she cared.</p><p>\u201cHitting the strip?\u201d</p><p>With a roll of his eyes, he got back on topic. \u201cLook, Fairview has the permits ready to go. Neither of us can stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll stop them all right.\u201d She stormed from behind the bar. \u201cThink about it, Eddie. The former owners had a ton of dot-com money. If they could\u2019ve made that stupid property into something bigger, or better, or somehow more than just a little old ranch house, they would have. No, there\u2019s something fishy about your permits,\u201d she spat, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna get to the bottom of it.\u201d She looked at her dad. \u201cTell Sorrow I\u2019m taking a rain check on lunch.\u201d</p><p>She stormed out. The door slammed behind her, leaving a deafening silence, with just the sound of Bear\u2019s spoon clinking against his mug to be heard in the tavern.</p><p>\u201cBuilding up, huh?\u201d</p><p>Eddie sighed and leaned against the dinged-up counter. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t us on the job, it would\u2019ve been someone else. There\u2019s no stopping those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always figured that was some sort of historic property. You know, the sort of thing you can\u2019t change, just restore.\u201d Bear shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not doing anything illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairview got special permission. Some adaptive reuse thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the permits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bear. This is my livelihood we\u2019re talking about. In this economy, Jessup Brothers Construction can continue to scrape by with odd jobs, or we can go big-time. Fairview is big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our livelihood, too, boy. The livelihood of the whole Bailey family.\u201d He stood and patted a definitive hand on the counter. \u201cBut Marlene raised you well. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eddie headed back out to his truck, evading the nosy stares of the other diners. Screw the soup. His appetite was gone anyhow.</p><p>What Laura had said nagged him. What if there was something fishy about that permit?</p><p>A quick phone call to Hunter Fox was supposed to put his mind at ease, but the man\u2019s smooth-talking protests weren\u2019t as easy to swallow as they\u2019d once been. Eddie snapped his phone shut and pulled the permits from the glove compartment. All neat and tidy, just as Fox had said. He shoved them back in and slammed it shut.</p> <p>Laura was just being her old self. Self-involved, self-absorbed, and snotty.</p><p>He needed to stop being distracted by things like smooth legs and teensy-tiny running shorts. What he needed was to start construction once and for all. Get this thing built and finished\u2014the future of his family business relied on it. That was all he could afford to think about.</p><p>And if it meant the total ruination of his relationship with Laura, well, he never stood a chance with that kind of woman anyhow.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Laura startled, hearing the creak of the attic steps. She gave a sharp sniff and scrubbed a quick hand over her face.</p> <p>\u201cAre you up here again? I can\u2019t find the\u2014\u201d Sorrow\u2019s head popped into view and she paused, taking in the scene. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Laura turned her back on her sister. She\u2019d allowed herself a mini-breakdown in what she thought would\u2019ve been the solitude of the attic. \u201cGot some dust in my eyes. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for the dustpan.\u201d Sorrow\u2019s eyes swept the room. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrganizing.\u201d She gave a sharp sniffle and got back to rifling through an open trunk. \u201cDitching some of this old stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw away too much. I already went through it when the roof caved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a ton of junk.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s bad feng shui.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay...\u201d Sorrow said warily. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the dustpan was bad feng shui, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw it away.\u201d She began to refold and smooth a stack of old linen napkins.</p><p>\u201cYou threw away the dustpan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a Swiffer to use instead. I cleared out the pantry; it\u2019s hanging in there on its own hook.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow clomped the rest of the way up the stairs. \u201cWhat do you mean, you cleared out the pantry?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the energy to get into it with her little sister. Cleaning was therapeutic, and she\u2019d just as soon continue in peace. \u201cThere was stuff in there that didn\u2019t belong,\u201d she said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cLike what kind of stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...duct tape. And envelopes. Stuff that belongs in the garage. Or the office.\u201d She slammed the trunk lid down. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not up for this right now, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy, Laura.\u201d Sorrow put up a quelling hand that, at the moment, felt patronizing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to take it easy. Who do you think will get the blame if we go out of business? Me, that\u2019s who.\u201d She smooshed the lid all the way closed and clicked the hasps shut.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go out of business because there\u2019s duct tape in the pantry.\u201d</p><p>Laura felt the emotion clawing at her throat again. Controlling her environment helped her feel in control of her destiny\u2014why was that so hard to understand? \u201cI need to get this place in better order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sorrow said, \u201cdon\u2019t forget I\u2019m here, too. Just because you\u2019re the manager doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in this alone.\u201d</p><p>Her sister had obviously sensed her distress, but instead of comforting her, the sympathy only made her feel teary again. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cBut I like chores like this.\u201d And she did. Dealing with practicalities kept the demons at bay.</p><p>Sorrow knelt to her eye level. \u201cI want you to be able to focus on business stuff, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I remember? I was up all night with business stuff.\u201d She leaned an elbow on the trunk, suddenly heavy with exhaustion. She\u2019d spent hours pulling together a hard-core, bulleted presentation outlining the next steps for confronting the Jessups\u2019 treachery. There was so much to consider: budget, publicity, outreach, growth estimates. She was approaching the management of her family business no less seriously than she had in her job as interim vice president. Though look how that had turned out.</p><p>\u201cJust...don\u2019t forget I\u2019m here to help. I can totally deal with stupid stuff like cleaning out the pantry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always know where everything goes.\u201d</p><p>She realized how bratty that\u2019d sounded and waited for Sorrow to take the bait, but her sister just sighed, telling her gently, \u201cYou can\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>But she didn\u2019t say that. Her sister would never understand. Sweet, loving Sorrow had always been everyone\u2019s favorite. Lately, Dad was always going on about his talented chef daughter, or his brave Marine son. But when it came to Laura, the only praise she ever got was how on top of things she was. On it.</p><p>Our Laura\u2019s on it.</p><p>And now that the welfare of the entire family business rested on her shoulders, she dared not consider what would happen if, for once, she wasn\u2019t on it.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t about to go there with Sorrow, so instead she told her, \u201cLook, I think I put the dustpan in a charity box in the garage.\u201d She turned away, scooting in front of the next trunk, effectively ending the conversation.</p><p>She heard her sister sigh, pause, then head back down the stairs.</p><p>Laura didn\u2019t have a shrink, but at the moment, this kind of therapy would have to be enough. After two more trunks, it was.</p><p>Until Helen tracked her down later, shattering her hard-won calm.</p><p>Laura had gone into the tavern kitchen to hide out\u2014anyone who knew her knew she didn\u2019t hang in the kitchen if she could help it, but she was craving some of Sorrow\u2019s homemade hummus, so she\u2019d given herself a moment to sit on the counter, crunch on carrots and dip, and scan the seventy e-mail messages visible on her cell.</p><p>Sorrow had sensed her state of mind and given her a wide berth for the rest of the afternoon, but Billy had no such clue. \u201cHow\u2019s the new phone?\u201d he asked. He was spending his lunch break as usual, stealing some time with her sister as she did her advance dinner prep.</p><p>Laura frowned at the thing. \u201cJury\u2019s still out.\u201d She\u2019d splurged on a new smart phone, but so far it just showed her all the work she had to do, and yet the tiny screen made it barely possible to do anything about it. \u201cCan you believe...thirty-two new e-mails in just the past three hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two?\u201d Sorrow stowed a platter of chicken breasts in the fridge to marinate. \u201cWho\u2019s sending all the e-mail?\u201d</p><p>Laura shrugged. \u201cReservations. Lodge inquiries. Spam. Plus I\u2019m working on some other stuff. I\u2019m in touch with the California Office of Historic Preservation.\u201d She caught the look that shot between Billy and her sister and quickly added, \u201cIf there\u2019s some error in Eddie\u2019s building plans, any technicality at all, it\u2019ll void the whole permit and they\u2019ll need to start over.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d learned that trick from Ruby and Pearl when she\u2019d gone down to the Town Hall to investigate the historic registry. She still needed to stop by with some flowers to thank them.</p><p>\u201cStart over?\u201d asked Sorrow.</p><p>Laura braced for the speech that was to come, about how it wasn\u2019t a big deal, the Jessups wouldn\u2019t do anything illegal, there was no fighting the system. Increasingly she felt like Don Quixote, tilting at windmills.</p><p>But then Helen burst into the kitchen, interrupting, which meant for once she was happy to see the woman. \u201cHey, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re all hiding in the kitchen while some of us are out on the floor, hustling our butts off.\u201d Their waitress thrust the tavern phone at her.</p><p>She gave the phone a wary eye, making sure to keep her tone exaggeratedly even. \u201cIs this your way of saying the phone is for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my way of saying I need more help out there.\u201d</p><p>Laura put her ear to the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d She waited a second, then rolled her eyes. As far as she was concerned, Helen\u2019s days were numbered. She\u2019d even begun to keep a list of the woman\u2019s transgressions, remembering from her office days how the two most important things in any employee termination were to keep calm and to keep documentation. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d Helen snapped. \u201cMaybe if I had more help I could\u2019ve run back here sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I could use more help, too.\u201d Laura was more committed than anyone and could school the lot of them in what it meant to work hard. \u201cBut my hands are tied. Consider yourself lucky you even have a job.\u201d She was speaking from experience, as someone who\u2019d recently been fired, but the way Helen bristled, she\u2019d clearly taken it as a threat.</p><p>Whatever. She glared at the phone instead, putting it back up to her ear. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the call get transferred to the other line?\u201d Billy asked.</p><p>Helen ignored them, looking to Sorrow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more business than ever, and I just can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>Laura switched to the other line, only half listening to Helen\u2019s griping\u2014she had neither the time nor the patience\u2014but there was silence on the line. \u201cNope, that\u2019s dead, too.\u201d</p><p>Helen finally tuned in, and, shooting a quick glance Laura\u2019s way, she said, \u201cThey must\u2019ve hung up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I hadn\u2019t had a dozen other things to do at the same time, maybe I\u2019d have found you.\u201d Helen angrily crossed her arms, and the gesture plumped her already ample chest\u2014did she purposely flaunt her assets at any given opportunity? \u201cBut can I say one word to complain? No. I do much of the work yet have none of the say in how things go around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have a say.\u201d Sorrow tapped her spoon on the edge of her frying pan and gave Helen her full attention. \u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThey won\u2019t bite.\u201d Then he pointed to Laura and added with a smile, \u201cWell, she might.\u201d He placed his hands on his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoulders. It seemed he was always touching Sorrow with those affectionate, automatic gestures.</p><p>Helen only glared.</p> <p>The chatter from the other room swelled with the sound of new patrons. It was time to defuse the situation and get back to work. Helen had diners to serve, and she had a certain construction worker to confront. Even if nothing came of things like forcing Eddie to remeasure the property lines, it\u2019d still provide nice little setbacks for him.</p><p>She hopped from the counter, pocketing her cell phone with one hand and holding the tavern phone in the other. \u201cWe\u2019re all overwhelmed, Helen. Our marketing efforts have begun to pay off, and it just means we all have to work extra hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a case of be careful what you wish for,\u201d Billy said wryly.</p><p>Helen stiffened. \u201cWell, it\u2019s become too much. I can\u2019t keep running between tables, back to the bar, back here, back to the tables\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sorrow smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Laura gaped at her sister. Okay was not the way to manage people. The situation had been in hand before Sorrow had interrupted. \u201cWhat do you mean, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve hired someone to help.\u201d</p><p>Laura almost dropped the phone, not believing her ears. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Dad finally relented.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance quickly followed her relief. \u201cWhen exactly were you planning on telling me? I am the manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cWe just finalized it today. You were hiding in the attic, remember? Hey, if you looked up from that cell phone every once in a while, I could\u2019ve told you sooner.\u201d</p> <p>She shut her eyes for a second, regrouping. \u201cAll right. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d Sorrow grinned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head. Now tell me how you finally convinced the old man. He\u2019s been all talk, promising help for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it with a little help from this guy.\u201d She leaned back into Billy, and he cradled his arms around her waist.</p><p>Helen snapped, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you two be on a honeymoon somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a long engagement.\u201d</p><p>Laura had to agree with Helen on that point\u2014those two were a bit much to watch sometimes. \u201cYou can honeymoon all you want if you\u2019re telling me someone else is showing up to help around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it,\u201d Sorrow said.</p> <p>As Helen began to rail in detail about all the various skills their new employee would require, Laura considered the Caller ID on the tavern phone. It was a 212 area code. Manhattan? \u201cHey, Helen. You never said who called.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked annoyed to be interrupted. \u201cHe said he was from the History Network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said what?\u201d Laura exploded into action, seeing in a flash a whole new world of possibilities.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>By the time Laura took the turnoff to Timber Road, her mind was going a million miles a minute, and unfortunately the car was going a little faster than it should\u2019ve been, too. Gravel spat under her tires as she brought the Beemer to an abrupt stop in the ranch\u2019s parking lot.</p><p>A couple of the construction workers hooted at her daredevil entrance. She really should sell the thing and buy something much more practical for mountain living\u2014a nice SUV, or a Jeep maybe\u2014but she was having a hard time parting with the thing. She\u2019d left San Francisco with her tail between her legs, but she\u2019d bought that sedan fair and square, working her butt off for every last payment. It was a symbol of her meager successes, and she wasn\u2019t ready to part with it yet. Other successes had been just too hard to come by.</p><p>But then she caught sight of Eddie\u2019s ridiculously giant pickup\u2014it was a godawful vehicle. Maybe the BMW was just the thing.</p><p>Eddie. She shaded her eyes, looking for him among the other workers.</p><p>She bit her cheek not to grin\u2014she felt like she\u2019d already won the battle. It had been the History Network who\u2019d called. The execs had raved about Sierra Falls, the lodge, and the discovery of letters from her three-times-great-grandmother that\u2019d uncovered much about the famous California figure Buck Larsen.</p><p>They were interested in her family\u2019s lodge. Not Eddie\u2019s Slumber Ranch.</p><p>She squinted, trying to make sense of what she was seeing. Workmen roved the rooftop of the ranch house. It\u2019d been only a few days since her last argument with Eddie\u2014surely she wasn\u2019t too late. Had they begun building another story already?</p><p>She peered harder, shading her eyes from the sun. The home really was a beautiful old girl\u2014like something from one of those aged sepia photos of the Wild West. It had a low, flat roof, with no-nonsense posts and pillars hammered together at right angles. A porch wrapped around the front, adorned with old wagon wheels in various states of decay. Part of the fa\u00e7ade had been torn away, and though she was sure it\u2019d been necessary to repair the extensive damage years of snow and ice would\u2019ve done, still, the sight sickened her. She was protective of her town, and nothing more symbolized the heart of Sierra Falls than a turn-of-the-century building like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d a friendly voice shouted from above.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack.\u201d She knew she could take her issues up with Eddie\u2019s brother\u2014after all, it was Jessup Brothers, plural\u2014but she found she mostly wanted to continue the conversation with Eddie. \u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little brother? He\u2019s off in the woods, no thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making the man nuts. He\u2019s somewhere out there now, with his surveying equipment.\u201d Jack gestured into the distance. \u201cGot it in his head to check all the property lines. Again. Said we have you to thank for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He began to make his way toward the ladder. \u201cYou need me to come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no need. Thanks, Jack. I\u2019ll go find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. He\u2019s been making stupid mistakes, distracted. Doesn\u2019t help with that phone of his buzzing every two minutes, and don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know it\u2019s you hounding him. He said you\u2019re in a lather about something.\u201d Jack gestured into the distance. \u201cI told him to stay out there and take a long lunch.\u201d</p><p>Distracted. She didn\u2019t realize guys like Eddie had a conscience. Did it mean she\u2019d begun to get through to him after all?</p><p>As she wandered away from the house toward the tree line, the beauty of the place struck her. She didn\u2019t consider herself a big outdoorsy woman\u2014she must\u2019ve driven by the place thousands of times, but never once had she explored beyond what was visible from the road\u2014but the property really was quite pretty. A creek curved over the land like a ribbon, sparkling in the sunlight. Summer had coaxed every color of the rainbow, and a carpet of green, red, and yellow grasses lined its banks, dotted with blue, pink, purple, and white Sierra wildflowers. Scattered pine trees in a deep green flanked the water on either side, and the mountains rose in the far distance, feeling ancient and wise. Thin veins of white dappled a few of the peaks\u2014snow that had yet to melt.</p><p>The closer she got to the water, the more distant the construction became. Instead of the sounds of sawing and shouts, she heard only the lazy splash of slow-moving creek water, the sound of tall summer grasses swaying, birds chirping. She might not\u2019ve been a nature girl, but even she couldn\u2019t deny how idyllic it all was. She stopped to take a moment, shutting her eyes and inhaling deeply. Feeling the sun on her face was both the simplest and the most profound of pleasures.</p><p>\u201cLovely, huh?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Eddie\u2019s voice was a low rasp, and her skin beaded at the sound of it. Bracing herself, she opened her eyes. He\u2019d appeared next to her, standing in his jeans, dirt-smudged T-shirt, and old work boots, looking as rugged as the land. Momentarily speechless, she stood there, inadvertently sharing this quiet with him. She had the odd thought that the blood in her veins felt as enlivened as that babbling water.</p><p>She cleared her throat, looking away to stare at the creek instead. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re here to tell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to tell me if we develop any further we\u2019ll be invaded by people come to cut all the flowers and fish out the creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, Laura.\u201d He took off his ball cap, scraped his hand through his hair, then adjusted it back on his head. Despite the shade it provided, sun marked his face, in faint lines around his eyes and mouth. He\u2019d clearly spent a lot of time outdoors, squinting and smiling\u2014smiles that, lately, were rarely directed at her.</p><p>She glanced away, gathering herself. \u201cNot very hard, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI measured and remeasured the property line. I even looked into rules about building near conservancy land. I\u2019m listening, Laura. What else do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>That took her aback. She finally looked, really looked him in the eyes. They were a sparkling blue in the sunlight, looking even bluer for his tanned skin and brown hair. In that instant, her traitorous mind came up with one answer. Kiss me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She gathered herself, and standing rigidly upright, looked away. \u201cI\u2019ve got news, Eddie. Big news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a call earlier. From the History Network.\u201d</p><p>He looked momentarily baffled. \u201cYou mean, like on cable TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you know, the History Network. \u2018Bringing the past to life,\u2019 that one?\u201d This was her big moment, the most success she\u2019d had since losing her job, and she found she wanted it\u2014needed it\u2014more than ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, cool. What\u2019d they want?\u201d Something about the surprise on his face was deeply gratifying.</p><p>\u201cThey found out about all the Buck Larsen stuff,\u201d she said, referring to the letters Sorrow had found, revealing the secret affair between their ancestor and one of the most famous figures from California history. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about doing a documentary on the town.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing like the interest of a television network to feel like validation. She\u2019d been working her fingers to the bone\u2014it was what the Baileys did\u2014and her efforts had brought their family business to the brink of real success. Finally, she\u2019d have her chance to make up for her past failures. She could prove to herself, prove to the world, just how talented she could be.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news,\u201d he said, sounding actually genuine. \u201cSorrow might\u2019ve found those letters, but the rest is all you, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, she stammered, \u201cI...yeah...thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Laura, congrats. I hope Bear understands what he has in you.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected warmth broke down a wall she\u2019d had erected since junior high. No longer able to monitor her excitement, she found herself revealing more. \u201cWe\u2019ve been booked solid ever since the call. Film types are flying out from LA, if you can believe it. Dad even let us hire someone to help around the place. We\u2019re on the brink of something real, with the lodge, I mean. We\u2019re so close to becoming something big, or at least, you know, bigger than just a run-down family operation. This would really put us on the map. So now you really do have a reason to call it off with Fairview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all awesome,\u201d he said, but his voice sounded suddenly strained. \u201cI\u2019m excited for you.\u201d He grew quiet and stared at the ground, kicking at a rock.</p> <p>If he was so excited, then why couldn\u2019t he look her in the eye? She pressed him. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t see how it affects this project.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment choked her, a pained, self-consciousness that sizzled through her till her cheeks burned with it. Why had she just told him all that stuff? Why had she thought he\u2019d understand?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d She turned and stabbed a finger back in the direction of the ranch house. Distance made it seem even older\u2014but for the men swarming the roof, she might\u2019ve been looking through a window back in time. \u201cYou can\u2019t change something that\u2019s historic, you know, when the History Network is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got permits,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed a contract. We\u2019re all buttoned up, no matter how many times I remeasure the place. Look, I\u2019m glad things are turning around for you. People will always want to stay at the Big Bear. I genuinely hope this Fairview thing doesn\u2019t hurt you. I really do believe that maybe it\u2019ll even bring in more business for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really believe that,\u201d she cut in. With a sharp exhale, she took a few steps closer to the water. Stupid Fairview would probably build a little bridge over the creek\u2014a silly-looking faux Japanese Zen thing, that people would stand on and flick their cigarette butts from.</p> <p>How could the sight of all this nature make her feel better and so much worse at the same time? The low, loud rumble of a saw cut through the air, followed by a sharp crack. It galvanized her.</p><p>Everything she\u2019d worked so hard for was falling apart. She was falling apart. Just when she\u2019d made peace with Sierra Falls, it would be taken from her.</p><p>She burst forward, needing to be closer to the creek, to touch it for herself. Fed by the snowmelt, it would be cold, and she wanted to dip her hand in and pluck out a stone to skip across its surface. Why had she once resented all this so much? Why had it taken her so long to see how these mountains brought her such peace? She\u2019d fled for the city, but it was here that she knew herself. Her throat burned with emotion, but she refused to get emotional in front of Eddie Jessup. She put more distance between them, wandering closer to the banks, walking in among the thigh-high grasses.</p><p>\u201cLaura,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>She spun a slow circle. \u201cHow can you build on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I trespassing now?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and it was an aggravating sound. \u201cNot hardly. I just want you to watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou refuse to see what\u2019s in front of you.\u201d</p><p>He approached. \u201cBelieve me, I see.\u201d There was a husky, suggestive note in his voice, and it made her defiant.</p><p>The damned man\u2014why did he have to do that? She whirled around and plunged deeper into the grass. This time, when he called for her to stop, she ignored it. Instead, she challenged over her shoulder, \u201cWhen was the last time you really saw how pretty this all is?\u201d</p><p>It was so exhilarating to reconnect with the land she\u2019d known as a child. She\u2019d spent so many years chasing other things\u2014how had she forgotten this? She plunged into the waist-high grass, stroking her hand along the tips of leaves.</p><p>His hands were hard, grabbing her shoulders. \u201cJesus, Laura. Stop.\u201d</p><p>She flinched away. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>He began to walk backward, pulling her with him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in a field of poison oak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She stopped her struggling and froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison oak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. In the fall.\u201d He scooped her up and simply carried her out.</p><p>She stiffened in his arms, shoving against him. He was hard and strong, and the heat of his body burned through his T-shirt. She fought dueling urges, wanting to either shove away from that hard chest or simply give up and curl into it. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>Why did she keep feeling embarrassed in front of him? Exposed? She had the stupidest urge to cry, and she never cried in front of people.</p><p>Eddie ignored her and instead calmly said, \u201cFor the record, I see how pretty this place is every day. Almost as pretty as you,\u201d he added, a hot whisper in her ear. \u201cCome on.\u201d His voice was gentle as he put her down, but he didn\u2019t take his arm from her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve got some stuff back at the house that\u2019ll wash off the worst of it. But we\u2019ve only got about twenty minutes before you start to have a reaction.\u201d</p><p>As they emerged from the grass, she looked down at her clothes in dismay\u2014a pair of khaki shorts and flip-flops. Was it her imagination, or was her skin already crawling with itchiness? She realized he\u2019d been eyeing her, too, and she gave him her best glare.</p><p>He laughed, damn him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what were you thinking, city girl...wandering into a patch of poison oak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know that was poison oak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know the saying?\u201d</p><p>She tried to storm ahead, but he kept pace. \u201cI thought it was \u2018leaves of three, okay for me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, goof. \u2018Leaves of three, let it be.\u2019\u201d He opened the passenger door of his truck. \u201cGet in. I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and he simply took her waist and hoisted her high onto the seat. She had to shove a couple of rain jackets and a pile of blankets out of the way. \u201cWhat do you need all this stuff for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe great outdoors, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you stow it in the back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d get wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rain gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm,\u201d was his only, maddening reply before shutting her door and walking around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>She craned around, peering out the little rear window, and saw that there already was gear in the back. A toolbox, some tent poles, and a giant set of waders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trusting,\u201d she told him the moment he got in. \u201cThat stuff would last twenty seconds parked in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get a lid for the truck bed.\u201d</p><p>He turned the ignition, and the truck rumbled to life. He put it in gear, and they bounced and jostled out of the rocky lot.</p><p>She braced a hand on the dash. \u201cThis thing is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a V-8 engine. Over four hundred horses under the hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she grumbled. She\u2019d have protested more, but already she felt a prickling sensation. It was probably just adrenaline, but her legs were shaky with it.</p><p>When he pulled onto the main road, she demanded, \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m taking you to my place.\u201d He reached across the bench, and with a casual confidence that rattled her, he swept the hair from her face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, beautiful. I\u2019ll take care of your legs.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>He pulled into his driveway and hopped out of the truck, headed to the passenger side. He felt intensely self-conscious that she was seeing his cabin for the first time. He wished for her to like it but braced for some sassy comment to spill from her pretty mouth instead. Preoccupied, he plucked her down from the high bench seat.</p><p>She twisted in his arms to give him a funny look. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to carry me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He put her down with a laugh he hoped didn\u2019t sound nervous. Why was he so uncomfortable all of a sudden? He\u2019d had scads of women at his cabin, so why was this one any different? \u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Who was he kidding? He knew why he was self-conscious. It was because the girl was so damned judgmental. He took the porch stairs in two quick steps, unlocking the front door. \u201cIt\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t follow him in, he peeked back out to find her staring at the cabin, an unreadable look on her face. Here it came. \u201cWhat, Laura? Did you think I lived in a cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d The smile she gave him made it impossible to get too mad. Then she shocked him by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of...darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Seriously?\u201d He joined her on the porch. It was a small thing, just one bedroom, one bath, a small kitchen and living area, with a wall of windows and a panoramic mountain view to knock your socks off. It wasn\u2019t anything good for raising a family, but just right for a confirmed bachelor like him. \u201cI built it myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet out.\u201d She stepped away to get a better look at his face. \u201cSeriously? You built this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d He laughed at her dumbstruck expression. \u201cWhere do you think homes come from, sugar? Men build them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it all by yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack and Scott helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close with your brothers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is.\u201d He nodded thoughtfully. It wasn\u2019t something he thought about much, but his brothers were part of who he was. \u201cThe four of us, we\u2019re tight. Though we don\u2019t see Doctor Mark nearly enough\u2014he spends most of his time in his condo in Silver City. And then there\u2019s Jack...working with him every day, well, we do our share of bickering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike fighting about whether you should remeasure the property line?\u201d Something in her eyes had shuttered as she said it.</p><p>They\u2019d had a moment where they\u2019d actually connected, but that was it. Just a moment was all it would ever be with Laura, and it was too bad. He headed inside. \u201cCome on. We don\u2019t have much time. If you\u2019re going to have a reaction, it\u2019ll set in quick.\u201d</p> <p>He felt her follow him into the bathroom and grabbed the special scrub from the cabinet. When she didn\u2019t say anything, he gave her an urging look, gesturing toward the tub. \u201cGo ahead. Sit on the edge there.\u201d She looked like a trapped animal, so he clarified, \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t some elaborate way to get in your shorts.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>She sat warily on the edge of the tub, and those shorts tugged higher than should\u2019ve been legal. Suddenly, his tiny bathroom wasn\u2019t nearly big enough to contain him, her, and those mile-long legs. He went and ran the bathwater, shoving his whole arm into the cold stream as he waited for it to warm up. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He opened the tube and rubbed the gritty cream between his hands. At her questioning look, he said, \u201cThis breaks up the oil. We\u2019ve got only a few minutes before it sinks in for good. If you scrub with this stuff before the poison soaks in, sometimes it can minimize the allergic reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had poison oak more times than I can count,\u201d he said, happy to have something he could reasonably answer.</p> <p>She smiled wickedly, asking in a singsong voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you know the saying?\u201d Mimicking his words from earlier.</p><p>\u201cCity girl visits one creek bank and suddenly she\u2019s an expert.\u201d The cream was warmed in his palms. He held his hands out. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He replayed his words in his head. \u201cWhat did I do wrong now?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018City girl.\u2019\u201d She wore a peculiarly bereft look on her face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he told her cautiously. He took a calf in his hands and began to rub. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It took every effort of concentration to keep his face a careful blank. With the cream in his hands, his touch slid up those tight calves, and he fantasized what might happen in another lifetime, if Laura didn\u2019t hate him, if he were the sort of man she\u2019d let slide his hands up her legs, to get a peek at what she hid under that cute little outfit.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she moaned, and thank God she\u2019d shut her eyes, because his jeans just pulled way tighter than usual. \u201cThat feels great.\u201d</p> <p>He managed some sort of grunt in response, but clearly she wasn\u2019t aware of his situation, because she blithely continued, \u201cSo, you never answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestion?\u201d With her eyes shut, he could stare unabashedly, and damn, she was pretty. So pretty. Normally her hair was done to perfection, but the wind had blown it into sexy wisps framing her face, with errant strands on her forehead and tucked behind her ears. It was a little darker than Sorrow\u2019s, with brown streaks among the yellow. He imagined gently twining his fingers through it. He\u2019d cup her cheeks and kiss her, long and slow.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019ve gotten so much poison oak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He came to, registering her question. \u201cOh, that. Well, sometimes, hiking, you know, you miss it. Or, if I\u2019m on my mountain bike and hit a patch, I can\u2019t help it.\u201d He rubbed the cream over her knee, on up to her thigh. It was as smooth and sleek and taut as it looked. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered, then caught himself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to say it, and it\u2019d been under his breath, but she\u2019d heard. She opened her eyes, focusing instantly on him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, uh, damn, because...\u201d Meeting her gaze like that, he realized just how close he\u2019d edged to her. He glanced down and smudged aside a bit of the cream, revealing a swatch of skin. It already looked an angry red. \u201cAw, damn, darlin\u2019. A rash is appearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She slouched forward for a peek, looking defeated. \u201cDamn is right.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to kiss her forehead and tell her she\u2019d be okay. He\u2019d put her on his bed, and bring her a tray of food, and ice her skin, and massage her with creams, and keep her company, taking care of her till she was better.</p><p>His cell buzzed, and he quickly washed off his hands, happy for an excuse to grab a little air. \u201cKeep rubbing. We\u2019ve got to break down the oil.\u201d</p><p>He gave a quick check to the Caller ID. Hell. It was Hunter Fox, with impeccable timing. \u201cMister Fox,\u201d he answered quietly.</p><p>He was painfully aware of Laura\u2019s eyes on him, and how the one-sided conversation would\u2019ve sounded to her:</p><p>\u201cA what?</p><p>\u201cIn the Sierras?</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean a hot tub?\u201d</p><p>As the conversation progressed, the clouds in Laura\u2019s expression grew darker. She was rinsing off her legs, looking angry as a wet cat.</p><p>\u201cThat, too?</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose we can dig for a pool.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the phone shut, silently cursing those stupid dot-com people who\u2019d sold to Fairview in the first place. There was a ton of young Internet money in the foothills, parcels of land owned by people who didn\u2019t remember how many houses they owned or where. Why couldn\u2019t Fairview have pursued them instead? Why\u2019d they have to come sniffing around Sierra Falls?</p><p>Laura verbally accosted him the moment he\u2019d clicked off. She\u2019d clearly understood the gist of the call. \u201cThey want you to add a pool? Who swims in a pool in the Sierras? They\u2019ll be able to use it, what, one, maybe two months a year? Have they ever been here in the winter? It\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>And so was the tone of her voice. Cold enough to chill him to his bones.</p><p>He sighed heavily, back to square one. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a pool, now does it, Laura?\u201d</p><p>But when he dared risk meeting her eyes, what he saw there speared him. Laura stood, a towel clenched in her hands, visibly holding herself together. She looked so sad, so alone in her despair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI can\u2019t lose. I need this. The past few years have been such a mess. I need to succeed. For once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura, you have a TV network coming to film here. If that\u2019s not success, then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Fairview has all the money in the world to throw at this project. Whatever I do, they\u2019ll come in and do better. Bigger. How can I ever compete?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know the answer. There was no beating a competitor like Fairview. He just wished he could make her see how, to him, whether she was wildly successful didn\u2019t matter. \u201cYou\u2019re a winner, Laura. You always have been. Losing against Fairview won\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>His intentions had been good, but it was obvious his words weren\u2019t.</p><p>She bristled. \u201cA winner? Seriously? What are you, a motivational speaker? You don\u2019t get it, Eddie. I can\u2019t lose.\u201d She tossed the towel on the bathroom floor and strode down the hall to the front door. \u201cTake me back to my car.\u201d</p><p>He checked the time on his cell. \u201cI gotta go, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Back to Reno for you? You\u2019re always running off. The mistress getting impatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mistress, Laura.\u201d Was that really what she thought of him? The only thing she\u2019d ever think of him? He met her at the door with a tired sigh. \u201cMaybe one of these days you\u2019ll open your eyes and see things for how they really are.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Laura was driving probably a little faster than she should\u2019ve been, but she knew these roads as only a local would, anticipating the exact moment to downshift to second for the turn, when to pop it back to third, and smoothly into fourth.</p><p>The scent of grocery store flowers overpowered the car and made her nose twinge. She cracked a window. She was anxious, at sea, over her head, not to mention ready to crawl out of her skin. She was too proud to admit the full extent of her despair to her family, and yet she craved comfort. She longed to be someplace she could feel like a kid again. A safe place.</p><p>Lately, with Eddie sniffing around, and Helen having tantrums, and Dad hassling her, and Sorrow and Billy taking every spare moment to play kissy-face, the lodge and tavern felt far from safe. But she did know one place she could find it.</p><p>Finally she slowed way down to pull into the Kidds\u2019 driveway\u2014it\u2019d do no good to shock the sisters with peeling tires and spitting gravel. As it was, the last time she\u2019d seen them, she\u2019d been agitated and impatient, and she regretted it. She owed them an apology, and a thanks, too.</p><p>Though nothing had come from having Eddie remeasure the property line, it\u2019d stalled him a little, and for that she was grateful. The idea had come from Ruby and Pearl. She got the feeling that despite the fact Eddie was their grandnephew, they didn\u2019t look askance at badgering a man every once in a while.</p><p>Girl power, the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Ruby had heard her drive up and came to stand on the front porch to greet her. She clutched the zippered front of her pastel blue seersucker housedress as if bracing a winter\u2019s chill instead of a pleasant July morning. \u201cLaura Bailey, you tell me everything\u2019s okay with your poppa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took her a second to understand, and then she quickly put the woman\u2019s mind at ease. \u201cOf course. We\u2019re all fine. I just wanted to stop by and say hi.\u201d</p><p>The way the woman looked at her made Laura wonder, was the friendly gesture such a shock?</p><p>She went around to the passenger side and grabbed the bouquet of flowers she\u2019d brought. There wasn\u2019t a florist around for miles, so the daisy-carnation mix from the Raley\u2019s in Silver City would have to do. \u201cYou and Pearl were so sweet, and I was such a crazy woman when I came to see you at the hall.\u201d</p> <p>Pearl appeared behind her sister. \u201cIs that Edith?\u201d She adjusted her glasses.</p><p>\u201cLaura Bailey\u2019s come to pay us a visit.\u201d Ruby gave her sister a weighty look.</p><p>She kept the smile pasted on her face. This was getting ridiculous. Really, it couldn\u2019t have been so very shocking to see her pay a friendly visit, could it?</p><p>\u201cFlowers?\u201d Pearl stepped forward, and the screen door slammed behind her.</p><p>\u201cFor us?\u201d asked Ruby.</p> <p>\u201cOf course. I wanted to thank you for helping me with the building stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Pearl exclaimed.</p><p>Ruby looked too nervous to accept. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did.\u201d When neither sister took the flowers, Laura simply walked inside and brought them to the kitchen to snip the stems and put them in water.</p><p>Sunlight shone through the curtains, and though the yellow gingham was faded with age, it was no less cheery. She let go a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time,\u201d Pearl told her as she led them into the sunroom.</p> <p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d Ruby repeated. \u201cWe were sitting down to tea.\u201d She pointed to the side table, which bore a plate of sweets and a teapot that probably contained the same Lipton they\u2019d been serving since she was a kid. \u201cPearl even made a plate of fancies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made these?\u201d She studied the homemade petit fours, momentarily tempted. There were several of them, each a tiny little cake with a hard frosting shell in pale pink or white. They were a bit lumpy and uneven but looked yummy nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cPearl did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She took one for her plate to be polite, choosing a white one with an uneven pink bow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple pound cake,\u201d Pearl said proudly.</p><p>Ruby beamed. \u201cBut it looks like more, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to use almond cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the taste was too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlmonds are a flavor best reserved for liqueur,\u201d Pearl finished, and the ladies tittered.</p><p>It was the Kidd sisters in a new light. She made a note to bring a bottle of Amaretto instead of flowers next time.</p><p>As Ruby poured their tea, Pearl leaned forward and put her hand on Laura\u2019s knee. \u201cYou tell us. That old Wexler ranch still giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>She plucked a few packets of Sweet\u2019N Low from a decorative dish. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brows.\u201d Ruby offered her the cup. \u201cYou keep frowning like that and you\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to mind the elevens,\u201d Pearl said, rubbing between her eyebrows to explain. She turned to her sister. \u201cRemember how Emerald used to use those things at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrownies,\u201d Ruby exclaimed. \u201cOur Laura could use some Frownies.\u201d</p><p>Pearl nodded. \u201cLook into it, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She consciously tried to smooth her brow and relax as she blew on her tea.</p><p>\u201cYou need another.\u201d Pearl plucked a pink petit four and put it on Laura\u2019s plate. \u201cNothing like a little sugar to soothe the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Ruby urged. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have fancies for your tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked it once, I\u2019ve asked a thousand times, how do you women not weigh a thousand pounds?\u201d She let herself take the tiniest nibble and for a moment was transported to another place, one that was sweet and innocent, that allowed time for cakes and tea. Her next breath was deeper, her shoulders easing just a bit. \u201cOh, that is good.\u201d</p><p>They were light and sweet and airy, and she wanted more. A lot like Eddie\u2019s smiles.</p><p>She scrunched her face against the sudden and treasonous thought.</p><p>The sisters nodded as though witnessing some essential truth coming to light. \u201cYou see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow tell us what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs our Eddie still giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that boy done now?\u201d</p><p>She decided another bite wouldn\u2019t hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s what he hasn\u2019t done,\u201d she said, swallowing. \u201cNamely, he hasn\u2019t told those Fairview people where they can...\u201d She stopped herself, hearing Sorrow\u2019s warning in her head. Language. \u201cWhere they can build their ridiculous resort instead of Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>The women hmm\u2019ed thoughtfully. Ruby dunked a corner of her petit four into her teacup and took a delicate bite. \u201cDid you check the work permits like we said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have him remeasure the property?\u201d chimed Pearl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d Ruby snapped her fingers. \u201cConservancy land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Pearl said with widened eyes. \u201cThat property backs up onto conservancy land, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>But Laura didn\u2019t get excited. \u201cNope, I looked into that. I looked into all of it. There\u2019s no stopping them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I heard television people were coming out,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not looking at the big picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like him.\u201d Eddie, Eddie, Eddie...she heard his voice everywhere.</p><p>She\u2019d gone in there having sworn to avoid their sweets but decided this particular topic called for another. Besides, chewing gave her extra time to think.</p><p>The sisters exchanged a look that wasn\u2019t lost on Laura.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Pearl began, and Ruby finished, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us what our nephew said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me I don\u2019t see things how they really are. Can you believe it?\u201d She took another petit four and popped the whole thing in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he has a point, dear,\u201d Pearl said kindly.</p><p>What? Sudden emotion clutched her throat, and she had to swallow twice to get the little cake down. \u201cI know how things really are.\u201d</p><p>The sisters nodded knowingly. Ruby said, \u201cThere was a day when I thought so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us,\u201d added Pearl.</p><p>\u201cWe were real firecrackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>Ruby clucked. \u201cHow to do things. How not to do things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Emmy, though.\u201d</p><p>They sighed in unison, remembering their sister, who\u2019d recently passed. \u201cEmerald was never afraid to be soft,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cTo be...what\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVulnerable,\u201d Pearl said.</p><p>Ruby nodded. \u201cVulnerable. Emerald let herself need people. And look. Of the three of us, she\u2019s the only one who found love.\u201d</p><p>Laura refused to accept that she was destined to live a loveless life. \u201cYeah, but then Emerald was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a different story,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cShe knew love, though. Once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what we wouldn\u2019t give to say the same.\u201d</p><p>Pearl reached out and took her sister\u2019s trembling hand. \u201cTo have a child like she had. Emerald had Marlene. Had four strapping grandsons.\u201d</p><p>She focused on her tea. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in men right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll wake up one day and find that you\u2019re eighty years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust us,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cIt happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t seem to...balance it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d Ruby spotted it instantly.</p><p>She blinked hard. She never cried in public, and now she\u2019d been caught twice in one week. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what my problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, there.\u201d Pearl leaned over to pat her knee. \u201cThe problem is, you\u2019re too much like that petit four.\u201d</p><p>A disbelieving laugh burst from her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cute pink teacakes with bows pretty much summed up everything she wasn\u2019t. She was strong and in control of her destiny...not fluffy and crumbly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Ruby insisted. \u201cHard and pretty on the outside, but soft on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly sweet, too,\u201d Pearl added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d She felt the tears burn and blinked hard to stop them. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cYou work so hard,\u201d Ruby said.</p><p>Pearl interjected, \u201cBut you have to take care not to become hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to act hard to do what I do.\u201d She\u2019d let herself go soft before, and it\u2019d only brought hurt.</p><p>Ruby handed her a clean but rumpled handkerchief. \u201cDon\u2019t let our boy make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie? Eddie is not making me cry.\u201d</p><p>Pearl gave a decisive nod and turned to her sister. \u201cSparks.\u201d</p><p>Ruby hummed. \u201cDefinitely sparks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSparks?\u201d Laura\u2019s voice came out a sharp squeak. She blotted her eyes, the tears gone as fast as they\u2019d come. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re referring to the ranch\u2019s electrical system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou silly goose,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cSparks between you two kids.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d touched her, there sure had been sparks. Forget poison oak, the way his strong hands had moved surely along her thighs, she\u2019d have overlooked a case of leprosy. She blushed, remembering it.</p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Pearl exclaimed. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. Sister, you always see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are definitely no sparks between me and Eddie,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cEddie and me,\u201d Ruby corrected.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a simple trick to remember the grammar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe first is the worst,\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cNever put yourself first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all things,\u201d Pearl said, nodding. \u201cScripture says, \u2018Let each of you look out for the interests of others.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her sister frowned. \u201cAre you certain that\u2019s how it goes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s Philippians, dear.\u201d</p><p>Laura flopped back in the chair, waiting for the women to peter out.</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s Philippians,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cI think the quote is longer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to quote Scripture.\u201d</p><p>Their fire-and-brimstone preacher daddy had schooled them well, but Laura was anxious to get back on track. She put down her saucer, letting it clink louder than necessary on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear,\u201d Ruby said.</p><p>Pearl shrugged. \u201cI forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Her sister frowned. \u201cI was talking to Laura.\u201d</p> <p>Laura waved it off. \u201cEither way, I promise you, there\u2019s nothing between Eddie and me.\u201d But suddenly, a question niggled in the back of her head. She hated it, but she needed to know. She took a nonchalant sip of her tea. \u201cI think he has a girlfriend, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d they exclaimed in unison.</p><p>Ruby shook her head. \u201cNot our Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d know,\u201d Pearl agreed.</p><p>She nodded, though she doubted it. Eddie had probably had hundreds of girlfriends\u2014if you could call them that\u2014since junior high.</p><p>Pearl shook her head. \u201cOur Eddie\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p><p>Sure he is.</p><p>\u201cA good egg,\u201d Ruby agreed.</p> <p>A Neanderthal.</p><p>\u201cSee.\u201d Ruby nudged her sister as they studied her expression.</p><p>Pearl grinned. \u201cShe likes him, I think.\u201d</p><p>Laura sat up straight. \u201cI do not. I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Eddie.\u201d Pearl tittered.</p><p>Ruby tried to hide her grin. \u201cLast time I saw sparks like that, Bear and Edith got engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll have it in spring,\u201d Ruby cooed.</p><p>Pearl gasped. \u201cThe waterfall is so pretty in spring.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave it up. As the sisters smiled and nodded, she considered sparks. Well, of course there were some sparks between them. There always had been. The only thing was, while once Eddie had been just the sexy bad boy, now he was tanned and strong and all man. He looked more delicious than any cake.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t her type.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Helen cleared her last table of the lunch rush. \u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered, seeing the tip. Two dollars on a twenty-dollar check. She pocketed it with a frown. \u201cTen percent. That\u2019ll pay the gas bill, for sure.\u201d</p><p>She carried the dishes into the kitchen, and Billy and Sorrow snapped apart when they saw her. There wouldn\u2019t be many more patrons till dinner, and they\u2019d been taking advantage of the lull by doing some canoodling, Sorrow\u2019s untouched sandwich beside her on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou could get a room,\u201d she said with a smirk. \u201cIt is a lodge, after all.\u201d</p><p>But then her gut churned. Her husband was out there, somewhere. Maybe he\u2019d gotten a room\u2014some seedy place to share with a girlfriend.</p><p>Because there had to be a girlfriend. Why else hadn\u2019t he come home again last night?</p><p>She kept herself looking good, and when that hadn\u2019t worked, she flirted with other men to show him proof of how desirable she could be, but that hadn\u2019t worked, either. She didn\u2019t know what else she could do to make herself attractive to him.</p><p>Billy laughed at her comment, clueless to her turmoil. \u201cA room? Now there\u2019s an idea.\u201d He never took anything personally\u2014he\u2019d been wearing a permanent ear-to-ear grin ever since he and Sorrow had become engaged. He stood behind her now, nibbling her neck as she attacked her sandwich. \u201cWhaddya say? We could get started on that basketball team.\u201d</p><p>Helen loaded up the dishes as quickly as she could. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some space,\u201d she muttered, getting out of there.</p><p>The two of them...it was too hard to watch sometimes. Had she and Rob ever been like that? She thought maybe so, in the early days. They\u2019d ended up with three kids somehow.</p><p>The jokes about Billy and Sorrow\u2019s future kids began after he\u2019d bought her that big Excursion, when Laura wrecked the old car. Helen was happy for them\u2014really she was\u2014but it sure was hard to watch the carefree way Sorrow had taken to that fancy new SUV. The Baileys griped about money, but the way the girl had slid into that new Ford, it seemed like it was nothing for her to have a brand-spanking-new car, like she was entitled to such a thing.</p><p>But then there\u2019d been her own accident around the same time. She\u2019d hit a patch of black ice and slid into another car, and like that, the hood of her old Dodge had folded up like an accordion, no good to nobody. But had Robbie gone out and gotten her the keys to some fancy new car, crowing about how he needed her safe at all costs? No, the man had snapped at her, some distant look on his face, his eyes empty but for an anger she\u2019d begun to see more and more frequently.</p><p>So she\u2019d taken on an extra shift, carrying her own anger, lodged in her heart like a splinter she couldn\u2019t pluck free.</p><p>She grabbed the carafe and made a pass through the dining room, refilling coffees, all the while surreptitiously taking stock of the few women in the room. Are you her? she wondered, studying each face. Are you the woman my Rob is sleeping with?</p><p>The bell on the door dinged, and in walked Damien Simmons. He was unaware of her eyes on him as he scanned the room and chose a booth.</p><p>It was a surprise how he hadn\u2019t stopped coming to the tavern after all that\u2019d passed between his family and the Baileys. She guessed he needed this community more than he let on. He\u2019d taken his breakup with Sorrow better than anyone had expected, though she supposed it was easy not to be too proud when you were as handsome and as rich as Damien.</p><p>His eyes met hers, lasering in like he\u2019d known all along she\u2019d been watching. \u201cHey, Helen, you all right?\u201d</p><p>She caught herself just standing there and jumped into action. \u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d She scampered over to hand him a menu.</p><p>She grabbed the pitcher of ice water and filled his glass. \u201cDo you need to take a look, or is it the usual?\u201d The guy was a fitness freak, and it was always a chef\u2019s salad, hold the bread, and the day\u2019s meat special on the side. \u201cThe dinner special\u2019s not up yet, but we\u2019ve got some pot roast from last night I could serve up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d He gave the menu a quick glance, then handed it back to her. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She brightened her smile\u2014it was what men wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Pretty, smiling faces? And Damien was an especially good tipper, so best not to jeopardize that. \u201cI am, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d She winked.</p><p>The bell on the front door rang, then rang again, but she kept her attention on Damien.</p><p>He shook his head, tsking. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re a married woman, Helen. You and me could run away together.\u201d</p><p>Married...barely. \u201cMaybe in the next life, hon.\u201d</p><p>There was only one man she cared about, and it was her husband, though she could flirt with other men until she was blue in the face and it wouldn\u2019t get him to notice her. Rob knew how chatty she could be with men, and he didn\u2019t care. She imagined that not even the attentions of Damien Simmons, basically the prince of Sierra Falls, would make him jealous.</p><p>\u201cI think those people need menus, Helen.\u201d It was Laura, using her boss voice.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard her come in and felt a spurt of panic. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, trying not to sound too tart about it.</p><p>More and more, she sensed Laura\u2019s critical eye on her. The older Bailey girl was a control freak, and losing this job was the last thing she needed.</p><p>Edith came over to smooth her daughter\u2019s ruffled feathers. \u201cI\u2019m sure Helen\u2019s got it.\u201d She gave a gentle pat to Laura\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>God bless the woman. Sometimes it felt like Edith Bailey was the only reason she still had this job.</p><p>With a last stiff smile to Damien, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go put in your order.\u201d</p><p>She had to brace herself to face the love nest in the kitchen. She was lonely\u2014so lonely her heart ached with it. But as she felt Laura\u2019s eyes bore into her back, she reminded herself this wasn\u2019t her time. Someday down the road she\u2019d figure things out for herself, but for now, she had three kids she needed to take care of. Which meant she had a paycheck to earn.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t give Laura any excuses to fire her.</p><p>She came back out to wipe down tables that didn\u2019t need wiping, and as she worked, she felt Edith approach. Tucking the rag in her apron, she turned to express a quick thanks for earlier, and was surprised to be greeted by a positively gleeful expression on the other woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard?\u201d Edith asked, excitement clear in her voice. \u201cThe History Network is coming to film here. Us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pasted a smile on her face. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that just exciting, how life was starting to happen for everyone but her?</p><p>Laura said from across the room, \u201cEasy, Mom. They\u2019re here to film the town. But yeah, they\u2019ll be staying here. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll get a little footage of the lodge, too.\u201d She came closer, directing her next words at Helen. \u201cWhich means we need to be extra on top of things.\u201d</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? \u201cI always am,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>Laura waved a hand. \u201cWell, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>But Helen wouldn\u2019t let her blow it off. \u201cI don\u2019t, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then. Like your purse,\u201d Laura said, pointing to a cubby under the bar. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong out here. You know I hate when you put your stuff behind the bar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She forced herself to stay calm. Laura had been away for years, living it up or doing whatever she did in the big city, while Helen had been here, helping the Baileys and stashing her bag in that very cubby. \u201cI\u2019ll move my purse. That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt also means that now, more than ever, it\u2019s important for all of us to be on time.\u201d Laura gave her an insincere smile\u2014in a few short months, the woman really had mastered the passive-aggressive boss tone. \u201cThat sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Inside, she fumed. All of us. She was always on time, and those few times she wasn\u2019t had to do with her kids, not because she was out gallivanting around town.</p> <p>Edith hated conflict and piped in cheerily, \u201cHelen\u2019s always on top of things. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Laura told her. \u201cWe just have one other problem.\u201d</p><p>She braced, but Bear barked a laugh from the end of the bar. \u201cJust the one?\u201d He rustled his newspaper, folding it to the next page. \u201cYou ladies let me know when it\u2019s all worked out.\u201d</p><p>With a moan, Laura limped toward a booth. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta sit down.\u201d</p><p>Only then did Helen spot the angry patches of red along the woman\u2019s legs. Momentarily forgetting her irritation, she asked, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoison oak.\u201d Laura gingerly sat down, sticking her feet out so as not to touch her skin to the seat.</p><p>Helen fought not to roll her eyes. That was her problem? That she\u2019d been out hiking and having fun, and she\u2019d gotten a little poison oak? Poor thing.</p><p>Not.</p><p>\u201cIs that the one other problem?\u201d Because if it was, boy could she tell Laura about problems.</p><p>People who had family didn\u2019t get it. They talked about troubles, but how bad could it be if you had family around to share it with? People who loved you and could catch you if you fell.</p><p>She wanted to smack the girl upside her head, to make Laura wake up and appreciate what she had. Because all she had was a no-good, no-show of a husband and a mom who got in touch only when she needed cash.</p> <p>She had her beautiful kids, sure, but she refused to share her burdens with them. If anything, she protected them more than ever. Especially Luke\u2014as her eldest, he was trying to act like the man of the house, and rather than comfort her, mostly it made her feel shame. Her children should\u2019ve been able to act like children, not taking on adult concerns before their time.</p><p>That there was a problem. Not an itchy rash that\u2019d pass in a few days.</p><p>\u201cI need you to do my shift,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI can barely move with these legs.\u201d</p><p>Edith\u2019s face pinched with concern. \u201cYou need calamine, honey.\u201d</p><p>Laura nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to put some on and get back in bed.\u201d</p><p>What Helen wouldn\u2019t do for a day in bed. Instead she said, \u201cSure thing. I\u2019m happy to pick up an extra shift.\u201d What else did she have to do, anyway? She didn\u2019t need to rest. Unable to look at Laura anymore, she went to her station at the end of the bar and began to refill the ketchups.</p><p>\u201cCool, you can just stay on.\u201d Laura glanced at the clock over the bar. \u201cThe early birds should start trickling in soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ll need to run out and get the kids. Drop them at home.\u201d She hated leaving them to fend alone for dinner. Hated leaving them alone at night. But she knew Luke would hold down the fort. He\u2019d make sure everyone took their baths and did their homework. She\u2019d splurge and give him cash enough to order a pizza.</p> <p>\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI made flyers.\u201d She caught her mom\u2019s eye. \u201cWould you grab them? I think I left them in the house kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlyers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got a petition going to stop construction at the old ranch. I\u2019d love it if you put them up at your kids\u2019 school. Or, wait, they\u2019re in two schools, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay camp for summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded tightly. Why explain?</p><p>But it did put her in mind of the fall. Two schools meant twice the work. Until next year, when Emmett would start middle school, and she\u2019d need to figure out how to get them to three different schools.</p><p>She supposed she could put them on the bus, though in a rural school district as sparsely populated and far-reaching as theirs, it\u2019d mean getting out the door a full hour and a half earlier each morning.</p><p>Either way, soon they\u2019d need to scrap all their extracurricular stuff until Luke was old enough to get his learner\u2019s permit. Just the thought of that gave her chills.</p><p>\u201cEven better. Thanks, Helen.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t recall saying yes, but she didn\u2019t see as she had any other choice. But that was how Helen operated. She was a hard worker\u2014always had been.</p><p>Unlike Laura, who was a wuss. Laura, who\u2019d been taken care of her whole life. Laura couldn\u2019t deal with a little itchy skin. A week off in bed, well good for her.</p><p>The bell dinged as a good-looking stranger walked in. What she wouldn\u2019t do for a week in bed with a fine man like this.</p><p>With her husband.</p><p>She gulped back the pang and greeted him, grabbing a menu and gesturing to a booth in the corner. Helen gave him her biggest smile, thinking she knew all about itches she couldn\u2019t scratch.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Laura had spent the past couple of weeks scratching, writhing, fuming, but mostly she\u2019d been hiding. Not that she couldn\u2019t deal with a stupid thing like poison oak, but she couldn\u2019t bear to see Eddie\u2014at least not until she could wear shorts again without worrying that she resembled a leper.</p><p>She\u2019d felt a nightmarish riot of feelings last time she\u2019d seen him. First, there\u2019d been embarrassment at the whole wandering-through-a-field-of-poisonous-weeds thing\u2014she\u2019d felt so stupid. But Eddie\u2019s tender ministrations had somehow pierced the guard she usually erected whenever he was around. Sitting on the edge of the tub, hearing the genuine concern in his voice, she\u2019d thought for a moment that maybe she\u2019d been wrong about him. Maybe they could find common ground.</p><p>And then he\u2019d touched her. How he\u2019d touched her. The man worked with his hands, and wow, did he know how to use them. Her face flushed hot at the memory.</p><p>Under the touch of those hands, all broad and strong, she\u2019d instantly forgotten her nervousness, her aggravation...as one itchy sensation was replaced by a whole other itch.</p><p>One that she hadn\u2019t had scratched in far too long.</p><p>Her chat with the Kidd sisters had haunted her. There were sparks, sure enough. The old attraction between them was stronger than ever. His touch on her had been too hot. He\u2019d had the upper hand\u2014literally\u2014and she\u2019d almost forgotten why she\u2019d gone to his work site in the first place.</p><p>But then he\u2019d gotten that phone call, and overhearing his conversation had instantly pulled her back to reality. A pool? Whose bright idea was it to put an outdoor pool in the mountains? Though she was sure Fairview would figure out a way to heat the thing. More than that, they\u2019d probably install hot tubs, a slide, diving boards...her imagination had gone wild in the days since. How could their family lodge ever compete with a diving board?</p><p>When he\u2019d hung up, she could tell he felt guilty. She\u2019d seen in it his eyes. It was the look of a dog who\u2019d known he\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>\u201cDog,\u201d she grumbled. He was a dog just like the rest of them. She had plans, and never again would she let a guy get in the way.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no denying those sparks. Her chat with the sisters had planted a seed she hadn\u2019t wanted to consider, though she found she wanted to poke at it, anyway. To tease and test, seeing just how far she could push these sparks. To use them to her benefit.</p><p>She studied herself in the mirror. Her rash had faded into faint pink swatches, her legs once more ready for prime time. She stepped into her lucky skirt\u2014she was off to battle, and her hot little denim mini was her secret weapon.</p><p>The skirt had gone out of style a few years ago, but Eddie wouldn\u2019t know fashion if it hit him over the head. Men had always responded well to the way the jeans skirt clung to her hard-earned shape, and she donned it like armor.</p><p>She had her petition in one hand\u2014it\u2019d garnered dozens of signatures\u2014and grabbed her strappiest sandals in the other. She was off to work it.</p><p>Eddie would be open to seeing her, too. She\u2019d heard reports of how he\u2019d come around the tavern looking for her. As if. He\u2019d probably come around to rub her nose in his triumph. Well, after she was done with him, he wouldn\u2019t know what hit him.</p><p>\u201cDirty, no-good dog,\u201d she said with a smile, eyeing her backside one last time in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d Sorrow knocked on her bedroom door. \u201cLaura?\u201d</p><p>She swung open the door, a general ready for assault. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Sorrow took a step back. \u201cYou are good.\u201d She glanced down at Laura\u2019s freshly shaved legs. \u201cYour legs look great. But why so dolled up? You headed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, errands.\u201d She breezed to the stairs, and Sorrow followed her down. \u201cI\u2019ve got some business.\u201d She waved several pages of signatures triumphantly. \u201cJessup business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl.\u201d Sorrow paused on the landing. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could help out in the tavern today? Helen is starting to pull some attitude about you taking time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is with her?\u201d Laura had worked hard all her life\u2014was the woman going to begrudge her a little rest? And it wasn\u2019t even restful\u2014there\u2019d been times that first week she thought she could\u2019ve clawed her skin off. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sitting around watching soap operas. I\u2019ve been doing a ton of stuff from my computer. Just because I\u2019m not at the tavern pouring iced teas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Sorrow put up a hand to mollify her. \u201cI get it. But until Hope comes up to speed, having an extra employee is more work than not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpeaking of which, where is Hope?\u201d Laura had put their new employee to work immediately, especially when she found out the woman had spent the past few years working in the state capitol. \u201cShe said she\u2019d make some calls for me.\u201d</p><p>Hope was still learning the ropes, but she was smart and a quick study. Besides, she\u2019d practically grown up under their roof, having been Sorrow\u2019s bosom buddy through childhood. Laura had been away at college, so she\u2019d never gotten to know her, though she did remember the two girls griping about the other kids\u2019 teasing. But seriously, a pair of pimple-faced besties with the names Hope and Sorrow? In ninth grade, it\u2019d just been asking for it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the tavern,\u201d Sorrow said, \u201cwhich is where I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d join us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to take a pass. Can\u2019t you manage without me? Those History Network people are coming\u201d\u2014she slid her cell from her purse to check the time\u2014\u201cand between that and this ranch thing, there\u2019s a ton that needs to get done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go over menus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCook whatever you want.\u201d She passed her on the way to the front door. \u201cYou rock, sis. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She swept out and just about crashed into Hope on the porch. \u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>The woman had become Laura\u2019s favorite person the moment she\u2019d let on what she used to do for a living.</p> <p>\u201cI work for CalEPA,\u201d Hope had said quietly. \u201cIn the governor\u2019s office. On the Air Resources Board.\u201d She\u2019d been a soft-spoken thing in high school, too. Good at her studies, not super popular, though not unpretty, either. \u201cI oversaw the Fine Particulate Matter Monitoring Program.\u201d</p><p>Laura had tried not to gape. So that was what bookish girls did when they grew up. \u201cFascinating.\u201d Not. \u201cWhy\u2019d you leave? To work here?\u201d She\u2019d looked at her sister, fighting a growing panic. \u201cShe knows she\u2019ll be making beds and stuff like that, right?\u201d</p><p>But Hope had laughed it off, apparently eager to do exactly stuff like take reservations and make beds if it meant she could get her environmental journalism blog up and running.</p><p>From there, it hadn\u2019t taken Laura long to put two and two together: people who once worked in the governor\u2019s office were people with connections.</p><p>Laura gave a tug to her jeans skirt. She\u2019d been in a rush but was anxious to hear what their new employee had found out. \u201cDid you call Sacramento? Can they do anything about the permit?\u201d She turned to her sister, explaining, \u201cStupid Eddie is now going to build a stupid pool. Apparently, Fairview is adding kickboards and waterslides to their death blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t do that,\u201d Hope said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah! Right?\u201d Laura nodded in vehement agreement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hope said, \u201cI mean it\u2019s possible they really can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow frowned. \u201cAs in, they\u2019re not allowed to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make headway on the permit issue, but I did find out that El Dorado County just approved a ten-million-dollar bond for watershed protection purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d asked Sorrow.</p><p>Laura grinned. \u201cIt means Eddie is doing something illegal.\u201d</p><p>Hope backpedaled, looking panicked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I only spoke with a friend who worked on the legislation. I don\u2019t how it\u2019s enforced or what it means.\u201d</p><p>Laura headed to her car, ready to storm his job site, and the women followed her into the lot. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, that creek might be protected. Might. I don\u2019t know for sure. You could ask Eddie. Does he know anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me. I\u2019m about to find out.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Eddie sat on a boulder on the bank of the creek and checked his watch. Eleven thirty was early for a lunch break\u2014he knew by late afternoon he\u2019d regret having scarfed down his ham and cheese so soon\u2014but he couldn\u2019t focus.</p><p>Something about this project still didn\u2019t smell right, and he\u2019d been dragging his feet. But he\u2019d looked and looked and couldn\u2019t find anything to back up his suspicions. He\u2019d analyzed the property, and while the creek was on conservancy land, the ranch wasn\u2019t, and rules about preexisting structures protected him anyhow.</p><p>He\u2019d also double-checked the historic register and that adaptive reuse paperwork, too, but it all seemed to add up.</p><p>\u201cEddie.\u201d It was Laura, and by the sound of her voice, she\u2019d come with guns blazing. \u201cWe have something to discuss.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. The day was looking up.</p><p>Turning, he sized her up, and his grin turned dark. She wore an outfit that should\u2019ve been on a deadly weapons list. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t my favorite ray of sunshine.\u201d He didn\u2019t know where to look, and his eyes eagerly grazed up a sleek pair of legs, to a tight little skirt, up to her flimsy yellow top. Her shirt didn\u2019t have sleeves, and he wondered if her bra straps might be peeking out\u2014hell, maybe she wasn\u2019t even wearing a bra. A man could hope. \u201cYou look all healed. You here for some afternoon delight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She was a little spitfire, and man how he loved to goad her. \u201cCome closer and I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time for lunch.\u201d He smiled wide as he held up his sandwich. \u201cJoin me. If you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll give you half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come here.\u201d Scowling, she scanned the field between her and the creek bank. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not stepping one foot closer to you.\u201d</p><p>He held a hand to his ear. \u201cCan\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You can hear every word I\u2019m saying, so listen up. Guess who\u2019s doing construction on watershed protected land? You need to stop what you\u2019re doing.\u201d She waved a bunch of papers in the air. \u201cI have signatures from members of the community who agree. This isn\u2019t just about your stupid hotel\u2014it\u2019s the whole ecology of the Sacramento River Basin we\u2019re talking about. This is something we need to look into.\u201d</p><p>We...we. He liked the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear a word you\u2019re saying,\u201d he lied. What color bra strap would be peeking out from under that little tank top? He patted the rock beside him. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta come closer, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She scanned the distance between them, and suddenly she looked so lost and forlorn. He knew a pang of pity followed by a great stab of affection for the pain-in-the-butt city girl. He made a show of putting down his sandwich. \u201cBest hope the bugs don\u2019t eat this by the time I come fetch you.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, on the defensive. \u201cBring your sandwich, I don\u2019t care. We can talk by the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s too pretty out here,\u201d he said, making his way back to her. \u201cPlus there\u2019s door-to-door service.\u201d He scooped her up, and she slammed her hand\u2014hard\u2014into his chest. He laughed, rubbing where she\u2019d hit him. \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrying you to the creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look like he might drop her if she dared him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait.\u201d She had a firm grip on his shoulders now, and he could feel how she didn\u2019t want him to carry her, but she didn\u2019t want to fall, either. \u201cWhat about the poison oak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it up.\u201d He gave a little hoist to his arms, readjusting her. Damn, but she felt good.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He shook his head\u2014what did she take him for? \u201cI tore out every last bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI have an interest in the health and well-being of those legs of yours.\u201d He gave her his broadest smile, cutting her off before she could protest. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t have you getting a rash every time you visit me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cTrust me. This is the last visit, if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>She swatted him, and as she did, some girly scent wafted up to him. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d He nestled her closer, stealing a look at her shoulder. The bra strap was lacy and light pink.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to put me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, sugar.\u201d He reached his goal and put her down. \u201cJust be sure to mind the rattlesnakes.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm with a squeal, and he laughed, fighting the urge to slide his arm around her and give that tanned shoulder a nip. He\u2019d just bet Laura tasted as good as she smelled.</p><p>She shoved him. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do my best.\u201d He sat down, plucking his sandwich from the rock. \u201cI\u2019ll trade you,\u201d he said, offering her half.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You give me a kiss, I\u2019ll give you a bite.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re already hacking apart the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough I can\u2019t decide which I\u2019d rather take. A kiss, or a bite...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious, Neanderthal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I was waiting for that one. You sure you\u2019re okay sitting with Stone Age Man here? I mean, I might chew with my mouth open or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to do, Jessup.\u201d</p><p>He took a jaw-crackingly big bite of his sandwich and assessed her as he chewed. The scrutiny made her look uncomfortable, which made him chew slower. Finally he swallowed and asked, \u201cTo what do I owe this honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She brandished those papers she\u2019d been clutching since her arrival. \u201cI have signatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe petition.\u201d He\u2019d seen it posted on the bulletin board at the grocery store. \u201cYou\u2019re convincing people in Sierra Falls that I\u2019m the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>She only shrugged, letting him fill in the blanks.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cYou do realize I\u2019ll be employing a good number of local men on this project.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, gorgeous.

You need to call Jack right now and tell him he\u2019d better stop hacking off that roof, because I know something that will stop you once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you now?\u201d He cracked open his water bottle and chugged, taking a moment to figure how he was going to play it: angry or easy.</p><p>She sure hadn\u2019t wasted any time laying into him. But she wore a little denim skirt that\u2019d ridden up as she sat, and as he stole a glance at those long legs, he decided he\u2019d opt for cool. It was the skirt\u2019s fault\u2014it robbed a man\u2019s strength.</p><p>He wiped his mouth, calmly telling her, \u201cWe\u2019re not hacking off the roof. Those crossbeams are ancient. We\u2019ve got our engineer out today, checking it out. Hotel or not, it\u2019s something that needs to be done. Can\u2019t have the walls caving in before we even start.\u201d</p><p>That silenced her for a moment, but he saw by the machinations on her face that she was working up to something else.</p><p>\u201cEl Dorado County voted in a watershed protection bond,\u201d she blurted. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing might be illegal. Or, at least, digging for a stupid pool might be.\u201d</p> <p>It took him a moment to register the topic change. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bond was for ten million dollars,\u201d she continued, gaining steam. \u201cAll to protect the watershed. There must be implications for the land surrounding the creek.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply. This job was turning out to be a nightmare, in more ways than one.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want any food?\u201d He dug into his backpack and pulled out a bag of chips. \u201cSea salt and vinegar?\u201d He let his eyes linger over her body\u2014she was a workout fanatic with a tight little body, but it seemed like she\u2019d gotten a little too thin since taking over managing the lodge. \u201cDo you ever eat?\u201d</p><p>She just glared, but he\u2019d caught how her cheeks had flushed at his perusal.</p><p>\u201cNo? Your loss.\u201d He popped a chip in his mouth, giving her a wink.</p> <p>\u201cTen million.\u201d She pressed on, undaunted. She turned away, looking back at the ranch house, and the movement tugged that flimsy yellow top tightly along her curves. \u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is something.\u201d He gave an approving nod\u2014he sure was enjoying this argument. \u201cSomething else.\u201d He looked back up at her pretty face before she caught him staring.</p><p>He really needed to get this under control. He was a professional, dammit.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for Fairview,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s enough to catch their attention.\u201d She pointed toward the mountains lining the horizon\u2014veins of white still capped the highest elevations, the snowmelt providing water for much of Northern California. \u201cYou know as well as I do how that snow melts and fills this creek and trickles down until it eventually becomes the drinking water for all of Sacramento. If people felt strongly enough to vote in favor of a ten-million-dollar bond measure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d he interjected, wondering just how many times the woman could say ten million in a conversation. He wanted to end this chat and get onto more interesting things...like dessert.</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll probably have something to say about all that\u2019s going on in this valley,\u201d she finished sternly.</p><p>He brushed the chip crumbs off his hands and shoved the trash back into his pack. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll look into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...you, what?\u201d</p> <p>The wind had mussed her hair, and a strand had stuck to her mouth, all glossy and girly and pale pink. It took everything he had not to reach out and sweep the hair from her face. He\u2019d bet his new truck that her panties matched the bra and lip gloss.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about bonds?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>He cleared his throat, forcing his eyes back up to meet hers. \u201cI don\u2019t know jack about bonds. But there was one construction project a while back\u2014remember when they had to change the gas station site because of flood potential?\u2014there was talk of watershed back then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll look into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say I will, I will.\u201d Of course he\u2019d look into it\u2014he wanted to do the right thing. He hated being the bad guy in her eyes.</p><p>If he could ditch this whole damned job just to make her happy, he would, but it wasn\u2019t just his business at stake\u2014it was Jack\u2019s, and he owed Jack everything.</p><p>He wanted to get the woman\u2019s mind on other things. Like on himself, for example. She was single-minded, and he had to wonder what it\u2019d be like to have that kind of intense focus aimed at him. Would she ever see him for who he really was?</p><p>\u201cI might be a Neanderthal, but I\u2019m an honorable one. Despite what you might think.\u201d He polished off the rest of his sandwich and, standing, put his hand out. \u201cBut first you need to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>She was instantly on her guard. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, I won\u2019t bite. Yet.\u201d He grinned, and her responding blush gave him the guts to lean down and simply snatch her hand. It was so small in his, he had to force himself not to look at it, to press it to his mouth and kiss it. When she didn\u2019t pull away, he dared give it a little squeeze. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you, you have to stop work. Until we investigate.\u201d She stood, looking like a wary animal.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Just...fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I told you.\u201d He gave her a tug, and she fell into step with him. He dared to sweep his thumb in a quick stroke along the side of her hand\u2014how was it possible to have skin so soft? \u201cBut first I\u2019ve been wanting to show you something.\u201d He grimaced to himself, hearing how ragged his voice had sounded. She was like a skittish colt, and he was going to scare her off.</p><p>Sure enough, she stopped in her tracks, pulling her hand free. \u201cEdwin Jessup, you better not be up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all about the good, darlin\u2019.\u201d But then what she\u2019d said registered, and it was his turn to stop short. \u201cHold on, how\u2019d you know my name is Edwin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are called Eddie, right? Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but most people think it\u2019s Edward.\u201d</p><p>A wicked gleam lit her eyes. \u201cEd-win doesn\u2019t like his na-ame...\u201d She\u2019d said it like it was a grade school taunt.</p><p>Suddenly he was ten again. He looked back toward the ranch house, as though he might find Jack watching. \u201cDid my brothers\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Laura actually smiled at him. \u201cYou forget, dummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDummy?\u201d He grinned back. \u201cYou mean I\u2019ve been upgraded from Neanderthal?\u201d</p><p>She gave his shoulder a nudge. \u201cI\u2019ve known you since kindergarten, so I think I know your name by now. Besides, Edward is the name of a vampire, and sorry, but you are so not vampiric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s my line.\u201d He nudged her back. Who knew letting Laura tease him would be the way to break through her shell? \u201cAll right, Laura Edith Bailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cThat makes me feel like my mom.\u201d But then she stopped short, the laugh frozen in her throat. Her hand seized into a death grip in his. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, staring at some greenery along the trail.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a fern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d He pulled her closer, tucking her arm in his, and she actually allowed it. \u201cHow\u2019d you ever survive?\u201d As they\u2019d grown up in a small mountain town, the need for a basic understanding of the outdoors was a given. From a young age, they\u2019d been taught how to build a snow fort, what to do if lost in the woods, all that. \u201cHow did you grow up in Sierra Falls not knowing this stuff? I mean, that was you I knew as a kid, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gave him a snide look. \u201cBut don\u2019t forget, that was also me who, pretty much from fifth grade on, was counting down the days till I could flee for the city.\u201d</p><p>He spotted a cluster of mushrooms at the foot of a particularly big pine. \u201cWait, see those? Don\u2019t ever eat those.\u201d Suddenly everything seemed potentially perilous for the city girl.</p><p>\u201cJeez, I get poison oak once, and now I\u2019m an idiot. Of course I know not to eat random mushrooms in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust gotta make sure.\u201d He spotted a jagged ridge of poison oak growing along the creek, and he pointed that out, too. \u201cThere, there\u2019s some more. Do you see it? Three leaves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stop pointing it out to me,\u201d she said after he\u2019d drawn attention to it for the fifth time. \u201cI promise you, I\u2019ll never forget it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u2014he took her shoulders and aimed her toward his favorite spot\u2014\u201chere we are.\u201d He could\u2019ve just told her where to look, but he couldn\u2019t resist touching her. \u201cLook up and tell me what you see.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him over her shoulder to shoot him an impatient glare. \u201cI see a dead tree.\u201d</p><p>It was skeletal, an old beech he guessed, leafless even in the heat of summer. But it wasn\u2019t completely dead. \u201cLook closer.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted under his touch. \u201cThis is your favorite spot?\u201d</p><p>Rather than reply, he simply hugged in closer from behind her and pointed his finger slowly up the trunk, stopping when he reached an old, rotted hole. A tiny patch of brown and white was barely visible through the cracking bark\u2014it was feathers, from which a black beady eye watched them.</p><p>He felt the moment she saw it.</p><p>She blurted, \u201cAn owl!\u201d</p><p>The creature flinched and its head swiveled, and that black beady eye twitched and disappeared. \u201cShh,\u201d he told her, even though he was chuckling himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole nest of them. A mama with her hatchlings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad, Jessup.\u201d She looked impressed, if a bit startled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA forest-ranger brother is good for something.\u201d He shrugged, watching the spot for more movement. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who taught me how to look. They nest in these old trees\u2014they like the cracks and crevices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey? Are there more?\u201d She relaxed into him\u2014it was just the slightest bit, but he felt the impact like a Mack truck.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He leaned closer again, and this time she didn\u2019t stiffen at his touch. \u201cThere and there.\u201d He pointed and pointed again. \u201cI\u2019ve counted three nests total, but there are probably more up high.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are three mama owls in this tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, those other nests must be old. They were probably abandoned a while ago.\u201d</p><p>As she gazed up at that owl, leaning into his chest, Eddie wondered what she would do if he simply stroked down those bare arms, taking her hands in his. He risked hugging her a tiny bit closer.</p><p>As he held Laura like that, a great peace swept through him. It was an amazing life he led here in the mountains\u2014such simplicity, but such majesty, too. Someday he\u2019d find a woman to share it with. He knew a terrific pang of loss that it likely wouldn\u2019t be this woman.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthey\u2019re monogamous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Her voice was quiet, muzzy. She was as transfixed by this magical moment as he was.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t it be Laura? Maybe she was the woman for him. Hell, he\u2019d been crushing on her since puberty\u2014maybe he\u2019d been right all along.</p><p>\u201cOwls,\u201d he said, hugging her just a little tighter. And then he dared even further. He did what he\u2019d been longing to do. He swept his hands down her smooth arms, cupping her hands gently in his. \u201cScott told me they take only one partner for life.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, looking annoyed. \u201cUnlike some people I know.\u201d</p><p>Inside, he cursed. He\u2019d gone too far. But he was sick of her ridiculous assumptions about him. \u201cYou think you know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eddie. I know I know you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d He tried to be nonchalant, but his voice was tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like every other guy.\u201d She shouldered past him, headed out of the trees.</p><p>He\u2019d been having fun, letting Laura think what she liked about him, but now something had changed. Maybe it was those little lacy pink straps that\u2019d done it, but he figured it was time to show her who he really was. \u201cWhy? Because I like a pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d make a move on anything in a skirt. And on your own job site, no less.\u201d</p><p>He caught up to her, keeping pace as she strode back across the field to the house. She was so tense, so quick to jump to conclusions. It struck him that he\u2019d never seen her easy with any man. It was as if the situation had tilted, and suddenly he saw her in a new light. \u201cLook, Laura. I don\u2019t know who the jackass is who hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun on him. \u201cNobody hurt me.\u201d But the pain that flashed in her eyes put the lie to her words.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not out to,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cYou will if you finish this stupid hotel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about the hotel.\u201d</p><p>She sputtered, but when no words came, she turned and made for her car. \u201cJust look into the water thing,\u201d she shot at him, going at a brisk trot now. \u201cAnd I will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Emphasis on we. He slowed and let her go. There was no winning this particular battle\u2014but he wasn\u2019t about to cede the war. \u201cGood-bye, Laura.\u201d</p><p>For now.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Rob had a theory. Seven Stud was so named because seven was roughly the number of hours that could go by without his needing a break. Ever since his last big loss with the game, it\u2019s been Texas Hold \u2019Em for him, but he decided tonight was the night to get back up on that Seven Stud pony.</p><p>And tonight he\u2019d gone upscale, hitting the tables at Aura, a fancy resort casino on the Reno strip. Some day, after he hit it big, he\u2019d bring Helen here. Maybe have a second honeymoon. She could sun herself by the pool. He\u2019d rent them one of those cabanas, and people would serve her frosty drinks with frilly umbrellas.</p><p>Aura was a classy joint. When you were on the casino floor, it was all you could drink free on the house, though he knew not to drink too much at the tables. When he did, he stayed away from beer and wine\u2014too potent. But they watered down the liquor at these places, so his habit was to nurse a Jack and Coke, one per hour. He never got buzzed, and with those lowball glasses and all that ice, he always made it about seven hours before he needed to get up.</p><p>Helen had looked so sad when he left tonight. He wished he could tell her he did this for them. For her. But she wouldn\u2019t understand. All she could think about was the kids and the chores, while he had bigger concerns. Someday she\u2019d understand. When he hired her a regular sitter and she got to cut her hours at the tavern, his plan would become clear, he had no doubt about that.</p><p>He\u2019d known the moment he first saw her that she was the one for him. Even as a teenager, she\u2019d been something else, with her sexy red hair and those curves\u2014good Lord, those curves\u2014any Hollywood starlet would envy them. He\u2019d seen how other men looked at her. He knew he had to step up his game if he was going to be good enough for curves like that.</p><p>Which meant he had another mistress to consider, and at the moment, she wasn\u2019t anything like the queen of hearts. What he longed for was the three of clubs, the card that would complete a straight flush, prettier than any queen.</p><p>The dealer doled out the last cards. \u201cDown and dirty.\u201d</p><p>A master at the poker face, he schooled his features. Three, three, come on three. He hadn\u2019t seen any yet, which was unusual for Seven Stud. So many cards showing, and none of them threes.</p><p>His hole card was placed before him with a crisp flick. Rob rubbed his buffalo nickel for good luck. Rubbed the card. Peeked up at the corner. An eight.</p><p>His poker face shattered. \u201cShit.\u201d Nada. And with a measly deuce, jack, six showing, he couldn\u2019t even make a reasonable bluff, not when the young cowboy across from him was showing a pair of aces and his Colgate smile. \u201cFold.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been up for a while, but that last pot brought him back down to a hundred, and one lone Benjamin was definitely not going to do it. He needed more cash to get his mojo going, and that was exactly why he\u2019d come to Aura tonight\u2014their generous credit program.</p><p>He headed to the cashier and flashed his platinum Aura Player\u2019s Rewards card. \u201cI need a marker.\u201d</p><p>The woman was a tiny thing, with chipped purple nails and a tag that read:</p><p>Aura Resort Casino</p><p>~ A Fairview Property ~</p><p>Hello my name is</p><p>THUY</p><p>He gave Thuy a killer smile, willing her to recognize him. She must have because there was a quick buzz-buzz, the gate clicked open, and a suited thug appeared to escort him to the back office.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his first time back there, not by a long shot. He stole a surreptitious glance at the secretary\u2019s name tag. Sheryl, it looked like.</p><p>She swiped his card. \u201cGood evening, Mister Haskell. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a marker.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her computer screen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. You\u2019ve reached your limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hit your limit for the month.\u201d</p><p>His vision wavered for a moment, anger a sudden boil in his veins. But he kept his most charming smile plastered on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s Sheryl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bad. Sharon. I guess I was too distracted by your pretty brown eyes to remember right.\u201d He turned up that megawatt smile\u2014he knew he wasn\u2019t a bad-looking guy, and it\u2019d served him well before. \u201cSharon, I get paid next week.\u201d He heard an office door open, but ignored it, focused only on sweet-talking this Sharon who was the only thing standing between him and winning the pot of his dreams. \u201cI just need a marker till then. I\u2019m a lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we help you, sir?\u201d It was one of the pit bosses, and Rob finally registered that two men had entered the room, the blue-blazered boss and some other guy who was so fancy, he didn\u2019t even have a name tag.</p><p>Rob shared his broad grin with them. \u201cI was hoping to get a marker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d the pit boss said, but then he went to stand at her desk, looking over her shoulder at her screen, and he grew thoughtful. \u201cI can see you\u2019ve hit a bad run, Mister Haskell.\u201d</p><p>The fancy man joined him, looking at the screen. \u201cA local, are you?\u201d With a clap on the pit boss\u2019s back, he added, \u201cI think Mister Haskell here looks lucky. Another five hundred shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d He caught Rob\u2019s eye and gave him a chummy wink. \u201cYou\u2019re good for it, aren\u2019t you, Haskell?\u201d</p><p>Rob nodded like crazy. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you nice folks get back to business then.\u201d Rob\u2019s rainmaker shook the pit boss\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m over a barrel here. You\u2019re confident you can stay on top of that project we talked about?\u201d</p><p>A look of fear and respect stilled the man\u2019s features. \u201cI sent my boys out to the ranch, Mister Fox. It\u2019s just, they were worried...\u201d He pitched his voice lower. \u201cThey\u2019re worried it might be, you know, illegal.\u201d</p><p>The man in the fancy suit nodded grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s good of them to be concerned. But you tell them what we\u2019re doing will eventually be good for the land. Hell, think of all those rich dot-commers, anxious to spend their stock options on organic mud baths, hemp robes, hundred-dollar salads with local greens, heirloom this and that, and whatever the hell else we\u2019re pushing these days. Now that\u2019s eco-friendly. It\u2019s just business, and business means making the tough decisions. The smart decisions. You can\u2019t let this little glitch stop progress. We can\u2019t stop building, which means you need to make this disappear for me. Because I can find someone else who will...do you hear what I\u2019m saying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand, sir.\u201d The pit boss added nervously, \u201cThe eagle has landed.\u201d</p><p>Then the two men laughed like he\u2019d made some great joke.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rob was growing impatient. These dudes were jawing while he needed to get his five bills and get back to the tables. It was right back to Texas Hold \u2019Em for him. Screw Seven Stud.</p> <p>Finally the mysterious suit left. The pit boss unlocked the safe and counted out Rob\u2019s chips. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually raise the credit limit like this.

Dan texted me about an hour ago.\u201d She checked her watch. \u201cThey stopped in Fresh Pond for gas, which would put them here by four o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You meant they were coming today?\u201d Sorrow waited a beat, then grinned evilly. \u201cOf course, everything\u2019s all set. For the thousandth time, we\u2019re rea\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shadow crossed the window\u2014a large white van, pulling into the lot. \u201cOh my God, they\u2019re here.\u201d The day had finally arrived\u2014the History Network people had come to start filming\u2014and if that weren\u2019t good enough, an old colleague of hers was acting as producer. She ran out to the lot to greet them.</p><p>People were spilling from the van door, and it was like she was back in the city, seeing the array of tattoos, wildly dyed hair, and a showcase of tattered clothing that\u2019d probably cost a fortune. She glimpsed an impressive amount of gear stowed in the back\u2014mikes, boom poles, cameras, lenses. It was a total thrill.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d she called, and cursed herself for sounding like such an eager goofball. She tempered her voice and expression to play it cool. \u201cCome on in. Have a beer on the house before you get settled.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow appeared on the porch to shoo them inside, but Laura had her eye on the driver, still in the van, fiddling with his phone. It\u2019d been years since she\u2019d seen him, but that profile was instantly recognizable\u2014her old pal, Dan Harper. Finally a door slammed, and he walked around the van to her, beaming. \u201cHey, stranger.\u201d</p> <p>She felt the grin pop back onto her face, bigger than ever. \u201cDanny, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d They\u2019d once moved in the same San Francisco circles but had lost touch after he moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>He took her hand, letting his eyes rove blatantly up and down her body. \u201cLaura Bailey. As I live and breathe.\u201d</p><p>She tugged her hand away. \u201cEasy, sailor. I\u2019m not that cheap.\u201d</p><p>He barked a laugh. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d He leaned in to buss her on the cheek. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s awesome to see you. I\u2019m so happy we could make this work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy? I couldn\u2019t believe when I saw your name.\u201d After planning had begun in earnest, she\u2019d been shocked when, cc\u2019ed on an e-mail message, one of the names had popped from the rest. \u201cHow\u2019s life in Smell-Ay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Northern California types are such snobs.\u201d He shook his head in mock dismay. \u201cWatch it, or I won\u2019t share any of my celebrity gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got gossip?\u201d She motioned zipping her lips. \u201cI will not be denied.\u201d</p><p>Bear appeared, walking from the lodge to the tavern. \u201cYou going to make the man sleep out here?\u201d</p> <p>She and Dan shared an amused look. \u201cMeet my dear father.\u201d</p><p>Her dad simply grunted and continued his way into the tavern.</p><p>Sweeping an arm toward the porch, she added in a mockingly formal tone, \u201cMister Daniel Harper, would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t have to sit down.\u201d He rubbed his lower back. \u201cThe drive was fine till I hit the mountains. Thirty miles an hour of this.\u201d His hand snaked through the air, gesturing the twists and turns. \u201cGood thing I don\u2019t get carsick.\u201d When a woman emerged from the passenger van, looking rumpled and slightly green, he added, \u201cUnlike Kat, here.\u201d</p><p>She gave the woman a sympathetic look. \u201cThe drive is pretty, but it can be winding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan be?\u201d Kat raked a hand through her spiky black hair and croaked, \u201cIs there a place I can lie down?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow had been watching from the porch and, seeing she was needed, jogged down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll show her a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Hope show her?\u201d Laura did a quick scan through the tavern windows for their new employee. \u201cI thought she was going to be waiting tables for you. Isn\u2019t that why tonight\u2019s special is lasagna\u2014anyone can serve it up?\u201d</p><p>Hope might\u2019ve proved knowledgeable about environmental issues, but when it came to actual helpfulness, so far she was pulling a goose egg.</p><p>Sorrow hedged. \u201cWell...I told her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were headed out tonight. You can\u2019t take two hours off?\u201d Laura gave her a stare down. She couldn\u2019t take time off, but at least her sister could. Sorrow had been working so hard, as if she\u2019d sensed just how important this all was to Laura, and she wanted to reward her sister with some downtime. \u201cI thought you had plans with Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. We do. But Hope was nervous about going it alone, especially with all the new guests. Speaking of which...\u201d They both glanced at Kat, looking green and wobbly.</p><p>\u201cYou go,\u201d Laura said. \u201cGet the woman a bed and some ginger ale.\u201d</p><p>Dan put a casual arm around her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m hoping you have something a little stronger for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec.\u201d He stopped and, with a concerned glance back at the locked van, asked, \u201cWill our gear be okay out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It took her a moment to get what he was saying. \u201cOhh. Danny, this is Sierra Falls. The only thing that\u2019ll break into your van is a raccoon, or a bear maybe.\u201d</p><p>Worry flashed across his face, and Laura had to laugh. She\u2019d always thought he was cute\u2014they\u2019d even had a couple of dates back in the day\u2014but in his funky black-framed glasses and pretend-vintage concert T-shirt, he was more metrosexual than manly-sexual. She\u2019d become so accustomed to the brawny mountain men that the cool LA club vibe just looked helpless. Almost comically out of place. Dan had a sharp wit, but she doubted he\u2019d know what to do if faced with anything baring sharp teeth.</p><p>Oddly, it gave her a stab of affection for him...for all of them. It made her realize that she\u2019d made the right decision coming home, but also just how much she\u2019d missed her city friends. She leaned in for another hug. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to see you.\u201d</p><p>Gravel crunched as another vehicle pulled into the drive\u2014a red pickup. Even through the windshield, she could discern the grim set to the driver\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Eddie and his impeccable timing.</p><p>Just like his timing with that stupid tree. He\u2019d thought he could seduce her by showing her a couple of stupid birds\u2019 nests. And damn the man, he almost had. He\u2019d taken her hand, and she\u2019d felt his touch like a pulse of electricity. She\u2019d been too shocked to pull away, too curious to see if the feeling faded, if it\u2019d just been surprise\u2014not attraction\u2014that\u2019d surged through her. But that warmth had intensified. The sweep of his hands down her arms had left her weak, hot and shivery both. No, it\u2019d definitely, unfortunately, been attraction she\u2019d felt.</p><p>And now he was showing up, here. Just when she was hitting her stride. He pulled in right next to where they were standing. Total Neanderthal move.</p><p>He got out, and his eyes flicked ever so briefly\u2014and disdainfully\u2014over Dan. \u201cEvening,\u201d he said in a tight voice.</p><p>She bared her teeth in a smile. \u201cMiller time again?\u201d</p><p>He only shrugged, and she told herself it wasn\u2019t hurt that\u2019d furrowed his brow.</p><p>The contrast between him and Dan was pronounced. Her old friend looked like he belonged in some grungy, ultrahip LA nightclub, while there went Eddie, seeming like something out of a Levi\u2019s ad. As he walked into the tavern, she had to look away.</p><p>But that brought her attention to the back of his pickup instead. Yet again, he had ten tons of gear in the back. Did he ever clean the thing out?</p><p>A small slash of color caught her eye. Stepping closer, she registered what she was looking at and felt it like a punch in the gut. It was a small red sneaker.</p><p>A child\u2019s sneaker.</p><p>Did he have a kid? She glared at the door he\u2019d just walked through, as if that might offer some clue. Did this explain where he was always off to? Was he paying regular visits to his mistress and secret love child?</p><p>She smothered her extreme response. Why should she care?</p><p>The film crew was here. She knew the producer. Her world was taking off. She wouldn\u2019t let Eddie ruin her moment\u2014she\u2019d been looking forward to this for weeks. More than that, she\u2019d worked her butt off to make it happen.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She tucked Dan\u2019s arm firmly in hers and led him inside, headed toward his friends who were settling noisily into a booth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my fill of the crew for the moment,\u201d he said, steering her away. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past two hours forced to listen to their arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, then.\u201d She pointed him to a seat by the window and dashed behind the bar for two bottles of beer. She wasn\u2019t normally a drinker, but right then, she was in the mood for a change. \u201cArguing, huh?\u201d she asked as she returned to the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He cracked open both bottles, then handed Laura hers. \u201cThe only time they shut up was to tweet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cWere they arguing about the shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not that.\u201d He shook his head as he took a healthy swig.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p> <p>He put the beer on the table with a contented sigh. \u201cYou name it. Why vegetarians should be allowed to eat bacon. Why the valley isn\u2019t really LA. Why Battlestar Galactica is superior to Star Trek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d she said distractedly. She forced herself to focus on Dan instead of watching Eddie stand and lean against the bar. The guy really did have a great ass. Did he do regular squats or was that all from skiing and hiking? Too bad it was attached to him\u2014total waste.</p><p>Focus. She\u2019d been saying something. Gathering her wits, she took a long pull of that beer, not really tasting it. \u201cThough I have to agree about the other thing. Who doesn\u2019t want to be a baconatarian?\u201d She laughed at her own comment, but it came out too brightly, even to her own ears.</p><p>Then Eddie\u2019s laugh rose above the tavern din. His energy seemed to pull at the entire room, till her chest felt tight from it. She rubbed her arms, wiping away the memory of his touch.</p><p>She felt him make his way to the end of the bar, chat with Bear, grab his own beer. Generally making himself at home\u2014in her workplace. Why did she feel him like this? Feel him move through the room as though they were tied together by an invisible string?</p> <p>It made her want to flirt\u2014with Dan. She reached across the table and tugged at his sleeve. \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p><p>Dan met her eyes and held them a second longer than average. \u201cMe? What about you? Is this temporary?\u201d He glanced around the bar, lingering on the deer head over the fireplace. \u201cSome sort of punishment, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a playful shove. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tells you to shut up, too, huh?\u201d Eddie had come over, practically casting a shadow over the entire table.</p><p>Dan grinned and asked her, \u201cYou\u2019ve had this habit since childhood?\u201d</p><p>Eddie pulled up a chair. \u201cSince kindergarten, to be exact. Mind if I join you?\u201d He\u2019d directed the question to Dan, not her.</p> <p>She glowered up at him. \u201cSorry, we\u2019re busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Dan said eagerly. He introduced himself and scooted over to make room at the table. \u201cSorry, Laura, but I\u2019ve got to hear the dirt.\u201d He turned his full attention to Eddie. \u201cSo she was a little hellion even as a five-year-old?\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s laugh was rolling. \u201cNever heard it put that way, but yeah.\u201d He took a swig of his beer, and when he spoke again, Laura detected the slightest tightness in his voice. \u201cShe was a hellion all right. Still is.\u201d There\u2019d been something off in how he\u2019d said it, and an odd pause followed, but then he spoke again, his tone so easy, she wondered if she\u2019d imagined the rest. \u201cSo, how do you guys know each other?\u201d</p><p>Eddie had inserted himself into their conversation. She didn\u2019t want him there, but a part of her didn\u2019t want him to go, either. It was almost like she wanted to see him, but she wanted him to see her, too, with Dan. It was a jumble of adolescent impulses, and it gave her the inexplicable urge to be cruel\u2014to make it clear that they were from two different worlds, and he was currently intruding on hers.</p><p>\u201cDan directed a webisode for us,\u201d she said blithely. \u201cAges ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack when they called that crap webisodes,\u201d Dan said, and she shared a knowing laugh with him.</p><p>\u201cWebisode?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>\u201cI worked for an Internet company that did online reviews,\u201d she said in an impatient voice. \u201cEach episode was called a webisode.\u201d She turned to Dan, effectively shutting Eddie out and ending that conversation. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for the shoot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d start out by getting some B-roll,\u201d he said, switching into producer mode. \u201cScout some locations, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d She couldn\u2019t wait to get to it. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d been engaged in any sort of professional endeavor that didn\u2019t involve clean linens or electric bills.</p><p>\u201cWe need a place we can set up a small studio. Something soundproof.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know exactly the spot. There\u2019s a room upstairs\u2014too small to be a guest room\u2014you can do pickups there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPickups?\u201d Eddie grinned, trying to insert himself again. \u201cCan I come around for a pickup?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him\u2014he would have to turn it sexual. \u201cIs everything an innuendo with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cI meant audio pickups.\u201d How was it he always managed to throw her off stride? Terrified that she was blushing, she had to look away as she added in a tight voice, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about recording audio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I thought it was a good one.\u201d Dan clinked his bottle with Eddie\u2019s. \u201cAnd anyway, I don\u2019t want to talk shop yet.\u201d He twisted in his seat, studying the array of pictures on the far wall\u2014vintage signs with sayings about bounty and friendship, and old print ads for things like Kiltie Brand Lemons. They were all bordered with matching blue gingham mats that\u2019d already been faded by the sun back when she was a kid. She\u2019d been meaning to renovate them...right into the Dumpster.</p><p>Dan\u2019s voice brought her back into the present, saying, \u201cI want to hear about this place. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>She bristled at his tone. \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019ve moved to Mars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kind of have.\u201d He saw the pained expression on her face and dialed it back. \u201cMaybe not Mars. Maybe just...the moon. But seriously, your man can\u2019t like this new development very much.\u201d</p><p>Eddie exclaimed, \u201cYour man?\u201d</p><p>She realized with annoyance how aware of him she\u2019d been, how much she\u2019d felt him sitting there in judgment. She\u2019d refused to meet his eye, so she didn\u2019t know what expression he wore, but she did hear something in his voice. It was disbelief.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked,\u201d she snapped, then gathered her wits with a quick sip of her beer. It was still mostly full, well on its way to becoming tepid, and she put it down and pushed it away. \u201cHe\u2019s not my man. Patrick and I have been over for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes goggled. \u201cOh really?\u201d He jokingly spread his arms like he was yawning, and when he brought down his hands they rested on hers.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s gaze flicked to their hands and away again. \u201cWho\u2019s Patrick?\u201d He kept his face a careful blank, and she found herself wishing to see something else there. Jealousy, anger...something.</p><p>Dan ignored him and kept his avid attention on her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the queen bee is without a drone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick wasn\u2019t a drone,\u201d she said. There wasn\u2019t any aspect of this that she was enjoying.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you\u2019re made of honey.\u201d Dan grinned. \u201cGotta be some drones hiding out somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Patrick?\u201d Eddie asked again, sharply this time.</p><p>Dan finally emerged from his entrancement to answer, \u201cHer fianc\u00e9. The lucky dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a fianc\u00e9?\u201d Eddie\u2019s expression remained unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHad,\u201d she said sharply, feeling peeved that Eddie had chosen this moment to become so mysterious.</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine a little filly like Lola here flying solo for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLola?\u201d Eddie asked wide-eyed, and this time his eyes didn\u2019t budge from hers. What was that look on his face?</p><p>Forget Eddie. Who cared what he thought, anyway?</p><p>She turned to Dan instead, giving him a withering look. \u201cI hate when you call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nickname from her wilder days,\u201d Dan explained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a nickname if you were the only one who used it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura was wild?\u201d Eddie gave her a slow appreciative assessment\u2014his expression had suddenly become readable, and she didn\u2019t like it one bit. \u201cI\u2019d have liked to see that.\u201d</p><p>She was one second away from leaving these two to themselves. She slid her hands out from under Dan\u2019s and braced herself on the table like she might spring up. \u201cWell, this has been fun,\u201d she said in a voice thick with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll stop teasing.\u201d Dan patted her arm. He probably felt how stiffly she held herself because he snatched her fist in his hands, prying it open to give her an affectionate jiggle and squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m just psyched to see you, and I guess it\u2019s bringing out my inner twelve-year-old. I\u2019ve thought about this day, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d She was dying to sneak a glimpse at Eddie.</p><p>\u201cOh, once or twice,\u201d Dan said, playfully playing it down. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>That was it. She had to peek at Eddie. His eyes were waiting for her, staring, smoldering, a vivid, crystalline blue. His jaw was clenched. She glanced away quickly, unable to hold that look.</p><p>\u201cI always wondered where you ended up,\u201d Dan continued, \u201cwhat you were up to, what it\u2019d be like to run into you again. Although,\u201d he added with a laugh, \u201cI must say, I imagined reuniting in LA, or New York. Chicago maybe. But here we are...in the middle of nowhere.\u201d He looked up at the boar head looming high over the table and barked out a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally awesome,\u201d Eddie said flatly.</p><p>Shut up, she mouthed at him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Dan continued, unaware of the exchange. \u201cI bet you don\u2019t exactly get a lot of film crews out here.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded in mock amazement. \u201cHow will us country folk handle the excitement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d And this time she\u2019d said it aloud, scooting her chair back as she did, springing up. \u201cI need some water.\u201d Mostly she needed to get away from both of these men.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes lit. \u201cPlease tell me your water comes from a well. Or is pumped from a mountain spring or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaniel, this isn\u2019t Little House on the Prairie. We have hot and cold running water.\u201d She stood over the table, her arms wrapped tightly around her chest. She\u2019d been so happy to see him, but he was acting so oblivious. Couldn\u2019t he hear how disdainful he sounded? This was her new life he was joking about. Her new priorities. She was reminded with a brilliant flash of clarity why she\u2019d given up men.</p><p>Eddie chose that moment to get back in on the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll bet in LA, you only drink organic bottled vitamin water shipped in from a Peruvian hot spring.\u201d</p><p>That was it. She stormed to the bar. She felt one of the men follow her, and somehow she knew it wouldn\u2019t be Dan she saw when she turned around. She\u2019d felt Eddie\u2019s judgment from the moment he came in\u2014as if he were one to judge.</p> <p>She rounded on him. \u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d</p><p>Eddie assessed her quietly. \u201cJust feeling a little protective, country girl.\u201d He paused a moment, his eyes focused on her, looking like he wanted to say something more.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away. His eyes were a bright, unusual blue, and she\u2019d never noticed how long his lashes were.</p><p>When he spoke again, he sounded sincere. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be an ass...\u201d But then he spoke again in a voice like he was testing her, adding, \u201cLola.\u201d</p><p>He was baiting her, and she refused to bite. Instead, she kept her voice dead serious when she asked him, \u201cWhy are you even hanging around if you\u2019ve got such a low opinion of everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI came because...\u201d A look of wariness crept over his face. \u201cI have news, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d She curled her fingers into her arms, because now she read wariness and regret.</p><p>\u201cI looked into the watershed thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d The words were out before she had a chance to temper the shock from her voice. Though, thinking about it, she didn\u2019t know why she was so surprised. He\u2019d remeasured the property lines when she\u2019d asked him to do that, too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, looking oddly insulted. \u201cI told you I\u2019d look into it, and I\u2019m a man of my word. I\u2019m sorry, Laura, the bond goes to identifying and protecting flood zones. Timber Creek has never flooded. There are no restrictions to building on that land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there aren\u2019t.\u201d Sudden emotion clutched at her throat, and she spun away to gather herself, acting as if she needed to get herself a drink. She forced her voice to steady as she said, \u201cNext time, just shoot me an e-mail, okay?\u201d</p> <p>He was already walking back to the booth, and the wave of his hand was all that told her he\u2019d heard. So why had he come to deliver the news? She stole a look at him as she filled a glass with ice. Was he there to rub it in?</p><p>And then there was the Dan thing. Dan was clueless, but she could tell how much Eddie was mocking him. It was like he was mocking her old life, and that mocked her. How could she take it any other way? So why was he even there if he judged her so much?</p><p>Why did she care?</p><p>Filling a glass with club soda, she stole another glance. Eddie was leaning back, jawing easily with Dan. That was how he acted\u2014easy with everyone. Flirty with everyone. It wasn\u2019t just with her. Those blue-eyed winks weren\u2019t because she was special.</p><p>She\u2019d need to shore up her defenses.</p><p>By the time she returned to the table, she\u2019d schooled all emotion from her face. She gave Eddie a flat look. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were still here.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes, and she waited for him to make a crack, but he only sighed and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d he said politely. \u201cAnd Laura, I really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She let her eyes linger on his back as he left. Giving Eddie the cold shoulder didn\u2019t feel as good as she\u2019d hoped it would.</p> <p>But she had no choice. She\u2019d failed once before, because of a man. Patrick had become her fianc\u00e9, but he\u2019d begun as her co-worker. Eventually she\u2019d lost her job because of him, and hearing his name only reminded her of one crystal-clear fact: she couldn\u2019t lose again.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Damn. Eddie\u2019s tires spun in gravel as he sped into the ranch\u2019s lot and slammed his truck into park.</p><p>Damn that woman.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to get her out of his mind all weekend. Not even spending a couple of nights at Camp Richardson with a bunch of rowdy kids had tired him out.</p><p>But dammit, he wasn\u2019t a bad guy. He was a good guy. The good guy, who was doing what he could to rein in this construction project.</p><p>Fairview could easily have given the contract to some other outfit, and they\u2019d probably have razed the whole thing by now, erecting some postmodern glass-and-steel thing, with fake stone fountains and a giant Buddha in the foyer.</p><p>But they\u2019d given the job to him and Jack instead, and he was the one running around, double-checking paperwork, resurveying the land, investigating watershed bonds, God help him.</p><p>He scowled at his reflection in the driver\u2019s-side mirror. \u201cRough,\u201d he muttered, and reached for the glove box to grab his electric razor. A couple of nights of no sleep would leave any man looking rough, but camping with a van full of kids from the Reno community center had to be the killing blow.</p><p>It was how he spent many of his weekends, leading at-risk youth on guided hiking and camping trips. Not many people knew about it\u2014it wasn\u2019t something he advertised. On the contrary, it was something that felt very private to him.</p><p>He\u2019d been a screw-up, just like so many of these kids.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been a lot to do, growing up in a small town. His home life hadn\u2019t been bad, but still, his parents had spent years tiptoeing on the brink of divorce. They\u2019d focused mostly on their own needs, which had made it easy for a teenage boy in a big family to get away with some bad behavior.</p><p>As he\u2019d gotten older, it\u2019d only gotten worse. Temptations became more within reach. It\u2019d only gotten easier to find someone to buy him booze before he\u2019d been legal. And, most exciting for him, the girls eventually got older and filled out, and he had, too.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just the partying. The youngest of four boys, he\u2019d had big shoes to fill, following in the shadow of Mark, who\u2019d become some fancy doctor in Silver City, and then there was Scott, who\u2019d known practically from infancy that his vocation was to be a park ranger. Meanwhile, the only thing that\u2019d called to Eddie had been the Gas-n-Go the next town over, where the attendant was always happy to overlook the fake ID and sell him a case of beer.</p><p>Only the strong hand of his oldest brother, Jack, had saved him. All Eddie had ever been good at was football, flirting, and fast driving, but when Jack realized the road his little brother was headed down, he\u2019d made extra time for him.</p><p>Growing up in Sierra Falls, Eddie had always appreciated a blue-sky day or waking to a fresh blanket of snow, but it was Jack who really showed him what nature was all about. Fishing trips, hiking, camping, living off the land for days with nobody else for miles around...those things had shown him how deep was the connection he felt with the land.</p><p>It was the mountains that\u2019d shown him what it was to be a man.</p><p>The first time a bear walked through his camp was when it all really clicked. He saw how insignificant he was. How meaningless all the partying and girl chasing.</p><p>Jack had turned Eddie\u2019s world around. At the time, his brother had been building his business, and when Eddie graduated from high school, Jack gave him a job. A reason to get out of bed and comb his hair in the morning.</p><p>People credited both of them for their success\u2014and sure, Eddie worked hard\u2014but it\u2019d been Jack\u2019s vision that\u2019d made it happen.</p><p>He thought of his latest trip. Those kids might\u2019ve been born in the shadow of the Sierras, but many of them had never been out of the Reno city limits, and this latest batch, like Eddie so many years ago, had just experienced their first bear encounter.</p><p>They\u2019d hiked out to Mount Tallac, not an easy day, and were taking a break before turning back around when a black bear ambled by. The guy didn\u2019t pose a threat, but as Eddie could attest, there was nothing like the sight of one\u2019s first bear to forget your troubles. Meth-cooking moms, dads doing hard time\u2014it all tended to fade to the background.</p><p>One would\u2019ve thought that, after a weekend like that, he\u2019d have been dead to the world when he finally hit his own mattress last night. But he couldn\u2019t get Laura out of his mind. She pissed him off. She was cold and prickly and uptight, capable of thinking only of her own ambitions.</p><p>But she also riled him up in a way that made him want to pull that hot body close to his. She was sexy and sassy and smart, but she was vulnerable, too, and that right there was the crux of it. In her eyes, he\u2019d seen flickers of the emotion\u2014the sadness even\u2014that she kept bottled up, under tight control. He guessed something or someone had hurt her badly, and though her vulnerability was something she kept hidden, he knew she had her demons, secreted way down deep.</p><p>He longed to touch her...to finally, really touch her. To shoulder her burdens for a little while. To watch her let go and forget herself, with one of those knockout smiles lighting up her face, her greatest ambition only to melt into him.</p><p>He often caught her eyes on him. He longed to see the spark in those eyes transform, for the switch to flick from cold wariness into something white-hot. Something that forgot about arguments and bottom lines...something that didn\u2019t think at all. He\u2019d seen it once, by the creek.</p><p>Maybe that was the trick\u2014to get her away from the world she knew so well. Get her away from things she thought she could control. He wanted to show her how to lose control. That losing control could be good.</p><p>The way she responded to his touch, he knew she had it in her. She\u2019d relaxed into him, warmed to him. But then it was like she remembered she wasn\u2019t supposed to show her tender side, like she was afraid of it.</p><p>And he knew it wasn\u2019t just him. She kept herself strung tight, looking ready to shatter before she\u2019d let anyone in.</p><p>It was good to see that she and Sorrow had reconciled. He was glad Laura had someone to turn to. But still, he sensed she was lonely. If she weren\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have that thing in her eyes he spotted sometimes\u2014that look of fear, that flicker of sadness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He longed to hold her and kiss her till she forgot about the things that didn\u2019t matter. Kiss her till she shut the hell up about ten-million-dollar watershed bonds. Till she kissed him back, caving to the desire he\u2019d seen glimmer in her eyes on that day by the creek.</p><p>Would she ever let it happen? He rapped his razor against the dash to clean it out, thinking probably not.</p><p>It was sad, really. If she wouldn\u2019t look twice at him, he wished she\u2019d at least let go with somebody.</p> <p>And it sounded like she\u2019d been with someone for a while. When that annoying History Network guy mentioned her fianc\u00e9, Eddie wasn\u2019t sure what\u2019d been more of a shock\u2014that she\u2019d been engaged or the jealousy that clenched his gut to hear it.</p><p>But she was back home in Sierra Falls and still alone. It seemed to him like she was afraid to let anyone in. She was terrified to fail. Terrified that someone might see she couldn\u2019t do it alone.</p><p>There was more to that girl than she let on, he knew it. Even as a teenager, there\u2019d been something in her eyes that had reminded him of a cat, cornered and hissing, not because she posed any sort of threat, but because she was overwhelmed by her own feelings of fear and uncertainty.</p><p>Why a smart, gorgeous woman like her would ever feel uncertain was beyond him. Eddie had never made it to college\u2014with bills to pay and a business to run, he didn\u2019t see how it\u2019d ever happen. But Laura, she was A-list. The full package. She\u2019d put herself through school, a real self-made woman. Hot, successful, whip smart.</p><p>So why no boyfriend? Clearly it was her own choice. If she put herself on the market, she\u2019d be snapped up in a second.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t figure out what was between her and that hipster film guy. Was that what Laura was attracted to? Guys with tight jeans and hair gel? Hair gel, for God\u2019s sake. Eddie wouldn\u2019t be caught dead slicking a ton of crap into his hair. And then there were those bracelets\u2014the guy had a wrist full of them. He hoped his brothers would just shoot him if he ever bought himself bracelets.</p><p>Laura had made it clear that when she looked at him, all she saw was country boy. They\u2019d known each other for years, yet she clung to her judgments of him, refusing to see who he really was. He might not have a college degree, but he read, and he worked hard, and he had his Reno kids, but did she notice any of that? No, all Laura saw was a big pickup truck. But hell, he worked construction, took his campers off-roading, drove in the snow\u2014he didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d have him drive instead. Sometimes he just wanted to pin her up against the side of that truck and kiss her till she saw him for the man he really was.</p><p>He slammed the glove box shut, decided. Maybe she\u2019d never let go of whatever it was that had her strung tight, but he could at least do what he could to prove he wasn\u2019t a bad guy.</p><p>He needed this gig. Jessup Brothers needed this gig. As much as he hated being public enemy number one in her eyes, he couldn\u2019t back out. He owed it to his brother.</p><p>For Eddie, with no family to support, it wasn\u2019t so much about the money. He\u2019d built his cabin himself and owned it outright. Hell, lately all his spare cash went to the Reno kids, for gear like kid-sized sleeping bags and hiking boots for feet that seemed to grow overnight. But Jack had a family and needed the income. What\u2019s more, with his only son just off to boot camp, his brother needed the work, too\u2014the preoccupation that came with such a big job.</p><p>They may have needed the gig, but still, it didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t do it right.</p> <p>He snatched his cell from atop the seat. He owed his brother, but he owed something to himself, too: to listen to his gut. And right now, doing the job as it was spec\u2019d in the plans didn\u2019t feel right. Something was fishy. He\u2019d run the job and get the paycheck, but he\u2019d be responsible about it. Laura had been right\u2014he owed it to Sierra Falls to do no less than that.</p><p>\u201cHunter, hey,\u201d he said in a sure voice. There\u2019d be no more Yes, sir, Mister Fox for him. He checked the clock on the dash, suddenly worried he\u2019d called too early, but there was no need for concern. The Fairview exec sounded as crisp and clear as if he were already on his second pot of coffee.</p><p>\u201cThere have been some developments you need to know about,\u201d Eddie told him. Once he assured the man that all was well with the construction, he dove in. \u201cSierra Falls was one of the original gold rush towns.\u201d</p><p>He detailed the story of the letters, of Buck Larsen, but Fox soon interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s eight A.M. on a Monday morning,\u201d the man said. \u201cI appreciate your town spirit, son, but I\u2019m busy. You need to wrap it up and tell me what the hell this has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe History Network is here, filming a story focused on how historic Sierra Falls is.\u201d He sat tall, staring blindly at the ranch house through the windshield, weighing his words carefully. He wasn\u2019t a shark in a suit like Fox was, but he would get this right. \u201cOur draw is history. Tourists have been coming for a glimpse into the past, to see where Buck Larsen slept, where he drank. If you fundamentally change the look of the old Timber Creek ranch, you\u2019ll be changing its history. If you lose the essence\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Fox cut him off. \u201cTV people, you say? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Eddie replied, a bit thrown by the man\u2019s tone. He\u2019d have thought these corporate types would jump at the sort of publicity that television would bring. \u201cI met them myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met them,\u201d Fox repeated in a flat voice, then grew silent. When he spoke again, his manner was exaggeratedly chummy. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...oh.\u201d Eddie had been about to deploy his planned rebuttal and was thrown by Fox\u2019s sudden agreement. \u201cGood, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled you\u2019ve brought this to my attention,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIf they\u2019re filming about how historic the town is, well, we can\u2019t have their story become how we\u2019re changing history. Besides, I sure don\u2019t want a bunch of TV folks going out to your job site and bothering you while you work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s another good point.\u201d Eddie thought fast. He wasn\u2019t done yet and wasn\u2019t about to let some slick company man get the upper hand. \u201cSo you agree we need to go back to our original plans. Refurbish the ranch, pretty it up, you can get your solarium, spa, pool, all that. But we keep it to a single story.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, he clicked off his cell, amazed that Fox had agreed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to break the news to Laura. He could just picture her, building up steam, getting worked up, and that was when he\u2019d tell her.</p><p>Laura, all worked up.</p><p>Now there was a thing to consider. She was a passionate woman, that was for sure. All that fire, it was hard for him not to fantasize about working out their disagreements in the bedroom instead.</p><p>In fact, it was all he thought about lately.</p><p>His groin tightened as though on cue.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...\u201d He raked his hands through his hair and blew out a breath. He needed to focus. Get to work. Hammering something would take his mind off things, he thought. Hammer. Drill. Screw...And like that, his mind went to the dirtiest of places. He scrubbed his freshly shaved cheeks. \u201cGet a grip.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he felt hot.</p><p>There\u2019d been an early-morning chill in the Sierra air, and he\u2019d thrown on a sweatshirt, but he pulled it off now and dug through his duffel for a clean T-shirt.</p><p>A knock on his window startled him. The glass had fogged, so he simply opened the door, expecting to see Jack or one of his crew.</p><p>But instead, there was Laura.</p><p>Her hair was loose at her shoulders, and she wore jeans and an old concert tee that hugged in just the right places. She was always so sophisticated and put together, but casual like this was when she was at her sexiest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the genuine smile that popped onto his face. \u201cMorning, sunshine. I was just thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cYou...why...\u201d The sight of Eddie half-dressed robbed the words from her brain. She couldn\u2019t help her eyes from dipping to his chest, then back up again. He was cut with muscle in the mark of a man who took full advantage of his body, using it to work and to play, hefting lumber and operating tools and throwing balls. \u201cWhere\u2019s your shirt?\u201d she blurted, then felt her cheeks redden at the gaffe.</p><p>\u201cWarm morning. And looks like it\u2019s getting warmer.\u201d He smiled his trademark cocky-guy smile, but before she managed to get in a barb, he asked, \u201cWhat brings you out so early, sugar?\u201d He spoke in a husky morning voice.</p><p>Though he still sat in his truck, suddenly he felt too close, and she took a step back.</p><p>Why had she come? Why was she seeking him out this early? She should\u2019ve known he\u2019d be alone. Most of all, why was he half-naked?</p><p>\u201cI have things to discuss,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d He got out of the truck. It was high off the ground, and yet as his taut body unfolded from the cab and he stood, he still loomed so close and so tall over her. It was unsettling.</p><p>\u201cI have things, too,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cBut you first.\u201d</p><p>There was that arrogant grin again\u2014she was sure it portended gloom. He was about to stick it to her in some way, she just knew it.</p><p>\u201cMe first?\u201d She cinched her arms at her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me...age before beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darlin\u2019, no.\u201d He gave a playful pinch to her chin. \u201cPearls before swine.\u201d He winked and let go, but the ghost of his touch left her skin hot. \u201cSo what brings you here looking like you might like to eat me for breakfast?\u201d He raised a brow, implying so much more than her current temper.</p><p>She took another step backward. She was painfully aware of his proximity, like she\u2019d all of a sudden become claustrophobic.</p><p>Her reaction to him annoyed her. His ease annoyed her. It sharpened her words. \u201cI found precedent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecedent, huh? Sounds important.\u201d He paused. \u201cPrecedent for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor stopping this construction,\u201d she said, trying to keep her temper. \u201cWhat else? There have been similar cases. In each, a federal lawsuit was filed, citing a violation of the National Historic Preservation Act.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded, thinking, then asked, \u201cThat all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are maddening. No, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if it\u2019s my turn, I wanted to tell you my news. I got Fairview to back out of their phase two plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou...what?\u201d She felt herself gape. Surely she didn\u2019t just hear what she thought she heard.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no stopping the resort,\u201d Eddie quickly amended, \u201cbut Fairview has agreed to scale back.\u201d</p><p>She searched his words for some hidden trick. \u201cWhat does scale back mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the building to just one story after all.\u201d He smiled, looking proud of himself. \u201cI told you I\u2019m not a bad guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there\u2019s no stopping the resort.\u201d She still suspected he was, in fact, a bad guy. \u201cI still want to stop the resort, Eddie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Laura, you know there\u2019s no stopping a company like Fairview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact\u201d\u2014she ignored him and tapped a finger on her chin\u2014\u201cI think I\u2019d like to kill the resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I just put my ass on the line to scale back plans for a whole damned international hotel. Which, by the way, will mean less money for Jessup Brothers.\u201d</p><p>Baby steps, she told herself. Of course he wouldn\u2019t do something that would hurt his own business.</p><p>He saw her waffling and held out his hand. \u201cPeace? Please? Let\u2019s shake on it.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stop the construction completely, but she still could. She\u2019d think of a way. In the meantime, she let her hand slip into his, and there it was again, that warm rush at feeling his large, worn hand envelop hers.</p> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She let him shake her hand. Scaling back was something, she told herself. Scaling back was good.</p><p>He squeezed, doing a little rub with his thumb, and all sorts of alarms sounded in her head. When she pulled her hand free, he laughed again. \u201cThe least I could get is a smile. Maybe a Thank you, Eddie, for being so awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t trust you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for you, dummy.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I respect you, Laura.\u201d</p><p>Respect. Wasn\u2019t that what she\u2019d wanted? She\u2019d lost it at work, had been scrambling to reclaim it at home. Why did it feel so strange getting it now, so freely, from Eddie?</p><p>How was this guy she\u2019d known all her life\u2014who\u2019d bugged her all her life\u2014how was he the one to be giving her what she\u2019d so longed for? And not just that, but he was sacrificing some of his own money in the process.</p> <p>Suddenly, it wasn\u2019t Edwin Jessup from Mrs. Patmore\u2019s kindergarten class standing there. It was a man she saw with fresh eyes. A currently shirtless man.</p><p>And he looked good.</p><p>She fought it.</p><p>She edged sideways\u2014had Eddie always been this big?\u2014but as she did, she caught a glimpse of a large duffel on the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>She knew it. Same old Eddie. \u201cDoing the drive of shame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get your meaning.\u201d He pulled on his T-shirt\u2014finally\u2014and as he did, she heard him murmur, \u201cSure is chilly with you.\u201d</p><p>She hated the stab of jealousy she felt...at him frolicking around all over town, at her always being the chilly one. It riled her even more and she stabbed a finger at the junk littering the inside of his pickup. \u201cJust getting in from an all-nighter? Real classy, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll-nighter?\u201d</p><p>Razor, dirty shirts and socks, an extra pair of shoes...he\u2019d clearly been based out of his truck for a couple of days. Was it with someone she knew? Or maybe he\u2019d crashed with whatever hottie it was in Reno he was always dashing off to see. The mother of his child. Her stomach lurched for reasons she didn\u2019t want to contemplate.</p><p>\u201cActually\u201d\u2014she put up her hand\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He glanced into the cab at his stuff, and as her meaning registered, his face fell. He gave her a flat look to match his flat tone. \u201cYeah, Laura, I was out all night with my many mistresses, having hot times in my pickup.\u201d He shouldered by her, slamming the door behind him. \u201cWhy do you insist on seeing the worst in me?\u201d</p><p>What right did he have to look so hurt? He was the one sleeping around, not her.</p><p>\u201cI was just asking,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He stopped, turning slowly to look at her. \u201cI can\u2019t figure you out.\u201d The way he shook his head said he was about to give up trying.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want him to give up, and that was what she couldn\u2019t figure out. She fell into step behind him as he went to the back of his truck. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m complicated. Unlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m easy as pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I\u2019ll just bet you are.\u201d She scowled at his head\u2014his hair stuck up every which way, like a man who hadn\u2019t showered that morning.</p><p>Why on earth was she feeling her heart crack? Why did it seem like everyone had their secret lives except for her?</p><p>He caught her staring and gave a beleaguered sigh. \u201cHat head, Laura. Because I went to bed with wet hair. Not because I was out all night partying.\u201d</p><p>He reached into the truck bed for his hat, a black Giants cap he settled onto his thick, brown waves. And did he have to be so damned cute?</p><p>He kicked back, half sitting, half leaning against the bumper, arms crossed at his chest. \u201cBut enough about me. How about you? How\u2019s your fianc\u00e9? Or did you throw him over for that TV douchebag? Gotta hand it to the guy\u2014all that jewelry and hair gel, he sure is pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he works an honest job.\u201d</p><p>Eddie popped to standing. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about a good day\u2019s work. Nobody works harder than me and Jack.\u201d</p><p>She felt a stab of regret at her hurtful words, but there he was, looming over her again. Her defenses kicked in and she sidled out of his way. \u201cIt\u2019s Jack and me. \u2018Me first is the worst.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, angling his body to face hers. \u201cYou think I\u2019m some sort of redneck idiot, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself not to retreat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He took another step closer. \u201cSo, is that the kind of guy you like? Pretty?\u201d</p><p>This time she stepped out of the way, a move that put her up against the side of his truck. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you like?\u201d His voice was a mesmerizingly low rasp. He placed the gentlest finger beneath her chin, tilting her face up to his.</p><p>She should\u2019ve said, Not you.</p><p>She could\u2019ve said an urban professional.</p><p>A well-groomed man, someone who wore Burberry for work and James Perse for weekends.</p><p>She should\u2019ve said, Anyone but you.</p><p>But for some reason, her tongue stuck in her mouth as her eyes locked with his. They were a vibrant blue, glittering with desire that\u2019d become unchecked. He looked like he was going to kiss her.</p><p>And it was looking like she might let him.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>Eddie couldn\u2019t help it. His years of wanting her, his frustration and anger. The way she lashed out, intentionally misunderstanding him. He couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. She\u2019d always gotten to him, even when they were kids. Except back then, when she riled him, all he\u2019d had to do was tug her ponytail. Now he wanted more.</p><p>To touch her, just once. He needed to bring this thing\u2014whatever it was\u2014to a head.</p><p>He placed the gentlest finger beneath her chin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to flinch, but instead her breath caught. Those gorgeous, sparkling eyes were wide, staring at him. The barest suggestion of tears appeared, shimmering, making them even bluer.</p><p>He pulled his hand away, fisting it at his side. Was she scared of him? She ate men like him for breakfast. What was going on in her head?</p><p>She could\u2019ve taken up her concerns with Jack, but instead she\u2019d dogged him. She could\u2019ve been colder, but the anger she hurled at him was fueled by a deep-seated passion. Passion that ran hot.</p><p>\u201cWho are you really, Laura Bailey? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to stop you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, so tired of this backing and forthing. \u201cNo, I mean here. In Sierra Falls. Why are you alone? What happened?\u201d The need to touch her again was unbearable, but he fought it. He\u2019d never touch what wasn\u2019t his to take.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am,\u201d she said, looking ready to snap.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so goddamned beautiful. I know you know it. I see you running along the side of the road in those little short shorts. What are you running from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she trust him? \u201cYou\u2019re running from me.\u201d</p><p>A strand of hair blew into her lashes. The whites of her eyes had turned pink in the corners, like she was holding back some fierce and secret emotion. He ached to smooth the hair from her face. To cup her cheeks and kiss her once on each eye, to make them shine bright again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t run from anyone.\u201d Her voice wavered, like she didn\u2019t really believe it.</p><p>\u201cThen why no boyfriend?\u201d She was so near, he could feel the heat of her, smell her feminine scent, like flowery soap. He was dying to close the gap, but he\u2019d never touch a woman against her will.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a boyfriend. I\u2019m not interested in you or anyone.\u201d She looked away, and he watched as she bristled, her gaze sharpening, focusing inside the truck bed.</p><p>He followed her eyes to a gray hoodie. One of the kids had left it behind in the van.</p><p>She added primly, \u201cI\u2019m especially not interested in a man who won\u2019t take responsibility for his own kid. Or is it kids?\u201d</p><p>He was stunned speechless. He\u2019d come to expect her crazy accusations, but this was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDo you have a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of kids.\u201d He did an exaggerated silent count on his fingers. \u201cSeven. I spent the weekend with my seven kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke like that. I\u2019m being serious.\u201d She looked so brittle, like she was barely keeping herself in one piece.</p><p>Why would Laura care so much about whether he had a kid? It made him want to goad her even more. What would it take for her to break through to the other side? For her to tell him what was really going on in that pretty head of hers? \u201cI\u2019m always serious, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you own up to your obligations? Are you saying you\u2019re not someone\u2019s father? Just cop to it already.\u201d Her cheeks were flushed. Would she be taking this so seriously if she didn\u2019t have some sort of feelings for him?</p> <p>There was chemistry between them, no doubt about it. There always had been. What would it take for her to accept it? Accept him? It was time to clear the air. \u201cLaura, slow down and listen for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a kid,\u201d he said, cutting her off before she could reel back and hurl more his way. \u201cI take care of kids.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, frowning. \u201cWhat do you mean? Like...you babysit?\u201d</p><p>He barked out a laugh. \u201cNo.\u201d His laugh faded as he considered it. \u201cGod, no. Though sometimes it feels like it. I take at-risk kids camping. That\u2019s all. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCamping?\u201d She was staring at him like he\u2019d begun to speak Greek. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re always going to Reno? To pick up at-risk kids?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI work with the community center there, downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. She stared at him, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d He smiled nervously. What was that look on her face? What was she seeing when she looked at him? \u201cI\u2019m not such a monster.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, lifting her face to the sky. \u201cNo, I am.\u201d</p><p>The statement shocked another laugh from him. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, clearly needing a moment to wrap her mind around it. \u201cTo jump to conclusions like that when all the while you\u2019re taking poor kids camping? I\u2019m horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe a little horrible.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIn the prettiest of ways.\u201d</p><p>She shoved him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d Then, studying his truck, she said, \u201cIs that why you got such a ridiculously big vehicle? So you can drive kids around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, they wouldn\u2019t even fit in this old girl. I borrow a van from the center instead.\u201d He patted the shiny red paint job. \u201cYou\u2019re coming around to her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not one little bit.\u201d She glanced at the gear in the back. \u201cSo who pays for all this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I don\u2019t have any bills to pay, not really. There aren\u2019t a lot of good local programs for these kids, so I figure, how hard is it for me to buy stuff like food? They barely eat anything. And then the gear I use over and over again. Other people kick in a little extra here and there. Doctor Mark is always good for some supplies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOther people know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many, no. I don\u2019t advertise or anything. There\u2019s just too much explaining to do.\u201d He added with a smile, \u201cKind of like I\u2019m having to do now.\u201d Seeing her crestfallen expression, he chucked her chin. \u201cKidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, what must you think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a businesswoman looking out for your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve thought I was insane.\u201d She sagged against the side of the truck. \u201cI\u2019ve been such a shrew. I\u2019ve just felt so...alone in all this. It\u2019s overwhelming. I feel like it\u2019s up to me to carry the family.\u201d</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to give the poor woman a hug, but he knew to keep his hands to himself. \u201cSeems like you and Sorrow are getting along now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bug her with everything\u2014she\u2019s got her own thing going on, plus with Sully gone, she\u2019s the one managing all the cooking. And then there\u2019s Dad. Since his stroke, our medical bills have been nuts. You wouldn\u2019t believe the paperwork I have to sift through just when he gets a simple checkup. I did the books recently, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to balance the damned things. When I ran the numbers, the loss I projected with your, your...Slumbertimes Spa\u201d\u2014their eyes met as they shared an amused look\u2014\u201cI just don\u2019t see how we can pull through.\u201d</p><p>Her folks always had seen her as the professional, business-savvy kid in the family, so it was no surprise she\u2019d felt she had to be the one to shoulder all the financial concerns. Still, he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been holding all this in.</p><p>He was just glad he\u2019d made that phone call to Fox. It\u2019d been some lucky damned timing on his part, that was for sure. \u201cWill it help that we\u2019re scaling back the project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Her eyes went to his, and for once there was warmth there. \u201cI mean, yes. Yes, of course. Every little bit helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do more if I could, but Fairview is big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still want to stop them,\u201d she said, her voice suddenly fierce.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s no stopping them completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure out a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I need the business. It\u2019d be a blot on our record if we biffed this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. I get it, I do.\u201d Her gaze drifted back to the camping equipment in his truck bed. \u201cThough I guess it\u2019s not just that. If you lost the job, I\u2019d be taking food and gear away from at-risk inner-city youth? Nice...\u201d</p><p>He drew the back of his finger down her cheek. \u201cYou had no way of knowing.\u201d</p><p>His touch brought her eyes back to him. There was something else there now, something that was seeing him for the first time. Something that smoldered.</p><p>\u201cDid you come out here for anything else?\u201d he asked, hoping.</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cI just...I want this to stop.\u201d</p><p>It was the flick of her tongue that did it. He didn\u2019t need more than that. She\u2019d licked her lower lip. Darted her eyes to his mouth then quickly back up again. He could read signals.</p><p>He knew women, but it was Laura he wanted.</p><p>He stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cStop the construction, or stop this?\u201d He cupped her cheek. Stepped closer, till he felt the heat of her body along his. He moved slowly, giving her every opportunity to stop him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop him. She only stared up at him, looking as disbelieving as he felt.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Laura.\u201d His desire for her was intense, blinding him to everything but that luscious mouth. How many times had he stolen glimpses of it, fantasizing about the dirtiest of things. She\u2019d been his teenage fantasy. His high school crush. And now here she was before him, lips parted slightly, his for the taking. \u201cYou know I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and he had to smile at that, such a Laura thing to say. But he knew she was just nervous. He saw now how vulnerable the Laura Bailey could be.</p><p>He leaned down to her, and for a moment, he hovered just a breath away. He didn\u2019t believe this was actually happening. He\u2019d wanted her for so long. As long as he could remember.</p><p>And then she shocked him.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Eddie.\u201d She snagged his T-shirt in her fists and pulled him the final inch to her. Her mouth slammed into his, devouring him instantly.</p><p>His whole body stiffened, hardened, lust swamping him until his head rang with it.</p><p>He kissed her back. Kissed her like he\u2019d wanted to kiss her since they were kids. Only they weren\u2019t kids now, and his hunger was a man\u2019s hunger, ravenous, wanting to take her, have her.</p><p>He wrapped his hands around her hips and braced her against the side of his truck. And\u2014oh, God\u2014he\u2019d fantasized that, too. Taking her against the side of the truck. In the truck. In the woods. On the tavern bar. Beneath their high school bleachers. So many times, so many ways, and God help him, he wanted them all.</p><p>He kissed her deeply, and she kissed him back, just as deeply, just as hungrily.</p><p>But then she pushed him away, keeping his shirt clenched in her fingers. Breathlessly, she said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing.\u201d He leaned down, nipping at her ear. He\u2019d consider it later. For now, he just wanted to get back to kissing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening, Eddie. I\u2019m going to make Fairview regret the day they found us on the map.\u201d She was so damned sexy. So hot and so passionate.</p><p>His eyes found hers. \u201cBring it, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She shifted. Damn, was she pulling away? But, oh...oh, she was only adjusting, repositioning herself to drag him down to her. She nuzzled into him. He felt her mouth on his jaw, tasting his neck, tugging his shirt lower to lick and suck at his throat.</p><p>He growled with pleasure and pressed his body into hers, his groin so hard he was sure she couldn\u2019t help but feel it. Would it scare her off? But then she writhed into him, adjusting her body, nestling him against her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Laura Bailey.</p><p>He wanted to feel her. He had to feel her, but he was afraid. If he\u2019d fantasized about kissing her, how much had he dreamed of running his hands along that taut body? Of cupping those hot little breasts?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself. He had to. Slowly he inched his hand up. The fabric of her shirt tugged beneath his palm. He rested his hand on her rib cage. Her chest rose and fell as though she were panting to catch her breath. Her heart hammered through her bones, through her skin. He felt it beating against his hand, pounding through his body.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, and brought her mouth back to his, kissing him harder, more frantically.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need more urging than that and slid his hand the last few inches to her breast. So firm, her nipple was a hard peak under his thumb.</p><p>She moaned, and he did, too. He pulled from her, so starved for her, he had to speak through his clenched jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you so bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d She stole small kisses along his jaw. \u201cGod, Eddie, you, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulled from her in disbelief. His heart was punching against his chest, but he had to ask, \u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I have.\u201d She looked as frustrated as he felt. \u201cBut you were so damned stupid in high school. I wanted you, but you never asked me out.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cI was totally in love with you in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a jerk.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his body against hers and gently raked his hands through her hair, cradling her head close against his chest. \u201cNot anymore, Laura. I swear. If you still want me, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Helen murmured, seeing Laura walk in the front door. And what was with the dopey smile?</p> <p>Laura\u2019s eyes found her instantly. \u201cThere you are, Helen.\u201d</p><p>There she was? She\u2019d been trying to call the girl all morning. When Laura finally got around to answering, she was the one who\u2019d acted put out. She\u2019d been out at the old Timber Creek ranch...of course. She seemed to make a hobby out of pestering poor Eddie. She\u2019d invited these television people and then proceeded to take off, running around, waving her petitions, hounding Eddie, flittering around, doing whatever it was she did. Laura got to be free and easy, so busy keeping herself fit and pretty, while most days all Helen felt was used up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Laura greeted her father at the end of the bar. \u201cI take it that\u2019s the window?\u201d She stormed to the shattered window and torn screen, and Helen heard her mutter, \u201cOf course he couldn\u2019t deal with this.\u201d</p><p>Helen followed her. \u201cYour film people broke it with their microphone pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a boom,\u201d Laura said distractedly.</p> <p>Fine. \u201cYour film people broke it with their boom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not my film people.\u201d Laura rounded on her. \u201cThey\u2019re here for the whole town.\u201d</p><p>Helen could only shrug at that. She didn\u2019t care who they\u2019d come for; all she knew was they were about to be the straw that broke her back. They disappeared during the day, but mornings and evenings they crawled all over the place, making themselves at home, ordering her around, asking for things way outside her normal responsibilities...would she order pizzas, find them duct tape, buy the woman a box of tampons, for goodness\u2019 sake.</p><p>She studied the window\u2014didn\u2019t seem like such an emergency, really. \u201cCan\u2019t we just tape it up till it gets fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t just tape it up.\u201d Laura looked at her like she\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cWe have people filming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Hope help?\u201d Their new girl had yet to prove her worth. She was book smart, sure, but she seemed pretty helpless when it came to simple day-to-day chores.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d She already had three kids to keep track of\u2014babysitting new employees definitely was not in her job description.</p> <p>The Bailey girl exploded into action, calling back to the kitchen, \u201cHey, Sorrow. We\u2019ve lost Hope.\u201d</p><p>The Kidd sisters sat at a nearby booth. Pearl turned and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t lose hope, dear.\u201d</p><p>Laura looked like she was strung tight enough to snap. \u201cBut she hasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of hope.\u201d Helen patted the woman on the shoulder, feeling glad to have Laura\u2019s laser eyes shifting off her back for the moment.</p><p>Understanding registered in Laura\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh. Hope is the name of the new girl,\u201d she told Pearl, using a louder, slower, talking-to-senior-citizens voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re old,\u201d Ruby told her. \u201cWe\u2019re not deaf, dear.\u201d</p><p>Helen would bet money that the younger of the two Kidd sisters was, in fact, quite deaf. She hid her smile as she went to grab the pitcher to refill their waters. A few decades ago, those women could\u2019ve given someone like the Bailey girl a run for her money.</p><p>Pearl smiled blandly. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought Hope was a lovely name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the plump girl?\u201d Ruby asked.</p><p>\u201cShe is not plump,\u201d Helen chimed in, feeling a bit put out. Just because those women were skin and bones in their orthopedic sandals gave them no right.</p><p>\u201cAnd Faith,\u201d Pearl said, still in her own thoughts. \u201cThat\u2019s another pretty name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talking about that Hope girl?\u201d Bear swiveled around in his seat. \u201cSure seems plump to me.\u201d</p><p>The man next to him at the bar elbowed him. \u201cGotta have something to hold on to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrudence is pretty, too,\u201d Pearl continued, \u201cthough you never hear that anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ruby leaned in. \u201cDo you remember Prudence Jacobson?\u201d</p><p>Pearl gasped. \u201cScarlet fever took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a tragedy.\u201d Ruby clucked.</p><p>A man at the end of the bar chimed in, \u201cAre you kidding? Hope is hot.\u201d</p><p>Pearl nodded. \u201cIf you mean the plump girl, she\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>Ruby pitched her voice loud for her sister. \u201cShe\u2019s not plump, dear.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave a funny little aggravated cry. \u201cWould you all just\u2014\u201d There was a buzzing, and she slid her phone from her jeans pocket to check it. She made a weird face, then tucked it back away. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>It was the third time since walking in the door that Laura had screened a call, checking the ID, then letting it go to voice mail.</p><p>It didn\u2019t bode well for Helen. Were the Baileys hiring her replacement, and Laura didn\u2019t want to field the call in front of her? Or, had Laura met someone? Was that where she\u2019d disappeared to this morning? A man would take the girl\u2019s mind off things for a while...until it went south and she took it out on them.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist probing. \u201cNew boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s head shot up, and her deer-in-the-headlights expression made Helen think for a moment she\u2019d hit the nail on the head, but then the girl waved it off. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a work thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tavern thing?\u201d she asked, doing her best to keep her voice even, while inside she cursed because, dammit, Laura was looking to replace her.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known. Lately, the woman had watched her every move, acting like she was just waiting for an excuse to chuck her out the door. And with Rob more remote than ever, she was in a panic about it.</p><p>If her husband was sleeping around...Her stomach churned at the thought. If he left her the way she feared he might, she\u2019d need some way to support her family.</p><p>Jobs like this didn\u2019t exactly abound in a town the size of Sierra Falls, and what else was she qualified for besides waitressing and tending bar? It was all she\u2019d ever done. She supposed she could drive all the way to Silver City for work, but then who\u2019d help with the kids?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Laura said distractedly, \u201cit\u2019s my old CEO from San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to register the reply, and then she exclaimed, \u201cOh!\u201d It hadn\u2019t been tavern business. Her job was safe. For now. \u201cYou mean your boss from your old company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s called...\u201d But then Laura seemed to tune in to just who she was talking to. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ve got to deal with this window.\u201d</p><p>She was busy, not stupid. \u201cI went ahead and put a call in to Eddie,\u201d she said, but then paled to see the girl\u2019s strange reaction.</p><p>Stupidly, she hadn\u2019t considered Laura\u2019s hatred of the guy. At the time, all she\u2019d thought was how she didn\u2019t want to be phoning Jack, a married man, so she\u2019d just called the other Jessup instead.</p><p>Helen cringed. She\u2019d messed up now. She wanted to rail at Laura to grow up, but she needed to play nicey-nice if she wanted to keep her job. \u201cSorry, I guess I should\u2019ve called his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Eddie\u2019s...\u201d And then the woman went and blushed. \u201cEddie\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Holy cow. There was no explosion. No bitching. The girl actually blushed.</p><p>Helen was treading dangerous personal territory, but curiosity got the better of her. \u201cI thought you hated Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate Eddie,\u201d Laura snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve never hated Eddie.\u201d</p><p>What was the saying about protesting too much? She just shrugged. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Laura sharpened her eyes and crossed her arms at her chest. The bitch was back. \u201cSo, table four? You are on the clock, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d She forced a smile on her face. Nicey-nice.</p><p>She\u2019d been avoiding table four. June Harlan lunching with Jack Jessup\u2019s wife, Tina. But Laura was right, it looked like their iced teas needed freshening.</p><p>She shuddered to think what they might be talking about, heads leaned close together like that. Every time she approached, their voices got louder and their faces brighter, like they\u2019d only been chatting instead of doing the gossiping she suspected they were doing.</p><p>June\u2019s husband ran the hardware store and was Rob\u2019s boss, so they probably had plenty to jaw about where she was concerned. Had Rob\u2019s mistress ever been in to see him at work? Maybe that was where he\u2019d met her.</p><p>Maybe she was here even now. Frowning, she scanned the room as she went to the bar to grab the pitcher.</p><p>Billy had come in, headed straight for Sorrow in the kitchen, and she overheard them back there. Sorrow was teasing, something about being bad and needing a patdown.</p><p>It was the last thing she needed to hear. Her morning coffee sloshed in her belly, sour and burning. If only she had a reliable man, it would all be so much easier. The Baileys thought they had trouble\u2014one broken window, for God\u2019s sake\u2014but she could school them on trouble. Trouble was her middle name.</p><p>She refilled the tea pitcher, wiped her hands on a rag, grabbed a fresh bowl of cut lemons, and headed back to serve June and Tina.</p><p>If Rob was getting it on the side, it was only a matter of time before he kicked her to the curb. And if her husband left, there\u2019d be no meeting anyone for her. No nice sheriff would ride into her life. She could always try that Internet dating stuff, but what man out there wanted a woman with three young kids? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ladies were leaned closer than ever, and she braced herself to face them. Would that she had a friend to gossip with, but she could only dream of having that kind of time. It made her feel more the outsider than ever. Slowing, she overheard snippets as she approached.</p><p>\u201c...never in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree kids. What would she do?\u201d</p> <p>It was like she\u2019d been punched. She forced a cheery smile, though she was gutted. Dying inside. \u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d</p><p>Their heads sprang apart. \u201cThanks, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about Craig,\u201d June said, referring to Tina\u2019s son, just off to boot camp. \u201cHe says Lake Michigan is pretty in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d She topped off their teas. Sure they were.</p><p>She lived in a town full of judgmental biddies. All she needed was for Marlene Jessup to drive back into town, and then it\u2019d be a party.</p> <p>\u201cThree kids.\u201d There was no doubt\u2014that had to be her.</p><p>So that was how it was. Rob was probably fixing to leave her. Maybe he\u2019d already made the plans. Did everyone at the hardware store know it? Did everyone in town know except for her? She made herself smile, though she feared she probably just looked like she had a screw loose.</p><p>That was it, then. Fine. She handed the ladies their check, grinning like a wild woman.</p><p>More than ever she needed to keep that grin pasted on her face. Maybe one day it\u2019d turn real. Maybe one day she\u2019d really feel like smiling.</p><p>But for now she needed a plan.</p><p>Twenty-three</p> <p>Eddie was getting out of his truck, and as Laura watched him from a distance like this, everyone else faded away. He\u2019d always been one of the best-looking guys in school, but now that he was older...Good Lord, but the man was hot. White T-shirt, faded jeans, tan work boots.</p><p>Memories of their kiss had been so unreal in her head, but here he was, in the flesh. She\u2019d known a flicker of such relief in his arms, like she could let go for a second. It was probably just hearing news of Fairview\u2019s scaled-back construction, but still, that fleeting comfort, the momentary feeling of finding something, had haunted her all day.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the morning racking her brain for excuses to go see him again or have him out to the lodge. Lucky for her, the History Network guys\u2014hungover, no doubt\u2014had given her the opportunity in the form of a shattered window. She hoped finally to shake this feeling of unreality.</p><p>She needed to focus. Regroup. She didn\u2019t want to hurt Eddie and Jack\u2019s business or\u2014God forbid\u2014to take money away from impoverished kids, but surely there was a way to stop Fairview in a way that worked for everyone.</p><p>And now, to complicate matters, the president of her old company had been calling, leaving messages saying how he\u2019d fired the wrong person. Hired the wrong vice president. She was the one who\u2019d been right for the job, but he\u2019d been blinded by her no-good ex, Patrick. His apologies were effusive, and he had an offer, too. If she\u2019d come back, he\u2019d double her pay. Healthy stock bonus package. Top-of-the-line insurance, and her whole family could be covered. He was a smart man. He\u2019d caught that her dad had had a stroke, and it didn\u2019t take a genius to deduce what their premiums must\u2019ve been.</p><p>Talk about vindication. She still hadn\u2019t taken any of his calls, but the attention only made her more confident she\u2019d be able to solve these problems at home.</p><p>A whole other possible future opened itself to her, and it\u2019d given her pause.</p><p>In the same way Eddie was giving her pause.</p> <p>For so long, she\u2019d had it in her head that she was giving up men, and it was a shock to find one preoccupying her thoughts. Surely Eddie didn\u2019t count, though. They\u2019d known each other all their lives.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she was going to marry the guy or anything. No way. She was accustomed to certain things\u2014nice car, nice restaurants\u2014things that Eddie couldn\u2019t provide.</p><p>But they could mess around. Especially now that he\u2019d proven he wasn\u2019t that bad a guy. He\u2019d challenged Fairview on her behalf, and that was something.</p><p>He walked through the tavern door, strode to the bar like he owned the place, and slung his tools by a stool on the floor. He scanned the room till he found her, then gave her a smile that was darker and more meaningful than his usual carefree grins. \u201cHey, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She felt her face turn red to the roots. \u201cHi, Eddie.\u201d He\u2019d been calling her darlin\u2019 since they were teens, but now it was different. Now she knew what it felt like to have him whisper the endearment hot in her ear as she offered her body to him for the taking. She took a steadying breath. \u201cThanks for coming. I know you\u2019re...busy.\u201d</p><p>And that was when she remembered just one of the many reasons why his hotness had been so far from her mind lately. He\u2019d been busy...at the ranch. The threat to her family\u2019s business.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll always come for you.\u201d He got a naughty look on his face.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cHelen, would you please get Eddie a beer?\u201d She knew she could use a cold one.</p><p>\u201cMake it a Coke. Thanks.\u201d He gave the waitress a genuine smile. \u201cI never drink and work.\u201d</p><p>He went to the window to assess the damage. Opening the sash all the way, he jiggled the screen free and pulled it through to the inside. \u201cHey, Bear,\u201d he called to her father, sitting in his spot by at bar. \u201cYou\u2019re not having the best luck with these screens, are you?\u201d</p><p>Bear only grunted.</p><p>\u201cYou could use this as an opportunity, you know. Finally upgrade to better-insulated windows. They have really good energy-efficient ones now. You get a tax break and everything.\u201d</p><p>Bear grunted again.</p><p>\u201cI take that as a no.\u201d Eddie tilted the screen this way and that. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid this is beyond patching. But\u201d\u2014he leaned down, studying the window, knocking at the sash, scraping his thumbnail against the old wood\u2014\u201cthe mullion is old, but it\u2019ll be easy enough to pop out the glass and replace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, pretty lady.\u201d Dan appeared at her shoulder, and she had to bite her cheek, seeing his gelled hair and thumb ring through new eyes. \u201cSorry again.\u201d</p><p>She watched Eddie\u2019s shoulders stiffen and had a brief internal debate, feeling oddly tempted to flirt with Dan just to see how Eddie would respond.</p><p>He said he\u2019d called Fairview for her. That he respected her. Part of her couldn\u2019t believe that Eddie might actually, truly like her for her. She believed he wanted her, but his being fond of her was a different story all together.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d she told the producer. \u201cYou can stop apologizing. Stuff happens.\u201d</p><p>Actually, more than the usual stuff was happening. If the lodge hadn\u2019t needed the publicity so much, she\u2019d have kicked Dan\u2019s crew out by now. They stayed up till all hours every night, and the front parking lot had become the guys\u2019 communal ashtray.</p><p>He slung an easy arm around her shoulders. \u201cLet me make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>She became acutely aware of Eddie, watching how his movements slowed. Was he listening? He\u2019d made fun of the city guys\u2014was he jealous? Protective? Possessive?</p><p>Dan gave her a nudge. \u201cYou checking out the hired help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She realized she\u2019d been staring at Eddie\u2019s backside, and man, was it one fine specimen. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Lola.\u201d Kat, their camerawoman, came over to see what was going on. \u201cSorry again about the window.\u201d Her eyes roved from the broken glass to Eddie, then simply snagged and hung there. She mouthed, Is he single?</p><p>Her chest tightened. Was he single?</p><p>No. Yes. Maybe. Not for girls with spiked hair, she bet.</p><p>What was wrong with her? Why was she fuming? Why didn\u2019t she answer Kat?</p><p>Eddie took that moment to turn around. Seeing the tableau, he got a funny look on his face. \u201cCan I have your help here for a sec, Laura?\u201d</p><p>She jumped into action, realizing she\u2019d hoped for just this sort of excuse to talk to him, even if it was about windows. She\u2019d always been such a pro with men, but something about this situation made her feel shy.</p><p>\u201cI need something to put the broken glass in. Like a trash bin. Or even a large bowl.\u201d He\u2019d put on his work gloves, and she was momentarily mesmerized by the masculine sight. The worn leather framed his forearms, highlighting ropes of muscle that flexed with each movement. There was a sun-faded dusting of hair along his weathered skin. \u201cLaura?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew to his, and a knowing smile was waiting for her. He pitched his voice low. \u201cHow about I finish this up and buy you dinner?\u201d</p><p>Dan ambled up, too close. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage?\u201d</p><p>She fled behind the bar to grab the small plastic trash can they kept for rags. It gave her a second to gather her wits. Dinner with Eddie? She hadn\u2019t really thought past that first kiss.</p><p>Meanwhile, the producer was peering at the window like he was studying something of great importance. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d</p><p>Eddie gave him a funny look. \u201cThis thing? Sure, I can fix it. A child could fix it.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s posture went stiff, making him look like he\u2019d challenge the other man to arm-wrestle if only Eddie wouldn\u2019t have whupped his butt at it.</p><p>All the male posturing was making her uneasy. She put the trash can on the floor and occupied herself by starting to pick up the shards. \u201cI can help you get the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t dare,\u201d Eddie said instantly. \u201cI got this.\u201d He stepped in to take over. \u201cSince the window was broken from the inside, most of the glass went out, anyway. I\u2019ll clean up those bits when I\u2019m done here.\u201d He began to scoop up the shards. \u201cCan\u2019t let you cut those pretty hands.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorted. \u201cCheeky.\u201d</p><p>Eddie stood and tossed the pieces in the plastic bin. With a nod to the window, he asked, \u201cWhat idiot did this, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Laura had to bite back a smirk. She was pretty sure Helen had mentioned precisely which idiot it\u2019d been, but she said evenly, \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan came to stand beside her again, whispering in her ear, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me much.\u201d</p><p>She flinched away, wondering how much she was liking Dan at the moment. \u201cDoesn\u2019t appear so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur boom smashed it,\u201d Dan said more loudly in answer. \u201cAccident, dude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude,\u201d Eddie mumbled.</p><p>They watched as he deftly popped out shards of the broken pane, then used a tool to scrape out the remaining dirt, paint, and glass.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re using?\u201d</p><p>Eddie didn\u2019t look up from his work. \u201cFive-in-one tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta get me one of those.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously, Danny?\u201d She raised a brow. \u201cFor your toolbox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m handy.\u201d He inched closer, studying Eddie\u2019s work. \u201cNot as handy as this guy. But I guess when you do it for a living...\u201d He clapped a chummy hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>At the unexpected contact, Eddie\u2019s arm slipped, and his hand flew through the opening, his forearm grazing along the mullion still jagged with glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Eddie hopped back, shaking out his hand, looking like he\u2019d rather be using it to punch Dan. \u201cA little space, please.\u201d</p><p>Laura gasped, seeing the blood gush along his skin. \u201cOh my God, Eddie, you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, so sorry.\u201d Dan looked panicked.</p> <p>\u201cNo big thing.\u201d Eddie scowled at the cut, fisting and unfisting his hand. \u201cThis part of the arm bleeds a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d She ran to get a clean rag from behind the bar. \u201cHere, wrap it up.\u201d</p><p>He wound it around his arm, cinching it tight. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>Dan backed away. \u201cHey, I should be going, anyway. The guys want to check out that bar cross town.\u201d</p><p>The look she gave him said that was probably a good idea.</p><p>The dinnertime rush was starting in earnest. The hum of diners swirled around her, and Helen and Sorrow could\u2019ve probably used help, but she was worried about Eddie, already back at it.</p><p>She let herself take a moment to sit down. She needed to think. Her phone buzzed and buzzed again as the calls from her old boss had been replaced by a text assault, and they were all so flattering.</p><p>Come back. We need you. Stock + incentives.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Patrick\u2019s gone. Fired his ass.</p><p>There\u2019s nobody better than you.</p><p>You\u2019re an ace. Come back.</p><p>She\u2019d longed for respect. Had felt so stung when the job that should\u2019ve been hers was taken away.</p><p>And now she wished she could\u2019ve told someone about this new job offer, but she was too wary. Nobody would understand. She didn\u2019t have the best track record in Sierra Falls, and in some ways it\u2019d become more important to prove herself at home. If her family heard she\u2019d been offered her old job back\u2014check that, offered an even better job\u2014even if she swore she was home to stay, they\u2019d just be waiting for her to leave.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to leave Sierra Falls. Against all odds and despite what she would\u2019ve guessed, she was actually contented. Challenged, even. Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined she\u2019d want to stay, but there she was, watching Eddie Jessup patch her window, and she was happy about it.</p><p>And what an engrossing sight it was. The windows were a standard size, and he\u2019d cut a replacement pane before coming. She tried not to stare too unabashedly as he made quick work of it, but it was hard when right in front of her was a white T-shirt tugged tight over a broad set of shoulders, muscles flexing as he chipped and sanded and pried, doing all manner of capable man things.</p><p>He was such a guy\u2019s guy, hanging in there till he finished the job, despite the gash on his arm that must\u2019ve been killing him. He was acting immune to the pain.</p><p>She\u2019d known guys like this\u2014she\u2019d grown up around mountain men, and heck, she had an overly macho brother. But her dating life had mostly been in San Francisco, and she\u2019d never been with a guy like this. The most dangerous thing her dates had ever faced was weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic. The most painful thing her fianc\u00e9 had ever encountered was the hangover after his best friend\u2019s bachelor party.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201d He dropped his tools back in his box and recinched the rag around his arm.</p><p>She slid to her feet, feeling a little bummed the show was over. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. A kid could\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>She gestured to his arm. \u201cMay I?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she was doing\u2014she needed to get back to work\u2014but she kept prolonging their time together. \u201cMaybe someone should take a look at it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a doctor?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes, like a doctor.\u201d</p><p>He stuck it out for her perusal. \u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d She gingerly peeled the rag away, and a fresh line of blood appeared along his cut.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Cute.\u201d He stretched and tilted his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just worried you\u2019ll turn around and sue us,\u201d she joked as she wound it back up. She\u2019d known men like this, which meant she also knew they could be tough-guy idiots who\u2019d rather bleed to death than actually ask for help. \u201cCome on, let me at least clean it. I\u2019ll fix you right up...\u201d</p><p>And then you can get out of here, she\u2019d meant to say, but he stepped closer, and suddenly the room felt ten degrees hotter.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say no to that, Doctor Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go back to the lodge,\u201d she said, her face hot. \u201cThat\u2019s where the good first-aid kit is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d</p><p>She was painfully aware\u2014of her stride, of the patrons\u2019 glances, of Helen\u2019s stare\u2014as they made what felt like an endless trek across the dining room and back to the main lodge.</p><p>She led him upstairs, but he paused by her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cHey, this your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said warily. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d She leaned in to peek, searching for the clue that\u2019d given it away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d He strolled in, and she had no choice but to follow.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>He pointed. \u201cPurple bedspread and lamp. I went to school with you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was purple with you. Purple backpack. Purple winter coat. Purple jeans.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI especially liked those purple jeans.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten the purple. \u201cThe color is plum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple, plum, whatever. It\u2019s clear it hasn\u2019t been changed since you were a kid.\u201d He pulled out her desk chair and plopped down, leaning on an elbow to avidly study all her memorabilia.</p><p>She felt herself blush. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t see the need to change it, and it didn\u2019t seem to matter. I guess I always assumed Mom would eventually get rid of everything and turn it into a sewing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not your folks. You could be an old woman, and they\u2019ll still have your room done up like it was yesterday.\u201d</p><p>The comment gave her pause. Was that really true? Was she really so valued?</p><p>He peered at the photos pinned on her bulletin board. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d be the one to have redone it by now. Some modern Ikea look, or maybe Japanese antiques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm,\u201d she mumbled doubtfully. She went to the bathroom to grab the first-aid stuff, and when she returned, Eddie was standing, eyeing every last item on that bulletin board.</p><p>It was the same junk she\u2019d had in high school. A Hello Kitty postcard. A 13.1 sticker from when she\u2019d run a half marathon in Sonoma. A picture of her in her cheerleading uniform. She\u2019d been meaning to go through it with a big trash bag, but there was never any time.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you climbed.\u201d</p><p>She came up behind him to study the picture of her on an indoor rock wall. \u201cOh, that. That\u2019s from a couple years ago. I sent it to Mom, and for some reason she hung it up.\u201d She did a little self-effacing shrug\u2014parents could be embarrassing, even if you were twenty-eight. \u201cIt was from a team-building thing at my old company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d He shocked her by taking one of her hands in his. Goose bumps shivered up her arms at the feel of those warm, large hands enveloping hers. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like they belong to a climber.\u201d</p><p>She tugged away. \u201cI\u2019m not a real climber,\u201d she said, though it was kind of a lie. It\u2019d been one of her favorite workouts. It was indoors and perfectly safe, but she found such joy in it nonetheless. She was always so regimented in her life, and dangling high above the ground was the one time she felt free. Felt dangerous. \u201cI used to go to a climbing gym in the city. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like a big deal to me.\u201d He turned his attention to an old shot from her high school cheerleading days. \u201cNot as big a deal as this, though.\u201d He leaned closer, grinning. \u201cGod, I had such fantasies about you in that little skirt.\u201d</p><p>She plucked the picture from the wall and put it facedown.</p><p>He turned back to her and suddenly he was right there. \u201cYou always were a hottie, Laura Bailey.\u201d</p><p>The compliment overwhelmed her. There was a depth to his gaze that suggested he spoke to so much more than her looks\u2014that she was a hottie because of those photos and trinkets and purple bedspread.</p><p>It felt like she\u2019d inadvertently spilled a secret she hadn\u2019t meant to tell. She felt vulnerable, and vulnerability made her nervous.</p><p>Instead of responding, she opened the bottle of hydrogen peroxide and soaked a cotton ball with it. \u201cGive me your arm.\u201d She dabbed the peroxide with abandon.</p><p>\u201cStill are,\u201d he said in that voice...that voice he got. \u201cHotter than ever.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and dabbed harder. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look so bad.\u201d Now that he\u2019d stopped bleeding, she could tell the cut wasn\u2019t nearly as horrific as all that blood had implied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, that stuff stinks.

Now stand still.\u201d</p><p>She finished with the cotton ball and felt his eyes on her as she put on the antibiotic ointment. \u201cMaybe you should have your brother check it out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might scar.\u201d</p> <p>She was liking him too much. Liking this too much.</p><p>\u201cI thought women went for men with scars.\u201d The moment she sealed the last Band-Aid on his skin, he brought his hand to her face, tucking her hair behind her ear. \u201cHow about you, Laura? You always liked the bad boys.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the comment and instead backed away from his touch. \u201cBe sure to keep it covered.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted this. She didn\u2019t want a boyfriend, least of all Eddie. They\u2019d known each other just too long for this not to end with either a ring or a breakup. In her mind, in this small town, both options were completely unpalatable.</p><p>\u201cIf it got infected, you\u2019d have a big problem,\u201d she said tersely.</p> <p>\u201cLaura, babe. Look at me.\u201d He cupped her cheek.</p><p>She held her breath. Looking at him was a bad idea. It was all too easy to lose her way in those blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got only one problem at the moment,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need you to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four</p> <p>Laura knew she desired Eddie\u2014what hot-blooded American woman wouldn\u2019t? But how badly did she want him? \u201cI need to think.\u201d</p><p>He quirked a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to think about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, consider what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m getting into?\u201d A medley of expressions crossed his face, all of them some variation of amused and dirty. \u201cDarlin\u2019, I can think of ten responses to that, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d like one of them.\u201d</p><p>She removed his hand from her face. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Laura, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Sierra Falls is tiny. We\u2019ll see each other everywhere. At the gas station, tavern, grocery store...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what will people think?\u201d Did she want everyone to see her as his girlfriend\u2014or someday ex-girlfriend? And what about her family? Or his family? She ran into Jessups everywhere.</p><p>He stepped closer. \u201cI don\u2019t give a good Goddamn what people think. I think I\u2019d like to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted that, too, but...She tried to think of another reason. \u201cEddie, really...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he coaxed in a husky voice. He wrapped his hand around her waist, easing her closer, and God, he felt so good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss.\u201d</p><p>She clutched that bottle of peroxide to her like armor and pressed her other palm against his chest to hold him back. Did he have to have such a thin T-shirt and such a hard, hot body? \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to the tavern.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be doing this. Couldn\u2019t be doing it with Eddie. Eddie Jessup, for goodness\u2019 sake, the twelfth-grade screwup. The guy who\u2019d toilet-papered the principal\u2019s house. Who\u2019d shown up to prom drunk.</p><p>Who used his own money to take underprivileged kids on camping trips.</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss.\u201d He ran a finger down her cheek. \u201cCome on. I see you caving.\u201d</p><p>She had to get a handle on this. \u201cWe cannot be hooking up in my childhood bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d When she didn\u2019t reply, his face warmed into the sweetest smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cFine, sugar. It\u2019s your show. No hooking up.\u201d He added innocently, \u201cJust one kiss.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t strong enough to simply turn and walk out on him, but she knew a man like him would need mollifying. \u201cOne kiss. Fine.\u201d She stood on her tippy-toes and gave him a quick, chaste peck on the cheek. \u201cOkay?\u201d But as she returned to her feet, her chest brushed against his and her body began to pulse.</p><p>Their eyes met. Held.</p><p>\u201cThat all you got for me?\u201d His voice was a deep, rich rasp. His eyes were glued on her mouth, and they were hooded, dark in a way that made her shiver. He angled his pelvis to hers and, with a wicked half smile, brushed his jeans against her ever so slightly. He was a rock.</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI don\u2019t usually go this fast,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cFast?\u201d He gave a husky little laugh. \u201cLaura, we\u2019ve known each other since we were five. Any slower and our next kiss will be in a retirement home. Come on.\u201d He leaned close to whisper, \u201cJust one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, hell.\u201d The peroxide bottle dropped to the ground as she wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down and kissing him hard.</p><p>He moaned, and the feel of it reverberated through her. She opened her mouth wider, grabbed his shoulders and tugged him closer. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t get him close enough. Couldn\u2019t touch him enough. She ran her hands through his hair, pressed her breasts against his chest, chafed her palms against the sandpaper stubble along his cheeks.</p><p>He was two people. He was Eddie Jessup, the bad boy. The one you didn\u2019t bring home to Mama. The Eddie who\u2019d always tickled her imagination. Who\u2019d made her wonder how and if. The Eddie it felt so deliciously wrong to kiss.</p><p>But then he was also Eddie the man, who\u2019d fixed their window, and called her dad sir, and phoned Fairview just for her. The one who mentored at-risk kids.</p><p>Which Eddie was her body responding to? Young Eddie might\u2019ve been a bad boy, but Eddie the man was far more dangerous.</p><p>When they parted, his eyes bored into hers like he might peer down to her soul.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about it. Didn\u2019t want to think about this feeling she had when he looked at her like that. This feeling of relief. Of security. Of protection.</p><p>So she kissed him again. Told herself she was kissing Eddie the bad boy. The one she\u2019d sneaked peeks at in homeroom. The one she\u2019d ogled whenever he\u2019d played any sort of ball on all kinds of fields ever since they were twelve.</p><p>She\u2019d made the move, and his response was instant. Now he was the one to angle his mouth and take the kiss deeper. This time it was his fingers in her hair, tipping back her head. It was his hand roving her body, kneading her, and\u2014oh God...</p><p>She pulled away with a gasp. His fingers were cupped over her breast, where he\u2019d been doing amazing, magical things. She cradled her hand over his and felt the thumping of her own heart.</p><p>He grazed a thumb over her peak, giving her a questioning look. \u201cYou still with me?\u201d His gaze was quiet and intense, like he might be able to read the real her.</p><p>Yes, she realized. She was. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her his crinkle-eyed smile, and a feeling of such tenderness warmed her, but then it was heat that followed, cascading from her chest all the way down to her toes. Had she always loved his smile? Was it just that she\u2019d been afraid of what it meant? Afraid of how it\u2019d made her think dirty things with this bad boy?</p><p>She promised herself she\u2019d consider all of it...later. For now, she had to kiss him just one more time. She stood on her toes, running her hands up the nape of his neck. \u201cSo kiss me already.\u201d</p><p>He did, but then this time he was the one to pull away first. \u201cI thought you said slower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she muttered. Feeling a bit breathless, she tugged him back.</p><p>With a low, rumbling laugh, he brought his mouth down, trailing kisses along her jaw, down her neck. He was going lower, and every atom in her body wanted and feared it both.</p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to calm her body down a notch. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re making out in my high school bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother of my fantasies to check off the list.\u201d He kissed below her throat, dipping even lower. Her shirt had a low scoop neck, and he was grazing dangerously close to the neckline.</p><p>She finally registered his words. \u201cThis was a fantasy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He roamed back up to kiss her jaw. Her cheek. Dipped in to take her mouth.</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cWhat else did you fantasize about?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled. \u201cYou still got that cheerleading costume lying around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPig.\u201d She gave him a little shove, but there was laughter in her voice.</p><p>He laughed broadly, scooping her tightly to him. \u201cYou pushing me around like that...that might be somewhere on the list, too.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice pitched deeper. \u201cBut this is.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her, and instinctively she wrapped her legs around his waist. She felt so exhilaratingly small in his arms. He carried her across the room until her back touched the wall.</p><p>She curved her body, grinding into him. She\u2019d told him slower, but now all she could think was faster, faster, more.</p><p>He braced his hand on her purple-flowered wall, kissing her in bad-boy ways that would\u2019ve horrified the popular girl who\u2019d done the decorating.</p><p>There was a knock. The door creaked. Then, \u201cOh, jeez, sorry. Oh.\u201d</p><p>She unhooked her legs and swung her feet to the ground. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s firm, protective hand didn\u2019t budge from the small of her back, as Hope looked from her, to him, and back again.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the woman sputtered. \u201cI was...So sorry, Laura. I just couldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice sounded angry even to her own ears. She took a calming breath. \u201cWhat do you need, Hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find the hand towels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t find the hand towels,\u201d she repeated flatly. She stepped away, and finally Eddie let her. \u201cThey\u2019re in the linen closet, with all the other towels.\u201d She registered the stack of sheets balanced in Hope\u2019s arms. \u201cWait, what have you got?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have a couple checking in tomorrow morning, so I thought I\u2019d get the room ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they were staying in the Gold Rush room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose sheets are for the Pioneer Suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. But these are\u201d\u2014Hope glanced at the sheets then back at her\u2014\u201cthey looked like they\u2019d fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the room. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d When Hope left, she looked up at Eddie, who wore an aggravatingly amused expression. \u201cI should help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is really a disaster if the Pioneers use the Gold Rush sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a system, Eddie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can see.\u201d He wandered to her bureau and began to nonchalantly poke at the stuff she kept there. She knew he was probably disappointed, but was that uncertainty she read on his face? Eddie Jessup, uncertain? \u201cCan I buy you dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She paused, shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll just have to be happy I got dessert.\u201d Before she had a chance to respond, he added, \u201cSo when\u2019s the next time we get to make out in your room?\u201d</p><p>He picked up her pinecone, and instantly she said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He raised his brows, incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pinecone. There are a thousand of them on the ground outside your front door.\u201d</p><p>She nervously eyed it in his hands. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, sorry.\u201d His voice got tender, and he put it back down. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Now it was her turn to feel uncertain. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get weird on you. It\u2019s just...my grandfather gave it to me when I was little. I know...heirloom pinecone. Probably sounds stupid, huh?\u201d</p><p>But he remained serious. \u201cYour dad\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Grandpa Jim on my mom\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember him.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay attention, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not just a pinecone.\u201d She came and shifted it to its proper place. \u201cHe used to burn them in the fireplace. Dad hated the smell.\u201d She smirked. \u201cSometimes I think that\u2019s why Grandpa did it. Anyway, he\u2019d help me gather them. He had a special basket for me and everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of adorable.\u201d</p><p>It was, she supposed. More than that, it had always made her feel special. \u201cIt was just something we did, just him and me. He\u2019d bake with Sorrow and play backgammon with BJ. But with me it was walks and pinecones. He\u2019d take me out to the falls...I still go sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling low. I always take a quick detour on the road back to the city. When I\u2019m there, I feel connected, like he\u2019s looking down on me and I\u2019m not alone anymore.\u201d She shrugged, a little abashed. \u201cI always bring him a pinecone.\u201d</p><p>She realized Eddie was looking at her funny. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He tucked his hand along her waist and slid it around her. \u201cJust...you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me what?\u201d Had she said too much? She had to lean away to look up at him. \u201cAm I being silly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, on the contrary. Sometimes you act all tough. But really I think you\u2019re a lot softer than you let on. You\u2019re kind of like that pinecone there,\u201d he said, nuzzling her playfully. \u201cHard on the outside with the tender meat inside.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cTender meat? Um, ew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, nature girl. Didn\u2019t your grandfather tell you on your walks?\u201d He pointed to the pinecone. \u201cYou can eat those, you know.\u201d</p><p>She thought about those petit fours she\u2019d had with the Kidd sisters, and their talk of how the hard shell masked the sweetness inside. She\u2019d been told the same thing twice now. Did she really act that tough? Might she really have a tender side? She guessed both were maybe true.</p><p>People always saw just one thing with her. Commenting on how rigid she was. How disciplined. How controlling. How thin or how fit. How this, how that. So how was it Eddie Jessup saw past all that? It was unsettling but comforting, too.</p><p>\u201cYou can really eat these?\u201d She plucked the pinecone from her dresser, and even after all these years, the hard, sharp ridges poked her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, goof. Where do you think pine nuts come from?\u201d He pointed to the tips. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever stuck in the woods, find a pinecone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you get the nuts out of there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it with your bare hands. I\u2019ll show you sometime.\u201d He carefully took it and put it back in its exact place. \u201cYou deny it, but I think you really are nature girl at heart.\u201d</p><p>She almost said no. She wasn\u2019t this secretly soft, nature person he was talking about, and there would be no next time besides.</p><p>But instead she heard herself say, \u201cYes. Show me.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>Laura sat in the chair at Claire\u2019s Cuts studying herself in the mirror. She and her sister had taken a break from the lodge for a little personal maintenance. It\u2019d been Sorrow\u2019s idea, and Laura had acted resistant, but really, she didn\u2019t mind the idea of a little prettying up. She told herself it was just for her, that she liked looking good for herself.</p><p>It certainly had nothing to do with any Jessups.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easy to brighten it up.\u201d Claire ran her fingers through Laura\u2019s freshly trimmed waves as they discussed adding some highlights. \u201cConceal the grays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConceal the whats?\u201d She spun in the chair.</p><p>\u201cSome grays.\u201d Claire caught her eyes in the mirror. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a few.\u201d</p><p>She darted her eyes to Sorrow, seated in a neighboring chair. \u201cCan you see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No.\u201d Her sister gave her an apologetic shrug. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she whispered as she peered at herself in the mirror. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you found gray hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do it,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cWhy not?\u201d She was in a neighboring chair where she was flipping through an old InStyle magazine. She shut it, looked at the cover, then opened it again. \u201cClaire, this is two years old. It\u2019s not even \u2018in style\u2019 anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Best Of\u2019 issue and it has Carrie Underwood on the cover.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow displayed the cover. \u201cHey, Laura, you can learn Ten Ways to Reduce Stress.\u201d</p><p>She was still stuck on the gray hair sighting and shot back, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t have any gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot,\u201d the stylist said reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even see it till she pointed it out.\u201d Sorrow traded the InStyle for a more recent Us Weekly. \u201cThis is more like it.\u201d</p><p>Claire riffled through her hair, bouncing it in her palms. \u201cMy advice? We take the highlights up a bit, but\u201d\u2014she put her hands on her shoulders to stress her point\u2014\u201cthen you need to relax more. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll stop the premature aging.\u201d</p><p>She slouched in her chair, grumbling. \u201cPremature aging.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow held up a photo spread. \u201cHey, ladies, who wore it better?\u201d</p><p>She only needed to give it a quick glance. \u201cEasy. Kate Middleton. Duh. She\u2019s always going to win that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl?\u201d Claire tsked. \u201cToo skinny.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over again. \u201cWhat did that other woman do to her eyes?\u201d Then leaned in for a closer look. \u201cWho is that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows anymore?\u201d Sorrow flipped to another page. \u201cSo many of these people are just famous for being famous.\u201d</p><p>The stylist steered Laura back upright. \u201cAre we going to do this or not? I\u2019ve got to pick up Abbie from swim team soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should?\u201d If she still lived in the city, she wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about lightening her natural highlights. But now the prospect made her feel oddly self-conscious. \u201cI\u2019d feel kind of weird about strolling into the tavern with Marilyn Monroe hair.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Marilyn Monroe. You\u2019re too thin for that, anyway. I\u2019m the one who got the curves in the family.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s mind flashed back to Eddie and his skilled hands. He seemed to like her curves just fine.</p><p>\u201cNobody will be able to tell,\u201d Claire assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll just look...brighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by that, she doesn\u2019t mean smarter.\u201d Sorrow smirked, not looking up from her magazine.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She rolled up the ancient People magazine that was in her lap, reached over, and swatted her baby sister. \u201cYou\u2019re the one sitting there reading old news about Brangelina.\u201d She sat back up, all settled. \u201cOkay, Claire. Do it.\u201d She shot Sorrow an evil grin. \u201cMy sister will just have to wait for me.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Claire left to pick up her ninth-grader, and Laura sat there with dozens of tiny foil strips in her hair, Sorrow at her side.</p><p>Her sister was clearly engrossed in some article, but she wanted to talk. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cMy magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Depp interview.\u201d Sorrow held it closer, reading the fine print on the photo spread. \u201cH-O-T hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tries not to be,\u201d Laura said, trying to make conversation. \u201cYou know, he tries to play it down. Living in France. Wearing all those hobo clothes.\u201d She paused, but her sister wasn\u2019t taking the bait. \u201cBut there\u2019s no stopping the hawt.\u201d Finally she just leaned over. \u201cCan I see?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow sighed and flopped the magazine onto her lap. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is what?\u201d She gave Sorrow an innocent look. \u201cI just wanted to see the Johnny Depp pictures.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She slouched in the chair as much as she could without mussing her bleaching hair. \u201cEddie\u2019s ranch project is still freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said he was scaling back the construction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is, but I ran the numbers again, estimating the size of their hotel. Even with the new smaller scale, our projected loss is still too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re making too big a deal out if it,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cThink about it for a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Sorrow kept her patience and said gently, \u201cI know, but the numbers will work out. Their resort will be totally different from the lodge. It\u2019ll be more like a spa. Mud baths, massages...it\u2019ll draw visitors to Sierra Falls we\u2019d never get otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we do mostly get hunter-hiker types.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019ll get hunter-hiker wives.\u201d Sorrow reached over and put a hand on her knee. Earnestly, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. It might even be good for us. Have you thought about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it would be nice to have a place to get a decent mani-pedi without having to drive all the way to Silver City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Sorrow said brightly as she riffled through the stack and grabbed a new magazine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a good attitude about it, because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping it. If Eddie tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard, really?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow laughed. \u201cEnough already. Stop fretting over Eddie. He\u2019s a good guy. He wouldn\u2019t intentionally do something that was bad\u2014for us or for the town.\u201d</p><p>Laura sulked at that, knowing it was the absolute truth. He\u2019d been so much safer when he wasn\u2019t a good guy. She turned her attention to her own magazine, blindly flipping through.</p> <p>Good guy. That was the trouble. He was a good guy.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have such a bee in your bonnet about him, anyway?\u201d Sorrow\u2019s hands grew still. Not looking up from her Vanity Fair, she said, \u201cUnless you secretly like him.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. That was the problem.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sorrow said, misunderstanding. \u201cYou\u2019re holding out for your zillionaire.\u201d</p><p>Would she really want a zillionaire? She certainly wouldn\u2019t find one in Sierra Falls.</p><p>For half a second, she considered telling her sister about the job offer from her old CEO. She considered the offer itself. If she took her old job back, it\u2019d solve all kinds of financial problems for the family. It\u2019d mean better health insurance. A bigger cushion for all of them. Not to mention the fact that she\u2019d meet all kinds of single executive types.</p><p>And she was sure very few of them spent their free weekends taking kids camping.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s kind of boring.\u201d Sorrow traded Vanity Fair for Vogue and became engrossed in several pages of ads.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know he takes poor kids camping?\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cWho, Eddie?\u201d It took Sorrow a second to get what she was talking about. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said warily. \u201cBilly helped him a couple months ago with one of the kids.\u201d</p><p>She waited a moment, letting the silence hang, then demanded, \u201cWell?\u201d She stared at Sorrow, who was aggravatingly engrossed in her reading. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Her sister shrugged. \u201cOne of the older boys got into a scrape, but Eddie vouched for him, and Billy intervened. Convinced Reno PD the kid just needed a talking-to, rather than sending him to juvie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow looked at her like she was nuts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d She went back to her magazine, more flustered than ever, and flipped angrily through the pages.</p><p>So, he was a good guy. A nice guy. A good egg.</p><p>She looked up with a huff. \u201cWell, he could be a saint for all I care, but he needs to get his business in order.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow finally spun her salon chair, facing Laura completely. \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t finalize our fourth-quarter budget until I have a full picture of what our expenses will be.\u201d She turned her attention back to a spread on fall dresses. \u201cIf he\u2019s such a good guy, you can tell him he needs to bill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill us for what?\u201d Sorrow asked, sounding perplexed.</p><p>\u201cFor all the stuff he\u2019s done around the lodge. Who knows what that\u2019s all going to come to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, nothing? It\u2019ll add up to something, believe me. These contractors charge a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie never charges Dad. They\u2019ve got something worked out. I mean, we pay for materials, but his labor is always free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll note he never has a bar tab,\u201d Sorrow said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cThis is serious. Our expenses are out of control. Somebody needs to keep track of everything, and that somebody is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Laura. It\u2019s fine. It all works out in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a horrible way to do business,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s how we do business.\u201d Her sister uncrossed her legs and gave her a pointed look. \u201cEddie\u2019s like family. They\u2019re just little jobs, anyway. I\u2019m sure Dad would insist on paying him if he did something big. Like when he patched the roof. We paid him then.\u201d Sorrow turned her attention back to her magazine, flipping through like it was no big deal. \u201cI know you have a thing against the guy, which is why I don\u2019t really talk about him. But I promise, he\u2019s got no secret plans to destroy us. He doesn\u2019t want to take us down. He\u2019s not going to stick us with some crazy unexpected bill. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a cutie-pie, too. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if he ever settles down. It\u2019s gotta happen eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Her sister continued to flip through her magazine, blithely prattling on about things that were turning knots in Laura\u2019s belly. \u201cHe\u2019s so great with those kids\u2014I\u2019m sure he must want some of his own someday. If any woman could catch him, he\u2019d be awesome husband material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, old Stanley down at the recycling center. Yes, dummy. Eddie. I\u2019ve seen so many girls throw themselves at him. He\u2019s got to be holding out for something. I wonder what it\u2019d take to get a guy like that to settle on just one woman.\u201d Sorrow got a swoony little look on her face. \u201cFor him to tell her, hey babe, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>But Laura knew. He already had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all yours,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>And he\u2019d said it to her.</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cNo, I said we\u2019re going with the PEX pipe, not the PVC.\u201d Eddie leaned his elbows on the counter, breathing slowly to keep his temper.</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d Rob said, then surreptitiously checked his watch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d He was only half joking. \u201cShift over soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rob gave him a guilty smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since seven.\u201d</p><p>He wondered where the guy would be running off to at one in the afternoon, because Eddie sure as hell never saw him with his wife or kids. He felt sorry for poor Helen\u2014her husband surely had something going on the side, though concealing it in a town this small was some feat. Rob must\u2019ve been dipping into action outside the town limits.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, the guy needed to man up and deal with himself. It wasn\u2019t like Eddie didn\u2019t understand the concept of wanting to be somewhere else. In fact, he could think of a whole mess of other places he wanted to be. Like...</p><p>Instead of coming with Jack to the hardware store to pick up an order, he could be picking up Laura.</p><p>Instead of doing errands, he could be doing Laura.</p><p>She consumed his thoughts. He just wanted to lose himself in her.</p><p>He blew out a breath and checked the clock on the back wall. He\u2019d call her later. Convince her about that dinner. Laura needed pursuing, and he was more than up for the challenge.</p><p>For now, though, he had responsibilities. He wanted to be all kinds of elsewhere, but he kept his word. Which meant he was standing at this counter, waiting for this guy to do his job.</p><p>\u201cAll set,\u201d Rob said, and Eddie zoned back in.</p><p>\u201cCool, thank\u2014Wait.\u201d He pointed to the ancient screen. \u201cYou typed PVC again. I said we don\u2019t need PVC.\u201d</p><p>He loved Up Country Hardware, but wasn\u2019t it time they upgraded? Got a new system...maybe a new employee even.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d Rob peered at the order like he was seeing it for the first time. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Did he? Because demo on the ranch had gone fast. They were down to the studs, and work needed to happen quickly. They couldn\u2019t get stopped up now with the wrong gauge of the wrong pipe. He\u2019d stuck out his neck enough, asking Fox to scale back the project. He couldn\u2019t be pushing back the date on top of it.</p><p>Rob pecked at the keys. \u201cSorry. The PEX won\u2019t be in till tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all set?\u201d Jack came up from behind and dumped some stuff onto the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll pull my truck around. Let\u2019s load up the pipe.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head, rubbing the rim of his ball cap. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His brother gave him a flat look. \u201cWhat do you mean, can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob here ordered the PVC, not the PEX.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in first thing tomorrow,\u201d Rob assured them.</p><p>\u201cBut we need it this afternoon.\u201d Jack caught sight of the bright yellow flyer pinned behind the register. \u201cAnd what the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>STOP THE DESTRUCTION\u2014END THE CONSTRUCTION</p><p>He smirked, clapping Jack on the shoulder. Laura was a challenge unlike any he\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cThat, big brother, is Laura Bailey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot cool, Eddie. If Fairview gets wind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out.\u201d He spotted a familiar car pull into the lot and broke into a grin. \u201cI\u2019m all over this.\u201d</p><p>Jack saw whom he\u2019d spotted and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in over your head with that one.\u201d Then he turned his attention back to Rob. \u201cSo tomorrow...for sure?\u201d</p> <p>Rob checked the screen one more time. \u201cYes, for sure that order will be in tomorrow, first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, today is shot.\u201d Jack checked the time on his cell. \u201cI guess it\u2019s paperwork for me this afternoon. Come on, I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m cool.\u201d He watched Laura stride in, a baby-blue sundress fluttering around her gleaming, tanned legs. \u201cLooks like my ride just got here.\u201d He gave her a big smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, sugar?\u201d</p><p>She got that look she got, the one that said she couldn\u2019t decide whether she wanted to kiss him or kick him. \u201cIsn\u2019t what right?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cTold you. Out of your league, brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give me a ride.\u201d He gave her an affectionate wink. \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s a real cute haircut.\u201d</p><p>That flummoxed her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to run his fingers through those soft waves. \u201cIt\u2019s lighter, too.\u201d</p><p>She touched it, looking a little self-conscious. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be able to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice everything about you, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted from him to the other men, as though remembering she and Eddie weren\u2019t the only ones in the room. She put her purse on the counter and proceeded to ignore him, exchanging pleasantries with Rob.</p> <p>Jack shook his head, chuckling. \u201cSo, tomorrow...we\u2019ll hit the site seven sharp?\u201d</p><p>He touched a finger to his cap. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan.\u201d</p><p>Laura cut her eyes his way. \u201cWell...good-bye, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry.\u201d He leaned against the counter. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I told you, you\u2019re my ride.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, looking unsure of her next move.</p><p>Rob was the first to fill the silence, asking Laura, \u201cWhat did you say you needed?\u201d</p><p>Eddie smiled, not taking his eyes from her. \u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her head swung toward him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say what you needed. Our friend here is trying to clock out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Rob asked again.</p><p>\u201cI think she does need something. Don\u2019t you, tiger?\u201d</p><p>Rob was clueless to the flirting, focused only on how many minutes it was till one o\u2019clock.</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cWell, if you must know, I thought I\u2019d swing by to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo?\u201d Eddie raised his brows. He was desperately curious now\u2014why was she acting so uncharacteristically shy?</p><p>Staring exclusively at Rob, she finished in a rush, \u201cI came by to get the petition and ask you to take down the flyers.\u201d</p><p>Eddie cracked a huge smile. Progress. \u201cTaking down the petitions, huh? Does that mean I\u2019m not such a bad guy after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>It sounded a lot like what she\u2019d told him during their first kiss. He rubbed his jaw. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve heard you say those words before...\u201d</p><p>She grew visibly agitated.</p><p>Rob gathered all the bright yellow flyers and handed them over. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you remember.\u201d He leaned against the counter, giving her his full attention. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything. If you don\u2019t remember saying the words...well, maybe that means you didn\u2019t mean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye then.\u201d Rob looked relieved to finally be getting out of there. \u201cIf you need anything else, Tom is in the back office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Haskell,\u201d Eddie said automatically, but his gaze hadn\u2019t budged from Laura. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see...as I recall, you told me nothing was changing. Nothing would be different.\u201d</p><p>He studied her profile, watched her chest rise with a deep breath. She turned to face him.</p><p>That was the woman he knew\u2014never one to back off in a showdown. He loved that about her. He pitched his voice lower, wishing he could pin her up against the counter, then and there. \u201cWere you wrong? Is it different for you now, Laura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cHow about I remind you?\u201d He took a step closer and ran his hand down her smooth, bare arm.</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch away; she only stared up at him raptly, her lips slightly parted. She\u2019d been with pretty city boys, but just then he wondered if Laura had ever been with a man.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move away, but she didn\u2019t move forward, either. But it was all good. He was happy to be the one with the moves.</p><p>He swept his hand down one last time, twining his fingers with hers. \u201cI need to speak with you outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She was wide-eyed, resembling that cornered cat again.</p><p>There was a distant phone ringing. Tom\u2019s voice carried to them from the back office.</p><p>He nodded somberly. He was barely keeping his head, he wanted her so bad. \u201cI think maybe we should take this to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said finally. Her hand tightened, her fingers squeezing his. \u201cMaybe we should.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>Laura felt so naughty. So recklessly, wickedly bad in a way she\u2019d previously only fantasized about.</p><p>She was blowing off work for the afternoon...to be with Eddie. He\u2019d taken her hand. It\u2019d felt so good, and yet she\u2019d had to make herself not pull away. Make herself keep her cool. Keep her head.</p><p>She barely remembered the car ride to his place.</p><p>She wanted him, and she told herself it was okay to want him. For once, she\u2019d let herself be this person who said sexy things to sexy men.</p><p>She pulled into the gravel driveway, and the moment she yanked the emergency brake into place, he was reaching over the center console, sweeping the hair from her brow, cupping her face and turning it to his. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She put her hand on his cheek, ready. Now that she\u2019d made her decision, she was eager to make out right there. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>But Eddie closed the gap slowly, taking a deep and gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d he whispered as he pulled away. He was out of the car and opening the door for her before she\u2019d even caught her breath.</p><p>He kept a hand on her lower back as they went up to the porch. He\u2019d been so slow and deliberate in the car, but the tension between them grew with each step, his movements becoming urgent. He kept his hand on her waist as he fumbled with the keys.</p><p>The door unlocked and the keys jingled in the knob as it swung open. He swept her inside, yanked off his cap, threw it across the floor. He didn\u2019t pause to shut the door. He simply closed in, his body hot and hard along her chest and thighs.</p><p>\u201cEddie.\u201d She pressed into him, sliding her hands along his waist. \u201cIs this really happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, hell yes.\u201d He claimed her mouth in a kiss that exploded to life. It wasn\u2019t slow, or gradual; it was frantic and hungry. A kiss that\u2019d been simmering for years.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He pulled away, looking winded. \u201cDammit,\u201d he hissed under his breath. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She tried tugging him back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to shower.\u201d</p><p>She curled her fingers, holding tight to his shirt. She wanted him, and she wanted him now. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. A few hours ago, I was hauling old drywall to the dump.\u201d He cradled her face in his hands. \u201cLaura, I\u2019ve been waiting, what, fifteen years for this moment? I\u2019d rather my smell not turn you off before we even start.\u201d</p><p>This moment? She knew what he meant, and her skin tugged tight in anticipation. She debated offering to shower with him. There were women who would have. She could\u2019ve purred something sexy about washing his back.</p><p>\u201cYou smell just fine to me,\u201d she said instead, but she let his shirt slide from her fingers, anyway. She wasn\u2019t that brave. Yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be two minutes.\u201d He disappeared into the bathroom and soon the sound of the shower filled the tiny cabin.</p><p>Waiting made her nervous. She fought the urge to check her cell phone, vowing she\u2019d give herself an afternoon to be this new Laura. This carefree Laura. The one who skipped out of work for a little afternoon delight.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d find only the usual messages, anyway. Lodge reservations, cancellations, inquiries. Maybe something from the film crew\u2014they were supposed to be shooting in the old Town Hall today, and she got the impression the Kidd ladies weren\u2019t well acquainted with the concept of quiet on the set. She\u2019d probably have a few new texts from her old boss, too.</p><p>She pushed all of it from her mind. Sorrow and Hope could handle any emergencies, the film guys could deal with themselves, and as for her old CEO, she\u2019d turned him down twice now, and it was time he got the hint.</p><p>She realized she was still standing stiffly in the same spot and wandered in, consciously trying to relax. Eddie\u2019s place. How strange to be standing there, able to take it all in, unwatched. The last time she\u2019d been over, a rash had been erupting all over her legs, and what she\u2019d seen of the cabin hadn\u2019t extended much past what she could spy from where she\u2019d sat on the edge of his tub.</p><p>He\u2019d built the place himself, and it was surprisingly charming. Small and tidy, holding the fresh smell of the logs it\u2019d been built with. It had a masculine feel, decorated with rich colors, like the chocolate of the leather couch, a hunter-green throw blanket, and a soft maroon area rug atop the dark, timber plank floor.</p><p>The cabin itself was open and airy. A bar in a roughly hewn style was the only thing separating the modest living area from the kitchen. The appliances were modern, the stainless streamlined and spotless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wandered over, stealing a quick look in one of the cabinets. Peeking in a couple of drawers. She\u2019d expected some bachelor scenario like in the movies, with pizza boxes and a jar of old mayo in the refrigerator. Instead, opening it, she found a small assortment of condiments, half a bag of prewashed lettuce, a six-pack of Corona with two missing, a few oranges, half a lime, some deli meats, a pack of ground beef.</p><p>Her stomach rumbled, and with a startled giggle, she slapped a hand to her belly. \u201cWhoa.\u201d She\u2019d shut herself down for so long, but now all her senses seemed to be coming to life, waking after their long slumber.</p><p>Spotting the new bag of hamburger buns on the counter, she had a guess what he\u2019d been planning to make. She\u2019d caught him on his lunch hour\u2014had he eaten? It was late\u2014he was probably starving.</p> <p>She decided to surprise him, maybe even impress him, and throw a little something together for lunch. How hard could it be? Cook for the man\u2014it was the advice she\u2019d once given Sorrow, and look how that had turned out.</p><p>Besides, slowing the afternoon\u2019s momentum a bit could be just the thing. The more she saw of Eddie, the more she liked. The bigger this thing felt. It made her nervous.</p><p>She thought of his kiss. Considering how his touch had a way of lighting her like a Christmas tree, a little food was probably advisable. She had a feeling once they started kissing again, there\u2019d be no stopping for some time.</p><p>The shower was going, but she went to the door, hesitated there for a second. It felt so intimate to make herself at home while he was on the other side of that door, naked. She vowed that next time she would offer to get in the shower with him. She smiled to herself\u2014she was taking to this Eddie thing rather more quickly than she\u2019d thought she would.</p><p>Not giving herself a moment to chicken out, she simply cracked the door and called in, \u201cYou eaten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d The smell of men\u2019s soap, like pine trees, wafted out with his voice.</p><p>It gave her a shiver. \u201cMe neither. I\u2019ve got some ideas, though.\u201d</p><p>He laughed that laugh\u2014she\u2019d known he would. She\u2019d even anticipated his next line, \u201cI look forward to that.\u201d</p><p>As a no-carb girl, she knew her way around a frying pan and ground beef. She quickly formed some patties and got them going on the stove.</p><p>She\u2019d known Eddie her whole life, and stepping into his world like this felt oddly like settling into a cozy chair. It was new, but somehow familiar, too. Almost like coming home.</p><p>She wandered back into the living room as she waited, making herself at home in a way that felt satisfying. She studied the pictures on the wall and thought it interesting that there were no personal pictures to be found, especially considering his close-knit family.</p> <p>Instead, there was a series of large, black-and-white landscape photos. An alpine lake with the sharp glare of sunlight on the water. Dark, massive granite peaks that seemed all the more majestic for the absence of color. An extreme close-up of pine needles coated with clouds of fresh snow.</p><p>\u201cYou like those?\u201d Eddie had come in, and he stood there toweling his hair.</p><p>It took her a moment to find her tongue, he was so sexy, standing there in his bare feet, his dark hair spiking every which way. \u201cI do,\u201d she said. She liked every single thing about this cabin, including its inhabitant.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s my favorite.\u201d He came up beside her, peering at a shot of a tiny winter bird. A line of fragile bird tracks trailed behind it in the powdery snow. \u201cI took it a few years back, in the woods by the falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took these?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her disbelief. \u201cYup. Mom got me a Neanderthal camera when my View-Master broke.\u201d</p><p>She nudged him with her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her back. \u201cYou either, Laura.\u201d He\u2019d sounded almost half-serious. It showed him in a different light.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised. She supposed she had been ruthless over the years, probably judging him all the more fiercely for the fact that she\u2019d always found him so damned attractive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson, Eddie Jessup.\u201d She crossed her heart. \u201cAs of this moment, I will never again make any assumptions about you.\u201d</p><p>He got a funny expression on his face and looked toward the kitchen. \u201cHang on. What\u2019s that smell?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten the burgers. \u201cWhoops.\u201d She made a sorry face. \u201cI was going to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy filling my cabin with the smell of burned meat?\u201d</p><p>She followed him to the stove, staring in horror at the obliterated patties.</p><p>Eddie turned off the burner and tilted the pan, studying the mess. \u201cDid you put anything in these, or on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave him an apologetic smile. \u201cAll I know are Atkins recipes. I\u2019m sorry. I ruined it.\u201d</p><p>He got a funny look on his face. \u201cNot at all, actually. Grab a bottle of red,\u201d he said, nodding to a small countertop wine rack. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, he\u2019d added a can of Ragu, some chopped tomatoes, and a few additional spices, and they\u2019d settled at a weathered picnic table behind his house, eating pasta with Bolognese sauce.</p><p>\u201cRefined flour,\u201d she muttered as she twirled spaghetti onto her fork. It ended up being a giant bite. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She shoveled it in. If she was going to be hooking up with Eddie Jessup, she might as well enjoy some carbs, too.</p><p>When the flavors hit her tongue, her eyes widened. She put a hand over her mouth and said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d Swallowing, she repeated, \u201cOh my God.\u201d She shut her eyes, washing it down with a sip of wine. \u201cI never eat pasta, and this is so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re learning all kinds of things. Pasta\u2019s not half-bad. Maybe Jessups aren\u2019t half-bad, either...\u201d He gave her a teasing smile. The late-afternoon sun made his skin glow, and a light breeze tousled his hair.</p><p>Not half-bad at all.</p><p>Sudden butterflies made her stomach flutter. She had to look away, shoving another bite into her mouth, and took in the view instead. A small meadow spread out before them, peppered with ragged grasses and wildflowers and ringed with pine trees. Mountain peaks loomed in the far distance.</p><p>He breathed in deeply, squinting against the low sun. \u201cPretty, huh? It\u2019s why I bought the place.\u201d He pointed to the distance. \u201cI own all the way to that fence there.\u201d</p><p>She shielded her eyes and realized that sure enough, beyond the meadow, there was a basic wire-and-post fence. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get a dog. Thought a fence would come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotten a dog?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI guess I always hoped I\u2019d meet someone, and it\u2019d be something we could do together. You know, go to the shelter, pick out a nice mutt.\u201d He turned his attention to his plate and took a giant bite of pasta, looking a little embarrassed. It was a sight she didn\u2019t see often.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet those kids would like it. If you brought a dog on your camping trips, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He chuffed out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll just bet they would. Not a lot of dogs in Reno\u2019s low-income housing developments. Not nice ones, at any rate.\u201d He got a distant look and a faint smile, like he was remembering something. \u201cOn my very first trip, one of the little guys chased what he thought was a lost dog into the brush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Using a heel of bread, he swabbed up the last of the sauce on his plate. He popped the bread into his mouth and shook his head as he chewed and swallowed. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know what it was. And of course I had to chase after the kid\u2014I mean, I guess it\u2019s possible it could\u2019ve been someone\u2019s stray dog, but I panicked, thinking of all the other stuff it might be. Rabid raccoon. Injured fox. Wildcat. Hell, it could\u2019ve been a bear cub.\u201d</p><p>She raked up more spaghetti, realizing she\u2019d been holding her fork in midair, listening raptly, wondering where this story was going. \u201cSo you chased after some boy, knowing there might\u2019ve been an angry bear waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her like she was crazy. \u201cOf course.\u201d He wiped his hands on his napkin and tossed it on the table. \u201cWhen we\u2019re out there, those kids are in my care. But there were no angry mama bears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d She waited a beat. \u201cWell...what was it?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, looking like he was debating telling her. \u201cSkunk,\u201d he said finally. He laughed then. \u201cI dove into that brush after the kid, and damned if that skunk didn\u2019t spray me right in the face. I stank for a week. Whoever said tomatoes remove the smell was never tagged in the face at point-blank range. Tomato sauce, tomato juice\u2014I bathed in the stuff. All it did was make me smell like an Italian skunk.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing, dabbing tears from her eyes, and it felt so good. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d belly-laughed.</p><p>He made a face like he was put out of joint, but she saw the humor in his eyes.</p><p>She patted his hand, playfully consoling him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t let Pep\u00e9 Le Pew win, did you? You\u2019re still going out and braving those woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean, braving those kids? But yeah, damn right I\u2019m still going. Only now I do all my wildlife instruction in the van on the way over.\u201d He tilted his plate, swabbed clean of tomato sauce, muttering, \u201cTook me months before I could look at a tomato without gagging...\u201d</p><p>She laughed and mashed the last bits of meaty sauce in the tines of her fork. \u201cI for one am glad you and tomatoes have made peace. This was really good, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurned patties are nothing. But turning them into this? That\u2019s MacGyver caliber.\u201d She sipped her wine, thinking how for every question Eddie answered, she found five more popping up in its place. \u201cDo you cook a lot?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged it off. \u201cI\u2019m all right. I can grill a steak. Feed myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than I do,\u201d she muttered. It occurred to her that he\u2019d have to cook for a lot more than just two on his trips. \u201cWhat do you feed the kids when you camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make easy stuff. I\u2019ve got a Sterno, and food keeps pretty well in ice chests. It\u2019s not so hard. My monkey bread is always a hit.\u201d</p><p>The light in his eyes as he\u2019d said it made her believe he truly got something from the trips.</p> <p>\u201cMonkey bread.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t had that since I was little and Dad took us to Big Basin to see the redwoods. Look at you...I think you enjoy the camping. It\u2019s not just for the kids, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s for me. Watching them in the woods for the first time, it kills me. These kids have had it hard. Some of them have been busted for big-deal stuff, too\u2014especially the older ones. Concealed weapons charges. Drug stuff. But then they get out there\u201d\u2014he waved to the mountains along the horizon\u2014\u201cand they\u2019re blown away that you can live off the land. That a man can actually walk into the woods with no cell phone and no gun, not even a cigarette lighter, just walk in there and then walk back out, a week later if he wanted, alive and well.\u201d</p><p>He swirled the wine in his glass, shrugging like it was no big deal. \u201cIt\u2019s all about self-sufficiency. Personal responsibility. Keeping calm and informed. The man stuff that every boy needs to learn. That\u2019s what I try to teach them at least. It\u2019s what Jack taught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you got into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what got me thinking about it, yeah. When I was sixteen, seventeen, I was shaping up to be a bad seed. I\u2019m sure you remember.\u201d</p> <p>She considered his teenage antics. \u201cWild child, maybe. But egging the teacher\u2019s car seems far from bad seed material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, it doesn\u2019t make for a very good man, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d She didn\u2019t know his dad well, but Marlene was such a lovely woman. \u201cSurely they rode you about stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the last one out of the house, and by the time I was a junior, senior, they were pretty involved in their own worlds. I\u2019m sure Dad was probably having his affair by then, which on some level I\u2019m sure my mom knew about. And it\u2019s not like I got arrested or anything. I got decent grades, didn\u2019t do drugs. Still, I thought I was a real son of a bitch. But then my brother showed me what a man really is, and that it\u2019s not some bad-ass with a fast car and a bottle of Southern Comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really were as naughty as all the girls said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all the right ways, darlin\u2019,\u201d he told her with a wink. His grin had lightened the mood, but after a moment\u2019s silence, he turned serious again. \u201cI guess the bottom line is, it\u2019s important to me these kids learn what I did the hard way. That feeling good about themselves comes from inside. Not from a bottle or a fistfight. That strength, courage, self-worth...they\u2019ve got to find it inside.\u201d</p> <p>His words hit her hard. Was she any wiser than these kids? Her self-worth had always been so wrapped up in the trappings of her success. In the car, the fancy gym membership, the clothes. Of course, that stuff didn\u2019t fulfill her. It was just stuff.</p><p>\u201cI want to meet them,\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>He looked stunned by that. \u201cThe kids?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shy smile. \u201cHopefully not the skunks.\u201d</p><p>The sun had dipped below the mountains. She wore only her flimsy blue sundress, and her bare arms prickled into goose bumps. She hunched into herself with a little shiver.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u2014he scooted closer, chafing warmth into her arms\u2014\u201clet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>She looked off to the meadow. A cool breeze had picked up, but it\u2019d set the wildflowers dancing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always my hot tub,\u201d he said playfully, his laugh sexy and teasing. But then he stood, giving her shoulder a gentle squeeze. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ll run grab you a fleece.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually\u201d\u2014she snagged his hand, stopping him\u2014\u201cI kinda like the sound of that hot tub.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>Eddie looked at her like he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI\u2019ve got a fleece I can lend you,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbut there\u2019s no bathing suit. At least not one that\u2019d fit.\u201d The line was funny, but he\u2019d knit his brows into a serious expression, watching her, waiting to hear her reply.</p><p>She stood. Made herself hold his gaze. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She knew what she wanted. To have needs didn\u2019t make a woman weak, she knew that now. She could be vulnerable with a man like Eddie and still be safe. Losing control was sometimes a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this hot tub?\u201d she asked, while inside she complimented herself on how brave she sounded.</p><p>And there was no reason to be afraid anyhow. She thought of all the reasons why it\u2019d be okay. The beige bra and panties she\u2019d worn under her sundress were probably more sensible than her actual bikini. She didn\u2019t need to manage every situation. Not everything needed to be perfect and planned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s around the side,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan we use it?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a smile, looking eager and wary both. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding?\u201d</p><p>She pretended outrage. \u201cCan we get in your hot tub or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, you don\u2019t have to ask me twice.\u201d He snatched her hand and led her around to the side of the house.</p><p>It was a whole other world there, with an outdoor shower, a hammock, and a shining red barbecue. \u201cRed truck, red barbecue...you like the color red, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He came up close and traced her shoulder, tugging aside the cap sleeve to reveal her thin bra strap. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m liking pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat color\u2019s called nude,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI like that even more.\u201d</p><p>She began to debate the whole hot-tub thing in favor of simply tearing Eddie\u2019s clothes off then and there. But then he stepped away to deal with the tub, pulling off the cover, releasing a cloud of steam. When he leaned over the side to turn on the bubbles, she let her eyes linger\u2014that man sure did have the best backside she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He stood and caught the look on her face, and instead of giving her one of his trademark grins, his expression grew dark. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab towels,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse.</p><p>When he returned, he strode toward her with such intent in his eyes. Suddenly shy, she merely hiked up her dress and sat on the edge. The sun had yet to set, but it\u2019d dipped below the mountains, casting the scene in a gray light. Her shoulders were chilled, but the water was hot, bubbling over her feet, and her body gave a shiver of relief as she began to warm.</p><p>He studied her, sitting there with her dress tucked tightly around her thighs. \u201cWe can still turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She knew he meant more than the hot tub. And she also knew, whatever happened that night, he wouldn\u2019t hold her decision against her. But turning back was the last thing she wanted. She wanted to be fearless. She could let herself lose control.</p><p>\u201cWe could just sit and talk,\u201d Eddie said, then added playfully, \u201cI could be a gentleman and let you keep that dress on after all.\u201d He sat next to her on the edge, putting his back to the water and resting his feet on the tub steps. \u201cSeriously, Laura, the stars will be out soon. I could bring you a blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so surprised that I\u2019d want to get in?\u201d Just how cautious did people think she was?</p><p>\u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t take you for the skinny-dipping type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have my bra and panties on,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to see about that.\u201d He sneaked a finger under her sleeve, hunting for her bra strap. \u201cWhere\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie!\u201d She flicked water at him but was secretly pleased.</p><p>He stood, a challenge in his eyes. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re not getting in, I am.\u201d</p><p>She watched avidly as he pulled off his shirt, but when he began to unzip his jeans, she said, \u201cHey, don\u2019t you have a suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t.\u201d His hands froze on his zipper. \u201cWhy, you complaining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at that, but still, he kept on his boxers, and she suspected it was to make her more comfortable. He hopped into the tub, and water whooshed over the sides, drenching the hem of her dress. \u201cCome on in\u201d\u2014he playfully patted the surface, splashing her some more\u2014\u201cthe water\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. It was tempting. He was tempting. Adorably so.</p><p>He\u2019d always been such an easy charmer, and it was a delight to finally embrace his flirtations. To let herself bask in them.</p><p>But still...to undress in front of him? Just like that, outside, in the daylight? She wondered if maybe she should wait for the sun to dip lower. She\u2019d always been a little self-conscious when it came to her body\u2014she knew in her head that it was a good one, but knowing and feeling were two different things.</p><p>His voice pulled her from her thoughts. \u201cStill worried about what other people think, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said defensively. Though really, he\u2019d hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cI promise, there\u2019s nobody but you and me in these woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m different now. I don\u2019t care what people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He grew quiet, studying her, and she read affectionate understanding on his face. \u201cLook, let\u2019s go inside, Laura. All I want is to be with you.\u201d He quickly added, \u201cI don\u2019t mean with you with you, though I\u2019d love that, too...God, how I\u2019d love that...\u201d He gave her a flustered smile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, we can just hang out and watch a movie. Do the crossword. Whatever makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look. \u201cYou do the crossword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He made himself look innocent. \u201cBut you strike me as someone who appreciates men who do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him. It was finally hitting her that, yes, Eddie Jessup was the sort of guy who really would choose the crossword over a naked hot tub party, if he thought that was what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you just fine, Eddie, with or without the stupid crossword. And I am getting in this hot tub.\u201d</p><p>She stood, and in one smooth movement, pulled the dress over her head. She squealed as the cold air hit her bare skin and she immediately plopped into the tub. She sank down to her shoulders, her grand moment of bravery spent. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very graceful, was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe judges give you a nine-point-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t a ten.\u201d He sidled close, but not too close. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Laura. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not so sure you do get it.\u201d He gently turned her face to his, studying her intently. \u201cI blame that bastard fianc\u00e9 of yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEx-fianc\u00e9.\u201d She looked away, avoiding that intense gaze, and instead placed her hand on the surface of the water, focusing on the feel of bubbles between her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. It wasn\u2019t like I was so in love with him. Patrick didn\u2019t break my heart. He just showed me...how I need to be more careful. Keep myself safe. Protect myself, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him and kill him.\u201d</p><p>She shot her head up with a laugh. \u201cOkay. But you\u2019ve got to let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d He leaned back, spreading his arm behind her, along the back of the tub. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a duo. Only now, I\u2019ll be the one to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She felt her smile fade. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, come here.\u201d He pulled her onto his lap, settling her sideways, and the position exposed more of her body to the cold evening air. He smoothed her wet hair from her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let yourself be vulnerable with somebody, sometime. Vulnerable isn\u2019t weak. Sometimes vulnerable is good. Like...vulnerable can get you this.\u201d He kissed her neck, and the feel of his hot mouth on her cooling skin sent a delicious shiver rippling across her body. She became exquisitely aware of her breasts tightening under the thin, wet fabric of her bra.</p> <p>\u201cOr this,\u201d he said, his voice gone husky. He stroked down her arm, until his hand disappeared below the bubbles. His fingers splayed over the side of her hip, gripping her, tugging her panties against her flesh just enough to set her body on fire.</p><p>She had to open her mouth to inhale. \u201cAll right,\u201d she managed. \u201cYou\u2019re convincing me.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled her earlobe. \u201cOnly partly convinced?\u201d His breath tickled her skin, and her pulse became a drumbeat. \u201cWhat else do I need to do?\u201d One hand smoothed down her thigh, finding her knee, and the other swept down her back, lower then lower still, until the very tips of his fingers dared plunge under the top of her panties.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d begun to speak, but her word became a moan. Nodding, she said, \u201cYou win. Vulnerable is good. I see that now.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his other hand back up her thigh, higher and closer, until his thumb was sweeping just below the V of her thighs.</p><p>Her body was throbbing now, begging for more, and instinctively she circled her hips in his lap. \u201cMmm. I could maybe get used to vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d He nipped at her shoulder, kissing along her collarbone, waiting for her to make the first move.</p><p>She tucked her knee, and in a single motion she swung her leg between them, spinning in his lap to face him.</p> <p>He barked out a pleased laugh. \u201cHot damn, Laura.\u201d</p><p>She felt like she must\u2019ve been beaming, she felt so free, so gratified, so joyous. \u201cI used to be a cheerleader, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget? You were the Holy Grail of my teen years.\u201d He grasped both her hips and ground her closer. His arousal was undeniable, and it was a spark, inflaming her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not kids anymore,\u201d she said softly as she twined her hands behind his neck. She hitched her hips to nestle him in place and kissed him deeply.</p><p>When she pulled away, he looked drugged, dazed. \u201cYou are one sexy thing, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He parted his lips, leaning closer to taste her again, but she ducked away, instead kissing along his jaw, his neck. She\u2019d dreamed of seeing that bare chest, of touching him, and let herself explore every inch with palms and fingers and mouth.</p><p>It was perfect. Just then, in the dreamy twilight, this was perfect.</p><p>She roved back up and let herself sag into him, savoring the feel of his hands stroking along her back. \u201cThis is good, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than good,\u201d he said, in a voice gone fierce. He guided her mouth back to his, taking another kiss. It was passion and urgency, but mastery, too, his hands knowing just where to go, his kiss just right. Good Lord, but the man knew his stuff.</p><p>Her desire hitched higher, until she felt fevered with it. She stretched into him, until the chafe of her bra against her sensitive skin became an exquisite agony.</p><p>She broke the kiss, catching her breath. She wanted him. Needed him skin-to-skin. Desired him with an intensity that made the heat of the water nearly unbearable. \u201cToo hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is hot,\u201d he growled, taking her mouth again.</p><p>After a minute, she broke away again. \u201cNo, the water.\u201d</p><p>Holding her in his lap, he swept them to a bench that sat higher in the tub, exposing more of her upper body to the cold air. It was instant relief. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>With a moan of pleasure, she kissed him hard in answer. She wrapped her arms more tightly around his neck and tilted her hips, craving him closer, deeper.</p><p>He reached around and unclasped her bra. Pulling away, his eyes met hers. He still held her straps in place, as if asking permission to let the scrap of fabric fall from her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He brought his hands down, drawing the bra slowly along her skin. Sensations overwhelmed her\u2014the shiver of cold air on naked skin, coarse lace dragging over her body\u2014it drove her desire to the edge. But it was Eddie\u2019s eyes on her, hooded, devouring her with a look of such wanting, that gaze was what pushed her over the edge. She gripped his shoulders, needing him to take her, to quench this fire.</p><p>Her breasts pebbled in the cool air. She arched her back, wanting him to taste her, take her, something. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he slowly, reverently, brought his hand up, cupping her. \u201cYou\u2019re like an angel.\u201d She leaned into him, using her body to beg for more, and he answered with a firmer touch, squeezing her, palming her. \u201cMagnificent,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his head and pulled his mouth to hers for a kiss. But still, it wasn\u2019t enough. She pulled away, unable to stand it any longer. \u201cNow, Eddie. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to steal a taste of her breast, and she pleaded, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he parted from her. \u201cWait...\u201d Keeping her legs wrapped around his waist, he held her as he half stood, reaching for the towel, and then when he settled them back in the water, he flashed a condom pinched between his fingers.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cSmooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man with a plan,\u201d he said, grinning back.</p><p>He stretched, tossing the towel well away from the water, and the move showcased his torso and flexing muscles. It was a beautiful sight.</p><p>She swept her palm lightly along his chest, teasing him to goose bumps. \u201cYou need to go shirtless more often.\u201d</p><p>He sucked a breath in through his teeth. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, he cupped her face for a quick kiss, but it soon grew heated, deeper. The next time they parted, when they settled back again, the rest of their clothes had disappeared.</p><p>She took Eddie inside her, and he filled her, hot and perfect. The bad boy and the good man, all at once, in a single package. It was almost too much.</p><p>Afterward, he held her close, and she felt raw, overflowing with sensation, with emotion. With a sense of completion that frightened her.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said, his voice so quiet. So serious.</p><p>She held her breath. Darkness had fallen, and with it, silence had descended like a blanket, shrouding the woods from all sound but for settling leaves and the occasional distant cries of coyotes. A vast canopy of stars spread overhead.</p><p>She was overwhelmed by the night. Overwhelmed by him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer his extraordinary declaration. She only clung tighter, squeezing him closer.</p><p>He seemed to understand, though, and began to caress her in long strokes, from her head, along her hair, and down her back. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cGlad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She felt it in her heart. She wanted to be there, to be with him. She\u2019d meant the words, but she was too afraid to consider beyond that.</p><p>It\u2019d been a risk to come home. A risk to stay. And yet it was Eddie who felt like the greatest risk of all.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>Rob stowed his blue-and-yellow Up Country Hardware apron in the back and headed out\u2014finally. He must\u2019ve checked his damned watch five hundred times, but the seconds had ticked by like he was trapped in some screwed-up science fiction movie.</p><p>He had another hunch, but this time it was a good one.</p><p>When he first checked his watch that morning, it\u2019d been eight o\u2019clock on the nose. No big deal. But then he\u2019d checked again, and damned if the time didn\u2019t read nine o\u2019clock, exactly. He\u2019d just about pissed himself. Double zeroes, then double zeroes again, right in a row, flashing like a red beacon.</p><p>Omens didn\u2019t get any more solid.</p><p>Screw the card tables, he was done with them. He wasn\u2019t going to mess around\u2014he\u2019d head straight to the Reno strip. It was time for roulette.</p><p>\u201cRob,\u201d Tom called from the back of the store. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me calling?\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Dammit, but he\u2019d already clocked out and gotten halfway out the door. Automatically, he checked his watch, half hoping he\u2019d hit one o\u2019clock. But it was already seven past. \u201cI thought I was off at one.\u201d He tried to seem calm, but really he just wanted to hop into his car and floor it. His hand was in his pocket, jiggling that buffalo nickel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, your shift\u2019s done,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got a phone call.\u201d</p><p>Screw Reno. Really, he just needed to cross the state line. The Indian Rock Casino had a sweet setup with a bunch of five-dollar roulette tables. Or maybe he\u2019d head right to their ten-dollar table, if he was feeling it. It had to feel right, and he made it a rule to stay away from empty tables.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d His boss hitched a thumb in the direction of the back office. \u201cHelen\u2019s on the line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelen? She\u2019s at work.\u201d Indian Rock it was.

He hated interrupting his mojo like this. He told himself it didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d seen the double zeroes.</p> <p>He strode back to the office and grabbed the phone. \u201cHey, Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called your cell,\u201d she said in greeting.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t hear it.\u201d Really, he hadn\u2019t answered it. Whenever she called, it was usually just for stuff like milk or sugar, anyway. He was going to check her message later. Groceries could wait.

Why can\u2019t you get her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am working a double shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sick or something?\u201d He calculated. He could get her, get back in the car, and be at Indian Rock by two-forty-five. But\u2014damn damn damn\u2014he\u2019d need to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab her, drop her at home for you. I should run\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you hang up on me. I need you to stay with her, not just drop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s around.\u201d Their oldest was in high school. By the time he was in high school, he was working fifteen hours a week at the Gas-n-Go. \u201cHe\u2019s a capable kid. Can\u2019t he watch her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Luke can\u2019t watch her. He\u2019s down at the Kidd house on Tuesdays, running errands, remember?\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t remember, but he only said, \u201cYeah, okay. Well, can\u2019t she just sit at home in front of the TV? I\u2019ll grab some ginger ales for her. Should be fine like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you need to be running off to that you can\u2019t take care of our sick child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got errands, Helen. And if she\u2019s so sick, won\u2019t she want you? I don\u2019t know what to do with sick kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t leave here. As it is, every time I turn around, Laura\u2019s eyes are burning a hole in the back of my head. I won\u2019t get out of here till nine.\u201d</p><p>Nine-zero-zero. It mocked him.</p><p>He\u2019d had his omens. He had to seize them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her, anyway?\u201d Maybe a car ride might be soothing. Put her to sleep like when she was a baby.</p><p>\u201cCroup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad can it be? You dropped her at camp in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it killed me to do it,\u201d she said slowly, her resentment crackling over the phone line. \u201cBut croup\u2019s like that. Kids seem fine, until they can\u2019t breathe. So just go get her already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do if she has trouble?\u201d He checked his watch. Helen wouldn\u2019t resent him when he brought home enough to cover next month\u2019s mortgage...double zero paid thirty-five to one.</p><p>\u201cSit her in the bathroom and run the shower. Moist heat is good. Helps her breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you can\u2019t do it?\u201d He thought he\u2019d try one last time.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to earn money in this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and I don\u2019t earn any money?\u201d He\u2019d show her just how great his earning potential was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going there now, Rob.\u201d The wind had left her sails, and suddenly his wife just sounded tired.</p><p>There was one thing a gambler was good at, and it was a poker face. \u201cSure thing,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll go get her.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like he was lying\u2014he was doing this for her.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Helen sounded so relieved that, for a moment, he believed himself the hero.</p><p>He wanted to be the hero. \u201cIf I said I got it, I got it, babe.\u201d</p><p>Not thirty minutes later, he was with Ellie in her room. She flopped dramatically onto her pink rug. \u201cCan\u2019t I just watch TV?\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d predicted, she didn\u2019t look so bad. She didn\u2019t even have a fever, just a voice that made her sound like a seal.</p><p>\u201cCome on, angel girl.\u201d He leaned down and scruffed her hair. \u201cA little field trip will fix you right up. The best thing for that throat is ice cream, and the best ice cream is in Indian Rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy throat doesn\u2019t hurt. I just want to watch TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have TVs there. A whole wall of them.\u201d He pictured the screens with keno and horse races flashing by. \u201cAnd they have a buffet, with soft serve and sprinkles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear\u2019s place has yummy ice cream,\u201d she argued. But she\u2019d sat up, and that was progress.</p><p>He studied her stuffed animal shelf. Why were there so many, and who\u2019d paid for all this crap, anyway? But he wasn\u2019t about to mess with the fragile mood of a second-grader, so instead he asked, \u201cWhich one of these is your favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMister Bear.\u201d</p><p>There must\u2019ve been two dozen bears on that damned shelf. \u201cWhich one is Mister Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brown one.\u201d</p><p>That narrowed it to one dozen. He grabbed the biggest one, and she hopped to her feet. \u201cThat\u2019s Missus Bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t Mister Bear be bigger than Missus Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shouldered by him and pointed up. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>He plucked down the bear and then froze, trying not to grin. \u201cWait. Did you hear that?\u201d He gaped at the toy. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d Holding the bear to his ear, he said, \u201cMm-hm. Yeah. Oh, sure, they\u2019ve got plenty. In vanilla and chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there strawberry?\u201d Ellie asked, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cOh sure, they\u2019ve got all the flavors.\u201d He handed her the stuffie. \u201cMister Bear says he wants to take a trip for ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a smile dawned on her face. She opened her arms to the bear, but instead Rob just scooped her up. He wasn\u2019t such a bad dad. Not such a bad one at all.</p><p>He settled her by the pool, with a big dish of strawberry ice cream with gummy bears on top\u2014a special request from Mister Bear himself. He was in a grand mood. It\u2019d been three-zero-zero on the dot when he\u2019d pulled in. Granted, he\u2019d been watching the clock like a hawk, but an omen was an omen.</p><p>Helen had said Ellie needed warm, wet air, and it didn\u2019t get much warmer than out by the pool. The air was dry, sure, but surely the pool water added some humidity to the place. It was a pretty clever solution, actually.</p><p>\u201cDaddy will be right back, angel girl.\u201d Just an hour was all he\u2019d need. Maybe not even that long. Maybe even twenty minutes. He leaned down to lay a kiss on her head. \u201cMister Bear here is in charge till I get back.\u201d</p><p>He left his daughter, smiling poolside. His double zeroes were waiting.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Eddie traced his finger down Laura\u2019s naked back. Every inch of her was perfection, and she was in his bed, lying on her stomach, her blond hair a wild tangle. God, she was gorgeous\u2014and what a sight when she finally let loose and let go.</p><p>She squirmed from his touch. \u201cYou\u2019re tickling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do more than that.\u201d He swept aside her hair to lay kisses along her shoulders but felt the tension there at once. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the knots?\u201d Leaning on his elbow, he began to rub her back. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re wound so tight you\u2019re gonna snap.\u201d</p><p>She shifted to get a better look at him. \u201cThen maybe you should unwind me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were all crackle and fire, and in them he saw the passion he\u2019d always admired, only now she wasn\u2019t fighting him. Now she was loving him.</p><p>It would\u2019ve felled him, if he hadn\u2019t already been lying down.</p><p>\u201cUnwind you, or wind you up? Which is it?\u201d He eased onto her back, wanting her again. He doubted he\u2019d ever stop wanting her. Just touching her like that, he\u2019d begun to stiffen already. He smoothed his hands along her arms, spreading them over her head. Nuzzling at her neck, he said, \u201cShall we go for three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mountain air, darlin\u2019. And you.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, wriggling her hips, teasing him. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you,\u201d he said, suddenly serious. He rolled to the other side of her, turning her to face him. Strands of her hair had tangled in her lashes, and he carefully brushed them aside. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl tries.\u201d She gave him a light smile, clearly not getting his exact meaning.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u2014he chucked her chin\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t just mean your looks. Which, by the way, are stellar. It\u2019s who you are. You amaze me.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the biggest wordsmith, so he thought carefully about how to express it. It amazed him how alive he felt with her. Amazing how she\u2019d gotten under his skin. She\u2019d thought she was afraid to be vulnerable, but he\u2019d never felt so exposed before, and it scared him. But it felt great, too. Intense. He was ready for it. For her. Ready to let it all hang out.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI won\u2019t make you say or feel anything you\u2019re not ready to say or feel, but hear this. I think you are the greatest goddamn woman I have ever met. You\u2019re so smart. So sharp. Look at you\u2014you plucked yourself up by your bootstraps and got out of here. Paid your way through school. Then when your family needed you, you came back again. You\u2019re tough when you have to be, but you know what you want. You protect your own\u2014your town, your family. You love fiercely, Laura. I\u2019ve seen it. That\u2019s what\u2019s amazing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, a little abashed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone noticed that stuff.\u201d</p><p>They lay belly-to-belly on the bed, and when she looked up at him, he saw this strong woman\u2019s eyes cloud with emotion. For once, she was letting herself be vulnerable, and it was for him. A tidal wave of affection swept him. Swamped him.</p><p>He cupped her head, pulling her close to kiss her forehead. \u201cI noticed. I noticed you from the get-go\u2014all the way back on that first day in kindergarten.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, wiping the corner of her eye. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Maybe it took me till first grade. But you get my gist.\u201d He rained kisses along her face. \u201cPlus you\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re so beautiful, like an angel. Like a painting.\u201d He had too much to say...he didn\u2019t know what to express first.</p><p>She giggled and poked him in the ribs. \u201cLike a painting of an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m new at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie Jessup, new at women? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, yeah, I know how to pay a compliment. I can appreciate a pretty face. But I\u2019ve never been floored by one, and Laura, you floor me.\u201d</p><p>She grew serious. \u201cYou floor me, too, Eddie. I...You\u2019ve blown me away. I had no idea, you, this...\u201d</p><p>She ran out of words, but it was okay. It was enough. He was a patient man.</p><p>The ringing phone startled them.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you let it go?\u201d she asked, but the look they shared said they knew he couldn\u2019t. Late-night phone calls were too unusual\u2014and too alarming\u2014to send to voice mail.</p> <p>He scampered naked to the living room, where he\u2019d dropped his cell on the table with his keys and wallet. He checked, and the Caller ID was a weird one. It couldn\u2019t be a telemarketer at ten P.M., could it? \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Jessup Brothers Construction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said warily, peering at the clock on the microwave. \u201cIt\u2019s way after hours, though.\u201d</p><p>He strolled back into the bedroom and gave Laura a look that said they were far from done.</p><p>\u201cApologies for the late hour, but I\u2019m calling from Indian Rock, from the urgent care clinic here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said it like a question, so he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d even though he wasn\u2019t entirely sure of the place. He\u2019d been to Indian Rock a few times through the years, but those late-night clinics all looked the same. Single story, lights on late, sign with a red cross out front.</p><p>Laura gave him a questioning look, mouthing, Who is it? and he could only shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure who to call,\u201d the woman said, and by the time she finished telling him her reasons, he\u2019d dashed outside, grabbed their clothes from beside the hot tub, and begun tugging on his jeans.</p> <p>\u201cSo who was it?\u201d The question burst from Laura the moment he clicked off. She was sitting up in bed, holding the sheet to her chest, where she\u2019d been avidly watching his every move.</p><p>\u201cSome clinic in Indian Rock. They\u2019ve got an anonymous girl there, unconscious.\u201d He pulled on a clean shirt. \u201cI\u2019m heading over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a little thing. They think she\u2019s from Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>She hopped out of bed, dressing quickly. \u201cWhy\u2019d they call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think I might know her. She\u2019s wearing a shirt with a Jessup Brothers logo. A soccer shirt,\u201d he recalled. They\u2019d donated money for the peewee jerseys last year.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a question that she go with him, and he loved the feel of that. Like they were a team. \u201cI told you we\u2019d be a duo,\u201d he said as they hit the road.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d She\u2019d put her hand on his thigh the moment they\u2019d gotten in his truck, and she gave it a squeeze. \u201cDo you think they called Billy, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume the sheriff was the first person they called. I didn\u2019t think to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see when we get there, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He filled her in on the remaining details. A girl, approximately six to eight years old, was sitting poolside at the Indian Rock Casino when she began to have trouble breathing. \u201cThe hotel called 911,\u201d he finished, \u201cand you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d vacation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from here,\u201d she said, and he had to agree. Indian Rock was kind of threadbare. And where were her parents?</p><p>Laura used the GPS on her phone to navigate, and with the late hour, they made good time. They ran inside, though the scene was far from urgent when they arrived.</p><p>A tired-looking nurse greeted them when they arrived. She\u2019d minimized her computer window, but not before Eddie spotted a solitaire game. She asked, \u201cYou\u2019re here for Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Laura blurted, \u201cEllie...Haskell?\u201d</p><p>At the nurse\u2019s nod, she didn\u2019t wait for an invitation, she simply stormed through the waiting room door into the back, and Eddie followed.</p><p>The clinic was a small one, with just a tiny kitchenette, two patient rooms, and a bathroom in the back. The doctor didn\u2019t even have his own office, just a niche in the hallway bearing an ancient-looking PC with a stack of files beside it.</p><p>They saw Ellie right away, and Laura went to her, sweeping the sleeping girl into her arms. \u201cWhat the heck is she doing here?\u201d she demanded in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cShe said her father brought her for ice cream,\u201d the nurse said, standing in the doorway to join them. She was shaking her head like it was something she saw everyday, and after spending time with his Reno kids, Eddie imagined it was possible she did.</p><p>Laura mouthed over the girl\u2019s head, I\u2019ll kill him.</p><p>Though he\u2019d never seen this side to Laura, he didn\u2019t doubt she would.</p><p>As Ellie snuggled into her, she asked, \u201cDid you call Helen? Her mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mother reported the girl missing to the sheriff\u2019s office not two minutes ago\u2014about the same time Ellie woke up enough to tell us who she is.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Helen, Ellie roused. \u201cIs Mommy here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take you home, honey.\u201d Laura rocked her. \u201cYour mom is waiting for you there. She\u2019ll be so happy to see you.\u201d She turned to the nurse. \u201cHelen is my employee at the lodge and tavern in Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take her?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019re close with the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to contact Mrs. Haskell,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got such a big head start on her, I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d mind.\u201d</p><p>The doctor appeared at the door. \u201cDenise will finish up the paperwork. If it\u2019s okay with the girl\u2019s mother, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to discharge her into your care.\u201d</p><p>Eddie put one hand on Laura\u2019s shoulder and the other on Ellie\u2019s forehead. \u201cIs she okay to leave? You don\u2019t need to do any tests or anything?\u201d The kid actually didn\u2019t look that bad. Her breathing was loud and her cheeks a bit flushed, but otherwise she seemed fine.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all set,\u201d the doctor told them. \u201cI imagine she\u2019ll sleep well the rest of the night. It\u2019s how croup is. The child appears normal, with just a minor cold, until the laryngeal muscles spasm. Does Ellie have asthma?\u201d He signed off on the paperwork, then handed the clipboard to the nurse. \u201cWhen she\u2019s better, she should be tested. To be on the safe side, we put her on the nebulizer\u2014some extra oxygen and a little Albuterol fixed her right up.\u201d</p><p>Laura gathered her more tightly in her arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you home, honey.\u201d</p><p>They settled back in the car, and by the time Laura phoned what seemed like pretty much everybody in Sierra Falls, Ellie was fast asleep in the backseat of the truck.</p><p>\u201cPoor Helen,\u201d Laura whispered. She turned in her seat, craning to check on the sleeping girl one more time. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Rob. I knew something was up with him, but bringing his kid so he can meet his mistress? I can\u2019t...it\u2019s just beyond the pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mistress?\u201d Eddie had other suspicions. \u201cI have a feeling his mistress just might be a stack of chips.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>Helen was beat. She was on for the lunch shift, but all she wanted to do was curl onto the couch with Ellie and zone out in front of as many stupid kid movies as her girl wanted to watch. She\u2019d gather her boys on the couch, too. They\u2019d have themselves what she called one of their desert-island days, when they spent the day in their jammies, eating whatever was in the cupboards.</p><p>She sighed. She might\u2019ve been beat, but it was nothing compared to the whupping last night\u2019s bill gave her. Late-night visits to urgent care clinics didn\u2019t run cheap, and even with insurance, emergency co-pays were nuts.</p><p>Her damned husband.</p><p>He\u2019d acted all penitent that morning and offered to watch Ellie\u2014had seemed desperate to watch her\u2014but she wasn\u2019t about to let her girl leave her side. Her baby currently sat in one of the tavern\u2019s corner booths, listlessly coloring the back of a children\u2019s menu.</p><p>Helen watched as Laura brought Ellie a ginger ale. She braced herself for some lecture on how she shouldn\u2019t be bringing a sick child to work, or maybe about how she\u2019d had to drive to Indian Rock in the middle of the night, interrupting whatever it was she\u2019d been doing with Eddie Jessup, and didn\u2019t Helen just wonder about that development.</p><p>She spoke before her boss had a chance to lay into her. \u201cSorry about Ellie. I can\u2019t leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>But Laura surprised her with a vehement and instant reply. \u201cOf course you can\u2019t.\u201d The significant nod that followed was a knife in the gut\u2014her sympathetic expression said it\u2019d be a given that she couldn\u2019t leave Rob at home with the girl. And then Laura shocked her even more when she said, \u201cThat\u2019s why you should go home. Hope\u2019s in the kitchen doing lunch prep. We\u2019re all set to cover your shift.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...oh...thank you.\u201d She fantasized about it for a second, then tied on her apron, knotting it with a sharp tug. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. Emergency clinics aren\u2019t exactly cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Believe me, I remember how it was with Dad.\u201d Laura frowned and reached out to her, putting a hand on her arm. \u201cYou let us know if there\u2019s anything we can do.\u201d</p><p>Helen made herself not flinch away from the unexpected contact. The woman\u2019s sympathy seemed genuine, and it wasn\u2019t what she would\u2019ve expected.</p> <p>She gave her a sad smile. \u201cYou could rob a bank for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid this won\u2019t be the first of your bills, either. Make sure they itemize it all for you. They\u2019ll get you for every Band-Aid and cotton swab. I\u2019d be happy to help you review it all as it comes in. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve gotten good at parsing medical invoices.\u201d</p><p>The offer floored her, and Helen was thanking her when Edith bustled in. \u201cWhere\u2019s our little patient?\u201d Mrs. Bailey went straight to the booth, wrapping an arm around the girl, tucking her close and stroking her hair. \u201cEllie Lynn Haskell, I am taking you up to the house right now. You\u2019re going to spend the day with me. I\u2019ll even let you sit in Bear\u2019s chair.\u201d</p><p>Laura smiled. \u201cJust like Goldilocks.\u201d</p><p>Ellie went wide-eyed. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p> <p>Edith looked to Helen. \u201cPlease say I can take her.\u201d</p><p>She felt something unclench in her chest. \u201cReally? You sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019ll be nice to have a little one underfoot again.\u201d Edith plucked Ellie\u2019s glass from the table and bustled behind the bar. \u201cHow about a refill? Do you want to try Sprite? That was always my girls\u2019 favorite.\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed. \u201cMom\u2019s a big believer in the clear fluids. Hopefully you won\u2019t mind your daughter drinking a gallon of soda today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I appreciate it,\u201d she said, meaning every word. \u201cI wanted to thank you again for driving her home last night. And also...\u201d She gave Laura a probing look. \u201cThank Eddie for me.\u201d</p><p>The girl blushed, and it was a sight Helen never thought she\u2019d see. \u201cThe cat\u2019s out of the bag, huh?\u201d</p> <p>So, her and Eddie...would wonders never cease? But the Bailey girl seemed to live a charmed life, so in some ways it was no surprise. She told her genuinely, \u201cHe\u2019s a good one, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that.\u201d She got a faraway look on her face. \u201cHe really dealt last night, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give for a man who dealt. A man who could be a source of comfort and strength instead of trouble. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>Laura opened her mouth to speak, but she just stood there for a moment, at a loss for words. Their eyes met for a strange, prolonged moment. So, they really were a couple now, though it appeared maybe Laura was still getting used to the idea. Helen had to wonder if she truly understood what a good man she\u2019d found.</p><p>The bell jingled as a different Jessup walked in.</p><p>Laura brightened, appearing a bit relieved that their moment of bonding was over. \u201cHey, Scott.\u201d He was in his ranger uniform, so he was clearly on duty. \u201cGrabbing an early lunch?\u201d</p><p>He went straight to Ellie. \u201cNah, just came to check on this girl here.\u201d He fished in his pocket and brought out a pack of cards. \u201cI brought a little get-well present.\u201d</p><p>Helen felt herself choke up. It stunned her how the town was rallying around her. For years, she\u2019d kept herself at arm\u2019s length, assuming everyone was so judgmental, but that wasn\u2019t it at all. Everyone cared; they\u2019d just been looking for a reason to cross the divide.</p> <p>Touched, she turned her back, swallowing hard, busying herself with refilling ketchup bottles. \u201cWhatcha got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pack of Junior Ranger cards.\u201d He settled next to Ellie in the booth.</p><p>Edith joined them. Using her dramatic mother voice, she said, \u201cOh, look, Ellie. How nice is that?\u201d The woman was going to make a wonderful grandmother someday.</p><p>\u201cEach one pictures some bit of California wildlife,\u201d Scott said, peeling off a sticker and putting it on Ellie\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to study up, if you\u2019re going to be an honorary forest ranger.\u201d</p><p>With her daughter so happily occupied, she set about doing the lunch prep, and Laura joined her. They got into a rhythm, where one unscrewed and wiped down ketchup bottles while the other filled them back up.</p><p>Laura shot a look at Scott, then muttered, \u201cStudly job, good looking, and he likes animals? That man must get laid right and left.\u201d</p><p>Helen snickered at the unexpected comment, and boy, how she appreciated a topic other than medical bills and wayward husbands. She stole a peek, too, and had to agree\u2014Scott sure did fill out his uniform nicely. \u201cCan\u2019t argue there.\u201d They shared a laugh, and it felt so good to have a nice, normal, easy exchange with another woman for once. \u201cI guess Eddie must\u2019ve called him and told him what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie called everyone,\u201d Laura said. \u201cDoctor Mark was first on the list, though. He prescribed clear fluids, fresh air, and lots of Nickelodeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad Rob\u2019s cure isn\u2019t so easy.\u201d Helen bit her tongue, unsure she should\u2019ve divulged so much.</p><p>Laura hesitated, then asked, \u201cDid Mark talk to you about it? He said he called you, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate. Patient confidentiality and all that.\u201d</p><p>It felt good to be confiding in someone, even if that person was Laura Bailey. \u201cYeah,\u201d she admitted, \u201cwe talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Helen let herself have a moment of gallows humor. \u201cI asked if he could prescribe my husband a pill that\u2019d make him less of a jackass.\u201d</p><p>Laura smirked. \u201cNo luck, I take it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe said compulsive gambling is an addiction like any other. Sorry to say, there are no magic pills for my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked around on the Web late last night,\u201d Laura said, and with a rueful smile, added, \u201cYou can imagine I was pretty amped when we got home. Anyway, I read that the biggest challenge is getting the person to admit he has a problem. But if he recognizes it and takes it day by day...\u201d She tapered off. \u201cDoes Rob get that his gambling is a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, he will when I\u2019m through with him.\u201d She sighed heavily. The line would\u2019ve sounded funnier and felt better if it weren\u2019t just so damned sad. \u201cHe says he\u2019s sorry. I don\u2019t know...maybe the scare was big enough to shock some sense into him.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe said he thought he was helping us. As if he might\u2019ve actually hit some jackpot.\u201d She forced a smirk, because if she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d cry.</p><p>\u201cI say make him grovel.\u201d Laura had noted Helen\u2019s attempts at levity and was trying to play along.</p><p>But she felt her smile fall from her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ever forgive him.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing to say to that, and the women grew silent. Gradually, she tuned back into the sound of Scott, flipping through his ranger cards.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a black bear,\u201d he was saying, explaining each animal to Ellie. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of those around here, and that\u2019s why we lock up our trash. We all have to live together, though, don\u2019t we? Hey, here\u2019s a chipmunk. And a gray fox. Ooh, you\u2019ve got a mountain lion, too\u2014don\u2019t run into many of those, thankfully. Oh, and these guys are special. A spotted owl. You don\u2019t see many of them anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne sec,\u201d Laura muttered, and left her with the ketchup bottles. \u201cCan I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has polka-dots,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen owls like that,\u201d Laura said. \u201cNear Timber Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Scott asked. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it endangered?\u201d</p><p>Helen wiped her hands and joined them, wondering at the woman\u2019s sudden nature curiosity.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s just a threatened species,\u201d Scott said, \u201cbut a lot of people are fighting to get it on the endangered list. I\u2019d be surprised if they had a nesting ground near the creek. Usually stuff like logging and construction is limited around critical habitat areas.\u201d</p><p>There was a clattering in the kitchen, and Hope burst through the door, a plate in hand. \u201cI made Ellie...\u201d Her eyes snagged on Scott, and her cheeks flamed bright red. \u201cI made cinnamon toast. For Ellie. I thought she\u2019d like toast. With cinnamon.\u201d She glanced again at Scott. \u201cHi,\u201d she said awkwardly.</p><p>Scott\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Laura and Helen shared a quick, loaded look, and the Bailey girl said, \u201cYou two don\u2019t know each other? Scott Jessup, Hope Fitzpatrick, our new employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he repeated lamely.</p><p>The look she and Laura shared was longer this time, and they didn\u2019t have to say anything, because the meaning was clear: a speechless Jessup was rarer than any owl.</p><p>Thirty-two</p><p>Laura stood behind the bar, going through the motions...wiping down the counter, checking stock, cutting limes, refilling the glass tray. But mostly she was thinking.</p><p>She had what she needed. She\u2019d done some research. The northern spotted owl was federally protected as a threatened species. She\u2019d seen the job site\u2014the construction wouldn\u2019t go near the nesting ground, and Eddie\u2019s project wasn\u2019t nearly big enough to be a threat, anyhow. But still, she knew it\u2019d be enough to put a hold on their work for a good, long while. She could stop the construction.</p><p>But would she?</p><p>She could make a stink about it. Notify environmental groups. Call television stations in Reno, get it on the evening news. Just one hint of bad press, and she had no doubt Fairview would pull out. They\u2019d spent years, not to mention a bundle of marketing dollars, pitching smaller, boutique resorts just like this one as eco-friendly destinations. Tourists came from all over to meditate and get back to nature, all the while dishing out beaucoup bucks for things like mud facials and seaweed wraps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could make a stink, and Fairview would pull out, removing all competition for the lodge. The Bailey family business could continue to thrive.</p><p>But at what cost to Eddie?</p><p>\u201cHeya, Lola.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. Dan. The last person she felt like seeing just then, and she forced tired cheer into her voice. \u201cDone filming for the day?\u201d</p><p>She tore into a big bag of Chex Mix and considered her conundrum as she filled several bowls for the evening tavern crowd. She could make a fuss, but she had a new perspective now. If Fairview pulled out, it\u2019d cut into Eddie\u2019s bottom line. It would also take food, savings, and security from Jack\u2019s family.</p><p>Worst, it would take away from the at-risk kids in Reno\u2014kids who\u2019d lost so much already.</p><p>\u201cOoh, gimme.\u201d Dan leaned on the bar, reaching for the snacks. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss all this middle-America awesomeness.\u201d He pulled a bowl his way and shoved a fistful into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m starving. We took off a day of filming to, you know, explore. Dude, have you been to Silver Town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver City? Of course I have.\u201d Stopping Fairview had been all she\u2019d wanted\u2014could she let it go now? She remembered her talk with Sorrow...the family business would probably survive a little competition, especially because the two properties were so different.</p> <p>\u201cI swear, we had the worst sushi ever. We went to some place...what was it called? The Sushi Zone,\u201d he exclaimed. Dan snagged another handful of snacks, then added in a mocking voice, \u201cWe were...in the zone...the sushi zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? How was it?\u201d She wiped down the counter for the third time, mostly to appear busy to the producer. She really needed silence to think this through.</p><p>There was the whole environmental question still to consider. Of course, she could just discuss it with Eddie. Maybe she should. He\u2019d make sure to give the owls a wide berth. The impact would be negligible.</p><p>But he was Mister Outdoors Guy. If he knew those owls were special, he\u2019d stop the work until he could sort it all out. More than that, if he knew they were protected by law, he\u2019d halt construction all together.</p><p>Did she want to be responsible for the loss to his business? Worse, might he think this was just another ruse on her part, another way to hound him?</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Dan asked, chomping away.</p> <p>\u201cDid you want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, that, too, thanks. But I was saying there was mayo on the sashimi rice. Actual mayonnaise. The ahi was chewy, and you know they only had that gross crab stick stuff on the Cali roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d she said distractedly. No wonder they were taking so long to film if Dan was having his crew drive all over creation in search of raw fish. When would they be done, anyway? They hadn\u2019t even gotten any lodge footage, which she\u2019d been hoping for. It\u2019d all been shots of the town, the falls, interviews with the community. They must\u2019ve had hours of B-roll by now.</p><p>\u201cDude, how can you live here without decent sushi?\u201d He sounded outraged, and just then it struck her as so ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI find a way to carry on,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I had food that crappy was at The Supermarket. You heard of it? It\u2019s the new place on Melrose. They serve only food purchased from grocery stores...like an ironic statement about the global economy. You get it?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to open a jar of cocktail onions. \u201cSorry, get what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>Her cell rang, and she answered without thinking. Dammit. She\u2019d been too distracted and had forgotten she was screening. Now she had to deal with her old CEO\u2014as if she didn\u2019t have enough on her plate at that moment.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she told him and, putting a hand over the phone, said to Dan, \u201cAsk Sorrow. She can tell you how to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe supermarket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. No, no, dude. The Supermarket is a restaurant in LA. Anyway, I\u2019ll let you get that.\u201d He waved at her phone. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Fabulous. She turned her back to him, trying to keep it down. But the dinner crowd had yet to appear, and even in a whisper, it felt like her voice echoed through the place.</p><p>She listened to the same litany. Double her salary. Hand-picked team. Stock options. Benefits for her and her family.</p><p>That last bit tripped a switch in her brain. Benefits.</p><p>Watching Helen wrestle with just one small urgent care clinic visit had given her flashbacks, back to the days after Dad\u2019s stroke. Forget the challenge of getting him back to health; they\u2019d struggled for years to recover financially.</p><p>Her parents weren\u2019t getting any younger. How would she pay for their care when the day came that they needed extra help? There was Medicare, but would that be enough? What if, God forbid, something catastrophic happened? It would bankrupt them. Talk about failing the family business.</p><p>She nestled the phone closer to her mouth and found herself asking, \u201cFull coverage? If I came back, you\u2019d give my parents coverage, too?\u201d</p><p>But Dan had overheard. He spun in his seat. \u201cGet out. You\u2019re moving back?\u201d</p><p>She shushed him, angling farther away. \u201cDid you ever establish that pretax benefits plan?\u201d</p><p>What a relief it would be, if she could feel like her parents were covered. Sorrow and Billy would be married soon, and she was sure the sheriff\u2019s department would have them covered, but if she could establish a bigger nest egg for Mom and Dad, then if the day ever came when her folks needed something like in-home care, she\u2019d be able to provide it.</p><p>\u201cBecause I so cannot see you living here,\u201d Dan said with a smirk.</p><p>Tucking her head for more privacy, she told her old boss she\u2019d consider it.</p><p>San Francisco wasn\u2019t so far away, not really. She could go back, just for a little while. Sorrow could stay and run things at the lodge, and she\u2019d have her high-powered job back, pulling in an easy six figures. She could scrimp, setting aside enough money to take the stress off her parents.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not even any decent sushi here,\u201d Dan said, continuing his rant at her back.</p><p>She nodded, moving farther down the bar. \u201cI\u2019d need a guarantee in writing,\u201d she told him in a low but stern voice. It felt good to be business Laura again\u2014she was good at it. \u201cA more ironclad contract. And no noncompete clause this time.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Eddie would even move with her. They could always come back to Sierra Falls when it was time to have kids.</p><p>They...she smiled at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Dan exclaimed the moment she hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you screening your calls. Checking your texts. Lola\u2019s back. The master negotiator.\u201d</p><p>Eddie walked in, and as she watched him approach, all her concerns fell away. Their eyes locked.</p><p>\u201cI love this idea,\u201d Dan said, then added in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cBut forget San Francisco. You belong in LA.\u201d He held up a hand, and it hung in the air until she gave him an automatic but distracted high-five, her attention pinned only on the Jessup heading straight for her.</p><p>Eddie reached them, and all she wanted was to sink into his arms\u2014if only he were holding her, she\u2019d be able to sort out this confusion. If she could be with Eddie, she\u2019d be home, wherever she was.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am, darlin\u2019.\u201d He gave her his Eddie smile, all ease and promise and comfort. \u201cI came to take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust no sushi,\u201d the producer chimed in. \u201cAm I right, Lola?\u201d</p><p>Eddie looked askance at the guy. \u201cNo worries there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLola, tell Teddie here where they have the best sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco is where it\u2019s at,\u201d Dan yammered on. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the best sushi, and now they\u2019ll have our Lola back, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dan.\u201d She paled, watching Eddie\u2019s face go blank, and quickly assured him, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like what?\u201d he asked her slowly.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear?\u201d Dan raised his beer in a toast. \u201cOur girl is moving back to San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-three</p><p>Eddie\u2019s blood turned to ice. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not set in stone,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Dread spread through him like a cold, black shadow. \u201cWhat\u2019s not set in stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy old boss called,\u201d she began, and she didn\u2019t need to say more than that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving. Again.\u201d It felt like he\u2019d been punched. Her leaving was no real surprise anymore, and it gutted him. But on top of the hurt was anger. Why hadn\u2019t she told him?</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good option,\u201d she hedged. She hadn\u2019t disagreed.</p><p>Eddie watched her, waiting for this to be some misunderstanding, but he could tell by the look on her face that he\u2019d heard correctly. \u201cThat\u2019s all it takes? A phone call from some guy who treated you like crap, and then you\u2019re back in your car, outta here?\u201d</p><p>That idiot producer chimed in. \u201cShe\u2019s off to San Fran, but I\u2019m telling her, LA is the place to be. City of Angels, baby. Am I right?\u201d And then the jackass actually gave him a chummy punch on the arm.</p><p>Eddie flinched away. He couldn\u2019t believe this. She wasn\u2019t leaving. Not again. He tried to understand\u2014surely there was something he was missing. \u201cSo, what, this guy just called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing the hard sell,\u201d Dan answered instead. \u201cCalling, texting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Laura scolded.</p><p>Eddie finally broke his gaze away from her, shooting a glare at Dan-the-douche, then back at her again. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude\u2019s been calling her for a while now. But who wouldn\u2019t chase Lola?\u201d Dan gave a knowing leer. \u201cShe\u2019s even got you chasing her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eddie cut his eyes at him. \u201cHow about you shut the hell up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d the guy muttered, grabbing another fistful of bar snacks.</p><p>Laura sighed. \u201cTake it easy, boys.\u201d</p> <p>He was done being easy. He\u2019d been easy his whole life, and look what it was getting him. No, he finally had everything he\u2019d ever wanted, and he wasn\u2019t letting it go without a fight. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might have mentioned this? Remind me...what have we been doing these past weeks? Because I know what I\u2019ve been doing. I\u2019ve been with you. Thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>In love, with you.</p><p>While clearly she\u2019d been back to her old ways\u2014coming home, doing the emotional slash and burn, which meant soon she\u2019d be hightailing it back to the city, leaving scorched earth in her wake. Right on schedule.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said in a pleading voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t think his calls would come to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, hey,\u201d he barreled on, \u201chere\u2019s a thought. You could\u2019ve mentioned it to me, maybe before you told this guy.\u201d He angrily hitched his thumb Dan\u2019s way.</p> <p>\u201cChill out,\u201d Dan told him, sounding indignant. \u201cTake it easy on her.\u201d He added under his breath, \u201cDude, I would lose my shit living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, dude,\u201d Eddie mocked. \u201cThen maybe it\u2019s time for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with me,\u201d Laura argued. \u201cWe can still be together.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes widened, and he swung around on his stool with a shout. \u201cGet out!\u201d He shook his head, repeating, \u201cGet the hell out. You two are a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take care of things for a while,\u201d she said, ignoring Dan. \u201cTill you got on your feet. You could find a construction job in the city. I can pay for stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s what I care about? Whether I have enough stuff? Have you not been listening to a word I\u2019ve said? Haven\u2019t you gotten who I am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. What would a mountain dude do in the city?\u201d Dan laughed to himself, shaking his head, muttering, \u201cLola sowing her oats with the locals. Classic.\u201d</p><p>Eddie spun on him. \u201cHow about you shut your mouth before I shut it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget him.\u201d Laura reached for his hand. \u201cListen to me. You have to admit you\u2019ve been struggling, but there\u2019s work in the city. Jack could run Jessup Brothers on his own.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m struggling with right now is you, Laura.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled to himself. \u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d Eddie told him through gritted teeth. He would not be held responsible for mopping the floor with this guy.</p><p>Dan smirked. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to think of my finances,\u201d Laura continued. \u201cOur finances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with our finances? We\u2019ve got food, family, a roof over our heads. Hell, several roofs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I need more? People will pay me a lot to use my business sense. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe survive because this is our home. We\u2019ve got family here. I\u2019ve got family, and I\u2019m not leaving them.\u201d He did a quick scan of the bar. Bear was in the corner, playing cards with his buddies. Sorrow was in the back. Helen worked the floor, while Edith was at the lodge caring for her kid. \u201cWe\u2019re a community, Laura. But we\u2019re not good enough for you, are we? We never were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s not fair? Jerking me around like this. What, you just wanted to see what it was like with a townie? Is that all I am? But how big of you, you\u2019re not done with me yet, so you\u2019ll find the country bumpkin a job in the big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d consider leaving until just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t for a moment think your leaving was something I might like to have a say in?\u201d</p><p>She shot back, \u201cSince when do you have a say in my professional life?\u201d</p><p>He got quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s like you need to control every aspect of your life. You can\u2019t let it go for one minute, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known. Whenever the going gets too scary, Laura Bailey cuts and runs.\u201d He felt so stupid. Stupid, and embarrassed. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you told this guy about it before me. You could\u2019ve at least told me your old boss was calling. We have had some time together lately. I trusted you. I thought I was finally making headway with you. I told you stuff, Laura. And then you turn around and tell your news to this prick.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his shoulders back, trying to look tough. \u201cDon\u2019t be getting up in my grill. Lola, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re letting mountain man here talk to you like that. He\u2019s out of your system, now you should get him out of your bar.\u201d</p><p>Eddie took a step closer. He had half a mind to show this guy the meaning of mountain man. \u201cYou\u2019re on thin ice, pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come with me to the city,\u201d Laura pleaded. \u201cI can take care of things for a while, until we figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat Teddie here,\u201d Dan told her. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want you, you can be my sugar mama, any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>That was it. Eddie grabbed a fistful of that gelled, spiked hair, pulled the guy from his stool, and punched him in the face.</p><p>Dan grabbed his head with a sharp yelp and skittered backward. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Laura shrieked. The bar had fallen silent. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He flexed his fist, shaking it out. \u201cJust being a country boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan grabbed his asinine black glasses from where they\u2019d flown to the floor and settled them back on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201d He blew out a breath, rolling his shoulders like he might actually try something, but Eddie had about five inches and forty pounds on the guy that said he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cScrew this,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019m loading up. We\u2019re out of here. I thought we\u2019d get some footage of your stupid hotel, but I\u2019m over it. Done.\u201d</p><p>As the producer stormed out, Laura turned on him. \u201cThanks, Eddie. Thanks a whole hell of a lot. Your business sense is staggering.\u201d</p><p>That was all she was thinking about? Business? She\u2019d just broken his heart.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a tender side,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut everyone was right. You\u2019re out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was right, too. You\u2019re a Neanderthal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, at least I\u2019m not a robot. I\u2019d rather know how to feel, and get angry, than be good at...what are you good at...spreadsheets? All you care about is the bottom line. Well, you can take your cold numbers to bed with you.\u201d</p><p>She stood rigidly, arms wrapped tight around her chest. \u201cYou say you don\u2019t want anyone to think you\u2019re a bumpkin, but look at you. You can\u2019t just go around punching people when things don\u2019t go your way. Talk about looking the part. What do you expect people to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll think maybe I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>The bar was utterly silent. Laura was silent.</p><p>He felt it in his chest, gutting him, like silence might be a physical thing.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re better than us,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cYou always did. I tell you I love you, and not even that\u2019s good enough.\u201d He let his eyes lock with hers, one last time. He had to get her out of his sight. The pain was too great. \u201cYou know what, Laura? Just go. And this time, stay gone.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-four</p><p>Rob dallied under the tavern\u2019s awning, putting off the inevitable.</p><p>It\u2019d been a sort of horror...watching from a distance as a man did such unfathomable things, only to realize you were that man. When clarity had descended, and he grasped what he\u2019d done, it\u2019d been like rousing from a dream into a waking nightmare.</p><p>Last night, he\u2019d left his daughter. It was incomprehensible. His sick, tiny daughter. He\u2019d left her alone to fend for herself. Helen would never forgive him.</p><p>He\u2019d never forgive himself.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob, but it flew open, and out burst Laura Bailey. She froze, stopping short before they ran into each other, and then she gave him a look of such disgust it shamed him. \u201cMen,\u201d she snarled, her lip curled, then stormed away to the lodge.</p><p>Not the greatest indication of how he\u2019d be received. He took a deep breath and warily entered the tavern. Inside, the silence was so deafening, it made his skin crawl. Was the silence because he\u2019d shown up?</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he heard his wife say. \u201cNow it\u2019s a party.\u201d</p><p>Guilt, humiliation...it choked him. But it was a horror of his own making, and so he made himself face it.</p><p>He found her\u2014his Helen\u2014his eyes went straight for her. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tongue. What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d So pretty she was, with that thick, red hair. That saucy body. There used to be such fire in her eyes, and he knew he was the one who\u2019d dampened it.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace private?\u201d he pleaded. By the time he\u2019d made it home last night, she\u2019d secured the chain on the door. She wouldn\u2019t let him in. Wouldn\u2019t take his calls. His only choice was to plead his case in public, but he hoped it wouldn\u2019t have to be this public.</p><p>She scanned the floor, until Bear caught her eyes and gave her a nod. She led him to a corner booth and sat. \u201cTell me one thing,\u201d she demanded at once. \u201cIs there another woman? Because I can\u2019t figure how else you could leave our girl like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Just you. Only you.\u201d He leaned forward, desperate to take her hands.</p><p>She stared at his outstretched arms like he was diseased. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got?\u201d She bolted to standing. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Please.\u201d Panic made his mouth taste metallic, made his ears ring. \u201cJust give me one minute. Sixty seconds is all I ask.\u201d</p><p>She considered it for a painful moment, then sat stiffly across from him. \u201cSixty seconds.\u201d She glared at her watch like she might actually be timing him.</p><p>She seemed so far away. He was losing her. Losing his family. He\u2019d awoken from his haze into a cold, black place. But it was a place he\u2019d made himself. Even now he felt the itch to try, just one last time. To head to the nearest casino and finally get his big payday. But he knew now, the impulse was a madness, chasing smoke. He had his payday, and it was Helen and the kids. And they\u2019d locked him out of their lives.</p> <p>He forced himself to keep his hands extended toward her, praying the day would come when she\u2019d take them again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to Ellie. I can get you wanting to leave me, but her? Chrissakes, Rob, she\u2019s only seven years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were flat on him. \u201cThat and two bucks will buy you a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that now. But I promise I\u2019ll work hard. I\u2019m going to work on getting better.\u201d It would be a lifelong struggle, but his wake-up call had been just too terrifying. The stakes were too high\u2014he had to back away from the ledge. There was no choice in this one. He needed to turn his back on gambling forever. \u201cDoctor Mark found me a group in Silver City.\u201d</p> <p>He heard someone in the tavern say, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s far from the strip.\u201d There was a low, answering laugh.</p><p>He pretended not to hear. \u201cI went, and it\u2019s good, Helen. It\u2019ll be a good thing. They told me how gambling is an addiction. Like heroin or something.\u201d</p><p>He heard voices discussing him. The talk came to him in snippets...what he should do, what Helen should do, what others have done. There were Bible quotes about forgiveness. About fortitude. Pithy, pitiful crap.</p><p>It all made him so angry. People didn\u2019t understand. Easy quotes and anecdotes meant nothing when you were facing a battle like this. But he knew that his anger and shame were the flip sides of the same coin. He had no right to be angry, and the shame was his to feel. He was the one who\u2019d made himself an outsider.</p><p>He pushed those other voices from his head. They didn\u2019t matter. All that mattered was Helen. His kids. \u201cGamblers like me, we think we can hit the tables like anyone else. I thought I could go to the casino like a normal person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you,\u201d Helen snapped, \u201cthe day you enter another casino will be the day I take your kids from you forever.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was steel, but he\u2019d earned that cold wrath. He made himself hear it. \u201cI won\u2019t. I swear I won\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d been studying the steps to recovery. First was to admit he was powerless. Then, to turn his will. Now, it was time to make amends.</p><p>\u201cCan you try to forgive me?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Rob.\u201d She leaned her head back, looking defeated. Her pretty face had aged.</p><p>He\u2019d done that to her. \u201cMarrying me was a bad bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur kids are the only reason I\u2019m even looking at you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vow I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said vows before.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re just words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you mean them like I do. You said vows once, too. In sickness and in health. Please, just one more chance. Let me be a husband to you.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him a moment, speechless, looking like she was seeing him for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Panic clawed him. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d emerged from a fog to realize his angel girl could\u2019ve died, and it would\u2019ve been his fault. He\u2019d awoken to find his wife on the other side of a glass wall, staring at him like a pitiable thing. Like a criminal. \u201cI love you, Helen. I\u2019m nothing without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it looks like you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>He felt someone looming over them and looked up to find Eddie Jessup staring daggers.</p><p>\u201cHey, Helen,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cDo you need help over here? Do you need me to ask him to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have to make sure your wife wants to listen.\u201d</p><p>He stood and faced Eddie. This would be the last time she\u2019d need another man to step up for her, even if it meant breaking his back to prove he was the only one for her. He\u2019d face everyone, one by one, if that was what he needed to do to make it right. To make Helen his again. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need protection from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kid sure needed protecting when I dropped her at your house last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing lurking around our house?\u201d Eddie made himself at home while he\u2019d been locked out. Jealousy and shame burned him. Fed his anger. \u201cYou hot for my wife?\u201d</p><p>Helen got up, every inch of her five-foot-four frame standing erect. \u201cRobert, don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d Eddie laughed grimly. \u201cThis is not the best moment to push it with me, Haskell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care, anyway?\u201d He considered the guy for a moment. He knew Jessup had been there for his wife and child, and it stung. He wanted to lash out, but since he couldn\u2019t take the guy with his fists, he\u2019d take him with words. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d be worrying about minding my own damned business. Fairview\u2019s got a casino in Reno, and the place has been crawling with suits. I heard them talk, and there\u2019s something fishy with that construction project of yours. So you need to stop throwing stones when you live in your own damned glass house.\u201d</p><p>Eddie squinted at him. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? You\u2019re so full of it, trying to make this about me, when you should be thanking me. I was there last night for your family, doing what you should\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay away from my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to get a grip,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cLook at you...look at all your bullshit. The gambling, the money, this big-guy attitude of yours, screw all of it. You\u2019ve got a wife and kids who love you. That\u2019s the jackpot right there. And you\u2019re going to lose it all.\u201d</p><p>The statement hung, reverberating, until Helen added quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to neglect me, Rob, but Ellie could have died.\u201d</p><p>He broke then.</p><p>He began to weep, in front of all those people. But he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d strip naked and walk through Sierra Falls if it meant his wife would forgive him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to neglect you, Helen. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie scowled at him. \u201cThen you need to man up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Eddie.\u201d Helen inserted herself between the two men. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>Rob took her hands and told her earnestly, \u201cAll I ever wanted was to take care of you. To treat you to things. Treat you right.\u201d</p><p>She flinched, and it was a knife in his belly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a funny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted some extra cash,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cFor us. I wanted enough money to hire a sitter for you. To get you some help every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the kids,\u201d she shot back. \u201cI love spending time with them. I wanted to spend time with you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re always flirting with other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping to catch your attention,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t want them. I thought you had a mistress.\u201d</p><p>The front door jingled, and Ellie ran in, with Edith right behind. His angel girl, and she ran right into his arms. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to keep her on the couch.\u201d Edith shot a glance at Helen, and it was loaded with uncertainty and apology. \u201cShe saw his truck in the lot and insisted.\u201d</p><p>His daughter forgave him, and he swore to himself he\u2019d do all he could to make himself worthy of it. He scrubbed his face dry. \u201cHey, pretty lady. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Ellie was clueless to the discomfort of the adults in the room and reported with a wide smile, \u201cMissus Edith gave me a special wallet for my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat money?\u201d Helen was instantly suspicious, and it made him feel like a thief. She took the beaded wallet from their daughter and opened it, but when she saw what was inside, her expression crumpled.</p><p>\u201cDaddy gave me his buffalo nickel,\u201d Ellie said proudly.</p><p>Helen gave him a pointed look. \u201cThat\u2019s your lucky coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She held herself stiffly, but finally she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cI don\u2019t need babysitters and fancy cars,\u201d she said, sounding so tired. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do you really mean that?\u201d He would erase that sadness from her eyes\u2014he\u2019d dedicate himself to it.</p><p>Finally he felt Jessup, Edith, and the others drift away, giving them some privacy, and he let it all out. \u201cI see you...you\u2019re so damned sexy, Helen. And I\u2019m such a screwup. I\u2019ve got a job at the hardware store, and then I see you talking to guys like...like Eddie, or that Damien. I see how men like that look at you. I see the way you smile at them. You could be with any man you wanted. You\u2019re that beautiful. We\u2019ve been on this road a long time. We were young when we started. I\u2019d understand if you want to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to leave you.\u201d She swept a tear from her face. \u201cBut don\u2019t you get it, Robbie? I don\u2019t care about those other men. All I ever wanted was to make a life with you, my husband, and you took that from me.\u201d She sighed. Paused. It was the longest moment of his life. \u201cBut the kids love you, and God help me, somewhere in my heart, I do, too. I\u2019ll give you one more chance. Just one more,\u201d she added vehemently. \u201cBecause if I see you so much as looking at a deck of cards, I\u2019ll fix it so you\u2019re never alone with me or our children ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Helen.\u201d He squeezed her hand and pressed it to his cheek. He knew not to try for more than that. \u201cI\u2019ll show you. I\u2019ll prove to you how I can be a better man.\u201d</p><p>He would prove his worth to her every day for the rest of his life. He\u2019d seen the edge of the precipice, and he wasn\u2019t going back, ever again.</p><p>Thirty-five</p> <p>Laura shoved her suitcase into the back of her car. He\u2019d told her to go. To stay gone. She slammed the trunk shut. He\u2019d called her a robot.</p><p>Fine, then. She\u2019d be the best, most successful damned robot Sierra Falls had ever seen. Only this time she wasn\u2019t going to come back until she was driving a damned Porsche. A red one.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to leave now?\u201d Sorrow came and leaned against her car. It was super early, and her sister had thrown on an ancient high school hoodie over her pajamas. Her hair was a messy, early-morning tangle.</p><p>Emotion clawed Laura\u2019s throat. All her posturing was just a lie. She\u2019d be dying to come back home\u2014would probably be home again by the end of the month. She\u2019d just hide in the lodge next time, maybe park around back where people couldn\u2019t see she was there. Where nobody would think she\u2019d returned with her tail between her legs. \u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>She needed to leave before the breakfast crowd showed at the tavern. Before she saw that red pickup driving down the road, where this time it wouldn\u2019t stop. She pasted a smile on her face. \u201cI want to miss the Bay Bridge traffic.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow gave her a probing look, likely seeing what Laura had tried to hide, but all the mascara in the world couldn\u2019t mask a sleepless night of crying. \u201cCome in and get some food at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d More like, she didn\u2019t think she could choke anything down. Her stomach was a knot.</p><p>\u201cToast,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cCoffee. Something.\u201d It was clear her sister wouldn\u2019t give up.</p><p>She peeked at her cell. She was checking the time but couldn\u2019t help but notice there were no calls. No texts. No Eddie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still so early,\u201d Sorrow said, guessing her concern. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the place to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She stopped trying to force the smile\u2014her sister understood. \u201cJust coffee. I don\u2019t think I can do anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow unlocked the door, and Laura went to turn up the thermostat. She loved the quiet, chill feeling of the tavern in the morning. That feeling of solitude. The first flick-flick of the kitchen lights.</p><p>The sadness made her feel so heavy. She sagged into a booth away from the window. \u201cI\u2019ll miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you have to go.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fully comprehending, either. It was happening fast, like a riptide sweeping her away. She hadn\u2019t reported the owls because she didn\u2019t want to ruin Eddie\u2019s business. He was a hero to those Reno kids, and she didn\u2019t have the heart to do something that might change that. But in not reporting the nesting ground to the authorities, she was letting the hotel construction continue, which could very well hurt her family business.</p><p>Her only choice was to help her family in another way. And there was no greater help than money. Seeing Ellie\u2019s ordeal had brought back chilling memories of medical bills, insurance deductibles, all those fears for the future. But if she took her old job back, the practical fears would disappear.</p><p>Moving back to San Francisco. It\u2019d been easy enough to go there in her head\u2014she\u2019d done it so many times. Had convinced herself so many times that leaving Sierra Falls was what she wanted. What was best for her family. Only now she feared she was going through the motions.</p><p>Sorrow tossed the tavern keys onto the table. \u201cI know you want to get out of here, like, ten minutes ago, but sit. For one second. And don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>God, she loved her baby sister. She raised her hand, promising. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>As she listened to Sorrow bustle in the kitchen, she checked her phone again. Since she\u2019d given her CEO the thumbs-up, there\u2019d been a flurry of e-mails from the human resources department. Benefits information. The contract for her to sign. Appointments she needed to make. The details about her stock grant.</p><p>Benefits, stock... It was the mantra she kept in her head. She had to keep repeating it. Had to keep reminding herself she was doing this for them. Whenever she stopped, too many doubts stabbed her.</p><p>She had all kinds of things to sign, but of course there wasn\u2019t a fax at the lodge. She clicked off the phone with a sigh. It was okay. She\u2019d be back in the city by lunch. Maybe she\u2019d head straight to the office.</p><p>She\u2019d sign her contract, and then the decision would be made.</p><p>Sorrow reappeared with two mugs bearing the Thirsty Bear logo.</p><p>She breathed in deeply. \u201cYou made the good coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my coffee is good coffee.\u201d Sorrow settled across from her with a smile. \u201cBut yes, I made your gross super-strong French press coffee.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes, and she pursed her lips to stop them. She\u2019d sworn to herself she wouldn\u2019t break down in front of anyone. Not even her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to throttle that man the next time I see him.\u201d Sorrow leaned forward and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Eddie\u2019s fault.\u201d She pulled away. Too much contact, and she would lose it. \u201cI was stupid to think there was anything there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving because of Eddie,\u201d she insisted. Not really, anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve got a killer bonus package. I figure if I work even for two, three years, I can sock away enough to cover what Dad\u2019s IRA doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget that.\u201d Sorrow squeezed her hand. \u201cDad has enough saved. We own the place outright. We are sitting on a gold mine, right?\u201d she joked, referring to the veins of gold running deep through the rock, too deep for anyone to touch.</p><p>She laughed, and it was good to have a moment\u2019s respite from the intensity. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Dad that. I\u2019m sure he has dreams of being Prospector Pete.\u201d</p><p>The door jingled as Helen came in, and Sorrow checked the clock over the bar. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes went from Sorrow in her jammies, to her, probably looking ready to crack. \u201cDo you need me to come back?\u201d</p><p>Laura tried her smile again, but she knew it was stiff. \u201cNot at all. I\u2019ll be hitting the road soon. Just grabbing some fuel for the drive.\u201d She sipped her coffee\u2014it was still too hot, but she needed something to burn away the emotion.</p><p>Helen tied on her apron. \u201cI wanted to get out, grab some time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork is good for that sometimes,\u201d Sorrow said, filling the uneasy silence. \u201cDon\u2019t mind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get everything going in the kitchen, then.\u201d Helen disappeared into the back.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her sister leaned forward. \u201cNow I have even more time to convince you.\u201d</p><p>She gave her a rueful smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go back to work,\u201d Sorrow insisted. \u201cThe lodge and tavern will be fine. Mom and Dad will be fine. We\u2019ve always gotten by. It\u2019s not up to you to shoulder everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. I don\u2019t know that I ever really belonged here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? Sierra Falls is your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fooling myself to think that I could be...I don\u2019t know...nature girl or something.\u201d She gave an embarrassed shrug. When she felt Helen emerge from the kitchen, going behind the bar to get the coffee started, she pitched her voice lower. \u201cHere\u2019s the irony. That stupid ranch is on some sort of protected owl nesting ground. So, after all that, I actually could shut Eddie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not. Why would I? The Jessups do good. They\u2019re a fixture in Sierra Falls. Scott the forest ranger. Mark the doctor. Jack\u2019s boy is off at boot camp. You don\u2019t get much more upstanding than all that. And then there\u2019s Eddie. He\u2019s practically a hero, using his own money to do stuff for needy kids. How many lives has he touched? How many kids\u2019 futures have changed because he\u2019s got the spare cash to buy gear and food? You pointed it out yourself; the Jessups aren\u2019t going to ruin us, so why should I put Jack and Eddie out of business? Especially now that I\u2019ll be going back to my old job. I\u2019ve got great insurance, an IRA. Hell, with what my old boss is paying me, I could start a whole new hotel.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her an evil grin. \u201cYou could do it to spite the Neanderthal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess...\u201d She gave a halfhearted smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was wrong about Eddie. He\u2019s a good guy. I think I\u2019ll just back away slowly, you know?\u201d</p><p>They were speaking in hushed tones, but she could tell by Helen\u2019s pauses that the woman was catching dribs and drabs of the conversation. It hardly mattered, though. Not at this point. And besides, after all Helen had been through, she couldn\u2019t fault her anything. It was amazing she\u2019d even let her husband back in the house. She guessed that was what marriage was about\u2014commitment. And being a team for life sometimes meant forgiveness.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she was ready for something like that, but maybe she\u2019d been right about herself all along. Business was her strength. Not men. Spreadsheets in bed, just like Eddie had said.</p><p>She felt that ache again in her throat and took a last sip of coffee to burn it away. She checked the clock. \u201cI should go, and you should get dressed.\u201d She gave her sister a sad smile. \u201cYou need to text me. And call. Anytime. If you take anyone else wedding dress shopping, I swear, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow walked her out. \u201cLet us know when you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext stop, San Francisco.\u201d She selected some music on her phone\u2014an old Dixie Chicks CD, with songs about strong women walking away\u2014plugged it in, and hit the road.</p><p>But the next stop wasn\u2019t San Francisco. She couldn\u2019t leave Sierra Falls without paying one last visit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirty-six</p><p>Eddie peeled into the tavern parking lot. He\u2019d screwed up. Big-time.</p><p>He owed Laura a big apology. What he should\u2019ve done was greet her news with congratulations. She\u2019d apparently been offered some plum job, but instead of telling her he was proud, he\u2019d acted pissy.</p> <p>Sure, he could\u2019ve asked questions, maybe raised doubts\u2014hell, they could\u2019ve had a little debate and resolved it back at his place. So why hadn\u2019t he? If he really thought about it\u2014and there\u2019d been little else he had thought about last night\u2014it was jealousy that\u2019d made him act like such a giant baby.</p><p>He loped up the steps. The real truth was, he\u2019d follow Laura all the way to New York City, if that was what it took to be with her. He\u2019d tell her so, immediately and in no uncertain terms.</p><p>\u201cYou just missed her,\u201d Helen said as he came in.</p><p>Still, he looked around, as if she might be mistaken.</p><p>\u201cYou came looking for Miss Thang, right?\u201d</p> <p>He finally focused on her. \u201cHey, Helen. Yeah, I\u2019m looking for Laura.\u201d He needed to get himself together, act like a normal human being. \u201cSorry...you said she left?\u201d He checked the clock\u2014he\u2019d barely slept and felt situated somewhere out of time\u2014but it was still early, just past eight. And he thought he\u2019d be too early. What time had she left to beat him out the door? \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>Helen resumed clearing a table of its plates, cutlery, and empty cups. \u201cI got in just after six. It was a little after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go? She\u2019s not gone gone, is she?\u201d Maybe she\u2019d run out and would be back in a minute. But at the crack of dawn? He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around the notion that she\u2019d simply disappear overnight. She\u2019d need to say good-bye to people. She wouldn\u2019t just leave without a trace.</p><p>Helen shrugged. \u201cShe looked pretty gone to me.\u201d</p><p>He plopped into the nearest chair. He was numb. \u201cGot it. Thanks, Helen.\u201d</p><p>Of course she was gone for good\u2014it was Laura they were talking about. The great disappearing woman. Master of the getaway.</p> <p>She came over with a carafe. \u201cYou look like you could use some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Maybe she\u2019d hit him over the head with it\u2014sure would hurt less.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Eddie.\u201d She filled up his cup and brought him creams and sugars.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, Helen.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d spent his life bemoaning how elusive the pretty Bailey girl was, and this time, he\u2019d been the one to send her packing. \u201cLooks like I screwed up big-time.\u201d Every nasty thing she\u2019d ever said about him\u2014a Neanderthal...a delinquent...an unsophisticated, uncivilized brute\u2014he\u2019d proven it all true. In front of a crowd, no less.</p><p>He realized Helen was still standing there. Had she said something? He was like the walking dead. \u201cSorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, can I get you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He scrubbed a hand through his hair, considering it. He had to eat\u2014if he\u2019d eaten something last night, he didn\u2019t remember it now, and neither did his stomach. \u201cHow about some eggs.\u201d He needed a plan, and food would help. \u201cThree, scrambled hard. Side of bacon.\u201d He tore open a bunch of sugar packets and dumped them into his coffee. It was shaping up to be one hell of a morning, and he\u2019d throw everything he could at it. \u201cMaybe some home fries. Toast, too. What else...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitchen sink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He looked up and she was smiling down at him. He sighed. \u201cYeah, throw in the kitchen sink, too, would you?\u201d He\u2019d need to claw his way out of this hole if he was going to be any good to anyone.</p><p>When Helen came back with the first of several plates, he forced himself to make small talk, which was clearly what the woman wanted. He asked after Ellie. She asked after the ranch. They avoided talk of Laura and Rob and fistfights.</p><p>His eggs and toast were up, and as she brought him a bottle of ketchup and a little bowl filled with jellies, she asked, \u201cSo, you off to the ranch today, or is the project dead for good?\u201d</p><p>He spread a big gob of strawberry jelly on a triangle of toast. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owls. I heard about Timber Creek having some nesting thing. I just assumed...\u201d She began to look panicked.</p><p>What the hell? He made a split-second decision to play along. \u201cOh, that. Yeah.\u201d If she knew something she wasn\u2019t supposed to know, he didn\u2019t want to scare her off. Ever since Rob called the ranch project sketchy, it\u2019d nagged him. \u201cThe nesting thing,\u201d he repeated. Whatever the hell that meant. Rob had overheard something\u2014was this it? And had he discussed it with his wife? \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura and Sorrow were talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess your ranger brother was the one who found the nests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d His mind raced to put it all together. Had Laura discovered something about those owls? But it couldn\u2019t have been Scott who\u2019d told her. His brother would flip his lid if he thought they were doing construction on some endangered habitat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen baby owls before,\u201d Helen went on. \u201cDo you think I could bring Ellie by when she\u2019s better? It seems crazy that something like a few nests could stop a whole hotel from being built, but Laura knows, I guess. And, I tell you, I\u2019d be pissed, too, if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume that\u2019s why you two were fighting. She shut you down.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. She hadn\u2019t breathed a word of it. She could have shut his whole project down, but she\u2019d obviously sacrifice everything and leave before hurting him.</p><p>What an ass he was.</p><p>\u201cI gotta run.\u201d He wiped his mouth, tossed some bills down, and scooted away from the table.</p><p>\u201cBut your bacon hasn\u2019t come out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry anymore.\u201d He had a project to shut down.</p><p>And a woman to find.</p><p>Hunter Fox returned his call almost immediately, and Eddie pulled to the side of the road to take it. He wanted to give it his total focus. He wasn\u2019t generally a shark when it came to business, but he knew how to play ball, and how different could this be? Hell, this\u2019d probably be easier than any ball game.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste any time, telling the Fairview exec right off, \u201cYou\u2019re stopping construction.\u201d</p><p>Fox paused for a good ten seconds. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>He knew at once what the guy was up to. Fox would try to unsettle him, using long silences, threats, whatever it took. But Eddie didn\u2019t scare easy.</p><p>He had only one thing to lose: Laura.</p><p>And the sooner he dealt with this bonehead, the sooner he could track her down. He\u2019d apologize. He\u2019d bring her home.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re stopping construction. See, Hunter, I know what you\u2019re up to.\u201d He was officially done with Mister Fox.</p><p>\u201cYou do? You surprise me, Edward. What am I up to?\u201d</p><p>Fox\u2019s voice reeked of amused disdain, but it didn\u2019t throw Eddie off his game one little bit. He had the ball and was going for the blitz.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to bulldoze a protected habitat and cover it up.\u201d It was a leap to think Fairview knew about the nesting ground, but Rob had overheard something in that casino. If the guy was up to no good, hopefully he\u2019d be quick to panic at anything. And sure, bulldoze was an exaggeration\u2014they might\u2019ve been on the same property, but those nests were nowhere near the ranch house itself\u2014but he bet these monkey suits bluffed right and left. \u201cYou knew something like that would bring the government down on your ass, and yet you covered it up. There must be all kinds of laws protecting rare species.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Fox was silent. Bingo.</p><p>He might not know business, but he knew all about sleazebags like this guy. He seized his advantage. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shut down your little boutique hotel, I\u2019m calling every newspaper from here to the goddamn New York Times if I have to, telling them you were going to slaughter a bunch of endangered birds. How do you think your rich yuppie eco-tourists will like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely done.\u201d Fox\u2019s voice was dangerously subdued. \u201cJust one problem. Who\u2019ll believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole town of Sierra Falls, for a start.\u201d He was freestyling now, but it felt right. Full-court press, for the win. \u201cI\u2019ve got witnesses. Your lackeys aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve heard about your special projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Edward,\u201d Fox said genially, \u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m finding this two-bit town to be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. What would you say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say maybe it was time for you to get out of Dodge. Cut your losses. Except for one thing...\u201d</p><p>Fox\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cWhat do you want, Mister Jessup?\u201d</p><p>Mister Jessup\u2014how the tables turned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my terms.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut first? The name\u2019s Edwin. Edwin Jessup.\u201d</p><p>He told Fox exactly what he wanted. And then he sped off, going after who he wanted.</p><p>Laura. She\u2019d become his everything. She was all he really needed.</p><p>She was headed back to the city, but he had an idea where she\u2019d go first. She\u2019d told him once how special the falls were to her, and he knew in his gut she\u2019d need to see them as part of her good-bye.</p><p>He drove straight to the trailhead, and sure enough, her shiny black Beemer was there.</p><p>He hit the trail, walking fast. But first he let himself take a moment to pick her a good pinecone.</p><p>Thirty-seven</p><p>Laura had dallied long enough. She\u2019d said good-bye to the falls. She wondered what Grandpa would\u2019ve had to say about her leaving\u2014probably that she was a coward.</p><p>It was too late now. She\u2019d accepted the job. Had chosen her path.</p><p>She got up and brushed herself off. It was time. She hadn\u2019t lied to Sorrow when she said she wanted to miss the Bay Area traffic. She hit the trail, heading back the way she came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d made fun of herself for not being nature girl, but she did love these woods\u2014she always had. It didn\u2019t hurt that it was an easy walk to and from the falls.</p><p>She took a good look around, memorizing the trees. Saying good-bye. Good-bye to the person she\u2019d almost become.</p><p>Realistically, she wouldn\u2019t be back until autumn. The leaves would have turned by then. The quaking aspens\u2014those were her favorites\u2014they\u2019d be yellow. There\u2019d be some reds and oranges, too. But mostly it\u2019d be the same pine trees, green and fresh, and feeling old as time.</p> <p>She had to look away. Look down. She kicked rocks along the trail, thinking how lately she felt old as time, too. Would she ever really be happy? She was in love with Eddie, she knew that now. She\u2019d probably been in love with him for years. All that sparring. All those sparks. Had she wanted him all along?</p><p>But she also knew that sparring, arguments, conflict...it was all she was good for. It was why she was so good at business. Why she thrived in a cold, big city.</p><p>\u201cPenny for your thoughts, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and her breath caught. \u201cEddie.\u201d</p><p>It was like she\u2019d conjured him. For an instant, she had the fantasy that they hadn\u2019t fought. The fantasy that they were a couple, out for a hike. But she reminded herself it wasn\u2019t true. They were from two very different worlds, two travelers bearing different passports, with two very different destinations. So many differences never to be resolved. Seeing him, she mourned the person she wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>He walked right up to her. \u201cFinding you was easy. It\u2019s catching you that\u2019s the hard part.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her, but he looked like he wanted to. She knew Eddie\u2014the touching would be up to her. But she didn\u2019t have the guts.</p><p>He spoke of catching her...did that mean he wanted to keep her, too? She didn\u2019t trust it. What if she let him in, let him look deeper into her heart, and he decided he didn\u2019t like what he saw? The old fear and vulnerability began to slink back, and it sharpened her words. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI love you. Why can\u2019t you believe that?\u201d</p><p>Probably because she didn\u2019t feel particularly lovable at the moment. Last night\u2019s accusations came to her in a flood. \u201cI thought I was too controlling. A robot with intimacy issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean those things. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I was hurt and jealous. But I do love you, Laura, and I\u2019ll say it as many times as I need to until you believe it.\u201d</p><p>Then she saw what he had in his hands, and she burst into tears. \u201cYou brought me a pinecone?\u201d Maybe he did recognize the real her. Maybe he had looked deep into her heart and still wanted what he saw.</p><p>\u201cYeah, goof.\u201d He gave her a loving smile, tipping her chin up to face him. \u201cI can\u2019t hike to the falls without picking you a pinecone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d held so much emotion dammed in for so long, but one pinecone, Eddie\u2019s smile, and\u2014God help her\u2014being called a goof when goof was the last thing she was, and she broke. Laughing, crying, smiling, sobbing...she stood in the middle of the woods and completely lost it. Lost it like she\u2019d never lost it in front of anyone before.</p><p>Eddie panicked. \u201cOh, honey, no crying. I hate to see you cry.\u201d He finally crossed the divide, tucking her close, which made her only sob harder.</p><p>She let herself sink into him. \u201cOh, Eddie, I love you, too. I think I\u2019ve probably always loved you, and now I screwed it all up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t screw anything up.\u201d He squeezed her tight. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. Just don\u2019t cry anymore\u2014you\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI keep crying. I can\u2019t stop it. People think I\u2019m a robot, but really I\u2019m just a wreck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNobody thinks you\u2019re a robot.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. She was a teary, shuddering mess. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to rust yourself out,\u201d he said, and she laughed through her tears. He smoothed his hand along her head. \u201cReally, it\u2019s time to come home, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I told them I\u2019d take this stupid job.\u201d She was stuck now. The riptide was tearing her away once again. \u201cI\u2019ve been jerking them around so much, if I don\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll never work in Silicon Valley again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d He pulled away enough to meet her eyes. \u201cHow can I get it in your head that business success isn\u2019t life success?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s security.\u201d She\u2019d spent her whole adult life building up the trappings of security, and she wasn\u2019t ready to part with the idea so easily. \u201cWhat if something happens? You could go away tomorrow. My dad might get sick again. I need to think about those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will happen. I\u2019m not going anywhere. There\u2019s a whole town full of people who love you and will help you. Who want you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the business stuff...I can\u2019t lose that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep managing the lodge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rock at managing the lodge. Look how much it\u2019s turned around in just a short time.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. She\u2019d wanted respect for so many years, and here it was Eddie Jessup who\u2019d been in her corner all along. \u201cSometimes I feel like it\u2019s all I\u2019m good for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u2014he stroked a finger down her cheek\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re good for me. Or you would be if you gave it a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to give it a chance. But you said it yourself...I\u2019m scared to let go.\u201d She stared off at the falls, crashing in the distance. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt so apart from all this. What if you were right about everything\u2014that spreadsheets and numbers are all I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is what you are,\u201d he said, and before she could come up with some other protest, he shut her up with a kiss.</p><p>It felt right. He felt right. He truly saw her and understood, and better, loved her for who she was. They kissed, and her blood sang as some essential part of her recognized that, city or country, being in Eddie\u2019s arms was the only place for her.</p><p>As he pulled away, she slumped with a curse. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>A startled, baffled laugh escaped him. \u201cNot the usual response I get after kissing the ladies.\u201d</p><p>She curled a fist in his shirt. \u201cYou better be done kissing the ladies, Edwin Jessup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am. I swear.\u201d He crossed his heart. \u201cSo then what\u2019s the trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trouble is, I\u2019ve got to go back,\u201d she said. \u201cI have this stupid job now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you have a stupid new job.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a wicked gleam lighting his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep you here. And this new job has benefits unlike anything you\u2019d get in the city.\u201d He cupped her bottom and gave it a suggestive squeeze.</p><p>She gave a little squeal, then swatted him. \u201cBe serious. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely serious. I\u2019m taking over the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She pulled back to get a better look at his expression, because she wasn\u2019t getting it. \u201cWhat about Fairview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew Fairview. I found out about the owls. We\u2019ve stopped the project.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh, Eddie. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I knew you\u2019d scaled back, and so the nests would be fine, but what about your company? What about Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack will be fine. I\u2019m pulling out of Jessup Brothers. Having just one permanent employee will take the heat off, at least until this economy turns around. Meantime, my brother can rely on his usual subs on an as-needed basis.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away completely then. She trusted him\u2014she was ready to make the leap, lose control, take a chance\u2014but Eddie owning a ranch didn\u2019t register. \u201cWhat are you going to do with a ranch?\u201d She guessed she could learn to love...what...cattle? What did people do on ranches?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning it into a camp for at-risk kids.\u201d He let the statement hang long enough for her to parse his meaning.</p><p>It took her a sec, but when she got it, she felt the grin burst across her face. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good, huh?\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I want you with me. I hate all the business stuff, but I thought maybe you\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought maybe I\u2019d...?\u201d She raised her brows, beaming, holding her breath to see how he\u2019d finish.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>She deflated the tiniest bit. Eddie\u2019s expression had turned so serious, she\u2019d thought maybe their conversation was headed in another direction...of the relationship variety. \u201cOh. Sure I can help.\u201d</p><p>She went into autopilot and turned her mind to practical matters. \u201cIf I\u2019m not taking back my other job, they\u2019ll still need me more than ever at the lodge. But I guess with Hope there, we can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course. I assumed you\u2019d need to spend most of your time managing the Big Bear. I just thought you could advise me on the business end of things, you know, as I get it all up and running. I\u2019ll need to establish it as an official nonprofit, all that.\u201d</p><p>A glimmer of sadness came and went. It was time to accept it\u2014she was and always would be spreadsheet girl. And yet it was true consolation to feel how, more than anyone else, Eddie respected her. He valued her opinions and her help...valued her. \u201cI\u2019d love nothing more,\u201d she told him truly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to love it. You just need to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Eddie. I do.\u201d Something deep down unclenched. She might\u2019ve been all business, but Eddie loved her all the same.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s one other thing.\u201d He dropped to his knee.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She\u2019d been right\u2014he had been heading in a relationship direction. But still, she had trouble completely trusting what was happening. She had to be certain, because she was having trouble believing what her eyes were telling her. \u201cSo...you\u2019re not just offering me a job?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, silly.\u201d He twined his hands with hers. \u201cI am offering you something else. Me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, speechless, the emotion threatening to overwhelm her.</p><p>He knelt there for a second, teasing her. \u201cWhat, no crying?\u201d</p> <p>She felt her expression explode into a joyous smile\u2014her heart brimmed with it. As always, Eddie\u2019s easy good humor sent a warm and happy calm spreading through her chest. \u201cGive it a second. The waterworks are on their way.\u201d Deciding it was her turn to get playful, she peered down at him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve yet to hear a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you all my life, Laura Bailey.\u201d He held tightly to her hands, growing more serious than she\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cAnd I do believe I\u2019ve loved you from the start. So what do you say? Make me an honest man? Marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already an honest man, Eddie. The best I\u2019ve ever known. And yes, I\u2019ll marry you. I do believe I\u2019ve been yours all along.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-eight</p><p>Laura pulled into the ranch driveway, and something in her shoulders released. Tension had a way of fading like that whenever her fianc\u00e9 was nearby. It\u2019d been a couple of months since she\u2019d decided to stay\u2014really stay\u2014once and for all, and she was grateful every hour of every day that Eddie Jessup was the sort of man who didn\u2019t give up.</p> <p>It was a gorgeous fall afternoon, the sort of day when the sky was wide and blue, but the air was crisp enough to cool the sun on her shoulders. When she turned off the car, she could hear the classic rock station blasting through her closed windows. She had to smile\u2014it was just that sort of scene, the kind that gave an easy, grinning, sunshine feeling. Like a deep breath in.</p><p>Like her man.</p><p>The Fairview project might\u2019ve been canceled, but the work hadn\u2019t stopped. Eddie continued to renovate the ranch house, only rather than turning it into a resort, it would host his camp for at-risk kids. That\u2019d been his stipulation for not talking to the press about Fox and his antics. The man had known about the nesting area, but it\u2019d been news to the Fairview board of directors, and they weren\u2019t too pleased about being associated with razing threatened wildlife.</p><p>Fox was fired, Fairview made a sizable donation to Eddie\u2019s new nonprofit, and as long as construction remained several hundred feet from the habitat, they were good to go.</p><p>Eddie had a whole crew of volunteers to help him, too. It seemed to her like the place was crawling with Jessups, but notably, Rob Haskell was also helping out, and he often brought Luke, his and Helen\u2019s eldest. They were at the stage in construction that was all final finish work, like painting and installing fixtures, and it was really any day now they\u2019d be done.</p><p>She opened her car door, and their new puppy, Buck, sprang out. \u201cGo get him,\u201d she called. After weeks of cajoling, Eddie had finally dragged her to the pound in Silver City, but she\u2019d been the one who fell in love the moment she saw the rescue pup, a husky mix he liked to call a malamutt.</p> <p>As Buck bounded toward Eddie\u2019s voice, she pulled their lunch from the trunk\u2014a basket of cold fried chicken that Sorrow had helped her assemble from the day\u2019s tavern special. She\u2019d stashed it in the back, having learned the hard way not to leave food unattended for longer than two seconds around the dog, and this would\u2019ve been more temptation than the little guy could\u2019ve handled.</p><p>At the sound of eager barking, Eddie came out onto the porch, and the instant he saw her, a smile burst onto his face. \u201cHey, gorgeous.\u201d He leaned down to scruff Buck\u2019s head but didn\u2019t take his eyes from her. \u201cI\u2019m happy winter\u2019s coming, but I swear, I miss seeing you tromp around here in your short shorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, are you saying you don\u2019t like my jeans?\u201d She twisted backward to get a better look at herself.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m saying I like your legs.\u201d He came up to her and stole a kiss that robbed her reply, which she quickly forgot, anyway.</p><p>She let herself snuggle into him instead, kissing him back, inhaling the scent of Eddie and fresh air and cut wood. \u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>When they parted, he said, \u201cThough I much prefer them naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cYour legs. I prefer them naked. And this, too.\u201d He swept aside her hair to kiss her neck. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He slid his hand up her shirt, and his hand was warm and strong on her belly. \u201cAll of it, actually. I can\u2019t get enough of you, but we need to do something about all these troublesome clothes.\u201d He tugged at her waistband.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she scolded, \u201csomeone will see.\u201d</p><p>He walked backward, pulling her around the side of the house. \u201cThat\u2019s what wraparound porches are for, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He began to kiss her neck, but as he shifted, she glimpsed a suspicious something over his shoulder. She slid a hand between them, planting it on his chest. \u201cEddie, what is that?\u201d She nodded at a pile of lumber in the yard.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d He looked like a kid who\u2019d just stolen some candy. \u201cThat...is a stack of two-by-fours.\u201d</p><p>She wandered to the edge of the porch to get a closer look. A shadow caught her eye, and she glanced up to find that the bones of a strange new structure had appeared in one of the trees. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows, giving her an innocent grin. \u201cTree house?\u201d He wrapped an arm around her and gave her shoulder a little jiggle. \u201cAw, come on, Laura. Kids need tree houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need money. We need more donations before you can be building deluxe tree houses.\u201d She peered closer at it. \u201cIs that going to be two stories?\u201d He really was too much.</p><p>\u201cBut you got us all that furniture,\u201d he said, referring to a donation she\u2019d solicited from a major chain store in Reno\u2014enough metal bunk beds to sleep twenty kids. \u201cIt gave me the idea that maybe we could talk to Up Country about them paying the tax on the lumber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she conceded. \u201cThat is a good idea. I\u2019ll talk to Tom.\u201d She gave him a loving bump with her shoulder. \u201cIn the meantime, you need to stop being such a softie.\u201d</p><p>He took advantage and snagged her close. \u201cAnd you need to stop being so irresistible.\u201d</p><p>She sank into him, and he was half a second away from convincing her that wraparound porches just might in fact be private enough, when a crinkling sound called their attention. It was Buck, trying to nose open their lunch basket.</p><p>Eddie groaned. \u201cI\u2019m thwarted at every turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u2014she plucked up the basket\u2014\u201cget out of there, sneaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you, Buck Larsen probably doesn\u2019t make the best namesake for a dog. He wasn\u2019t exactly the most trustworthy guy.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cIs this where you make a joke about saloon bitches?\u201d Eddie burst out laughing, and she added, \u201cI love when I can make you do that.\u201d She took his hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to their favorite picnic spot, beneath the old beech that housed all those owl nests. After they finished, she leaned against him, feeling sated.</p><p>Even Buck had gotten his fill of chicken scraps and was napping in a patch of sunlight. She watched as the pup twitched and yipped in his sleep, dreaming puppy dreams.</p><p>Eddie followed her line of sight. \u201cLook at those giant paws. He\u2019s going to be a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to build us a tree house just to fit him.\u201d She and Eddie were still moving the last of her stuff into his cabin, and even though she didn\u2019t own much, they were already running out of room.</p><p>\u201cHey, I cleared a spot for that treadmill of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliptical.\u201d She corrected him so much about the thing, it\u2019d become a joke between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s jammed against the western window, but it fits.\u201d He sighed contentedly, leaning against a tree. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll need to build another place soon. To fit all of our kids.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she jostled him with an elbow. \u201cEasy, cowboy. How about one construction project at a time?\u201d</p><p>Then she sighed, too, looking up at the canopy of pine boughs overhead. Not too long ago, she\u2019d thought she was saying good-bye to those trees, and yet here she was.</p><p>They sat for a while, just sharing the quiet, listening to the woods. Being there. Being together.</p><p>After a while, Eddie stretched and inhaled deeply. \u201cI love how fall smells. Do you smell it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI love it, too. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be back for it.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her, asking her earnestly, \u201cAre you happy being here? Being back for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, Eddie. It\u2019s the only place I want to be.\u201d She turned her gaze from him, taking in the land around them. Several yards down, the creek babbled happily, shaded by pines. Winter songbirds chirped and hopped among the branches. A copse of aspen stood out\u2014they were well downstream on the far bank, but their golden autumn leaves popped from the landscape. She felt connected. Contented. Loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, Eddie. I love you. And it\u2019s all good.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
