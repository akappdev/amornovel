She wished it were over\u2014which truly was saying something, since it was her wedding reception.</p><p>Jack leaned closer and whispered, \u201cStop sighing.\u201d</p><p>His warm breath sent goose bumps cascading down the right side of her body. Keely turned her head so his five o\u2019clock shadow scraped her jaw. She closed her eyes and inhaled his familiar scent: cologne, starch on his shirt collar and the underlying hint of his heated flesh.</p><p>Jack Donohue. Her husband. She really and truly was married to this gorgeous, sexy, intense man.</p> <p>Keely sighed again, not out of annoyance, but out of pure pleasure.</p><p>He smiled against her cheek. \u201cNow that\u2019s a sigh I recognize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have different sounding sighs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You make that one in bed after I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBringing up sex when we aren\u2019t having any just makes me cranky, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>His soft chuckle tickled her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. Why aren\u2019t we rolling around in bed nekkid right now?\u201d she demanded in a fierce whisper. \u201cWe are married. Why are we still stuck at the reception? No one would care if we left.\u201d</p><p>He eased back to gaze into her eyes. \u201cAs much as I can\u2019t wait to roll around naked with you, if we skip out early, your dad will kill me, turning you into a widow before you\u2019ve had a chance to be a wife.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped an octave and the possessive rumble vibrated through her in an electric caress. \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly get off on saying my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, Keely McKay Donohue. So go ahead and call me a Neanderthal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would if it meant you\u2019d employ some caveman tactics and drag me off to your cave. Right now?\u201d</p><p>she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The chinking of silverware hitting glassware crescendoed. Knowing what the crowd of family and friends wanted, Keely twined her arms around Jack\u2019s neck and gave him a long, wet, tongue-tangling kiss that probably caused some guests to squirm in their seats. She didn\u2019t give a damn. It was her wedding day.</p><p>If she wanted to make out with her husband, she damn well would.</p><p>When they broke apart, Jack murmured, \u201cTwo more hours and I swear we\u2019re outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d expect nothing less, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going in one hour and fifty-nine minutes?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d for the millionth time. Then his brother Justin snagged his attention and he turned away.</p><p>Sneaky-ass tease. Jack hadn\u2019t told her where they were spending their two-week island honeymoon beyond the cryptic hint that she only needed to pack beachwear\u2014preferably a dozen skimpy bikinis.</p><p>Normally he\u2019d spill his guts if she bribed him with unlimited, no-strings-attached sexual favors. But this time, the stubborn man wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>After the Twin Pines banquet workers cleared the dinner plates, the head table was disassembled to make room for the wedding dance and members of the wedding party were relocated. Which would\u2019ve been fine with her, if she and Jack hadn\u2019t ended up on opposite sides of the dance floor.</p><p>A hard bump connected with her hip as AJ McKay\u2014her best friend, matron of honor and sister-in-law\u2014sidled up beside her. \u201cWhy the frowny face, Mrs. Donohue?\u201d</p><p>She plastered on a fake grin. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s actually worse. What\u2019s up? You seem jumpy.\u201d</p><p>Would she sound like a horny ho-bag if she admitted all she could think about was jumping her husband? Wait. Could she even be a ho-bag if she was obsessed about having nonstop, shake-the-barn-rafters sex with the man she\u2019d just pledged the rest of her life to?</p><p>\u201cGranted, we\u2019re all anxious. It\u2019s been a crazy couple of weeks,\u201d AJ said, breaking Keely\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFour different family members having bouts of false labor during your bridal shower. The bachelorette party. I think Ramona is still hungover.\u201d</p><p>Everyone had been shocked at how tame former wild child Keely McKay\u2019s bachelorette party had played out last weekend. Not a lot of takers for a tequila shooting contest besides her cousin Ramona when the majority of Keely\u2019s sisters-in-law and female family members were knocked up. But truthfully, not reverting to her formerly rowdy ways\u2014even for one night\u2014had been a huge relief.</p><p>Screeching feedback from the microphone distorted the air.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d JC Blackwell said from the stage. \u201cThe band is set up and we\u2019re ready to kick off the weddin\u2019 dance. So can I get Carson and Keely up here? We\u2019ll start out with the father-daughter dance.</p><p>Hey, you know, in all the years I\u2019ve been doin\u2019 this, that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that at a McKay wedding.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rang out as Keely met her father in the center of the dance floor.</p><p>He squinted at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a funny look on your face, girlie. Aw hell, you ain\u2019t gonna cry again, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She playfully tugged on the silky silver handkerchief poking out of the front pocket of his suit. \u201cAt least you\u2019re prepared if I do begin to bawl.\u201d</p><p>He muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t know why I have to wear this fancy-ass piece of crap. It\u2019s worthless.\u201d</p><p>Keely laughed.</p><p>The band started a cover of Kenny Chesney\u2019s \u201cThere Goes My Life\u201d and her dad twirled her around and around the dance floor like he had when she was five years old. She looked at him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Ain\u2019t every day a man gives away his daughter. His only daughter.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. She was trying so hard not to cry. \u201cDaddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dancin\u2019?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cOr talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing. Definitely.\u201d And she let him twirl her all he wanted.</p><p>When the dance ended and he hugged her in such a public display of affection, she knew he\u2019d been hitting the bottle. When he released her and motioned for JC to bring the microphone to him, Keely thought her father might actually be hammered. Her dad. Making a speech. In front of over two hundred people.</p><p>He held her hand and cleared his throat. \u201cThe McKay Ranch had been in existence for over a hundred years when this little gal made an appearance. My brothers and me never considered what havoc this little spitfire would cause in all our lives and our future.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>Keely\u2019s stomach clenched. She desperately wanted Jack by her side as support in case her father\u2019s impromptu speech somehow embarrassed her.</p><p>\u201cOur beautiful Keely was the only girl for a long time. But with the arrival of more darlin\u2019 little girls into the McKay family the last few years,\u201d he winked and waved at his granddaughters, Liesl, Oxsana and Sasha, \u201cme\u2019n my brothers know that times are changin\u2019 and these girls deserve to have an equal part in the McKay Ranch if they choose to.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve restructured the way we\u2019re doin\u2019 things and... Hell, it\u2019ll be easier to show you. Hang on a second.\u201d He released Keely\u2019s hand and rooted in the inside pocket of his suit coat. He held out a folded piece of paper.</p><p>Keely gave him a blank look.</p><p>\u201cGo on, girlie. Open it up.\u201d</p><p>With shaking hands, Keely unfolded the legal document and she scanned the words. She reread it twice before she met her father\u2019s bright eyes. \u201cDaddy, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The McKay Ranch had deeded Keely and Jack Donohue two hundred acres. Beyond shocked, beyond touched, she couldn't utter a single word.</p><p>Carson whirled around, searching the crowd. \u201cDonohue? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Jack stepped forward and wrapped his arm around Keely\u2019s waist before he peered at the document.</p><p>He looked at Keely and then Carson. \u201cWow. That\u2019s very generous. Thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Though, I don\u2019t envy the headaches you\u2019re gonna have building my girl her dream house on that spot she\u2019s always had her eye on. Do you know how many dollhouses she had growin\u2019 up? I can\u2019t count all the hours she spent redecorating them.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>Her father, the comedian. Just when she was afraid he\u2019d keep going, Carson handed the microphone back to JC. He walked straight into the arms of Keely\u2019s mother, who stood on the edge of the dance floor, with damp cheeks and wet eyes.</p><p>JC said, \u201cLet\u2019s give our bride and groom their first dance as husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Jack tucked the paper inside his tux pocket and brought Keely against his body as the band began to play \u201cSo Good in Love\u201d by George Strait.</p><p>Keely clutched him, burying her face in his neck to hide her tears.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say a word. He didn\u2019t have to. He just knew what she needed and gave it to her without question.</p><p>God she loved this man.</p><p>The song ended and another slow one began. She\u2019d specifically requested all slow songs be played first, figuring it\u2019d be the only time she\u2019d get to slow dance with her husband.</p><p>Sure enough, her oldest brother, Cord, tapped Jack on the shoulder during the second song. \u201cMind if I cut in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I mind. Go dance with your own wife, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was...atypical Jack behavior.</p><p>Her next oldest brother, Colby, tried to cut in, and once again, Jack refused.</p><p>Same response when her brother Colt approached them.</p><p>Same response when her brother Cam approached them.</p><p>Same response when her brother Carter approached them.</p><p>Then Jack systematically shot down all eight of her McKay cousins and all eight of her West cousins.</p><p>Puzzled by his hard stance, she whispered, \u201cJack. What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust any of your redneck relatives not to hijack you for that stupid \u2018steal the bride\u2019 tradition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m letting them know the only man stealing you away tonight is me.\u201d His lips brushed her ear. \u201cIn one hour and seventeen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was really sort of sweet. Demented, but sweet.</p><p>Finally Jack relented and let Keely dance with his brother Justin\u2014but only because Jack was dancing right beside them with his mother, Doro, the entire time, watching them like a hawk.</p> <p>His possessive behavior didn\u2019t piss her off like it did when her hard-assed, overprotective brothers and cousins acted the same way. Although outwardly Jack was much more polished than her male relatives, inside, every inch of him screamed primal dominant male. And could she just get a thank you, Jesus for that fact?</p><p>After Justin handed her back to Jack, her nephews and nieces surrounded them, both intrigued and repelled by their ability to get Aunt Keely to kiss Uncle Jack simply by hitting a spoon into a glass.</p><p>She and Jack exited the dance floor and made the rounds together, chatting with wedding guests.</p><p>When Keely glanced at the clock she realized only thirty minutes remained until she and Jack planned to leave.</p><p>Where was he taking her? And why had her matron of honor disappeared?</p> <p>While Jack was engrossed in a conversation with Trevor and Edgard, Keely tired of waiting for AJ to materialize. She palmed the dressing room key and quickly ducked down the hallway out of Jack\u2019s sight.</p><p>Maybe he wouldn\u2019t notice she was gone. Besides, she only needed a minute to ditch the ridiculously puffy underskirt\u2014which was not enough time for any of her brothers to snatch her.</p><p>She unlocked the door to the makeshift dressing room, opening it just far enough to sneak inside. As she quietly shut the door by pressing her palms into it, she heard squeak squeak squeak and then, \u201cYes.</p><p>God, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby doll, give me one more.\u201d</p><p>Squeak squeak squeak.</p> <p>Keely whirled around. Cord had AJ bent over, and her hands gripped the table. His pants were around his ankles and her dress was flipped up her back and... Why in the hell hadn\u2019t they heard her come in?</p><p>The squeak squeak squeak of the table rocking across the floor was only slightly louder than AJ\u2019s moan.</p><p>That was why.</p><p>Keely shrieked and clapped her hand over her eyes before she faced the door again. \u201cOmigod. I did not just see you two boinking like bunnies during my wedding reception!\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>And the silence was worse than the squeaking and moans.</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand, but didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cNot a word, Cord. I\u2019m leaving, but so help me God you two had better finish up fast because I need AJ\u2019s help pronto.\u201d With that, she practically ran out.</p> <p>Big surprise Jack blocked the mouth of the hallway, arms crossed over his chest, one eyebrow raised, wearing his what the fuck? expression.</p><p>Shit. \u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. Right now they want us to cut the cake.\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>Keely took it, allowing him to lead the way to the cake table.</p><p>Photos were snapped. Given their volatile past, everyone seemed disappointed when she and Jack didn\u2019t smear wedding cake all over each other\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d he said, nibbling frosting from her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cOkay. As soon as AJ gets done screwing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Keely looked over at her very mussed, very flushed sister-in-law. Before she shot off a snarky comment like Besides your skirt? Jack spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to leave. Can you tell me where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, that. Umm, it\u2019s at the senior center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze bounced between AJ and Jack. \u201cWhat the hell are you two talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to concern yourself with, sweet wife.\u201d Jack\u2019s smooch on her cheek didn\u2019t mollify her at all.</p><p>Ramona bounded up. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve cut the cake, it\u2019s gotta be close to time to throw the bouquet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Round up all the single ladies. Maybe you could get Justin to help you track down the bachelors for the garter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Jack inserted, \u201cbecause there won\u2019t be a garter toss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keely stared at him with total confusion. \u201cBut that\u2019s tradition! You remove the garter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will be removing the garters, Mrs. Donohue, but not in front of your whole damn family.\u201d</p><p>The set to his jaw indicated this was nonnegotiable.</p><p>Bossy man.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he added in that alpha male tone, which always made her weak-kneed.</p><p>AJ tugged on her arm. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll help you get changed.\u201d</p><p>As they turned the corner and started down the hallway, Keely saw her cousin Brandt McKay in a heated discussion with Jessie McKay, his former sister-in-law. Suddenly, Jessie pulled back and punched Brandt in the stomach hard enough that Brandt bent over to clutch his gut.</p><p>Keely gasped.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s angry gaze zeroed in on Keely and then she glanced at AJ who\u2019d frozen a few steps behind.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo punch Brandt in the stomach? That was an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No. I meant to do that. I didn\u2019t mean to cause a scene and I...really have to wash my hands.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes stayed on Jessie, but Jessie wouldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be too long. I\u2019m about to throw the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>AJ unlocked the door to the dressing room and Keely followed her inside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Jessie just slugged Brandt. What do you think is going on with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try at distracting me, AJ, but I can\u2019t believe you and Cord were having sex in here.\u201d Keely reached under the layers of her wedding gown and yanked off the puffy slip-crinoline that\u2019d started to itch.</p><p>Ah. Much better. \u201cHow is it you get to have sex on my wedding day? And I don\u2019t? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing pregnant makes me horny. Plus Cord looks so damn good in that suit I just wanted him right then and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother just obliged you? During my wedding reception?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHormones and lust are beyond my control, Keely, when it comes to my husband. And he\u2019s always up to the challenge of taking care of my every need.\u201d AJ smoothed her hands over the bulging front of her bridesmaid\u2019s dress and frowned. \u201cGood Lord. How Cord still wants me and sees me as sexy when I look like a beached whale is a miracle.\u201d She caught Keely\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get you outta that wedding dress and into your traveling clothes.\u201d</p><p>Keely stood in front of the antique boudoir mirror, fussing with the lace panel on the bodice as AJ</p><p>began unhooking the hundred or so buttons running down the back of her dress. \u201cDo you know where Jack is taking me for our honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cHow\u2019d you get him to tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered to keep his car hidden so none of your overzealous relatives would decorate it with soap, shaving cream, tin cans and toilet paper,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were just talking about.</p><p>Where I stashed it.\u201d</p><p>AJ played dirty, knowing how much Jack babied that car. But Keely had a trump card. \u201cSo, BFF, seeing you and Cord going at it like teenagers just proves how little alone time you two get these days with two point three kids, so I\u2019ll make you an offer\u2014I\u2019ll baby-sit the boys every Saturday night for a month if you tell me where Jack is whisking me off to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo deal. If Jack finds out I blabbed... Well, he is much scarier than you, Keels.\u201d</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Speak of the devil... Jack sauntered in, and once again Keely marveled at how dangerously sexy he looked in his black tux. Plus, he was sporting that wicked get naked grin that always caused her body to pulse with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job as her matron of honor is to help her out of her wedding dress,\u201d AJ reminded him.</p><p>Keely met Jack\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cJack is very good at getting my clothes off, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare I say...I\u2019m an expert at it?\u201d</p><p>AJ muttered, \u201cAnd...that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock the door and don\u2019t tell anyone where we are for at least ten minutes,\u201d Keely said as AJ fled the room.</p><p>Her body stayed perfectly still as Jack sidled in behind her.</p><p>\u201cOnly ten minutes?\u201d He pressed a soft, warm kiss to her nape. \u201cI should be insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could prove me wrong. I know firsthand that table over there is sturdy enough for whatever you\u2019ve got in mind.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cHow do you know that firsthand?\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cOnly because I walked in on Cord and AJ havin\u2019 a quickie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. However, just to be clear, buttercup, there is no quickie in your immediate future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you in here?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll you want me for is sex. I feel so cheap.\u201d His rough-skinned fingers traced the bare line of her spine down to where the buttons of her dress were undone.</p><p>\u201cI could make you feel used too,\u201d she offered. She felt the fabric shift as Jack loosened her dress. Her skin beaded from his steady, gentle touch.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no. To answer your question, I\u2019m here to give you news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. The bad news is I\u2019m undressing you now. Otherwise, I won\u2019t have a chance to see the very sexy wedding night lingerie you\u2019ve been teasing me with all damn day.\u201d</p><p>Keely stared at his dark head reflected in the mirror. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as soon as you\u2019re changed and done tossing the bouquet, we\u2019ll be hopping in the car and driving to Denver. Our flight leaves at five a.m. So we won\u2019t immediately have a wedding night, rolling around naked in bed, like you\u2019ve been hinting at all damn day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A whine arose but she squashed it. \u201cSo what\u2019s the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise the wait will be worth it when we get to our honeymoon destination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is where?\u201d</p> <p>His mouth grazed her ear as he continued working the buttons. \u201cTahiti.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cTahiti is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I thought you\u2019d like that. Especially since we\u2019ll have two weeks to roll around naked in our private villa.

Tahiti is a little off the grid, so it\u2019ll take about fourteen hours. We should be there in time tomorrow night to see the sunset.\u201d He kissed the side of her neck and murmured huskily, \u201cThat was the last button. Turn around and drop the dress, Keely.\u201d</p> <p>Her blood heated. Her pulse spiked. Her body went wet and soft in places, tight and hard in others.</p><p>Jack could fire her up in no time flat with mere words. But that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d make it easy on him. Or that she wouldn\u2019t use every feminine trick in the book to get him to recant his \u201cno quickie in your immediate future\u201d comment.</p><p>Holding the bodice in place over her chest, she faced him.</p><p>Jack wore the hooded expression that told her he was trying very hard to keep it together and keep his hands off her.</p><p>Ooh. Snapping his control was gonna be so much fun.</p><p>Keely loosely held the dress with her left hand, giving him the occasional glimpse of her cleavage, while her right hand began to remove the bobby pins maintaining her up \u2019do.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettin\u2019 my hair down.\u201d The pins hit the tile floor, one at a time, each with a soft ping. \u201cYou like it when I let loose, don\u2019t you, Jack? And I\u2019ve been coiled so tightly all day.\u201d</p><p>He said not a word, but his hands were clenched into fists at his sides. The muscles in his jaw jumped, as did the muscle in his pants.</p><p>Heh heh.</p><p>After the last pin freed her hair, she sighed as the tresses fell, knowing how Jack loved to wrap those loose waves around his hands as he fucked her. \u201cAh. I needed that. Now. Where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Keely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, you asked me to drop the dress.\u201d She released the heavy weight of the beaded bodice and it gradually slid down her upper torso, briefly clinging to her hips before she slipped it over her thighs to pool around her feet in a pile of satin, chiffon, and lace.</p><p>Not that Jack noticed the crumpled state of her wedding dress. His gaze was firmly glued on her undergarments.</p> <p>Low-cut push-up bra edged in white lace?</p><p>Check.</p><p>Ass-molding boy shorts in white spandex also edged in lace?</p><p>Check.</p><p>Satin and lace garters holding up sheer white stockings?</p><p>Check.</p><p>White satin stiletto peep-toe pumps with delicate ankle straps?</p><p>Check.</p><p>Hungry, possessive look on Jack\u2019s face?</p><p>Check.</p><p>Keely tiptoed over the heap of fabric and stopped, expecting Jack would rush her, pin her to the wall, and do all the raunchy things that were etched on his handsome face.</p><p>But the stubborn man didn\u2019t move.</p><p>So she did. She twirled and gave him her backside, swinging her hair as she threw her arms above her head and gyrated her hips. Then she peered at him over her shoulder and murmured, \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>And...he was done for.</p><p>Jack\u2019s growl was her only warning before he was on her. Spinning her into his arms, smashing her mouth beneath his, kissing her frantically, one hand twisted in her hair, the other clamped on her butt.</p><p>Keely wasn\u2019t too far gone with lust not to release a little chuckle of superiority that Jack\u2019s resistance had vanished so fast upon seeing her peep-show.</p><p>He herded her until the backs of her thighs hit the table ledge. Without missing a beat, Jack lifted her, positioning himself between her legs, continuing to gift her with the soul kisses she craved.</p><p>After he\u2019d gotten her worked up to the point she writhed against him, he trailed his lips to her ear.</p><p>\u201cSuch a cocktease you are, wife. You are going to pay for that little display. Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater? Not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jack nuzzled her temple. Then his mouth followed the curve of her cheek to the corner of her smile. Keeping his eyes on hers, he lightly sank his teeth into her bottom lip before continuing the hot, wet, openmouthed kisses down the column of her throat.</p><p>Keely moaned, tempted to let her head fall back, close her eyes and lose herself in the mind-boggling way this man made her feel. But she kept her eyes on Jack as he conducted his sensual blitz. When he looked at her, a hint of devilry glinting in his eyes, she shivered.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he murmured as his tongue traced the lace band of her bra down the valley of her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cYes. You should do the gentlemanly thing and take your clothes off to use your body heat to keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against the upper swell of her breast. But he didn\u2019t dally. That oh-so-talented mouth progressed southward, slower than she liked, but chances were high they both had the same end point in mind.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Keely\u2019s breath stalled when his hands gripped the tops of her legs and spread her thighs wider. She squirmed when Jack\u2019s tongue traced the McKay cattle brand tattooed on her hip.</p><p>And she flat out whined when he retreated.</p><p>\u201cBetter grow some patience, cowgirl. You\u2019re going to need it.\u201d He grabbed her right ankle, leisurely unbuckled the rhinestone strap and threw her shoe behind him.</p><p>She laughed. The man surprised her on so many levels. She knew a lifetime wouldn\u2019t be enough to learn everything that made him tick. \u201cJack. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something to say back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lifted her left ankle and removed that shoe in the same manner. He stepped just out of her reach and said huskily, \u201cUnhook the stockings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d That wasn\u2019t what she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t that your job?\u201d she cooed. \u201cDivesting me of all my apparel?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head, but his gaze remained on the satin bridal garter, centered mid-thigh, below the band of the stocking. \u201cUnfasten them, but leave the stockings and the garters on.\u201d</p><p>Damn man was taking all the fun out of it...or was he? Keely crooked her finger. \u201cI need to borrow your big, strong body to support myself so I don\u2019t faint dead away with all the unbridled lust you bring out in me, husband.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLaying it on a little thick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d but he edged forward.</p><p>Keely gently set her foot on his crotch. Not as unaffected as he projected; he was totally hard. \u201cTalk about thick.\u201d She smirked when he growled again, but she noticed he didn\u2019t even attempt to move her foot.</p><p>She popped the buttons, moving the bridal garter up over the top of the stretchy band of the stocking, and slid her stocking-clad foot up and down his erection before she switched sides.</p><p>Once the stockings were loose, Jack leaned in and kissed her. A teasing brush of his lips. A fleeting nibble of his mouth on hers as his fingers inched up her thigh in a whisper-light touch across her trembling skin. When he reached the top of the stocking, he inserted his finger inside and slowly, slowly, slowly dragged it down the length of her leg.</p><p>Keely\u2019s whole body was quivering. Tingling even. And he hadn\u2019t even started working his magic touch on all her other special tingly parts. \u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her protest disappeared in his intense kiss.</p><p>Jack removed the other stocking with the same painstaking precision, with such drawn out eroticism, she whimpered.</p><p>He laughed and dropped to his knees.</p><p>Oh hell yeah. Now we\u2019re talkin\u2019.</p><p>His mouth meandered up the inside of her thigh, the tantalizing touch of his hot breath, wet tongue, moist lips and the scrape of his five o\u2019clock shadow was almost too much to bear. He latched onto the bridal garter with his teeth, snapped it once, and tugged it down her leg.</p><p>Okay, this garter removal business was much better in private.</p><p>One down, one to go.</p><p>She expected he\u2019d torment her mercilessly on the other leg before pressing his mouth to her damp panties and giving her what she really wanted.</p><p>But Jack just tugged the other bridal garter off and rolled to his feet. \u201cDone. Now get dressed so we can hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Were you expecting we\u2019d go at it right here, right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Wasn\u2019t that the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll admit I was considering throwing you a bone after the striptease, but you were so cocksure I had no control\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrowing me a bone?\u201d she repeated. \u201cAre you tryin\u2019 to piss me off, Jack?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cOn our wedding day? Not likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPin you down on the table or on the tile floor or against the wall and screw you blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad, because it doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 all puritan on me now that we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, but I don\u2019t want fast and dirty the first time we make love as husband and wife, okay? I want to take my time with you. I want it slow.\u201d</p><p>Keely stared at him for a few seconds, thrown by his PC reference to sex. \u201cMy God, GQ, sometimes you are such a girl.\u201d</p><p>There. That oughta goad him into proving his masculinity. Right now.</p><p>Probably twice.</p><p>But he laughed\u2014a bit meanly. \u201cNice try. But I will not fuck you until we\u2019re alone, in a room with a huge bed, with the surf pounding in our ears and zero chance we\u2019ll be interrupted by any of your two million family members.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cAnd that, my sweet, sexy, horny wife, is a promise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPromises are meant to be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this one.\u201d</p><p>A challenge? She loved a challenge. Keely would do everything in her power to make him eat his words\u2014preferably while he was eating her.</p> <p>Smirking, she tucked the garter in the front pocket of his tux jacket. \u201cIf you change your mind, all you\u2019ve gotta do is wave the white garter and surrender to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Now scram so I can get dressed and we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later Jack was this goddamn close to saying fuck it, pulling off to the side of the road in nowhere Wyoming and fucking Keely until she couldn\u2019t walk.</p><p>It figured his ornery cowgirl couldn\u2019t just sit back and accept that he wanted to wait. No, she\u2019d decided to turn it into a game of make Jack sweat. Within ten miles of driving away from the wedding reception, she\u2019d offered to give him a handjob.</p> <p>He\u2019d declined.</p><p>Then she\u2019d offered to give him a blowjob.</p><p>He\u2019d declined.</p><p>Then she\u2019d asked if he minded if she took the edge off herself by masturbating.</p><p>He minded. A lot. He said as much.</p><p>But she\u2019d just laughed, slipped her fingers beneath her sundress and proceeded to get herself off.</p> <p>Twice.</p><p>God. If he didn\u2019t have any willpower now, how was he supposed to survive the next eleven hours?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>As if the vixen didn\u2019t know. \u201cHow absolutely exquisite you looked today. How lucky I am. How happy I am that you married me.\u201d Jack lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d She opened her mouth and he warned, \u201cBesides sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about my dad\u2019s wedding gift. It was a shock.\u201d Her frown morphed into a sneaky smile that never boded well for him. \u201cBut then again, he did give us the section of land that\u2019s closest to their house.\u201d</p><p>Jack groaned. \u201cI knew there had to be a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be handy to have Grandpa and Gran-gran so close when we have kids.\u201d She paused. \u201cHow many times did you get asked during the reception when we\u2019re gonna start a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost track after seventy.\u201d</p> <p>Keely laughed. \u201cI rather liked seein\u2019 you skirting the issue, Jack. But as long as we\u2019ve got time to kill, maybe we ought talk about kidlets. Since it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t discussed.\u201d</p><p>The last two months since they\u2019d set the wedding date had been a whirlwind. Opening Keely\u2019s clinic, setting up his office space in her building, meeting with his clients across the country to explain he was only changing his physical address, not the nature of his consulting business. He and Keely had been apart more than either of them liked, which was why they needed these two weeks alone.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019ll want seven kids.\u201d</p><p>He nearly wrecked the car, his head whipped around so fast. \u201cSeven? Are you fucking serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019s only one more than Cam and Domini have, and they\u2019re doin\u2019 fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir house and their lives are a goddamn zoo, Keely.\u201d When she smirked, he realized he\u2019d been had. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do think we could handle six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. How many do you want?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo? That\u2019s it? I already feel bad for our two poor babies, practically raised alone.\u201d She made the most pitiful-sounding sigh.</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes. \u201cLast time I checked there were almost twenty-seven McKay and West cousins for Jack Junior and Little Keely to play with. That\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Five kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I\u2019d agree to three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Four ankle biters sounded good to him, but he had to keep some negotiating power with his wife.</p><p>His wife who\u2019d gotten very quiet all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cKeely? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened around his. \u201cJust thinking. As much as I wanna have a ton of kids with you, not right away, okay? I want you all to myself for a while first.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s sweetness always surprised him, always moved him, always humbled him. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I definitely think we should get lots of baby-making practice in. Starting now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to give this up, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will gladly give in to you as soon as we hit the villa. Until then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then you\u2019re giving me an excuse to relive my most memorable sexual encounters. Great idea.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes took on an unholy gleam before she looked away.</p><p>The car went silent. Except for her occasional sighs.</p><p>Sighs he recognized.</p><p>This was driving him fucking insane. Which sexual encounters was she reliving? She\u2019d better not be thinking about any man other than him. Ever.</p><p>\u201cYou do make such a sexy sounding rumble when you\u2019re jealous, Jack. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d His hands tightened on the steering wheel. \u201cFuck that. I\u2019m not cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. You\u2019re definitely too hot to merely be cute.\u201d Keely peeled his fingers free from the steering wheel and clasped his hand in hers, setting their joined hands on her lap. \u201cAnd so you know, husband, I was thinking of you, because I completely forgot every man after the first time you touched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a silver-tongued cowgirl.\u201d Jack relaxed because she knew just how to soothe him. \u201cWhat memory were you reliving?\u201d So much for his insistence they forgo discussions about sex.</p><p>\u201cThe one after our fake engagement party. When you just...\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou rocked my world, GQ.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a hard and fast encounter, as they\u2019d both been drunk on the lust that\u2019d shimmered between them for eleven years. Lust that\u2019d finally hit the boiling point. He\u2019d taken her on the floor of her apartment, which yeah, the I-need-you-right-fucking-now feeling was hot as hell, pinning her to the carpet and fucking her brains out. Although, he still held some regret that\u2019s how their first time together had played out.</p><p>Is that why you\u2019re so insistent on doing this differently?</p><p>\u201cAnd then I got to thinking about how we christened my office at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>An image of Keely, stripped naked and spread out on the top of her desk, flashed in his mind. That\u2019d been a hot tryst, mostly because it was so unexpected. His cowgirl certainly liked to mix things up. He murmured, \u201cAnd then we christened my office.\u201d As soon as they\u2019d caught their breath, she\u2019d crooked her finger and led them to his office, where she\u2019d draped herself over his drafting table and he\u2019d nailed her from behind. Then they\u2019d gone at it in the conference room.</p><p>Dammit. Now he was getting hard.</p><p>He glanced at her and realized while he\u2019d been reliving the Jack and Keely sex show, she\u2019d dropped their joined hands between her legs and was covertly rubbing his hand right where she wanted it. He stiffened his fingers and slid them free of her grasp. \u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we were sharing, Jack. Connecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are trying to connect my fingers with something, all right,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Keely let loose the deep throaty laughter that made him think of slamming body parts and sweat-soaked sheets.</p><p>Damn her. He was still getting hard.</p><p>\u201cBut you know which one of our many, many, many, many times of getting down and dirty sticks out in my mind?\u201d</p><p>Jack had gotten stuck on the many, many, many, many times portion of her question. \u201cAh. No, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me. In detail. In explicit detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month. When you\u2019d been gone for three weeks. I heard you running up the stairs to the apartment. You dropped everything you were carrying in front of the door and kissed me, such a deliciously long, slow kiss. Then you whispered, \u2018I love you\u2019 and took me to bed. And we stayed in bed the entire day. Twenty-four whole hours of mad, passionate love, wrapped together, napping, only to wake up and go at it again. It was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It was amazing.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, which surprised him. But he didn\u2019t push it. Then she said, \u201cLemme see your left hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just have this need to look at your wedding band, so I know this isn\u2019t some kind of dream and we really are married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems surreal, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jack held his hand across the console.</p><p>Keely turned the ring on his finger. \u201cWill it take some time for you to get used to wearing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already used to it. It\u2019s never coming off.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSo you like it?\u201d</p><p>That she\u2019d managed to keep the design and style of his wedding band a secret from him was a miracle for her, his little hater of secrets. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might bother you I didn\u2019t try to match them.\u201d</p><p>The wide band wasn\u2019t too feminine or too plain. It wasn\u2019t white gold like hers, but platinum. \u201cKeely. I love it. It shows how different we are but how well we fit together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s thumb swept across her new wedding band, comprised of diamonds and sapphires, nestled beneath her eleven-karat diamond engagement ring. \u201cDo you like yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really flashy, so of course I adore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sapphires reminded me of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a flatterer, but don\u2019t stop. You could start talking about my other physical attributes. I could strip nekkid if you need a reminder of what my body looks like without such constricting clothing.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>Comfortable silence fell between them for several miles. Then she yawned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, go ahead and sleep.

There goes my plan to carry you over the threshold and ravish you in your former bachelor pad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be plenty of time for ravishment in Tahiti.\u201d He kissed the back of her hand again. \u201cGet some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to change your mind about doing the nasty with me as soon as possible if I\u2019m snoring?\u201d She dropped his hand and turned in her seat to run her fingers through his hair. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk about all the places I\u2019m gonna try and seduce you before our toes hit the sand.\u201d</p><p>Jack said, \u201cNot a good idea,\u201d even as his cock pressed against his zipper, arguing it was the greatest idea in the history of the world.</p><p>This was going to be a long drive.</p> <p>Six hours later Jack was this goddamn close to saying fuck it, pulling Keely into the bathroom in the first class section of the airplane and fucking her until she couldn\u2019t walk.</p><p>Within ten minutes of passing through security at the Denver airport, she\u2019d suggested they test out the private rooms in the VIP lounge.</p><p>He\u2019d declined.</p><p>Then she\u2019d suggested they hook up in one of the family-friendly bathrooms in preparation for joining the mile-high club on the flight to LA.</p><p>He\u2019d declined.</p><p>It appeared she\u2019d given up seducing him during the flight to LA, until they reached LAX and she\u2019d started in again.</p> <p>Within ten minutes of reaching their gate, she\u2019d begun whispering her fantasies, which seemed to include a lot of lube and different kinds of rope.</p><p>But by the time they\u2019d settled in for the final flight to the island, Keely\u2019s eyes were drooping. Her raunchy sexual suggestions had tapered off, focusing on soft pillows and cool sheets rather than vibrating marital aids and zero inhibitions.</p><p>As soon as they were airborne, she\u2019d curled her body into his and had fallen fast asleep.</p><p>And in that moment, when it was just the two of them, snuggled together forty thousand feet in the air, Jack finally felt like they were married. That she belonged to him and he to her.</p><p>The vows and the ceremony and the exchange of rings and the reception had been great and all...yet, he\u2019d never understood before that the wedding had been for their family and friends\u2014public proof of their commitment to each other.</p><p>So in Jack\u2019s mind, the honeymoon was the place to offer his private commitment to Keely. To look her in the eye, with no interruptions and no distractions, and let her know that he planned on loving her every day for the rest of his life.</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d been so adamant about them waiting to make love\u2014because they\u2019d never get another first time as husband and wife and he wanted it to be meaningful. Special. Maybe even magical.</p><p>You\u2019re such a girl, GQ.</p> <p>But now he was worried. Had he built up the union of bodies, spirits and lives to the point it\u2019d be a big let down for them both?</p><p>Probably. He was prone to analyze stuff to death. Nothing he could do about it now\u2014he\u2019d begun to regret taking such a rigid stance. He\u2019d make it up to her. Jack rested his chin on the top of Keely\u2019s head, losing himself in the sweet lilac scent of her hair and drifted off.</p><p>They were both groggy when the plane finally landed.</p><p>The heat and the confusion about transportation made them both cranky. Rather than snipe at each other, they stayed quiet, lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>As soon as they reached the patio of the private villa, Jack pulled her into his arms and whispered,</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here. You know what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d He expected she\u2019d laugh the sultry sound that always made him hard, and drag him inside with a cheeky, Let the rolling around nekkid begin. He didn\u2019t expect her to disentangle from his arms and step back. Way back.</p><p>\u201cThat means we\u2019re at the beach, Einstein.\u201d</p><p>Jack squinted at her. Dammit. Sarcastic, lashing out Keely stood in front of him, which meant he\u2019d somehow hurt her feelings.</p><p>Gee, ya think? You totally fucked yourself with your sexy wife, my friend, and not in a good way.</p><p>He had to figure out what to do, and fast. Charming his way back into her good graces, warred with his male instinct to just fuck his way back into her good graces. Maybe a combination of both would work?</p><p>He grinned, stepped forward and took her hand, kissing the knuckle above her wedding ring. \u201cI know it\u2019s been a long day. But if you can give me ten minutes\u2014\u201d</p><p>Once again she retreated. \u201cTake as long as you want. In fact, take all night. There\u2019s no hurry, right?</p><p>We\u2019ve got two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I would just strip right here, right now, and wait for you to take me by the hand so you could make sweet, sweet love to me on a bed of fucking rose petals? Wrong, bucko. I wouldn\u2019t have sex with you right now if you begged me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I feel a headache coming on. A bad one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I have to wash my hair.\u201d She started humming \u201cWash That Man Right Outta My Hair\u201d</p><p>from South Pacific.</p><p>Sometimes she was such a pain in the ass. \u201cI swear to God if this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just too damn tired. It\u2019ll probably take me a couple of days to catch up on my sleep, bein\u2019s I\u2019m jetlagged and all. Days, husband, in which you can do anything you want...with the exception of one thing.\u201d</p><p>Oh no, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Oh yes, she would. With absolute glee.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI hear the fishing is good this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Do not yell at her on your wedding day.</p><p>Jack was trying to keep his cool, when he remembered something. He casually reached into his pants pocket, pulled out the white garter and waved it at her.</p><p>Keely looked at it, then at him, and laughed. Laughed. She said, \u201cNice try,\u201d and sauntered off toward the beach.</p><p>There was some serious groveling in his immediate future. Now he really had to set the stage, and prove to her...what?</p><p>Hell if he knew. But he\u2019d gone this far; he couldn\u2019t back down or chicken out now.</p><p>Jack dragged the two hundred suitcases into the main living area. He barely gave the space a second glance as he booked it to the massive master bedroom to make sure his specific requests had been filled.</p><p>Bouquets of fragrant flowers.</p><p>Check.</p><p>Dozens of candles.</p><p>Check.</p><p>Four bottles of champagne.</p><p>Check.</p><p>Chocolate and raspberry sauce.</p><p>Check.</p><p>Silken scarves.</p><p>Check.</p><p>Batteries.</p><p>Check.</p><p>He stared at the set-up until frustration set in. He was a goddamn engineer, for fuck\u2019s sake. He sucked at this stuff. But this was the exact romantic scenario he\u2019d envisioned and it\u2019d been perfectly executed. So why did it look...wrong?</p><p>Because Keely isn\u2019t here. Why in the hell did you think she would want this anyway?</p><p>When had he stopped taking into account what she wanted?</p><p>Jesus. He was a fucking moron.</p><p>He swallowed his pride and tracked her down. And for a minute, he just stopped and stared at the woman he\u2019d married.</p><p>What a magnificent picture she was, standing barefoot at the edge of the ocean, wind blowing through her glossy dark hair as the last rays of sunlight danced across her skin, bathing her in a golden glow.</p><p>Luckily she didn\u2019t jerk away when he touched her. She murmured, \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunning. And the scenery ain\u2019t bad either.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into his chest and sighed.</p><p>They remained locked together, waves lapping at their bare feet, gazing across the horizon until the sun disappeared and darkness surrounded them.</p><p>Finally she turned and gazed at him with those sapphire eyes that seemed to have a direct conduit to his soul.</p><p>All Jack\u2019s thoughts, fears, plans, and words of devotion vanished. So he said the first thing that popped into his head. \u201cKeely. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>He supposed he deserved that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you think it\u2019s lame that I wanted to wait to make love to you in such a...traditional way, when we\u2019ve already had sex in every conceivable position and in some pretty inconceivable locations. I thought I\u2019d try to be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? High-handed? Showing me who\u2019s boss in our marriage from the get-go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to give you romance.\u201d He tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou deserve that on your wedding night.\u201d</p><p>She drilled him in the chest with her finger. \u201cNo, Jack-ass, I deserve a say in what happens on our wedding night. You don\u2019t get to make a decision and just expect me to fall in line with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His capitulation seemed to surprise her and her smartass comment, \u201cYou were fully aware I\u2019m not a shrinking violet\u2014\u201d ended abruptly. She said, \u201cOh. Well. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I forgiven for being a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But you have to make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want. Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappily for you, GQ, I\u2019m all in for making love to my husband, in a big, soft bed, with the sounds of the surf pounding in the background and no interruptions.\u201d She poked him in the chest again. \u201cYou dodged a bullet this time. Next time I won\u2019t be so accommodating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted.\u201d</p><p>Keely stared at him thoughtfully again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d love you more if you gave me silk sheets, flowers and candlelight?\u201d</p><p>He honestly didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cJack. You already gave me your heart. That\u2019s all I ever wanted. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>Might make him a pussy, but he felt tears spring to his eyes. He could barely choke out, \u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLucky thing you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Keely stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. \u201cNow will you please take me to bed? I\u2019ve heard married sex is pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Jack swept her into his arms and started toward the villa. But he didn\u2019t make it far before he stopped and set her back on her feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christsake, Jack, what now?\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth on her ear, loving how it always caused her to tremble. Loving her whimpering sigh.</p><p>\u201cEver rolled around naked on a beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a first for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be pretty goddamned romantic.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other. Grinned at each other.</p><p>Keely said, \u201cFirst one undressed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGets to be on top,\u201d Jack finished as she started stripping.</p><p>\u201cAnd also gets to decide if it\u2019s hard and fast or slow and sweet,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Keely won. She had less clothing on than he did. But truthfully, the first rays of moonlight reflecting off all her mouthwatering curves distracted him.</p><p>That, and the fact she still wore that sexy white wedding lingerie beneath her sundress.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>She tackled him. Pinned him. Kissed him. Owned him completely. And when they were joined in body, as well as in their hearts, Jack knew this woman would give him the ride of his life. </p> </body></html>"]
