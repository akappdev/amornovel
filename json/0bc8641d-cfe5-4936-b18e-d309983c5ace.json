Permanent ones left by Lilith herself.They burned and tingled as he approached the entrance to the interior chamber. The throbbing never fully went away, but there were times when it ebbed enough that he could forget about the fact that he was permanently linked to the vampire queen.</p> <p>The back of his neck felt as though a brick of ice rested on it; but it was not because of the winter that blustered outside of the stone-cut chambers in the mountain. The howling winds and blinding snow that came much too early and stayed too long in these Romanian mountains had nothing to do with the chill that burned his neck, and everything to do with the fact that there were vampires nearby. As he was a Venator, it was his way of sensing the presence of the undead.</p><p>Coming here was foolish and brazen. Max was never foolish, although he had his brazen moments. But after what he\u2019d been through in the last months, he was willing to accept the consequences of this visit. Even if it resulted in his death, he chanced it\u2014because it could also result in his freedom.</p><p>The only reason he\u2019d made it so far into the bowels of Lilith\u2019s refuge was the fact that he bore her markings. Her branding of him was an obscene protection from the undead that guarded her compound.</p><p>Max passed yet another of Lilith\u2019s Guardian vampires, ones that had eyes that burned pale ruby and fangs that released a strong poison at will. She opened the heavy wooden door to Lilith\u2019s private chamber and stepped back to allow him in.</p><p>\u201cMaximilian.\u201d Lilith\u2019s voice was a purr, and her red-ringed blue eyes were avid as she cast her gaze over him. \u201cI believe this is the first time you have ever come to me of your own accord. What a pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Carved in the deepest part of the mountain, Lilith\u2019s sanctuary was as far as possible from the sunlight that would peel the skin from her body. Its interior was otherwise like any well-appointed house in the civilized world of London, Rome, or Budapest, with the exception of its lack of windows.</p><p>Comfortable furnishings were arranged throughout the large, high-ceilinged room. Tables held lamps and sheafs of parchment; settees were covered with thick pillows and cushions. Thick Persian rugs warmed the cold stone floor. A large tapestry hung on the wall depicted the immortalization of Judas Iscariot, the first true vampire. Another showed him slaying the first vampire hunter, Gardeleus the Venator.</p><p>That was the first time a vampire had killed a Venator, and, Max thought grimly, it had not been the last. Fortunately there had been other vampire hunters born from Gardeleus\u2019s blood over the ages\u2014arising randomly from far-flung branches of the family tree. And then there had been a very few\u2014like Max himself\u2014who were not of Gardella blood, but had chosen the path of a vampire slayer and had passed the life-or-death test that allowed them to wear the holy empowering amulet of the Venators, the vis bulla.</p><p>Nor were Venators protected from being turned by a vampire, although the power of the vis bulla made it more difficult for the vampire\u2019s blood to take hold in the Venator and to make one undead. Max had always felt that Gardeleus\u2019s fate of death was preferable to being turned into a vampire.</p><p>The chamber was warm, and the lighting burned low. A massive blaze roared in the fireplace, taking up the entirety of one long wall and casting black and red shadows into the room.</p><p>Lilith herself was arranged casually on a long chaise, her filmy ice-blue gown draping from her hip to the floor, leaving her white feet and arms bare. Her red hair, so shiny and bright that it appeared to burn, poured over her fair skin in sensual coils that reminded Max of the locks of a copper-haired Medusa. Although she had been on the earth for more than a millennium, Lilith had the beautiful elfin face of a thirty-year-old, and a body that matched. Her pose appeared nonchalant, but a fleeting glance at her dangerous eyes told Max a different story.</p> <p>He was glad for at least the advantage of surprise.</p><p>The doors closed behind him, and he stopped in the center of the room. Wanting to keep what little leverage he had, he waited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead,\u201d Lilith said after the silence stretched. She followed suit and arched her long, lithe body as she drew herself into a seated position. One of control.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re aware that I\u2019ve destroyed Akvan\u2019s Obelisk. That I\u2019ve kept my part of our agreement to stop your son, Nedas, from using its power.\u201d Lilith had raised Nedas, who was the son of one of her consorts from the tenth century, from an infant, and had turned him to an undead when he was twenty.</p><p>She smiled. Her upper fangs glinted. \u201cSo that is why you have come.\u201d</p><p>Now she stood and moved toward him, bringing with her a renewed burning in the bites on his neck and the scent of roses. Max felt her presence as it seeped into him, cloying and close, and noticed the way his breathing became...heavier...controlled.</p><p>Although he kept his eyes averted from hers, he felt the first hint of a muscle tremor deep beneath his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to release me from your thrall if I succeeded.\u201d He drew in his breath slowly, keeping it steady with effort. \u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me to.\u201d</p> <p>Lilith tilted her head, turning her face away while keeping her gaze on him in a sly manner. \u201cOn the contrary, Maximilian. I was certain that you would succeed. I had no doubts. After all\u201d\u2014she reached for him, brushing her long-nailed finger along one of his cheekbones\u2014\u201cthose very characteristics attract me to you. Your strength, your determination, and your integrity.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t flinch as the nail, death-sharp, cut a thin line into his skin. His heartbeat was still his own, and though his throat was dry, he was still steady. He wanted to step away, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019d faced Lilith before; he\u2019d face her this time.</p><p>Now her hand had come to rest on one side of his chest, and they stood face-to-face, the vampire as tall as he, the weight of her hand burning through his shirtwaist. \u201cAlong with...this...\u201d she added, smoothing her palm over his firm pectoral. With her touch came the strength of her thrall, battling to capture his breathing, the race of his heart, the surge in his veins. His desire.</p><p>\u201cWill you not keep your word and release me?\u201d Max closed his eyes. He knew it had been foolish to come here, but he\u2019d been willing to try. He had little to lose. He\u2019d even told Victoria he never believed Lilith would release him.</p><p>Both of her hands were on him now, flat palmed, sliding up and over his shoulders to cup the bare skin of his neck. Max felt the tiny, warm drip of blood from his cheek where she\u2019d cut him, and the unbearable closeness when she leaned forward and pressed an openmouthed kiss to the edge of his jaw, over the trickle of blood.</p><p>The flood of sensation staggered him. Her lips\u2014one cool and firm, the other warm and soft\u2014bussing against his skin set his fingers to trembling against the sides of his trousers. Her teeth were slick and smooth as they slid against his jaw, ending in a tiny nibble. His breath caught, and he drew it in sharply, deeply, and felt the beginnings of response simmering low inside him, behind the weakness in his knees, and his lips parted with a soft puff of air.</p><p>When she kissed him he tasted his own blood, and he kissed her back, unwillingly, yet willingly.</p><p>Then through the haze of desire that pummeled him, Max remembered who he still was, and managed to slide his hand up between them, brushing against her breasts as they pressed against his shirt. He tore at its ties and at last closed his fingers over the tiny silver cross that hung from his areola.</p><p>Strength from the vis bulla surged through him, and he drew in his first clear breath since she\u2019d stepped near him. He pulled his face away as she realized what had happened and stepped back. Her fingers tore at his shirt, pulling it open, and with a shriek of surprise, she jerked away.</p><p>\u201cSo you have come armed.\u201d At first she could not look at him, could not look at the large silver cross that hung on a heavy chain around his neck. Hidden beneath his shirt, it was the only weapon he\u2019d been able to bring into her presence aside from the tiny vis bulla. It wasn\u2019t as effective as an ash stake, but it had produced the effect he\u2019d desired.</p><p>\u201cI am not so foolish as to come to you unprepared,\u201d Max replied, his voice easier now, although his blood still leaped and his chest was tight. \u201cA stake would have been preferable, but your Guardians would not allow me to pass with one. I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would expect nothing less from you, Maximilian.\u201d She kept her distance, kept her eyes slightly averted, but was not the crumpled heap of weakness a lesser vampire would have been. The surprise had sent her spinning away, but the mere vision of the cross was not enough to frighten a vampire of her caliber for long. As one\u2019s eyes became used to sudden light in darkness, so would she soon be able to look at him again.</p><p>But the large cross would keep her from touching him\u2014or touching him much. And the delicate silver vis bulla\u2014blessed with holy water and forged of silver from the Holy Land\u2014gave him his Venator speed, strength, and fast-healing capabilities. But neither would damage Lilith in any other way.</p><p>Now, as she looked at him again, her eyes narrowed and seemed to focus on his half-bare chest. \u201cThat is not your vis bulla,\u201d she said suddenly, her eyes widening.</p><p>Max looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou are surprised that I would have noticed. Why should you be, Maximilian? I notice everything about you.\u201d The purr was back in her voice again, and despite the hand-size cross hanging there, she stepped toward him. \u201cThis one is different. It is smaller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no less powerful.\u201d It was true. He\u2019d given his vis bulla to Victoria, then walked away from her on the streets of Roma a month ago. And later, when he\u2019d decided to make this mad trip, he\u2019d replaced it with this one, one that did not belong to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I would expect not. But still.\u201d Her eyes narrowed again, and she tried again to catch his gaze, but he would not play. \u201cNot dead, and wearing someone else\u2019s vis bulla,\u201d Lilith mused. \u201cAnd demanding that I comply with your wishes. Maximilian, you absolutely fascinate me. Are you quite certain you do not wish to remain here with me? Forever?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have no wish for immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Long ago.\u201d There was no glossing over it. Max had learned to live with his choices.</p> <p>\u201cNot that long ago. Merely fifteen, perhaps sixteen years ago. And this last year you spent living among the members of the Tutela did not raise that desire in you again?\u201d</p><p>The mark of the Tutela had first been burned into the back of his shoulder when he was a young, naive man of sixteen and had foolishly joined them and their cause: to protect and serve the vampires in the hopes of attaining immortality and power. Now the tattoo of the writhing dog\u2014for that was really what the Tutela were: mortals who acted as bitches and whores for the undead\u2014seemed to itch on his skin.</p><p>This last year when he\u2019d lived among the Tutela again had been Hell on earth. Max had had to pretend not only to be one of them, desiring power and immortality while bowing and scraping to the vampire Nedas, but he had also carried on the charade of being engaged to Sarafina, the daughter of Conte Regalado, who had been the mortal leader of the Tutela.</p><p>He replied to Lilith, \u201cI did what you asked because of your promise to release me if I succeeded with the task you set me to. Now I am here to collect on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the woman you love? You left her?\u201d</p> <p>Max lifted an eyebrow in question, but did not speak.</p><p>\u201cThe girl you were to marry? Shall I be jealous of her? Is that why you wish to be released?\u201d</p><p>His breathing smoothed. \u201cI would not expect you to be jealous of a mere mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father is a vampire now, and he might well sire her in his footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will be young and weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Lilith looked at him, reached out her hand to touch his arm. \u201cI cannot let you go, Maximilian, my Venator pet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lied, then.\u201d He\u2019d known it, known she would not release him. \u201cI did your bidding and you never intended to do as you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, now, Maximilian. You are fully aware that the secrets I gave you, the knowledge you had that enabled you to see to the destruction of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk, were just as much to your benefit\u2014and that of your race\u2014as they were to mine. I would not say you have come out of this so very badly.\u201d</p><p>Black bile burned the back of his throat. Oh, but what he had been forced to do to carry out Lilith\u2019s desires and to save Roma\u2014and the world\u2014from the malevolent power of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk...executing Eustacia, accepting her willing sacrifice by swinging the sword himself in the presence of Nedas. It had been the only way to prove his loyalty to the Tutela, the only way to get close enough to destroy the obelisk.</p><p>And Victoria. She\u2019d seen it happen. She\u2019d never forgive him.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d done the right thing, the only thing...but it had been repugnant. Heartbreaking.</p><p>And that was why he\u2019d removed his vis bulla, walked away from Victoria and the rest of the Venators...and why he\u2019d been reckless enough to come here.</p><p>A hero he\u2019d been, true, but a repulsive one at that.</p><p>\u201cAh, Maximilian.\u201d Lilith was speaking again, touching him again. Her fingers wove into the hair that brushed his shoulders, sending little frissons of unease into his scalp. \u201cI do like your hair long like this. It makes you look so much more...savage. You would be a magnificent vampire.\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes. Waiting. Ignoring the leap in his veins, the obstinate awareness of her pull, the way his fingers trembled. The unbearable smell of roses from the hideous creature in front of him. The way his body responded to hers, and the knowledge that it wasn\u2019t only because of the bites.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never drink your blood.\u201d</p><p>Lilith sighed against him, her breath not putrid, as one might expect from an undead...but tinged with the same floral scent that clung to the rest of her. But then, of course, she hadn\u2019t just been feeding. \u201cAnd that, my pet, is my greatest disappointment of the century. All right, Maximilian. I will allow you to be released from my thrall. Much as it will annoy me to do so.\u201d</p><p>She released him and he opened his eyes. Wary.</p><p>Lilith stepped away, suddenly breezy in her demeanor. \u201cI will release you. There is a salve, a balm you can apply to the bites...my bites,\u201d she added, her blue-red eyes narrowing. \u201cIt will heal them permanently. We will no longer be bound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Her smile came all the way to her eyes, drawing them tight at the corners and tightening the tops of her cheeks. But it barely touched her lips. \u201cAnd...with the dissolution of my markings on you will also be the destruction of your Venatorial powers. The vis bulla will be useless to you. You will no longer sense those of my race.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d chosen to be a Venator; he could choose it again. He\u2019d willingly go through the life-or-death test to regain any powers he lost.</p><p>As if reading his mind\u2014perhaps it was as simple as her sensing the change in him\u2014Lilith continued: \u201cBut, of course, since you are not of Gardella blood, my bites that you so disdain have tainted you and your blood. As such, you will not be able to pass the test to regain your lost powers. They would be gone from you forever. But never fear\u2014along with the loss of your strength, you will be relieved of any memory of our times together, of your time as a Venator. It will all go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will recall nothing of the Venators, of the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Your ignorance will be your bliss.\u201d</p><p>He could forget what had happened. Live a normal life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your duty, Maximilian. Beyond your duty. You\u2019ve done everything that\u2019s been asked of you, and more. I would miss you, of course....\u201d</p><p>Then he understood. \u201cAnd, of course, I would be ripe for your plucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Maximilian. You would be just like any other mortal man. No longer a challenge. No longer exciting, a mixture of pleasure\u201d\u2014she stroked a hand over his cheek\u2014\u201cand pain\u201d\u2014and slipped her hand down under his shirt to brush against his vis bulla. And then she jerked away with the shock, and a breathless laugh. \u201cI would have no further interest in you.\u201d</p><p>His heart thumped quietly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Lilith placed both hands on his chest. \u201cI would no longer have to contend with my greatest threat: you as a Venator.\u201d</p><p>He took her wrists\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever touched her of his own volition\u2014and forced them away.</p><p>\u201cSo what shall it be, Maximilian? A free, ignorant life...or the vis bulla and me?\u201d</p><p>One</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Is Rearmed</p><p>On the west bank of the Tiber, in Rome\u2019s fourteenth rione, lay a small quarter known as the Borgo. Beyond its narrow streets, farther to the west, perched the Basilica of Saint Peter, and just to its east was the massive fortress of Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo. But within the small crisscross of borghi, a peaceful collection of hostels, shops, and churches attracted pilgrims from all over the world. Rosary makers, or coro-nari, had shops intermingled with osterie\u2014the small eateries that offered meat and pastries\u2014alongside the homes of artisans who worked at the Vatican.</p><p>Down one of the narrow borghi, near enough to smell the unpleasant aroma of oiled silk from the umbrella makers, was situated the unassuming church of Santo Quirinus. Made of yellowing plaster with curved terra-cotta tiles for its hipped roof, it was barely large enough to be considered a church rather than a chapel. In the shadow of the brilliant St. Peter\u2019s and the low but imposing presence of Santa Maria in Traspontina, Santo Quirinus attracted no more attention than might a Roman cockroach.But deep beneath this tiny, simple church was a large, circular room. In the center of the secret subterranean chamber rumbled a fountain that spilled into a red-veined marble pool about the size of a bed. The water that tumbled from a slender column of pink marble was pure and clear and shimmered as though mixed with diamonds.</p><p>The chamber itself was accessible through a well-hidden spiral staircase. It acted as the hub to other rooms and galleries, reached by hallways that shot off like spokes through arched entryways, each flanked by two columns of black-and-gray-streaked white marble.</p><p>Lady Victoria Gardella Grantworth de Lacy, who back in her homeland of England was also the Marchioness of Rockley, stood at the fountain. Two tiny silver crosses dangled from her fingertips. The silk skirt of her long navy-and-black gown brushed up against a table behind her, where a piece of parchment that tended to curl back into itself was kept open by the weight of an inkwell and a small book.</p><p>She had not yet fully come to terms with the grief of losing her great-aunt Eustacia so horrifically a month ago, for it had happened only a year after her beloved husband, Phillip, had been turned into a vampire. It seemed sometimes too much for her to bear, to think about losing two people whom she\u2019d loved so briefly, yet so deeply\u2014two people who each understood a single side of her bilateral life.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you not wear both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear two vis bullae?\u201d Victoria watched as the woman next to her trailed just the tip of her forefinger in the brilliant water. \u201cIs that permissible?\u201d</p><p>Wayren, a tall, slender woman with hair the color of wheat, pulled her dripping finger from the water. As she had been every time Victoria had seen her, she was dressed in a long, simple gown gathered loosely at the waist with a woven leather belt. Her sleeves, fitted tightly at the tops of her arms, flared into wide points and hung from her wrists nearly to the floor. She looked like a medieval chatelaine, and even though she was wearing fashions centuries older than the flounce-hemmed, ankle-length gown Victoria wore, she did not look out of place.</p><p>\u201cPermissible is an odd choice of word for the Gardella to use,\u201d Wayren replied with a beatific smile. With her customary ease and grace, she moved the leather-wrapped braid that fell from her temple back over her shoulder, where it merged with the rest of her long hair.</p><p>Wayren was not a Venator. She was...Victoria wasn\u2019t ever exactly certain who or what Wayren was, except that her library of old books and scrolls seemed infinite, and she was the one to whom the Venators always turned when they needed information and advice. \u201cA single vis bulla is forged specifically for each Venator as he or she is called. As it is created for each one individually, there are no two alike, and the amulet becomes an intimate part of them. When possible, the vis is always buried with the Venator, but of course this didn\u2019t happen in the case of your aunt. I\u2019ve not known a Venator to wear two vis bullae, but there has probably not been a time when one has had the opportunity to have two of them. It is not as if there are extras lying about. And as you are the new Gardella, there is no one who should say you nay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can scarcely comprehend that less than two years after I had the dreams that led to my calling to be a Venator, I\u2019m now the one to whom everyone will turn. Even those who have been Venators far longer than I.\u201d Victoria\u2019s aunt had been eighty-one, one of the longest-living vampire hunters ever, when she died. As the only other person bearing the direct bloodline of the Gardella family, Victoria had inherited the title\u2014and responsibility\u2014of Illa Gardella: the Gardella.</p><p>\u201cYou may be younger\u2014in fact, you may be our youngest Venator,\u201d Wayren told her with that same smile, \u201cbut you are well deserving of your title. What you have accomplished in the last eighteen moons would have been a challenge for even your aunt when she was in her prime fighting years.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked away from Wayren\u2019s serene gaze, focusing on the spill of glittering holy water next to her. She hadn\u2019t accomplished running off Lilith last year in London, or killing Nedas, the vampire queen\u2019s son, a month ago, without Max\u2019s help.</p> <p>Wayren was speaking again, perhaps in an effort to draw Victoria from her unpleasant thoughts. \u201cThe vis bullae are precious amulets. They cannot and should not be destroyed, and they are worth nothing to one who is not a Venator. Did your aunt tell you from whence they come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crosses are forged from a silver vein under the hill at Golgotha, in the Holy Land,\u201d Victoria replied. \u201cAnd they are held in holy water blessed by the pope\u201d\u2014she gestured at the fountain\u2014\u201cuntil they are given to the Venator for whom they were intended. But...is not each vis bulla made for one particular person? Can another Venator wear one not made for herself?\u201d</p><p>Wayren was nodding. \u201cYes, one and only one vis bulla is forged for the person for whom it is intended. As you see, the one that belonged to your aunt Eustacia is different from the one that Max gave you. But as you are aware, the power of a vis bulla can strengthen any Venator.\u201d</p><p>Victoria didn\u2019t need to look at the small crosses, each of which hung from its own silver hoop, to recall which was which. Aunt Eustacia\u2019s had tiny beveled edges, and the ends of each bar of the cross were pointed. Max\u2019s was slightly thicker and sturdier, without any ornamentation. Both crosses were no larger than her thumbnail.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s own vis bulla had been torn from where she wore it pierced through her navel on the same night that Aunt Eustacia had died, during a fierce battle with Lilith\u2019s undead son, Nedas. Hers had been slender, with delicate filigree along its edges, so minute she could not comprehend how anyone could have worked silver into such an intricate design.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d asked Wayren after a moment. \u201cShall I ask Kritanu to prepare for two of them?\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded slowly, wondering if wearing two amulets would make her feel any different. Would it make her twice as strong? Or would they cancel each other out? She made the decision; if there was a problem she could easily remove one of them. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll wear them both.\u201d</p><p>During their conversation, the other members of the Consilium had been walking about the chambers, in and out and through, some pausing to dip their fingers in the fountain or to speak to another. They were all men of varying ages and appearance. Victoria was the only female Venator of the hundred in the world, and there were only two dozen Venators in Rome, at the Consilium, at any given time.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall inform Kritanu, and we will proceed in a few moments. I know you have missed being on the hunt this last month while your wound healed, and you were closing up your aunt\u2019s properties in Venezia and Florence.\u201d Wayren gave her another soothing smile, then moved away in such a graceful manner that she appeared to glide.</p><p>The reinserting of her vis bulla was brief and less painful than Victoria recalled the first piercing being. Perhaps it was because the pain of its being torn away was more prevalent in her memory than the quick, smooth piercing. Kritanu, the elderly man originally from India who had been Aunt Eustacia\u2019s companion and Victoria\u2019s trainer, was quick and efficient with the long, curved needle. Since Victoria had decided to wear the two amulets, Kritanu inserted them separately, so that they each hung from the top of her navel and brushed against each other as they settled into the small hollow below. The moment the first one slipped into place, Victoria felt a renewal of energy, a familiar surge tingle through her body.</p><p>She felt as if she\u2019d become whole again.</p> <p>And, now that she was wearing something from her aunt, perhaps she would not only have her aunt\u2019s strength of spirit with her, but also begin to heal her grief.</p><p>\u201cBeheaded dogs and cats?\u201d Victoria said, looking from Ilias, the keeper of the Consilium and one of the eldest Venators, to Michalas, one of the Venators who lived permanently in Rome. It was nearly two months since Victoria had had the two vis bullae inserted, and although she\u2019d been out several times after sundown searching for vampires, things had been relatively quiet.Michalas nodded, his russet curls so tight they moved but a whisper. With his fair skin and very blue eyes, he looked more like a young boy than a feral warrior, despite the fact that he was a decade older than Victoria. \u201cA pile of them\u2014perhaps three dozen. In various stages of decay, so it appears the pile was started some time ago, and has been added to. I saw it two weeks ago, but many of the carcasses had been there much longer. Perhaps two or three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like vampires,\u201d she said, looking at Ilias for confirmation. \u201cThey prefer human blood, and certainly would have no reason to cut off the heads of their victims, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s for that reason that I waited until today\u2019s gathering to apprise you of it,\u201d Michalas said, glancing at Victoria and then back at Ilias. \u201cThere\u2019s no urgency, nothing to indicate any connection to the undead or any other nonhuman threat.\u201d</p><p>The older man nodded his head in agreement. Ilias was well over fifty, perhaps approaching sixty, and had watery yet wise eyes that crinkled at the corners, matching the furrows on his forehead. When he was deep in thought, as now, he pinched the end of his sharp nose with his thumb and forefinger. \u201cVero, not vampires. But something unpleasant, to be sure. It could be as simple as the leftovers from a butcher shop\u2014some of the Oriental pilgrims have unusual eating habits. This was two weeks ago? Has the pile grown?\u201d</p><p>Michalas smiled ruefully. \u201cI confess, I didn\u2019t deem it important enough to check on it again. With the city preparing for Carnivale, and all of the tourists arriving for the festivities, I\u2019ve been busy in the more populous areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Esquiline,\u201d Michalas said. \u201cI saw no undead in the area, but there were some about. I could sense them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Esquiline. That\u2019s near the Villa Palombara,\u201d Ilias said, his pale blue eyes suddenly sharp. Sometimes they appeared rheumy, but that affect seemed to disappear when something of interest presented itself.</p><p>Victoria looked at both of the men, natives of Rome, and waited for an explanation. Having lived her first twenty years in England, she was at a disadvantage in this city, the home and birthplace of the Venators. Nevertheless, despite the fact that she was a woman, and much younger than either of them, they were respectful and forthcoming with whatever information she needed. She was the Gardella.</p><p>\u201cThe Villa Palombara has been empty for a hundred and forty years, since its marchese disappeared under unusual circumstances. He was an alchemist, and had quite a popular salon with others of his inclination\u2014trying to find the way to transmute any metal to gold, that process which, of course, is believed to be the source of immortality.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt that it would be in poor taste to mention that one could easily achieve immortality by having a vampire turn one undead. Of course, there was the disadvantage of being damned for all eternity and being relegated to drinking human blood if one was turned. Instead, she said, \u201cPerhaps we could go tonight and see if anything has changed. As well, I\u2019m not familiar with that part of the city and would like to see it with someone who knows it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a pleasure,\u201d Michalas said with a genuine smile. \u201cI would enjoy hunting with you.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted from their conversation, which had taken place in one of the alcoves adjoining the fountain chamber, by a handsome man with red-gold hair. His arms were heavily muscled, a feature that Zavier tended to display by wearing unfashionable shirts with the sleeves cut off, much as he might have on the farm his father and brothers worked back in Scotland. It made him look slightly barbaric, and Victoria felt mildly embarrassed at all of his exposed skin.</p><p>\u201cCome, ye gabblers\u2014Wayren is gathering us in the Gallery. Victoria, \u2019tis good to see your bonny face again. Ilias, Michalas, come along with ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZavier.\u201d She turned toward him, smiling. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t miss our celebration today! I can only imagine how delighted you\u2019ll be to see Aunt Eustacia\u2019s new portrait unveiled in the Gallery.\u201d</p><p>Though his brawny physique bespoke great strength, his blue eyes were kind and his smile warm, particularly when he was in Victoria\u2019s presence\u2014a fact that had not been lost on her. He\u2019d left Rome just after Aunt Eustacia died to investigate rumors of vampire activity in Aberdeen. Wayren, with the use of the well-trained pigeons that clustered around Santo Quirinus, had learned that Zavier was on his way back to Rome, but she hadn\u2019t been certain he\u2019d be there in time for the portrait unveiling, a bittersweet tradition that honored each Venator after his or her death. But she should have known Zavier wouldn\u2019t have missed the honor to the oldest Venator.</p><p>Somehow, as he ushered her out of the alcove, he managed to place himself between her and Michalas and Ilias, drawing her back to walk behind them. \u201cAnd you ken that I have been attemptin\u2019 to wheedle out of Wayren whether the painting of Eustacia is one of her in her younger years or as we ken her.\u201d</p><p>Victoria slipped her hand into the tiny crook of his arm, aware of the unusual fact that her fingers were touching a man\u2019s bare skin. He\u2019d been the first of the Venators to befriend her when Aunt Eustacia brought her to the Consilium for the first time. Not that the rest of them had been standoffish or looked down on her for being a woman\u2014only Max had done that, and only until he\u2019d seen her at her most vulnerable moment\u2014for they were all well aware of the power and skill her aunt had wielded, and thus they held no prejudice against the female gender. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t told me either,\u201d she replied, glancing at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, soon enough. Tell me, when will ye be having your vis bulla replaced, and be able to go out on the hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already done so, Zavier. Whilst you were gone back to Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch! And I meant to be there for it,\u201d he said, a gleam of humor in his cornflower eyes. \u201cI would have offered to hold your hand.\u201d</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t stay the blush\u2014and, truly, it was mortifying for her, a Venator, to blush over something like this!\u2014and she looked away.</p><p>Despite the fact that every Venator wore his vis bulla somewhere on his body, pierced through the skin so that it became one with the being of the person, Victoria had not relished the thought of being surrounded by a group of men whilst her belly was bared and her navel poked. And along with that resolution, she\u2019d also made it a point not to consider where Zavier\u2014or any other Venator\u2014wore his. She felt it was a private thing.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were not, and Kritanu and Wayren were the only ones there. Just as I preferred.\u201d</p><p>Zavier chuckled. \u201cYe canna blame a man for tryin\u2019 his best.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria changed the subject as they wandered past the fountain and through the alcove that led to the Gallery where portraits of all of the Venators through the years were hung. \u201cDid you dispatch the vampires in Aberdeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I did. Five of the demmed leeches were living beneath the construction of the new Music Hall, coming out at night to feed on the locals. I never heard of any undead that far north before; I thought Scotland was too cold and rough for them.\u201d</p><p>Victoria smiled. \u201cI\u2019m certain it was pleasant to have a reason to visit home, after living here for several years. I\u2019ve been in Italy for only six months, but already I do miss London. Have you had any more thought on the paintings? Perhaps the months away from them have given you a different theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how I look at it, and study the portraits in the Gallery, I can only come to the conclusion that they have all been painted by the same artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though some of the paintings of the Venators are centuries old?\u201d Victoria let the humor into her voice. \u201cIt must be a family of painters, perhaps a father-to-son-to-grandson sort of talent...not so unlike that of the Venators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe are most likely correct, but I still canna get beyond the fact that they are so similar. And Wayren persists in being mysterious about it all. Ah, well, \u2019tis nothing more than a legitimate opportunity for me to study our artifacts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is no hardship for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed not.\u201d He looked at her, his eyes suddenly warm enough to cause her face to heat. \u201cPerhaps now that I am back we can hunt together some night. Carnivale begins in three days, and we will all need to be watchful during the festivities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear,\u201d she replied. \u201cI am looking forward to experiencing the great Roman Carnivale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I have been here these last five years, I have learned to greatly enjoy it. Most especially the roasted chestnuts and brunetti, which they sell on every street corner.\u201d</p><p>With that, they entered the long, narrow portrait gallery, which was lined on each side with the pictures of every Venator from Gardeleus on. Most of them were men, but there were a few women in the ranks. Zavier, who was particularly interested in the female slayers, had told her that each of the women Venators were direct descendants of Gardeleus\u2014as Victoria herself was, and her aunt before her, and unlike himself and Michalas, who were from other branches of the family. One of her favorite portraits depicted Catherine Gardella, whose laughing green eyes and brilliant red hair gave her a mischievous look that made Victoria wish she\u2019d known her.</p><p>Other Venators, like Zavier, were also from the Gardella family tree, but had sprung randomly from far-flung branches that often went for three or more generations without producing a potential Venator.</p><p>Ilias gathered their attention with three sharp claps of his large-knuckled hands. \u201cSince I believe that Zavier is about to expire on the spot with curiosity, it is time to unveil and honor our beloved Eustacia Gardella, mistress of the Venators, gracious lady of the Gardellas.\u201d</p><p>With a quick flick of his wrist, he whipped the lush white covering from the large portrait, revealing a life-size painting.</p> <p>Victoria felt the sting of tears in her eyes as she looked on the beautiful, wise face of the woman who had mentored her through her first year as a Venator. The artist, who in keeping with his mystery did not sign a name to any of the portraits, had captured the liveliness in her eyes, the gentle crinkles at their corners, and the gleam of her black hair. Aunt Eustacia\u2019s white forehead showed nary a wrinkle, despite the fact that the painting depicted her just as she had been before she died\u2014eighty-one years old, and still beautiful and strong.</p><p>Zavier bumped a handkerchief in front of Victoria\u2019s hands and she took the wadded cotton, dabbing at her eyes\u2014hardly remembering the last time she\u2019d wept. Her hand moved down over the front of the loose tunic and split skirt she\u2019d taken to wearing now that her mother wasn\u2019t nearby to insist upon more conventional garb, pressing through the material to the pair of vis bullae that hung from her navel. Aunt Eustacia\u2019s was on the right, and Victoria closed her fingers around it for a moment...and missed her aunt.</p><p>Two</p><p>Wherein Our Heroine Is Privy to a Repulsive Discovery</p><p>\u201cI do believe Zavier is smitten with the new Illa Gardella,\u201d Michalas said to Victoria. He cast her a sly grin from under his hat brim as they walked quickly along the Via Merulana. \u201cPerhaps I should have invited him to join us.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was glad it was dark, for she would have been mortified for him to see the warm flush on her cheeks. Although perhaps he would have written off the slight color to the bite in the February air, for the tip of her nose was cold and likely just as red. \u201cPerhaps you should have, although we\u2019d likely be treated to a history lesson if you had.\u201dMichalas chuckled softly, then gestured ahead. Fortunately the air wasn\u2019t cold enough to show the puff of air from his laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re likely quite correct.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was, of course, well aware of the interest the Scot had shown toward her, but she was a bit mortified that others had noticed as well. But why should it matter? Zavier was kind and gentle, and so very different from the easy propriety of her husband, Phillip...and the golden, overbearing charm of Sebastian.</p><p>The thought of Sebastian, and how she\u2019d let him seduce her last autumn in the carriage, made Victoria\u2019s stomach squiggle, and so she picked up her pace as she walked along with Michalas.</p><p>Sebastian was the great-great-great-(she didn\u2019t know how many generations)-grandson of the legendary vampire Beauregard. Because Beauregard had been turned undead after he\u2019d had his own son, there had been no vampire blood passed down through the generations. Sebastian was just as mortal as Victoria herself, but despite their intimacies, she didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t fully trust him, for he seemed to come and go on a whim\u2014usually when there were vampires or other danger about\u2014and it was obvious his loyalties were divided.</p><p>As such, Sebastian had spent the past year, since meeting Victoria, trying to balance his loyalty to his grandfather with his...how would he describe his relationship with Victoria? A fascination? Attraction? Game of cat and mouse?</p><p>She suppressed a snort that would have sent her mother into spasms, if she\u2019d been there to hear it. But she was safely back in London, undoubtedly being squired about by the smitten Lord Jellington and exchanging gossip with her two cronies, fondly known as Lady Nilly and Duchess Winnie.</p><p>But what would Victoria call it\u2014her relationship with Sebastian? A tryst gone bad? Or good...depending on how one looked at it. An affaire?</p><p>She\u2019d tried to give as little thought to him as he likely gave to her these days, now that his great-grandfather was stalking the streets of Rome, attacking and feeding where he would and taking great care not to get caught. Regardless of whatever her feelings were toward Sebastian, Victoria had a duty and a responsibility to hunt down Beauregard and slam a stake into his centuries-old chest.</p><p>But Sebastian had apparently thought of her at least once since last autumn, for somehow he had obtained her Aunt Eustacia\u2019s vis bulla after the horrific events of that long, bloody night and sent it to Victoria. How he\u2019d obtained it she couldn\u2019t guess, but the fact that he had sent it on to her was a miracle.</p><p>And then there was Max, from whom she\u2019d heard nothing since he handed her his own vis bulla and walked away. Almost four months ago.</p><p>That vis, in combination with her aunt\u2019s strength amulet, had given Victoria even greater strength and speed than her own single amulet. Instead of canceling each other out or even maintaining her level of expertise, the dual vis bullae had made her faster, stronger, and healthier\u2014if the training she\u2019d been doing with Kritanu was any indication.</p><p>Michalas stopped, drawing Victoria abruptly from her maze of thoughts. It was a good thing a vampire hadn\u2019t leaped out in front of her, as she\u2019d been distracted more than was prudent.</p><p>\u201cEh, now, look here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis great stone wall encloses the Palombara estate. It reaches all along this block and then around in a sort of elongated pentagonal shape. We\u2019re at the very rear, at the farthest point from the villa, which sits near the front, at the fifth corner of the wall. It\u2019s just a bit up this street that I came upon the pile of animal carcasses.\u201d</p><p>The sun had just set, and the graying light in the sky allowed her to see the crumbling rock of the barrier. Along the top of the enclosure\u2014which was half again as tall as she was\u2014high, sharp stones had been set in the mortar so that their edges discouraged anyone from climbing over. But there were cracks, and one large one where an oak branch had grown against the wall and caused it to buckle, then split halfway down so it would be possible to climb through.</p><p>Via Merulana was lined by narrow residences that appeared to be more well-kept than the Palombara estate, yet it wasn\u2019t a busy thoroughfare. A few carriages drove by, and several pedestrians moved quickly along\u2014heads bent against the chill, or in an effort to remain unseen and unnoticed. It was a bit eerie, made more so by the fact that she and Michalas didn\u2019t carry a lantern as if in fear of attracting attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one has lived here for more than one hundred forty years,\u201d Michalas told her, examining the crevice where the tree trunk thrust through. \u201cApparently the marchese had a secret laboratory where he and some of his fellow alchemists conducted their experiments. He claimed he was about to unveil the secret of transmutation after two more nights of work in his workshop, but he disappeared that very night. The laboratory, which presumably contains the results and remnants of his experiments, has remained locked since his disappearance.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked thoughtfully at the broken wall. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he was turned into a vampire,\u201d she said, a note of humor in her voice.</p><p>Before Michalas could reply, they both stilled. \u201cSpeaking of the bloody creatures,\u201d he murmured, sliding a stake from his belt. Victoria followed suit and they looked at each other, then waited.</p> <p>She felt the brush of cold air over the back of her neck, raising the prickles of awareness that always accompanied the presence of an undead. \u201cIt\u2019s back there,\u201d she said, gesturing to the wall. \u201cBehind the wall.\u201d</p><p>Michalas nodded, and they moved toward the crack in the enclosure. \u201cFirst or last?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Victoria said, pleased he hadn\u2019t tried to keep her behind. Some of the male Venators, particularly the younger ones who hadn\u2019t fought beside Aunt Eustacia, still had to be reminded that she was as capable\u2014more so, in fact, due to her dual vis and direct Gardella lineage\u2014as they in defending herself.</p><p>Despite that, Michalas had to help her through the crevice when her wide-legged trousers, designed to look like a skirt, got caught on a low branch. He followed behind her.</p><p>The sensation at the back of her neck was getting stronger, so she knew they were going in the right direction. The sun\u2019s last gasp of light was disappearing rather quickly, and it was too dark on the other side of the wall to see any details of the overgrown terrain. Tall, skeletal trees mingled with thick bushes, and the tangled brown-leaved vines and brush of a long-forgotten garden left little room to pass.</p> <p>Michalas pointed to the remnant of a pathway marked only by a smattering of stones. It was a pale streak in the dark, and nearly obstructed by tall grass that had fallen over it through the years. They were silent as they moved along the old trail. Victoria found herself peering ahead in the direction she expected the villa to lie, somehow assuming she\u2019d see lights or other illumination, but knowing that there would be none. It was just odd to have a large estate in the middle of a city, empty and unused. This would never occur in London.</p><p>The sensation at the back of her neck was growing stronger; Victoria knew they were close when they came upon a lower stone wall that appeared to bisect the estate, separating the back, with its more natural gardens, from the front, where the villa, stable, and more formal gardens would lie.</p><p>She sensed three or four of the undead nearby, perhaps just on the other side of the wall. She and Michalas either needed to find a gate or another way over it.</p><p>She silently grabbed Michalas\u2019s arm to get his attention and showed him four fingers, now barely visible, backlit by an anemic moon. He nodded and pointed to a large gap where the two walls should have connected\u2014a space they could easily walk through.</p><p>But as they moved toward it, Victoria heard the sound of rusty metal: a gate, opening and clinking back into place. She and Michalas waited for a moment, then began to creep silently toward the undead.</p><p>Eight red eyes glowed in the darkness, and they appeared to be talking excitedly among themselves; probably planning where and when to stalk the victims for their evening feed. She hated to interrupt their dinner plans, but...she lunged from the covering of a pine tree, the needles brushing over her cheek, her stake raised.</p> <p>The element of surprise allowed her to stab one of the undead before the others realized they weren\u2019t alone. When her stake plunged through to the creature\u2019s heart, he froze, then poofed into the malignant pile of ash and dust that was the final result of a life of damned immortality. Michalas was just as quick with his weapon, and it was really too simple for both of them to dispatch the other three vampires with barely the flicker of an eyelash or a disruption of breath. They were easy targets\u2014taken by surprise as they were, and, from the looks of them, had not been undead for very long.</p><p>When she\u2019d stabbed her second and final vampire, Victoria stopped, silent and still for a moment. The back of her neck was no longer cold and prickling, so she slipped her stake back into the deep pocket of her man\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cThey came from this way,\u201d Michalas said, starting off into the darkness.</p><p>Victoria was glad to follow. One could hardly call that brief skirmish a battle\u2014she could have done it in full court dress, without Michalas. Perhaps they would find something more interesting if they continued.</p><p>She finally saw the shape of the villa, rising wide and dark in front of them, just past the lower gated wall through which the vampires had come. It was dark as a tomb, large and black and quiet.</p><p>\u201cIt must be here somewhere,\u201d Michalas said from the darkness. She realized he was walking along yet another wall, this one angling off from the shorter one and stretching into the darkness, toward the back corner of the villa.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Porta Alchemica,\u201d he said as she joined him. \u201cThe Door of Alchemy\u2014the door to Palombara\u2019s laboratory. I\u2019ve not seen it, but I\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dark,\u201d Victoria said, peering up at a particularly overbearing pine that obliterated every bit of residual light from the moon. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Michalas tsked. \u201cIf only we had some source of light...Why does Miro not invent something practical like that for us? How many times have I wished for something that I could turn on or inflame at a moment\u2019s notice. We spend so much time in the dark and cannot see. All the fancy weapons he spends his time on\u2014pah! An ash stake is all I need. Or perhaps a little bit of something that could be set to explode at will.\u201d His smile flashed at her.</p><p>Privately, Victoria agreed with him that the best weapon was a stake, but since the Venator weapons master was working on a special garment for her, she felt it would be inappropriate to complain.</p><p>\u201cEh, perhaps this is it. Feel here,\u201d Michalas said.</p><p>She moved next to him and felt around the great stone lintel that framed a massive stone door set into the wall. The moon peeked out from behind the trees and clouds just enough to illuminate the smooth white door and the shadowy carvings on it and its frame.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s locked with three keys, and I understand it cannot be opened without all three of them,\u201d Michalas told her. \u201cThis must be it. Feel the round disk in the center? And the carvings on it? There are more carvings on the lintel, and legend has it that the symbols and words there are taken directly from an alchemical journal that came into the possession of Palombara before he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo these symbols contain the secrets to immortality, then?\u201d she asked in a wry voice, feeling the moss and dirt beneath her fingers as she felt the crevices of the carvings.</p><p>Michalas was moving around in the dark behind her now, back in the direction from which they\u2019d come. Suddenly she heard the unmistakable sound of him tripping and then the \u201cOof!\u201d when he fell.</p><p>Even Venators, apparently, had moments of gracelessness.</p><p>\u201cBy the bloody rood,\u201d swore Michalas quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, coming toward him where he crouched not far from the gate through which the vampires had passed.</p><p>\u201cYou...perhaps you don\u2019t want to see this,\u201d he said, straightening and turning as if to block her view. \u201cEh, it is not a pleasant sight.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the carnage she\u2019d seen at Bridge and Stokes, a private club in London, Victoria shook her head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She nearly stumbled over them herself in her effort to show she wasn\u2019t hesitant. There were four of them. She could barely make out the details in the low light, but she could see enough.</p><p>Still clothed. One in a dress. The other three in breeches and shirts.</p><p>Humans.</p><p>Headless.</p><p>Just like Aunt Eustacia.</p><p>The memory shot into her mind. Blood everywhere.</p><p>Victoria took a deep breath, closed her eyes. Her heart was slamming hard. Her stomach roiled, but she managed to keep from losing control. She waited a moment, swallowing hard. \u201cWhat are they doing? Why cut off their heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were taking them somewhere, probably out of the estate.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at Michalas. \u201cNo coincidence that there\u2019s a pile of beheaded animal carcasses nearby. Let\u2019s go see if...if there are other bodies there. But...we can\u2019t leave them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...eh...shall we bring them somewhere outside these walls so they\u2019ll be found? So perhaps they\u2019ll be identified? I\u2019ve not heard any reports in the city about finding headless corpses,\u201d Michalas added. \u201cI\u2019ve a cousin who works with the polizia, and he tells me of all the goings-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why take off their heads? They\u2019re vampires,\u201d Victoria asked again, if only to keep her mind from thinking about the morbid task at hand. They certainly couldn\u2019t leave the bodies; Michalas was right.</p><p>In the end they moved the four corpses and left them in a small courtyard several blocks away from the Palombara estate. Michalas would suggest to his cousin that he might wish to investigate that particular viuzza, and then the police could at least attempt to find the families of the victims.</p><p>By the time they completed the task of moving the bodies, Victoria was filthy and bloody and quite nauseated, but she still wanted to see the pile of animal carcasses, so Michalas took her to where he\u2019d found it, which was only two streets away from the broken wall of the estate.</p><p>The pile was still there, in the darkest corner of an overgrown courtyard behind a half-burned-out apartment. She had no idea how Michalas had ever come upon it.</p><p>According to him, the pile was larger now. Rotted. The stench was stomach-turning. And it was composed only, as far as they could tell, of dogs and cats, perhaps a wolf or two. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it would be too much of a coincidence to believe that the four dead humans were not intended to be added to the pile.</p><p>\u201cNow we know there are undead involved,\u201d Victoria said as she and Michalas walked away from the dark courtyard, still on the alert for more undead. \u201cBut the question becomes: What are they doing with the heads?\u201d</p><p>Three</p> <p>In Which Victoria\u2019s Idyll Is Invaded</p><p>Victoria and Michalas finished the night by patrolling the rest of the rione near Villa Palombara. They staked a measly three more vampires before returning to the Consilium at sunrise to report their findings to Ilias. They found him on his way to speak with Wayren.</p><p>After their brief discussion, Ilias suggested that Victoria join him with Wayren in her private library. Michalas appeared relieved to be dismissed, saying with a crooked grin that he was ready to return home to his own bed.Victoria would have been pleased to do so herself, but of course she did not. She followed Ilias to the library. It smelled of old books\u2014of paper and papyrus, of ink and leather. She had been there only once before\u2014very briefly\u2014so as she came into the dome-shaped room that was accessed by a locked door with hidden bolts, she took the opportunity to reexamine the chamber.</p><p>The ceiling of the round room was high above her head, and rows of books sat on shelves that appeared to be carved into the circular walls. On closer look, however, she saw that the shelves were stone ledges, and carved with letters or symbols in a language Victoria didn\u2019t recognize. She presumed the symbols were some sort of code by which the books, scrolls, and laced-together parchments were organized.</p><p>Victoria stepped onto a thick white rug that covered half of the chamber floor and selected a straight-backed chair for her seat. In the center of the room was a large piece of glass situated like a tabletop. Wayren sat behind the desk, her square spectacles resting neatly on a wooden tray next to a spread-eagled book. Ilias, who\u2019d followed Victoria into the room, closed the door behind him and sank into the final seat.</p> <p>The room wasn\u2019t as large as she would have imagined, knowing how many tomes Wayren had access to. A bevy of candles burned from sconces on the walls and some of the lower shelves, and from stands with multiple tiers and holders placed throughout the room. Despite being a deep flight of stairs underground, the room was lit as if it were noon in July.</p><p>Ilias glanced at Wayren. \u201cWhere is Ylito? Is he not joining us?\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head easily. \u201cHe is in the midst of a procedure. I have already spoken with him, and he urges us to continue without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYlito?\u201d Victoria was surprised at the unfamiliar name. She knew of all of the Venators by name, even if she hadn\u2019t met them all, and the Comitators, their martial-arts trainers, but this was one she\u2019d never heard mentioned.</p><p>\u201cHe is not a Venator, but an herbalist and alchemist who studies the properties of plants and metals and is very talented with his work.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at Wayren. \u201cDo you mean to say he\u2019s a wizard?\u201d</p> <p>The older woman looked pained for a moment, then smiled slightly. \u201cHe prefers to be called a hermetist, a sort of spiritual alchemist, which is a bit more palatable to him than the moniker of wizard or sorcerer.\u201d When Victoria continued to look at her with clear question in her eyes, she continued, \u201cAs powerful and daunting as our Venators may be, we\u2019ve found over the years that someone like Ylito often provides skills beyond what a Venator can do: casting protections, creating infusions or distillations, and even drawing forth the energies and inherent powers of gold and silver\u2014all for the purpose of annihilating the malevolence brought on this earth by Lilith and her kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not surprising that you haven\u2019t met Ylito, or perhaps even heard his name spoken,\u201d added Ilias. \u201cHe prefers to remain cloistered in his workshop unless needed. Which is why he\u2019s chosen not to grace us with his presence at this time.\u201d He shifted in his seat and raised a hand to scratch his chin. \u201cSo let us get to the matter at hand, Victoria. We have vampires who are cutting the heads off small animals and now, apparently, humans.\u201d He looked at Wayren. \u201cThat would be behavior more like that of a demon, so I am at a loss as to why the undead would do such a thing, particularly since they abhor demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall have to study it,\u201d Wayren told them when they described in more detail the headless corpses. \u201cBut I would suggest that a visit to the Door of Alchemy\u2014la Porta Alchemica\u2014during the daylight would be in order. Perhaps we will find some evidence that you could not see in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Ilias turned to Victoria. \u201cThere are three keys that open the Magic Door, as it is also called. Each one must be inserted in its proper slot and, once inserted, cannot be retrieved until the door is open. Palombara had one of the keys, he secreted a second one somewhere in the villa, and the third one was given to Augmentin Gardella shortly before the marchese disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Venator.\u201d Victoria\u2019s skin began to prickle.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Unfortunately Augmentin wasn\u2019t able to save Palombara from whatever befell him before he completed his quest. But he did keep the key. And passed it down through the family. Your aunt Eustacia was the last person to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not here, and we\u2019d best find it before the vampires do,\u201d Wayren said, looking at Victoria. \u201cI believe your aunt wore it on her person. Do you recall a silver armband? It was made specifically to hold the key, which is quite small\u2014not much larger than the first knuckle of your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wore it high on her arm, and never took it off. That and her vis bulla.\u201d Victoria chewed on her lip, not liking where her thoughts were leading her. Not at all. Best to change the subject. \u201cWhat\u2019s behind the door that\u2019s so important to the vampires? They already have immortality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe papers and journals of the alchemist must contain something of value to them. After Palombara disappeared, there was much activity about the door, as the undead\u2014and some of the mortal alchemists\u2014tried to force their way in. But the only way in is with the three keys, and they were in possession of none of them, even, presumably, the one kept by the Marchese Palombara.\u201d Ilias was rubbing his nose again, pinching it between a thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cThey gave up after a time, and the Door of Alchemy has remained untouched and unbothered for a hundred and forty years. But now, with this undead activity in the area\u2014as well as the death of your aunt and the possibility that the key might fall into the wrong hands\u2014it\u2019s imperative that we keep our attention on the door. In fact, the very great possibility is that somehow the key was removed from her person...after the events last autumn, and that it has already been put to use.\u201d Wayren\u2019s face, unlined and ageless, was a pale moon of seriousness. \u201cThe fact that the undead want what\u2019s behind the door is more than enough reason for us to be concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another reason to visit the door, to see if any of the keys have been turned,\u201d Ilias said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Ylito will want to accompany you,\u201d Wayren said, to Victoria\u2019s surprise. \u201cPerhaps you will be able to ascertain what is so important behind that door, or at least whether there is indeed anyone trying to get inside it.\u201d</p><p>Late that afternoon Oliver, Victoria\u2019s driver and the bane of her maid\u2019s existence, stopped the little barouche in front of the Gardella villa. As Victoria stepped out, she realized she hadn\u2019t been home or slept since leaving yesterday morning for the portrait unveiling at the Consilium. She was bone-tired, yet energized with purpose in a way she hadn\u2019t been for months. Her mind was racing down a myriad of avenues, and she felt as though she could barely keep up with it. At the same time she was still dirty and mussed from her evening of moving headless corpses with Michalas.But she had a task, and felt for the first time since Aunt Eustacia\u2019s death that she was back in full form.</p><p>Still, she wanted nothing more than to get into the quiet of her room and practice some of the meditation and breathing that Kritanu had taught her. Tomorrow she would meet the mysterious Ylito and they would go to examine la Porta Alchemica.</p><p>The front door opened just as she reached it, Aunt Eustacia\u2019s Italian butler looking slightly more harried than usual.</p><p>\u201cGrazie, Giorgio,\u201d Victoria said, walking in and directly toward the stairs as she pulled off her gloves and began to unhook the fastenings of her spencer. \u201cPlease ring for Verbena and ask that she wait upon me in my chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi, milady,\u201d Giorgio said. \u201cBut perhaps you might wish to take a moment to visit the parlor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parlor?\u201d Victoria, her hand on the newel post at the bottom of the steps, halted reluctantly\u2014only a flight of stairs from the haven she sought. She glanced toward the parlor and saw that the door was closed.</p><p>But before Giorgio could reply, the door in question opened. \u201cVictoria!\u201d came a familiar shrill greeting. \u201cVictoria, we have arrived!\u201d</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t move. Her fingers froze like a cap over the stairwell post as she looked at her mother, Lady Melisande Gardella Grantworth, rushing toward her from the sitting room, skirts and ruffles and lace bouncing and flouncing in all directions.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Victoria managed to ask, all thoughts of a quiet rest disintegrating along with the peacefulness of her home. No wonder Giorgio had looked out of sorts.</p><p>\u201cIndeed! Lady Nilly and Duchess Winnie and myself, we\u2019re all here. Just in time for the week of Carnivale. And for you, you poor dear, of course. Poor darling, to have to handle all of this on your own. I am only sorry I couldn\u2019t have arrived sooner.\u201d Lady Melly gathered Victoria into her maternal embrace even as her daughter desperately clutched the stairwell post.</p><p>And as her mother\u2019s two bosom friends spilled into the hall behind her, arms outstretched in greeting, high-pitched voices exclaiming over everything from Victoria\u2019s simple hairstyle to her sunken cheeks to the mild Italian weather and how it was so warm for February, so why were her hands so cold and her gown\u2014was that even a gown?\u2014so dirty and mussed? My goodness!\u2014had she been hurt?...she could do nothing but let them fuss and hug and pat and croon as they\u2019d done since she was a little girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a weary glance over her shoulder, she told Giorgio, \u201cPlease tell Verbena I shall be a while.\u201d</p><p>A long while.</p><p>Two hours later Victoria sank onto the stool in front of her dressing mirror. Two hours.All that time listening to her mother and the ladies Winnie and Nilly prattle on about the circles under her eyes, the gauntness of her cheeks (although Lady Nilly thought it wasn\u2019t so terrible, she of the hollow cheeks herself), and the paleness of her skin. Not to mention the droopiness of her plain hairstyle and unfashionable clothing.</p> <p>And that wasn\u2019t all. There were unveiled hints about her returning to London to find another husband. And how her dear friend Gwendolyn Starcasset was now the toast of the ton, with her new betrothal to an earl with more than fifty thousand a year, and how her brother, George, would be a perfect match for Victoria. (Victoria had had to bite her tongue particularly hard on that topic, for the last time she\u2019d seen George Starcasset he\u2019d been here in Rome with Nedas, as a member of the Tutela, and had been intent on ravishing her.)</p><p>There had been Lady Melly\u2019s grievances about the erstwhile Lord Jellington, who had, apparently, failed to meet her expectations of what a beau should do and be, and was thus the impetus for her visit to Italy.</p><p>Then followed opinions on Italian biscuits (too dry and crusty), Italian streets (crowded and confusing and filled with pilgrims), and the beauty of the little fountain in front of the villa.</p><p>She\u2019d had to keep the ugly red calluses on her left hand\u2014her tea-pouring and stake-wielding hand\u2014hidden while playing hostess, for, of course, she wasn\u2019t wearing the gloves she would have been wearing had she been home in London. Nor was she garbed in a proper gown, the lapse of which still had her mother in horrified raptures.</p><p>The entire event had culminated in one big problem that led somewhere she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to go. She rested her head on the dressing table in her chamber.</p> <p>\u201cNow, milady, no sense in lettin\u2019 em make it any worse\u2019n it already is. Ye have important things to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Victoria lifted her head to look in the mirror. All she saw at first were two puffs of orange-colored hair on either side of her own dark head, and then her maid, Verbena, looked up from where she\u2019d been unfastening the buttons of Victoria\u2019s tunic. Her face bore pity, but also a glow of interest.</p><p>\u201cDid ye see that massive crucifix the duchess was wearing? I swear, even m\u2019cousin Barth wouldn\u2019t be wearin\u2019 one that size, though he\u2019s been known to drive vampires around himself. Pardon me for sayin\u2019 so, but the duchess\u2019s cross looks bigger than the pope\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, Verbena drew the tunic up and over Victoria\u2019s head, leaving her droopy-eyed mistress to sit at the table in merely her split-skirt and chemise.</p><p>Victoria sighed. \u201cI cannot believe they\u2019re here,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cWithout a word of warning Mother has arrived with them, and now I haven\u2019t any idea how I\u2019m going to get out at night without their knowing.\u201d Sundown\u2014vampire-hunting time\u2014was in a matter of hours, and Melly expected her to join them for dinner, and likely more conversation. Surely she would also expect Victoria to join them in other activities, both during the day and in the evening.</p><p>In fact, the dearth of calling cards on the front table of the villa had sent Lady Melly into yet another soliloquy about how cloistered Victoria had allowed herself to become since Aunt Eustacia died, and how terrible it was that her social life had gone to null. And how glad Melly was to be here to set things right.</p> <p>But that was the least of Victoria\u2019s worries.</p><p>Verbena loosened Victoria\u2019s hair from its casual mooring at the back of her head. \u201cAn\u2019 ye\u2019ll have to give more attention to your hairdressing and gowns, now that your mama is here. She won\u2019t tolerate ye lookin\u2019 less than a marchy-ness, now that ye finally got the title.\u201d She sounded magnificently pleased with this new development, which was no surprise, as Verbena lived for the opportunity to get creative with Victoria\u2019s coiffure and toilette whilst finding ways to incorporate the tools her mistress Venator might need.</p><p>Recently Victoria\u2019s choice to wear the split skirt and long tunic favored by Kritanu for both training and rest had nearly given Verbena fits. But since Victoria had rarely left the villa except late in the day to go to the Consilium and then to search the streets for vampires, it was her opinion that it mattered not what she wore. Since she knew few people in Rome, there were no social obligations requiring her attendance. And, quite honestly, Victoria preferred it that way.</p><p>Her days of balls and soirees and musicales (thank goodness) were over. She was a Venator, and that was her life.</p><p>But all that would change now that Lady Melly and her cohorts were here.</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s horror at my choice of attire and coiffure was made abundantly clear, but at least the neglect was attributed to grief due to Aunt Eustacia dying.\u201d Victoria looked longingly toward her bed. Perhaps she would have two hours to rest, if she could keep the list of worries at bay. \u201cHowever, sadly, that topic brought an even larger problem to mind.\u201d She looked in the mirror at her maid\u2019s crystal blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no fear ye can\u2019t handle yer mama an\u2019 her biddies. I heard her say ye should come back to London and rejoin Society...she wants ye to marry again so ye can give her some little bunnies in nappies.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was shaking her head. \u201cNo, no...that I can manage. I think. \u2019Tis even a bigger problem.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment, then rose to move toward her bed. \u201cThe silver armband that my aunt always wore...I must find it. As soon as my mother remembers it she\u2019ll want it\u2014but the bigger problem now is that the vampires are already looking for it, because it holds a special key.\u201d</p> <p>Their gazes met again in the mirror, Verbena\u2019s eyes rounding in her cherub face, and her mouth following suit.</p><p>\u201cThat, my lady, is a bloody mess of a pro\u2019lem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed it is, since my mother believes Aunt Eustacia died in her sleep. Thus, she expects that the bracelet would have been on her arm, readily available for me to retrieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPer\u2019aps yer auntie gave it to Kritanu.\u201d</p><p>Victoria shook her head. \u201cNo, she did not, for he gave me all of her personal effects, and it was not there.\u201d</p><p>The apple-cheeked maid tsked, pity curving her lips down at the corners. Then they tilted up. \u201cBut, my lady, ye\u2019ve forgotten someone did see th\u2019 body after. He must\u2019ve, in order to send ye her vis bulla. Perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Victoria said again, rising to go to the bed, her head suddenly aching. \u201cThat is the biggest part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>Not only would she have to keep the vampires from finding the keys and opening the Magic Door...but now it appeared she would have to find some way to contact Sebastian and ask for his help.</p><p>Then he would, as usual, expect her to demonstrate some form of gratitude for said help.</p><p>And, truth be told, she could think of worse things to do. Much worse.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s meeting with Ylito was delayed to just before noon on a rainy morning two days after her mother and friends arrived. Even so, it was pure luck that she\u2019d actually been able to slip out of the villa that day, for Melly had planned to take her to see the Colosseum, but had developed a headache. Victoria had quickly seized upon a similar excuse, retreating to her room and instructing Verbena to allow no one to enter until the next morning.\u201cThis is the first day she\u2019s not dragged me about shopping, viewing the sights, parading around the city,\u201d Victoria hissed as she slipped back down through the servants\u2019 hall to the exit. \u201cPray God she has the headache all afternoon and misses dinner as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, milady, ye shouldn\u2019t wish such stuff on yer mama,\u201d Verbena cautioned. \u201cShe can\u2019 help it if she jus\u2019 wants t\u2019 show ye off and dress ye pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me off is rather more accurate,\u201d Victoria mumbled, tamping away the guilty feeling. She paused with her hand on the back door. \u201cAnd for someone so concerned with propriety, the fact that it\u2019s been only three months since Aunt Eustacia died and we\u2019re not expected to be in mourning is surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019T might be so, milady, but close as ye were to her, she was still jus\u2019 yer great-aunt. Not so long fer mournin\u2019, even back in Lunnon, but ye\u2019re in Rome now. An\u2019 if Lady Melly was in mournin\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t be able t\u2019 go to Carnivale this week.\u201d Verbena looked up at her, and Victoria saw sympathy in her cornflower eyes. \u201cYe\u2019re still so young and pretty, milady. Yer mama jus\u2019 wants ye to find happiness. She wants t\u2019 erase that sadness in yer eyes.\u201d</p><p>Happiness. Victoria wasn\u2019t sure it was possible.</p><p>Perhaps not happiness, then, but contentment. Or at least satisfaction that her place on earth was as more than merely one half of a marriage, a womb to bear an heir, or a showpiece for her mother to flaunt.</p><p>Victoria had a more important, more difficult role than most women\u2014or men\u2014could imagine. If she could find the same satisfaction and peace her aunt had as Illa Gardella, Victoria could ask for little more.</p><p>Because her mother delayed her, Victoria was late meeting Ylito at what was left of the Villa Palombara. Despite the early February chill and dampness, she had Oliver drive a circuitous route in the city in order to make certain no one was following her from Aunt Eustacia\u2019s villa. When the barouche stopped in front of the crumbling wall shaded by the old oak that had grown through it, Oliver turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cThis the meeting place?\u201d He looked at her questioningly. Not only was his driving gentler than that of Barth back in London, but his care for her safety was as well. Unlike Barth, Oliver wasn\u2019t as keen on leaving a woman alone on the streets, particularly in areas that could be considered dangerous.</p><p>Of course, unlike Barth, Oliver had never seen Victoria fight vampires.</p><p>\u201cYes, you may let me off here and return to the villa.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never seen a person with such dark skin as Ylito. Even Kritanu, who had the mahogany skin and sleek dark hair of his Indian heritage, had lighter coloring than the hermetist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, you are the new Illa Gardella,\u201d he said, looking at her soberly. Victoria was surprised at his low, smooth voice; for some reason she\u2019d expected him to sound as exotic as he looked, with his walnut skin and hair that spun out in tight, finger-length coils all over his head. His family was originally from Egypt, Wayren had told her, but Ylito\u2019s grandfather had left the land of the pyramids and come to study with the Venators in Rome nearly a century ago.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are the mysterious Ylito,\u201d she replied, and felt compelled to make a brief bow to him. \u201cI am delighted to meet you, particularly since I understand you rarely venture out.\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he was at least two decades, or more, older than her own twenty-one years. He was dressed in boots and breeches and a coat and shirtwaist, as any other man of the times would be, but with his dark skin and regal bearing, he still looked exotic. He gave her a formal bow in return. \u201cCome, let us look at this strange door.\u201d</p> <p>Now, in the daylight, Victoria could really see the deep split in the wall. It was caused by a low branch of the large oak growing through what had likely been a small crack at one time, but as the oak\u2019s branch and trunk filled out, it had opened the wall. The shadow of the large tree, along with a mess of leafless vines, had helped to camouflage the opening.</p><p>With Ylito\u2019s help, Victoria climbed through the crack, turning sideways so she could slip through the wet stone. She couldn\u2019t help but think it was best that Zavier wasn\u2019t there, for he would never have fit his bulky muscles through the slender opening. As soon as Ylito stepped both feet on the ground, they started off, Victoria leading the way.</p><p>The ground was wet and muddy, seeping into Victoria\u2019s slippers, and the budding leaves had begun to shoot into green furls that would soon thicken the view even more.</p><p>Ylito made a disgusted comment under his breath as he paused to wipe mud from the side of his boot, but then he followed behind Victoria as they traipsed through thigh-high grass toward an awkward-looking gray-brick building. What must have been the main part of the villa loomed high behind it, and was made of the yellowish stone most common in Rome.</p><p>As Victoria trudged along, she turned her mind from the chill of her cold, wet gown to something nearly as uncomfortable: how to find Sebastian.</p> <p>In London she had been able to go to his pub, the Silver Chalice, to contact him, but it had been destroyed. The last time she\u2019d seen him was here in Rome, when, with his usual talent, he\u2019d simply shown up when she didn\u2019t necessarily want him to. Short of putting a notice in the newspaper, there was little she could do to find him.</p><p>But then a thought struck her. Sebastian had introduced her to two young women, twins named Portiera and Placidia. Perhaps if she called on them she might be able to learn how to find Sebastian in this city.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that her mother would love to see her interested in making social calls.</p><p>Since Lady Melly had arrived, Victoria had spent the last two nights at home with her aunt and friends, playing whist, catching up on gossip, and generally doing the things she thought she\u2019d left behind when she married and moved from her mother\u2019s home. Even as a marchioness she was expected to have social obligations\u2014but at least they would be under her own terms.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Victoria said, gesturing to the wall made of slim gray stones stacked atop one another as she and Ylito passed through the same gate that the vampires had used two nights before. Off to the right was the smooth white lintel framing a solid stone door.</p><p>\u201cLa Porta Alchemica,\u201d said Ylito, stepping toward it.</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s sodden skirt brushed against him as she too moved toward the door. It was not a particularly large one, now that she saw it in full daylight. Just an average size, low enough that someone as tall as Max might have to duck to cross the threshold.</p><p>She watched as Ylito smoothed his dark hand over the white marble as though reading with his fingertips the symbols carved there. Above the door was a large circle carving, within which were two triangles superimposed on each other, one pointing up and the other pointing down, and a cross stamped on top of them.</p><p>\u201cJupiter...tin...diameter sphaerae thau...circli...non orbis prosunt... Venus...copper...\u201d murmured Ylito, moving his hand down the right side of the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlchemical symbols\u2014this is for the planet Jupiter,\u201d he said, showing her the top carving that looked like a cross with an arrow pointing to the right, \u201cand represents the metal tin. Below it, the symbol of feminity, or Venus, the circle with the cross below it. There is Mercury and Mars...\u201d he added, gesturing to the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it all mean?\u201d</p><p>Again Ylito flashed his white teeth. \u201cI do not know, and apparently neither did Palombara. As the story goes, he found the papers of an alchemist who came to Rome searching for a mysterious herb. After the alchemist disappeared, Palombara studied his journals and had some of the content engraved on the door. For example, under the Jupiter symbol it says, \u2018the sphere\u2019s diameter, the circle\u2019s tau, and the globe\u2019s cross are of no use to the blind.\u2019 It simply means one might have the tools, but if one doesn\u2019t know how to put them to use, they\u2019re worthless.\u201d</p><p>Victoria, looking at the odd symbols, couldn\u2019t agree more.</p> <p>A large dial was set into the stone of the portal, covering about the center half of the entrance. The round disk, which was flush with its setting, was formed of a different color stone and had the shape of a triangle carved into its face. At each of the three corners was a small rectangular notch, no more than two fingers wide and one thumb-length long. Victoria could see that the dirt and moss had been scraped away from the bottom right-hand notch, as though someone had recently slipped something into the hole.</p><p>She pushed her fingers in, examining the stone around the opening of what must be one of the keyholes, though it looked nothing like any keyhole she\u2019d ever seen. Which made her realize that the key was perhaps not a long metal one with notches carved on one side, but something different. More of a small tab that would slide into the small opening. \u201cYlito, look at this.\u201d</p><p>He crouched next to her with a faint pop in one of his knees and thrust his fingers sideways into the notch. They disappeared up to his second knuckles, and his dark eyes lit up with interest. \u201cThe key. One of the keys has been found.\u201d He looked up at her, more animation in his face than she\u2019d seen yet today. Obviously this was a fascination to him. \u201cSi, that slot has the key slid in, unable to be retrieved until the door is opened. It has been fitted into place, and there it will stay. Each key fits in its slot and lifts the insides of the lock, and thus allows the disk to turn. That will open the door.\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded, her heart filling her chest. Was the missing key the one that had been given to Augmentin Gardella and then passed down to Aunt Eustacia? How could they know? Had the others been found?</p><p>Then she noticed that the moss and dirt had been cleaned off just above the notch, and that there was a faint carving on it.</p><p>Ylito was already looking at the etched lettering, his quick, dark hands passing over it as if it would help him to read it. \u201cThat is the name of the key. \u2018Deus et homo,\u2019 God and man. And see, there: its symbol\u2014a large circle with rays like the sun, with a smaller circle inside it, resting at the bottom. It will be carved on the key itself, so that the user knows where it fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other two?\u201d Victoria crouched so she could look at the bottom left corner of the triangle, using her nails to scrape away the moss, feeling the grit of moist dirt. \u201cThey\u2019re named as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are all noted here, in this symbol above the door,\u201d Ylito said, drawing her attention to the large circle above the door. \u201cSee, it names the keys\u2014\u2018tri sunt mirabilia: Deus et homo, mater et virgo, trinus et unus,\u2019 that means \u2018three are the wonders: God and man, mother and virgin, the one and three.\u2019 The wonders are represented by the three keys that will give access to this secret laboratory.\u201d</p><p>Victoria saw the words carved around the circle, and bent back down to the lower left key slot, scraping the dirt away. She uncovered enough to see that it was the \u201cmater et virgo\u201d\u2014mother and virgin\u2014key, and then sat back on her heels, heedless of the wet grass bleeding into her thighs and rump, her heart thumping hard in her chest. \u201cAnd this?\u201d she asked, relief beginning to creep through her muscles.</p><p>\u201cThis is the slot for the \u2018mater et virgo\u2019 key,\u201d he said easily, tracing the symbols. \u201cA slender crescent moon to the left, representing the virgin, curving away from and touching the full, ripe circle of the mother.\u201d He looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s two parts of a common ancient symbol of the three goddesses: virgin, mother, crone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Eustacia\u2019s armband is marked with that very same symbol of mother and virgin. They haven\u2019t found her key yet.\u201d</p><p>Ylito\u2019s face settled into a smooth mask. \u201cBut we see here evidence that someone is looking for it now.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>In Which Victoria Develops an Acute Dislike of Sugarplums</p><p>\u201cSo how do you find your first Roman Carnivale?\u201d asked Zavier, looking down at Victoria as he was jolted into her side by an overzealous celebrant.</p><p>Since it was at least the dozenth time he\u2019d bumped into her, or she into him, Victoria hardly noticed the shove; she was concentrating on keeping her papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask in place. \u201cIt is like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d she replied with abject honesty. \u201cThe people seem to have gone insane!\u201d While she could fully understand why it was important for the Venators to be out in the streets during the eight nights of Carnivale, she wasn\u2019t as convinced of the necessity of wearing a mask.If the jostled eyeholes weren\u2019t obstructing her view, the long beak of her bird-face was bumping into the person in front of her, or being knocked to the side by someone throwing a plaster sugarplum.</p><p>Or being hit by one, which had happened more than once, as evidenced by the white marks on her mask and clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zavier laughed easily, but she noticed his attention didn\u2019t falter from the activity going on around them. With all of the revelry and masquerading on the wide street of Corso spilling into the smaller, darker side streets, the night was rife with the possibility of vampire attacks\u2014or worse, kidnappings by members of the Tutela for their vampire masters. And now the new threat of being taken off and beheaded, for some inexplicable reason. So far neither of them had encountered any undead, but it was barely midnight, and dawn was a long way off on this February night.</p><p>Although Carnivale had been going on for almost a week, this was the first night Victoria and Zavier had gone out patrolling for undead together. It was also the first time she\u2019d gone hunting since her mother arrived, and since she and Ylito had visited the Magic Door...other than the time she\u2019d surreptitiously slipped a stake into the chest of a vampire who\u2019d dared to sneak up on Lady Nilly when they were going home after a late Carnivale party.</p><p>To Lady Melly\u2019s great joy, Victoria had put her secret plan to find Sebastian into action by looking up the Tarruscelli twins, Portiera and Placidia. Unfortunately an afternoon of tea with them had turned into a series of invitations to Carnivale parties, races, and the sharing of their balcony overlooking the Corso, where all of the festivities took place. Victoria felt odd being thrust back into a world of society and parties after turning her attention\u2014and her life\u2014to her Venator duties. It felt foreign to her in a way it hadn\u2019t even after she\u2019d rejoined Society following Phillip\u2019s death.</p> <p>Perhaps she really had left all of that behind.</p><p>In return for having to sit and make conversation, while chafing about the other things that needed to be tended to, Victoria had had no luck in turning the conversation with the twins to Sebastian or learning of his whereabouts.</p><p>Perhaps he wasn\u2019t even in Rome anymore.</p><p>At any rate, tonight Victoria had managed to dislodge her mother\u2019s manipulative fingers (\u201cBut the Barone Zacardi is ever so smitten with you!\u201d) and plead exhaustion so that she could stay home. Ilias had explained that tonight was Rose Monday, the second-to-last night of Carnivale, and the fever pitch of excitement\u2014and danger\u2014would continue to grow until it reached its peak tomorrow night.</p><p>Lady Melly and the others planned to join the Tarruscellis, along with some other new acquaintances\u2014including the bound-to-be-disappointed Barone Zacardi\u2014in their red-draped balcony, so they could watch the street below. Victoria was relieved to be out on the street with her stake\u2014masked or otherwise\u2014and doing her job. Plus, she had another idea about how to contact Sebastian, and she was going to attempt it tonight.</p> <p>The smell of roasting chestnuts tinged the air, drawing her from her thoughts, and Victoria felt a sudden pang of hunger. The fragrant nuts reminded her of Christmases spent at her family\u2019s estate of Prewitt Shore with her mother and her two friends, long before any of their husbands had died. At that house at least one of her meals during the holidays would be made up only of hot nut meats and warm milk.</p><p>\u201cZavier.\u201d She turned to look at him, but her mask was knocked askew again. She reached up and pushed the long, narrow bird-beak back into place, and when her eyeholes were realigned, she saw that Zavier was nowhere in sight.</p><p>If she were a normal woman, with normal strength and no capability to defend herself, she might be terrified at being separated from her male companion in the middle of the boisterous festival at midnight. But instead Victoria directed herself to the side of the broad, thronged Corso, where a man and his wife were selling hot chestnuts. Her stake was safely in the deep pocket of her loose costume, and Verbena had made certain that Victoria\u2019s other pocket included a pistol, along with a few \u00e9cus for such an occasion as this.</p><p>She pulled out one of the coins to pay for the chestnuts, and just as she turned back to look toward the wide thoroughfare, Victoria felt another sugarplum slam into the back of her shoulder. This one was harder than any of the others; as if it had been thrown from close proximity.</p><p>She whipped around, her hand going automatically to her stake even though the back of her neck wasn\u2019t any colder than it had been moments before...and even though this was all supposed to be in the name of revelry. This time, miraculously, her mask stayed in place, and she turned to see a slight figure twisting away to slip through the crowd.</p><p>She started after the figure, a sense of recognition niggling deep in her mind with an impression of dark eyes behind a peacock mask, and a certain familiarity of movement.</p> <p>Suddenly something grabbed her arm from behind, and Victoria pivoted back, hand groping for her pistol. \u201cZavier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you going?\u201d he asked. \u201cI lost ye for a moment there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...went to get some chestnuts, but I couldn\u2019t find you, and then someone threw a sugarplum at me. Again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and turned her away. \u201cI see it. Another powdery white spot on your shoulder.\u201d He slipped an arm around hers, as naturally as if he\u2019d always done so. \u201cI\u2019ve seen not one vampire here tonight, nor felt\u2014\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as the hair lifted at the back of her neck in a definite chill. They looked at each other. \u201cThis way,\u201d Victoria said, starting off in the direction the figure had gone.</p><p>Whether it was a coincidence or not, she didn\u2019t know. But they went off through the crowds, pushing through the revelers, on the trail of the first vampire they\u2019d sensed all night.</p><p>Moving through the streets, they soon left the celebration behind them, and Victoria realized they were walking up a small hill. At the top she could see the outline of monuments and gravestones.</p><p>A cemetery. Not a bad place to find an undead.</p> <p>She took off her mask and adjusted the stake she now held as they walked through the open iron gate.</p><p>\u201cDo ye hear something?\u201d Zavier asked, stopping next to her.</p><p>Up here, in the yard of death away from the insanity of the festival below, the night was quiet but for the occasional shout or shrill laugh far in the distance. Monuments and headstones made tall, stark shadows over the dark grass.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, walking on, mask dangling from her hand. The fresh air felt good on her face, now that it was uncovered, but the back of her neck had warmed slightly, and the fine hairs there had flattened. She\u2019d lost the scent.</p><p>\u201cNae many vampires during Carnivale this year,\u201d Zavier said, walking along with her. His shoulder bumped against hers, then drew away as he kept on. \u201cPerhaps they\u2019ve all cloistered away since the death of Nedas, trying to get organized again.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had killed Lilith\u2019s son, Nedas, at the same time Akvan\u2019s Obelisk had been destroyed. Nedas had been a powerful leader among the vampires in Rome who\u2019d been served by the Tutela. With his destruction, the fate of his followers and the Tutela had been thrown into question, along with the issue of who would succeed him.</p><p>\u201cI hardly think that Beauregard would lose his opportunity to gain control of the vampire underworld in Rome,\u201d Victoria replied, stepping over a low iron fence. Its spike caught at the hem of her trousers\u2014thank heaven her mother hadn\u2019t been around to see her wearing them. \u201cHe was fairly salivating at the news of Nedas\u2019s death, and intended to execute Max that night while the vampires looked on.\u201d Her fingers were cold, but the air was only chilly. \u201cWe barely made it out alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there not another vampire who wished to succeed Nedas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, the Conte Regalado, who was the leader of the Tutela, wanted it very badly. He is a newly turned vampire, and young in his power, but it seems as if he may have not only the support of the Tutela, but also of some of Nedas\u2019s followers. It was partly due to Regalado\u2019s interference that Max and I were able to escape from Beauregard.\u201d Regalado was also the father of the woman Max had intended to marry, a woman who enjoyed being fed upon by vampires.</p><p>Victoria wondered, fleetingly, if Sarafina\u2019s father ever fed on her, now that he was a vampire. He was vulgar enough to do so.</p><p>And Sarafina was indecent enough to let him.</p><p>The truth was, Victoria wouldn\u2019t have escaped the battle between the two factions of vampires without the assistance of Sebastian Vioget. But at least now she thought she had a way of finding him.</p><p>Lost in her thoughts, Victoria didn\u2019t realize Zavier had stopped walking until something snagged her sleeve. Dropping her mask, she whirled around, stake raised, and nearly drove it into his barrel chest.</p><p>Instead of being surprised or taken aback by her offensive stance, he looked at her with a glint of humor in his expression. \u201cYe can put that down for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d Victoria replied, spying a movement in the shadows behind him. The hair on the back of her neck lifted, and the chill intensified again.</p><p>Stake in hand, she started off after the glowing red eyes, leaping over a gravestone and slipping a little when she landed on the damp grass.</p><p>The vampire must have thought he\u2019d come upon two lovers strolling through the graveyard, taking a quiet moment away from Carnivale; for until Victoria landed in front of him, stake at the ready, he\u2019d remained hovering in the bushes. When he saw that she\u2019d fearlessly come after him, he turned and ran.</p><p>Elated, Victoria followed. She loved the feeling of letting herself go, of running, leaping over the stones and low fences, dashing around a crumbling mausoleum, and finally throwing herself at the vampire. She crashed into him, barely feeling the impact, and they tumbled to the ground. The loose legs of her costume wrapped around their calves as he rolled on top of her, fangs bared.</p><p>His eyes were red, the color of Chianti, glowing as he bent his face down toward her. She could smell blood on his breath, and she dropped her stake, reaching up to grab him by the shoulders and fling him onto his back. He was young and relatively weak, and would be perfect for the message she needed to send.</p><p>But suddenly there was a whistle of movement and the vampire jerked, then froze, then burst into a cloud of dust and musty ash. It poofed onto her face and into her hair and lashes, and Victoria looked up to see Zavier standing over her. He was offering a hand to help her up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d She ignored his hand and rolled easily to her feet, barely breathing hard, stake again in hand. For a moment she wanted to plant it in that big barrel chest in front of her. Damn and blast! The first vampire she\u2019d seen in a week, and he was gone before she could talk to him. Now she\u2019d have to find another one tonight\u2014although it shouldn\u2019t be hard, really, since they were bound to be out on the Corso.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I was helpin\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had things well in hand. I didn\u2019t need help. I wanted to talk to him, not kill him.\u201d The thrill of the fight had gone out of her and left Victoria with a rumbling annoyance and the feeling of unfinished business. Not to mention covered with vampire dust.</p> <p>\u201cYe appeared to be in danger, so I wasna going to stand by and watch him maul you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at him as she brushed the dank ash from her hair and clothes. They were nearly the same height, although he was much bulkier than she. \u201cI am capable of staking a single vampire,\u201d she said slowly and distinctly, her nerves still wanting to jump. \u201cI\u2019ve done it many times before. In fact,\u201d she said, closing her eyes to finger away the dust on her lashes as much as to retain the evenness of her voice, \u201cI have fought five at a time, and won. I purposely didn\u2019t kill him because I needed him to take a message for me.\u201d A message to Beauregard that she was looking for his grandson.</p><p>But, of course, Zavier wouldn\u2019t have\u2014couldn\u2019t have\u2014known that. He didn\u2019t even know anything about the Door of Alchemy.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Zavier was still looking at her. But instead of bafflement or chagrin or even annoyance, his expression was filled with admiration. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cFool that I was, I forgot that you of all women dinna need protection.\u201d</p><p>The smile he gave her there, in the cold cemetery, warmed Victoria from her cheeks down to her toes, and she had to glance away for fear her face would start to glow. Although fighting her way through undead immortals and evil demons was becoming second nature to her, she was less sure of herself when interacting with men.</p> <p>She\u2019d debuted into London Society just about a year and a half ago, and had been in mourning for her husband, Phillip, for a twelvemonth of that period, during which, of course, she\u2019d worn black and stayed cloistered in her husband\u2019s home\u2014far away from members of the opposite sex. No fetes, no balls, no theater engagements. She\u2019d been lonely and grieving and trying desperately to determine how to fit the two parts of her life together.</p><p>She had come to the realization that there was no way to have a real life, with a real relationship with a man. Her life was with the Venators, especially now, as Illa Gardella. She would touch Society from time to time, but she would never be immersed in it as she once had been. She\u2019d never marry again, never have a child, much as her mother might wish it.</p><p>But then, as she looked over at Zavier and saw the admiration and attraction in his face, she wondered if it had to be thus. If she really did have to be alone and keep anyone who might care about her\u2014or whom she might care for\u2014at arm\u2019s length. The last vestiges of her annoyance filtered away.</p><p>\u201cI hope that ye will forgive me,\u201d he was saying, and somehow he\u2019d taken her hand in his large warm one. The one that wasn\u2019t holding the stake. \u201c\u2019Tis just that I am\u2014that a man is\u2014bound to protect a woman. And I dinna think of you as a warrior, yet I ken that you are a fierce one. \u2019Tis hard to reconcile that with...well...\u201d His voice trailed off, and Victoria would have believed he was blushing if his face weren\u2019t already a bit ruddy from the cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d she said, when he appeared unable to select the words to finish his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. Zavier, if ever I need assistance, it will be obvious.\u201d</p><p>He was looking down at their joined hands, her small white one in his, and when he raised his face again she felt her heart begin to pound.</p> <p>Before he could speak, a rustling in the bushes near a large tomb drew their attention. Zavier\u2019s hand tightened on hers in warning, and then released. They both moved silently across a fenced expanse of grass toward the stone structure. It was nearly as large as a small home, its cream-colored stucco appearing gray and forbidding in the sliver of moonlight.</p><p>The front of the mausoleum was grand, its upper edge topped with a wide, jutting cornice and studded at its corners with curling plaster leaves. The family name carved into the frieze was covered with moss, and illegible from where Victoria stood. A square cupola that might have contained a bell was perched in the center of the flat roof. What must be the main entrance, set partially below the ground and reached by a few descending steps, was flanked by two columns. The bushes that had rustled were part of a large clump of pines and holly oaks that grew in a thick cluster close to the tomb, casting the area in wide shadow.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s neck was no colder than the February air made it naturally, so she was certain the only vampire in the vicinity was the one Zavier had staked. Perhaps there was no threat at all, and it had been merely a hedgehog or hare that bounded through the foliage.</p><p>But then she saw a flash of something light in the brush, and then heard more rustling as she and Zavier drew closer. To his credit he didn\u2019t try to hold her back, or even to take the lead. They hurried together, following the rustling bushes, but suddenly Victoria sensed something\u2014or someone\u2014behind her.</p><p>She whirled just in time to see a large black canvas whipping down toward her. With a shout to warn Zavier, she ducked away and spun back around to see two large men swooping toward her again. They\u2019d come from the other side of the mausoleum.</p><p>Using a gravestone to leverage herself, Victoria kicked out and caught one of them in the gut, sending him sprawling, along with the blanket he\u2019d been brandishing. The other reached for her arm, and she twisted away with such force she went sprawling into the bay laurel bush where she\u2019d seen the flash of white.</p><p>The branches were tough and prickly, and it didn\u2019t help that her attacker had followed her and was trying to manhandle her out of the bush. She heard a shout, and looked up to see Zavier standing behind the man, hands on his hips, watching.</p><p>At least he\u2019d learned.</p> <p>But then something leaped on him from behind, and then another large body crashed into the fray, and she saw Zavier go down in a mass of fists and legs.</p><p>With a howl Victoria kicked out at her assailant, the force propelling her farther into the brush. But she managed to roll to the side, off the bush, and onto the ground. She swept to her feet and, as she spun around, caught sight of something in the dark foliage behind her.</p><p>A pale face, with light hair. A body that moved away through the bushes, using the same lithe movements as the one who\u2019d thrown the sugarplum at her.</p><p>But before she could react, something shoved her to the ground again, and she landed with a whump, face-first into the slick grass. The black canvas came flying down over her, covering her face and down over the front of her before she could roll away, and it clung to her when her attacker lifted her up.</p><p>Strong arms wrapped around her, holding the canvas and her own arms close to her body. Suffocating under the heavy material, Victoria kicked and twisted until she landed two good blows against the legs of the man who held her, then slammed her head backward.</p><p>The satisfying crunch and the sudden loosening of her person told her she\u2019d hit the mark, even as her head swam. She tumbled to the ground, and it took her more than a moment to fling off the folds of the canvas and scramble to her feet.</p><p>By the time she was upright, Zavier was standing in front of her. His red hair stuck out in tufts at the edge of his crown, and he was breathing heavily. \u201cAll right?\u201d he asked with a satisfied grin.</p><p>She looked around. Their assailants were gone and it was just the two of them, panting in the middle of a dark graveyard. She turned toward the brush, where she\u2019d seen the face she was sure she\u2019d recognized. Nothing was there but flattened bushes and broken twigs\u2014both from her own tumble into the foliage and whoever had been watching.</p><p>\u201cThey got away,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAye, they did. Surprised me\u2014three of them all at once. A stake wasna much use against \u2019em,\u201d he said companionably.</p><p>He was right, and Venators didn\u2019t generally fight with guns or knives. Their prey was the undead, not human threats. But it didn\u2019t seem to bother him that their attackers had gotten away.</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d she asked, looking around. \u201cAnd why did they want to abduct me? Did they try to kidnap you too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it just seemed they wanted me out of the way so they could get to you. They all ran off when they saw they couldn\u2019t get the best of us.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked up. The wall of the mausoleum stretched above her, and she could see the impressions of the family name. She couldn\u2019t make out all of the letters, but she saw enough to know that the face she\u2019d seen in the bushes, the person who had caught her attention by throwing the sugarplum so hard, had indeed been Sarafina Regalado.</p><p>But the question was, what was Max\u2019s fianc\u00e9e doing at her family tomb in the middle of the night?</p><p>Five</p><p>In Which a Message Is Delivered</p><p>On the last night of Carnivale, the Corso was filled with a blaze of light.</p><p>The entire population of the city seemed to fill the broad strada and its connecting piazza to bursting before it spilled into the narrower Ripetta and other streets. Each person held tightly in one hand to a large twisted candle, or moccoletto, and a long switch topped by a handkerchief in the other. The small blazes danced and glowed, painting the buildings and masked faces and elegant carriages in a yellow-white splash as the partygoers used their handkerchiefs to flick at the flames of nearby candles.The game was to extinguish someone\u2019s light or have one\u2019s own extinguished, all in a frenetic, rollicking mass of milling Romans.</p><p>Victoria had never seen the like, this blast of illumination from thousands of Romans crowding the street. They even called down from crimson-draped balconies\u2014one of which hosted Lady Melly and friends\u2014holding their moccoli aloft. Victoria could barely breathe, the area was so thronged with bodies and carriages, and tinged with the scent of burning wax, the smell of so many people packed so tightly in the street, the overriding crispness of the cool air. Victoria was thankful the propellants of last night\u2019s plaster sugarplums had given way to the friendlier, softer touch of flapping handkerchiefs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This final night of revelry, the eve of Ash Wednesday, was the wildest, loudest, most beautiful festival she\u2019d ever experienced, and although she would rather have been seated safely in a high barouche where she could gape all she liked, Victoria had other responsibilities.</p><p>Her switch, in fact, was more than a bit thicker than the ones other revelers were holding. In fact, it was not only thicker, but had been whittled to a lethal point on the bottom end.</p><p>Eschewing the long-beaked peregrine mask she\u2019d worn the night before, Victoria had donned a more manageable one tonight. The upper part of her face was covered by a gold mask painted with glittering streaks of blue and green, sparkling curlicues of orange and pink, and had no protrusions that would catch on nearby shoulders. White feathers sprouted from the top and sides, and long curls of red ribbon hung from the edges to her shoulders. Only her mouth and chin were free, which made eating those delicious roasted chestnuts and speaking much easier than the previous evening\u2019s disguise.</p> <p>\u201cSenza moccolo!\u201d a man masked as a banditto shouted in her ear, and he flicked his switch toward her candle.</p><p>As she had quickly learned to do, Victoria shielded her flame whilst grabbing at the handkerchief, and plucked the switch from the person\u2019s hand. With a nod behind her own mask, she tossed away the handkerchief, but left off from dousing the switch holder\u2019s taper.</p><p>Zavier looked at her. \u201cYou are very quick,\u201d he said with a smile beneath the heavy-brimmed sombrero he\u2019d chosen to wear this night. She wasn\u2019t certain how he\u2019d gotten away without wearing a mask when Ilias had insisted she do so. \u201cYou protect your candle like you protect those of this city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is madness,\u201d Victoria said, looking about. All she could see were large, painted masks and acres of shoulders and necks and throats everywhere, everywhere. Cast in shadows below arm level, lit from above, glowing and stark by turns in the night, loud and more of a crush than any ballroom back in London, the extinguishing ceremony was by turns breathtaking and horrific. \u201cEven if I knew a vampire was about, I\u2019d never be able to identify it, let alone get to him or her.\u201d She had to raise her voice to be heard above the din.</p><p>\u201cAye, so perhaps we ought to just enjoy the festivities as much as possible until the candles are doused at midnight and everyone begins to go home. After that it will be much easier to move about.\u201d The way he looked at her, so intently for a moment, as his hat brushed the feathers of her mask, made her stomach do a little flip.</p> <p>But before Victoria could reply, a sudden prickle at the back of her neck intensified into a chill. She turned quickly, sensing the presence of an undead in close proximity, and her shoulder slammed into the angel next to her, and then into a gypsy, and then into an owl, as the masked people pushed past her.</p><p>Glancing back toward Zavier, she saw him starting off in the opposite direction as if he, too, had felt something and was pursuing it. Despite their agreement about the difficulty of identifying undead in this crowd, neither of them would stand aside and do nothing when a vampire was near.</p><p>They were well separated by now, and as Victoria turned once again and tried to move in the opposite direction from the people near her, she scanned the crowd, looking for red irises behind the masks that streamed past her, or for a disguise that could be covering the face of Sara Regalado.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to sense which direction to go after the creature that skulked nearby, and finally set off toward the left, through the milling people. The chill at the back of her neck began to intensify as she made her way through to the edges of the crowd. Suddenly, not so far from the darkness that lingered beyond the revelry, she saw the glowing red orbs in a masked face two persons away.</p><p>Edging her shoulder through the throng, playing the senzo moccoletto game, Victoria squirmed along until she was close enough to touch the vampire. Her neck was frigid, and she felt the odd rush of the presence the undead gave in close proximity. Angling her switch cum stake, Victoria turned to face him\u2014or her; she wasn\u2019t certain of the creature\u2019s gender\u2014and closed her fingers around an arm.</p><p>The crowd was so thick and full of shouts and movement and the flicking of switches that Victoria could have slammed the stake into the vampire\u2019s chest before he realized that she was a Venator, and without drawing any attention to herself, but she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Instead she said, \u201cTell Beauregard the female Venator is looking for his grandson.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, fangs gleaming. \u201cI\u2019m no message boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t? Well, then, my apologies.\u201d She moved easily, angling her stake, plunging it up and into his chest.</p><p>The vampire disintegrated, as vampires did, into a poof of ash that burst over the partygoers, causing a dainty little shepherdess to forget about protecting her moccoletto for a moment in favor of brushing away the sudden gust of dust.</p><p>The chilly prickling at the back of Victoria\u2019s neck had eased, but had not disappeared completely. There were other vampires in the vicinity. Perhaps one of them would rather be a message boy than a pile of dust.</p><p>Even so, she\u2019d already given the message to two others last night, after returning to Carnivale from the graveyard and Sara Regalado\u2019s aborted kidnap attempt. Perhaps that would be enough to get the message to Sebastian.</p><p>Her neck still prickling, she began to push her way back through the crowd in search of Zavier. Behind her Victoria heard the shepherdess\u2019s shriek of annoyance as her candle was doused.</p><p>Suddenly something slammed into her from behind. She stumbled and would have fallen to the ground had she not knocked into a Pulcinella. Her flame guttered in its pooled wax, and the Pulcinella whipped his switch-laden handkerchief down on her moccoletto.</p> <p>When Victoria regained her balance and turned, her now-dark candle still steady in her grip, she found herself face-to-face with a masked man. His eyes weren\u2019t red, and she couldn\u2019t see the shape or color of them behind his black domino. But she recognized the angle of his chin, and the crop of fair curls that brushed the side of his neck. The smile he gave her was bemused, and laced with challenge.</p><p>Apparently the message had been delivered.</p><p>Before she could speak he moved sharply, yanking a nearby Joan of Arc between them and pushing off through the crowd.</p><p>Victoria shoved a laughing Saint Joan out of her way and followed, her heart pounding. She didn\u2019t hesitate to go after him, even though she certainly recognized that she\u2019d been followed twice in as many nights, despite wearing two different masks. It was a risk, but not an unexpected one.</p><p>Her stake was in her hand, and another was in a deep pocket where she also had a metal dagger Kritanu had given her when she started her ankathari training. The kadhara had a curved blade and was about the length of her forearm. She was also protected by the large crucifix she wore beneath her costume, not to mention her duo of vis bullae.</p><p>Watching the back of the shadowy domino and following its irregular path through the crowd was no easy task. He didn\u2019t carry a taper and Victoria\u2019s had been extinguished, so as they neared the edge of the light-filled festival, she paused to catch a flame from the fat wick of a donkey\u2019s candle.</p><p>When she pushed through the last barrier of people and found herself in a small, narrow viuzza\u2014what she would call a mews back in London\u2014Victoria stopped and looked around. It was an odd setting: behind her thousands upon thousands of people laughing and shouting with their glowing yellow candles, and here, in front of her, a dark alleyway lit only by her single flame, and silent. Still as death.</p><p>Her neck was still cold, the hair still raised to attention, but she saw no one. He\u2019d been there a moment before, just as she burst free of the crowd, but now she was alone.</p><p>Ripe for another black canvas cloth to come wafting down over her head.</p><p>Victoria braced herself, half crouched, turning slowly and peering into the shadows. Then she saw one of them move.</p><p>\u201cAh, it is you. I was not altogether certain, but the way you wielded that stake convinced me.\u201d The voice was soft as the figure moved into the dim light.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard.\u201d Victoria stepped toward him, warily casting about to see if he was alone, or if someone lurked nearby to pounce on her from behind. Sebastian, perhaps. Her stake was firm in her palm. The back of her neck remained cold and prickly. But it itched, as though there were something else watching them. \u201cDid you receive my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why else would I seek you out?\u201d His response was easy, but she could sense the respect and wariness in his demeanor as he flipped back the hood of his domino.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the message was garbled, then,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt was your grandson I wished to speak with. Not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t brandish that stake as though you are a novice Venator out for her first hunt,\u201d he said, crossing his arms over his middle in a picture of nonchalance that pulled up one of his sleeves and revealed a strong, elegant wrist. The stance, the expression on his face, reminded her again of Sebastian.</p><p>Although the two shared a similar, elegant facial structure and thick, curling hair, there wasn\u2019t a great resemblance otherwise. Beauregard, who must have been in his forties when he was turned, had a slightly wider nose and more delicate lips than his grandson, and his hair was more of a silvery blond than the tawny color of Sebastian\u2019s. He was handsome enough in his own cool fashion, and that, along with his persistent charm, and the fact that he was exceedingly well dressed, was what reminded her of the younger man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing to threaten you or to harm anyone,\u201d Beauregard continued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been undead for four hundred years; I\u2019m fairly certain you\u2019ve mauled at least one mortal during that time. And once you\u2019ve fed from one mortal, your sentence of eternal damnation is assured. I thought I might help you more quickly on your way there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...almost six hundred years, my dear Victoria. Six hundred. Yet, a pittance when one looks at the age of the elegant Lilith, yes?\u201d He shifted, his eyes beginning to glow ruby, narrowing with annoyance. \u201cPut the stake away. After all, you did send the message, and it\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve tried to bite you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI expect it will be only a matter of time until you do,\u201d Victoria replied.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Beauregard grinned, and now his fangs flashed. They were no longer than a man\u2019s first knuckle, but sharp as a razor. So sharp that the feel of them sinking into one\u2019s flesh would hardly be noticeable, more pleasure than pain. His lower fangs were much shorter, but just as lethal, and hidden by his lower lip.</p><p>During their banter she\u2019d foolishly allowed herself to relax enough that her gaze drifted too directly to his, too tightly to his ruby irises. She was snared.</p> <p>Guardian vampires, the ones with ruby eyes who also made up Lilith\u2019s personal guard, had especially strong enthralling powers. As Beauregard\u2019s control crept over her, Victoria felt her limbs begin to soften and her head to swim. The blood in her veins surged, swelling the vessels so that hot pressure pounded through her body.</p><p>His breath began to match hers, then fought to control their merging breathing. Victoria was sluggish, but she still held the stake, and the candle in her other hand. She had enough presence of mind to realize how incredibly strong his pull was, and how difficult it would be to fight it off.</p><p>Dimly she forced herself to blink, trying to break the connection. Drawing her eyelids down was like wading upstream neck-deep in a river: slow, deathly slow. She felt movement around her, then the brush of his hand against her neck, warm and strong.... She tried to blink again, tried to recover her own breathing and slowly force herself out of the pulsing red tunnel into which she\u2019d begun to fall, clawing back to her reality by focusing on the feel of the stake in her hand and the force of the vis bullae at her belly.</p><p>Suddenly the thrall was broken. She snapped free and pulled in a breath all her own, then raised the stake, plunging it down toward his chest\u2014a chest that had moved closer to her in those few moments of confusion. Everything in her mind was clear and crisp again\u2014the night, the darkness, the smell of the city, the buildings looming over them. As the stake plunged, he threw up his arm to stop her blow, stepping back.</p><p>Their forearms collided with a force that would have broken bones had they not been Venator and vampire, and she drew in her breath in annoyance, twisting away. \u201cI knew you were not to be trusted,\u201d she snapped, whirling back toward him, stake at the ready. \u201cDespite your grandson\u2019s arguments to the contrary.\u201d She dropped her candle and leaped.</p> <p>He blocked her again, and the force of her blow sent them into each other, breast-to-breast, in a parody of a lovers\u2019 embrace before she ducked down, seeking to surge up behind him.</p><p>He feinted away, but she launched at him. Beauregard caught her by the waist and shoved her so hard she stumbled backward, catching herself against a plaster wall. Her candle flame, still burning on the ground, flickered wildly as she looked over at him, recognizing that they were at an impasse.</p><p>\u201cStrong, brave, stubborn...and beautiful. Once again, I can understand my grandson\u2019s attraction for you.\u201d His lips, thinner than Sebastian\u2019s, but of the same shape, curved in a familiar smile. The movement couldn\u2019t help but remind her of the many times she\u2019d kissed lips rather like them. Beauregard\u2019s eyes gleamed behind his mask, sweeping a pink gaze over her, trying again to capture her. \u201c\u2019Tis a shame he saw you first, Venator. But if he does not treat his ladylove with care and attention, perhaps you will tire of waiting for him and cast your affections elsewhere. Toward power. And immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as likely to be his ladylove as he is to be a Venator himself,\u201d Victoria replied with a derisive snort, stepping back, but ready to propel herself forward. \u201cI trust him no farther than I do you; perhaps even less. At least I know where you stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The way he looked at her, as though he were contemplating some great question, was so different from his earlier gaze when he\u2019d tried to enthrall her that Victoria almost looked him straight in the eye. But she remembered how easily she\u2019d fallen moments before and resisted. \u201cAh, well, at the least, as you said, you know where I stand. Now, do not strike at me again,\u201d he added when she gathered herself up to do just that. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve proven just as enticing and capable as I\u2019d hoped, let us get to business.\u201d</p><p>Wary, but no longer breathing hard, Victoria didn\u2019t relax her stance. \u201cBusiness? Was that your vampire that I staked earlier? A lure sent to pull me from the crowd? As you did last night?\u201d</p> <p>She could almost see his eyebrows rising behind the hooded mask of the domino. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you must be mistaken. I was otherwise engaged last evening. It was a tedious thing, but one must feed at least occasionally. Although I will admit to using that young man you slayed as one of several...what did you call them? Lures? To help me locate you in the crowd. So that I could answer your call, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he was expendable.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard shrugged. \u201cThe young ones are so bloody sure of themselves they think they are invincible once they have been turned. They do not realize that a Venator can just as easily end their immortality as they believe they can take from other mortals. It was a lesson for some of his other companions. It\u2019s fortunate for me that most of those young, weak ones have allied themselves with Regalado and his Tutela members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so the battle rages on between the two vampire factions.\u201d Victoria swept up the candle, then straightened from her offensive stance.</p><p>\u201cBattle? I\u2019d hardly call it that. Regalado and his followers are no match for me, even with their new ally. Indeed, I have my own plan for dealing with them.\u201d</p><p>Victoria pretended to yawn. \u201cVampire politics: not something I\u2019m terribly interested in\u2014I\u2019d just as soon stake all of you, regardless of who allies with whom. Instead, let\u2019s talk about why you\u2019ve enticed me to this dark alley. I can only assume the purpose is to exact some kind of payment for telling me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, good. You\u2019ve alleviated the awkwardness of the topic by mentioning it yourself.\u201d Beauregard laughed, sounding uncomfortably like Sebastian. Then his charm vanished, and his eyes burned pink again. \u201cWhy do you wish to see him? I did not expect a woman of your stature and confidence to be chasing after the noncommittal rake that is my grandson.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head, taking care not to look directly into those dangerous irises. \u201cI think that the rake is more like an apple that has fallen not so far from the tree. Ancient though the tree might be. And the matter concerns my aunt.\u201d There was no sense in being coy with Beauregard\u2014she needed his help to find Sebastian.</p> <p>\u201cYour aunt?\u201d</p><p>Then Victoria realized her mistake. She should have let him believe it was Sebastian himself that she, playing the woman scorned, was after. But perhaps she could yet save it. \u201cHe...sent me something that belonged to my aunt, and I...wished to thank him.\u201d</p><p>She knew Beauregard was too smart to be fooled by a complete reversal of personality, but perhaps subtlety would be more effective anyway.</p><p>\u201cThank him? Ah.\u201d The way he allowed that last syllable to ease from his mouth in a low sigh told her he had taken the bait. The pink glow faded from his eyes, to be replaced by smugness. \u201cIt has been months, hasn\u2019t it? And you wish to thank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see him.\u201d She allowed the desperation in her voice\u2014let him think what he would. Let him tell Sebastian she was pining for him. It wouldn\u2019t matter in the end.</p><p>\u201cAs you might imagine, gratitude is something my grandson and I both appreciate. I might be inclined to pass on the message to Sebastian, in exchange for some from you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, merely tightened the grip on her stake and waited for him to continue. It was nothing more than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>He bowed in acknowledgment, spreading his hands as if he had no choice. \u201cI find that I have a curiosity...and a craving...that I desire to satisfy.\u201d</p><p>Victoria knew exactly what he meant. Her palms grew clammy and her heart began to thump harder as she felt his control begin to swirl about her. He was very powerful, and likely as strong as she was, even with her two vis bullae.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot feed on me,\u201d she said, shifting the long stake at her waist. \u201cI\u2019ll send you to Hell first.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard looked affronted. \u201cFeed? My dear, you needn\u2019t be crude. Feeding is like the rutting between hogs, or the mindless fucking of a whore. What I wish from you is much more than a mere gorging on your hot, thick blood. Your Venator blood.\u201d His eyes were blazing ruby-pink, and she felt the insistent tug toward him. \u201cYour sweet, female, Venator blood.\u201d</p><p>His voice was hypnotic, but she remained clearheaded enough to feel the wood under her fingers, even the hot splash of wax that spilled down in a trickle from the taper in her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, making her voice firm even as her mind softened. \u201cYou cannot bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me, Victoria. Let me taste you,\u201d he said softly, but it felt as though the words were there, all around her, filling her ears and insinuating into the blood suddenly rushing in her veins. \u201cLet me taste what it is that my own blood desires.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, focused on the feel of her weapon, forced herself to draw in the scent of rotting garbage nearby, willed her heartbeat to settle back into its own rhythm. \u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply, breaking the gentle lull between them. \u201cYou can\u2019t enthrall me, Beauregard. I\u2019m too strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask for nothing but a kiss,\u201d he said, his voice still calm and low, but his eyes dimmed. \u201cMouth-to-mouth. You might hold your stake between us if it would make you feel more at ease, Venator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I would slam it into your heart and send you to Hell, then,\u201d Victoria replied, her voice easier, more normal. \u201cThen Sebastian would surely seek me out, angry that I sent his grandfather to his eternal damnation.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard lifted his chin. \u201cPlease, Victoria, do not remind me of my fate. I prefer not to dwell on it. You would have no cause to do so, for if you give me what I wish, I\u2019ll bring your message to Sebastian. Just...let me taste you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t respond for a moment, and perhaps he sensed her weakening\u2014after all, it was merely a kiss...and she would keep her stake poised and ready. And if his lips were on hers, that meant his fangs weren\u2019t at her neck\u2014or delving into any other area of her flesh. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019d kissed a vampire.</p><p>\u201cOne kiss,\u201d she said at last, feeling the slam of her heart. \u201cAnd I keep my stake between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it will make you feel better,\u201d he said, stepping toward her almost before she was ready.</p> <p>His strong fingers closed over her shoulders, his head with the silvery blond curls bent toward her, the shadow in his cleft chin deepening. She rested her candle hand over his shoulder, kept the stake between them, and lifted her face, closing her eyes.</p><p>She started at the strangeness when his mouth touched hers, when she felt the bizarre sensation of one warm, soft lip and one cold, firm one closing over her own. Cool and hot, slick and soft...the myriad of sensations flooded her, and her head tipped back even more.</p><p>The hand holding the stake between them was smashed between their torsos; Beauregard\u2019s hand slid up from the back of her neck, which was still freezing cold, and his fingers worked up into the base of her simple braid. Victoria was kissing him back, tasting the warmth and wetness, feeling the slide of lip to lip, the pull between them, the pressure of her mask\u2019s edge cutting into her cheek. He moved, pulling slowly away, and suddenly she felt a scrape, a tingle over her lower lip, and then the warm iron of blood.</p><p>Beauregard had her head cupped in his hands, and he held her there, his mouth fixed on hers, the gentle sucking at her lower lip tugging through her body, spiraling down into her middle, curling warmly between her legs. She twisted her face, tearing away, bringing her stake hand up as he released her, stepping back.</p><p>His chest was moving up and down, and he looked at her, his fangs gleaming like blue-white daggers. \u201cBy Lucifer\u2019s blood,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She would have lunged toward him, but he held up a hand. \u201cI will give your message to Sebastian.\u201d Then he eased into the shadows. She heard the last remnants of his voice as it faded: \u201cIt has been a pleasure, Victoria. I look forward to doing so again.\u201d</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>Instead of turning her back on the place where Beauregard had disappeared, she edged along the plaster wall of the alley, back the way she\u2019d come, keeping her attention behind and in front of her while she tried to pull her heartbeat back under control. Blood still dripped down her lip from the little nip he\u2019d given her. If there were any other vampires nearby, they might sense the blood and come looking for its source.</p><p>She\u2019d be ready.</p><p>She came to the end of the alley and saw, in the distance, the yellow glow of the moccoletti oozing onto the walls of the next block. The back of her neck was still cold, but not frigid, not as if a vampire were very close. But there were some in proximity, perhaps a few streets away. She wondered where Zavier was, if he\u2019d found some undead. One thing was certain: She\u2019d never find him again tonight. She was on the hunt on her own.</p><p>But as she moved away from the protective shadows of the alley, she realized someone was watching her. Slipping her hand into her deep pocket, she closed her fingers around the kadhara\u2019s handle and walked briskly back toward the Corso. It must be near midnight, and with the new moon the Corso and its surrounding streets would soon be dark and full of drunken revelers.</p> <p>Ripe for a vampire\u2019s plunder.</p><p>The crazed noise of the festival seemed to have, if it was even possible, grown louder during Victoria\u2019s absence from the candlelit streets. As she rejoined the crowd, she no longer needed the taper in her hand, for she was surrounded by soft light again, and then drawn into the flow of revelers and their shouts of \u201cSenza moccolo!\u201d</p><p>Wading through the crowd, Victoria felt isolated. She blew out her candle, and she alone was silent and watchful as the rest of Rome, or so it seemed, shouted and pushed about her. Positioned in the midst of the throngs, she stood apart, alert for danger or the emergence of malice on a night of festivity, alone in the knowledge that there was much more to their world than these others could comprehend, more than even the evil of their mortal counterparts.</p><p>A Venator\u2014one who would never wholly be part of that world again.</p><p>The sudden deep tolling of bells from every church in the vicinity startled Victoria, for though the crowd was deafening, the funereal sound rose above the shouts. With the tolling of midnight, the street went from raucous and glowing to silent and dark in an instant.</p><p>The tapers were duffed with such immediacy it was as if a great wind had blown through the Corso and doused them all in one forceful breath. And with the light went the last bit of gaiety.</p><p>Suddenly the street was filled with silent people, leaving in quiet droves so that the avenue emptied more quickly than Victoria could have imagined. The Corso became ghostly. The back of her neck prickled with chill, and she heightened her attention, watching for the glow of red eyes, still trying to shake that feeling of being watched.</p><p>She walked along the street, her fingers around the handle of her dagger, still deep in her pocket. Then she remembered her mask and pulled it off. She needed it no longer. The festival had ended; now started the forty days of Lent. The days of dancing and revelry were over until Easter Sunday.</p> <p>The raucous city had grown quiet, bereft of even the murmur of voices or the scuffle of footsteps. Here and there a pair or trio or small cluster of people walked quickly, as though hurrying to their homes now that the fun had ended.</p><p>A movement out of the corner of her eye was accompanied by a waft of cold over her neck. Slowing her walk, Victoria began to pick her way along the street, making herself an enticing target for the undead behind her. She felt rather than heard him move toward her, and deep in her pocket she changed from dagger to stake before turning to meet him.</p><p>Her. It was a woman with long dark hair and glowing red eyes, and she gave a surprised squeak just before she disintegrated into a cloud of ash. She must have been one of the young vampires Beauregard had disdained earlier.</p><p>Whom had she called master, Regalado or Beauregard?</p><p>South along Via del Corso, away from the piazza, Victoria walked purposefully, but in no great hurry. It was many hours yet until dawn, before she would return to the Consilium or home.</p><p>More than once she felt that sense of being watched, but her neck didn\u2019t chill again, and she heard nothing. Smelled nothing. Fewer and fewer people were about, and she\u2019d walked two blocks without hearing the sound of carriage wheels bumping over the street.</p><p>Soon she passed the slender bell tower of Santa Francesca Romana, and she approached the curved, jagged wall of the Colosseum. It loomed ahead, its countless arches deeply shadowed.</p><p>The world was silent. Even the last of the revelers had gone to their beds, ready to start the stark weeks of Lent. She was alone.</p><p>Then she felt someone behind her. Close behind her.</p><p>She pulled the dagger from her pocket, whirling around.</p><p>And though she hadn\u2019t even raised her arm to strike, he caught her wrist with strong fingers and said, \u201cNot quite the greeting I\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Wherein Victoria Encounters a Stubborn Chin</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d Victoria\u2019s free hand automatically grabbed his arm, jolting him toward her, as if to be certain it really was him. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Relief and a wave of gladness washed over her as she felt the solidness of him under her fingers. He was alive. He was back.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you were expecting Sebastian Vioget,\u201d Max added, releasing her wrist and stepping away from what was as close to a welcoming embrace as she\u2019d ever given him.In truth, she had expected it to be Sebastian\u2014now that she\u2019d sent the message through Beauregard.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked, her heart still hammering from the surprise of his unexpected appearance. She looked up at him as if the answer would be in his countenance. And perhaps it was.</p><p>Even in the mediocre light from a smattering of stars and the occasional lantern on the street, she could see weariness there in his face, and a sort of hesitancy. His cheeks seemed more pronounced, his thick hair more out of place than usual, his sharp jawline set and harsh and with at least three days\u2019 stubble. Max\u2019s dark clothing, although never as perfectly stylish as Sebastian\u2019s, was rumpled, and there was no sign of a mask, costume, or moccoletto anywhere on his person.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost four months, Max. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in various places of no import.\u201d He stood back from her, but could not seem to remove his attention from her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to have suffered any great mishap during my absence.\u201d</p><p>Victoria realized how she must sound\u2014needy and uncertain, and as though she and the Venators could not function without him. She straightened, becoming more aloof to match his style. \u201cHave you been following me? Or perhaps you were looking for someone else tonight.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s handsome, angular countenance appeared even sharper than usual in the bluish glow of night. Because he was so tall, when he looked down his long, straight nose at her, his eyes were little more than dark hollows in the shadows of his face. \u201cFollowing you? I\u2019d have no reason to do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly weren\u2019t lurking about in the shadows trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>He paused, then replied in an odd voice, \u201cYou\u2019d lost your vis bulla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were watching to make certain I was safe? How very nice of you, Max. But I don\u2019t know what you thought...\u201d</p><p>...you might do to protect me without your own vis bulla.</p><p>Victoria quickly changed the subject. \u201cYou\u2019ve cut your hair.\u201d The last time she\u2019d seen him he\u2019d worn his hair clubbed back in a brief stub. Now it was too short for that.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more gratified that you noticed.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the comment and responded with one of her own. \u201cIs Sarafina lurking in the shadows? Why not invite her to join us? I didn\u2019t get to speak with her last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived, so I haven\u2019t any notion where Sara is, but undoubtedly you have some point to make by mentioning her. If so, then make it, Victoria. Unlike Vioget, I prefer to cut to the quick of the matter rather than banter around it like a May dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019re bantering now,\u201d she replied smartly. Then she thought better of continuing the game and said, \u201cYour fianc\u00e9e attempted to have me kidnapped last night. Do you have any idea why?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond immediately; nor did he deny that Sara was his fianc\u00e9e. Max just looked down at her, as though deep in thought. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cShe lured Zavier and me from Carnivale up to the Regalado family plot in a graveyard, and four or five men tried to wrap me in a big canvas and spirit me away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd fortunately Zavier came to your rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fortunately I was able to rescue myself and didn\u2019t stake Zavier when he tried to get between me and a vampire,\u201d Victoria replied, realizing Max was succeeding in annoying her already, and wondering why she continued to let him\u2014and why he continued to try.</p><p>\u201cZavier came betwixt your stake and a vampire? Did he get the harsh side of your tongue for his troubles? At least you never need worry about that happening with Vioget.\u201d Then he, too, appeared to ease. \u201cNo matter, I\u2019m certain you instructed Zavier on the proper way to accompany you when on the hunt...but back to the important matter, which is: You saw Sara at that time? Has she turned?\u201d</p><p>The question startled her, but after a moment Victoria wondered why it should. After all, Sara clearly enjoyed interacting with vampires, and her father, the Conte Regalado, had been the leader of the Tutela in Rome before he was turned into a vampire just before Akvan\u2019s Obelisk had been destroyed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. Were you expecting her to? It would make for a considerably interesting marriage bed if she had.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at her sharply, his mouth opening as if to say something just as cutting. Victoria cringed inside, knowing he would have every right to do so after she\u2019d baited him. Instead he stated, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re wearing a vis.\u201d</p> <p>Her face blossomed warm and, even though she was certain he couldn\u2019t tell in the low light, she looked away. She was suddenly acutely aware of the fact that his vis bulla, the one that had at one time pierced him in the intimate area of his areola, was now one with her flesh and dangled warmly in the curve of her belly. And she would swear the tiny silver cross suddenly felt warmer and heavier, shivering in her navel.</p><p>Would he be able to sense that she was wearing it? Since it was his?</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m wearing Aunt Eustacia\u2019s,\u201d she added.</p><p>At the casual mention of her great-aunt, a pall fell over the already awkward moment. Max turned toward the ragged Colosseum, which was only a few yards to her right, and she saw his shoulders lift as he took a long, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cKritanu? How is he?\u201d he asked finally in a different voice. \u201cThe others?\u201d</p><p>There were many other questions between the lines of those particular ones, and Victoria wanted to answer all of them\u2014but couldn\u2019t fully answer any of them. \u201cHe is philosophical and uncomplaining, as only Kritanu can be,\u201d she replied, choosing the easy one. \u201cHe grieves, as do I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I.\u201d The words were a challenge, as if to dare her to presume he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAnd the others. But she lived a long life, a dangerous one, in which she devoted more than sixty years to the Venators. We miss her\u2014we all do\u2014but...it\u2019s past, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Now he looked at her fully. Still challenging. And he was right to be so.</p><p>Although she finally understood that he\u2019d had to execute Aunt Eustacia, the fact remained that he had actually done it\u2014and she\u2019d witnessed it. There was no glossing over that in her memory.</p><p>Once again her gaze skittered away. Victoria was no shy rabbit, no cowering woman...yet the expression on his face made her want to alternately rage at him for his coldness and fold him in her arms to erase whatever it was that gave him the hard edge.</p><p>What an odd thing to think about Max, of all people.</p><p>She\u2019d once accused him of being unfeeling, emotionless, of being envious of the loving relationship she\u2019d found with Phillip. How ironic that now she was the one who felt cold and empty, while he seemed to be almost tentative, with the slightest hint of vulnerability.</p><p>But no, it was grief for the loss of Aunt Eustacia and guilt for the part he\u2019d played in her death that made him seem less harsh. And he was asking her if she\u2019d yet forgiven him for setting in motion the events that had resulted in that horrible ending.</p> <p>She truly didn\u2019t know if she had. She tried not to think about that night and the part he\u2019d played in Aunt Eustacia\u2019s death, the risks he\u2019d taken, the danger they\u2019d faced. The fact that there had been only a sliver of hope of destroying Akvan\u2019s Obelisk, and that he\u2019d risked everything to do it. And had succeeded.</p><p>But she still couldn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>When she remained silent, he asked, \u201cYou have Eustacia\u2019s vis bulla? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian sent it to me. I don\u2019t know how he came to have it.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, looking beyond her, toward the ruined amphitheater. \u201cVery clever. I\u2019m certain you thanked him appropriately, just as he no doubt intended.\u201d</p><p>Victoria did not mistake his meaning, as Max himself no doubt intended. But she forbore to respond. Now that he was back, they had other important things to discuss. \u201cMax,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you spoken to Wayren? Do you know about la Porta Alchemica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I haven\u2019t spoken to her since...since the night the obelisk was destroyed.\u201d His demeanor changed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She told him about the door, and the missing keys, taking several steps toward the Colosseum as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cEustacia\u2019s armband that holds the key is missing,\u201d he commented. It wasn\u2019t a question, but more of a thoughtful statement. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re looking for the unreliable Sebastian in the hopes that he might know, since after all he somehow obtained her vis bulla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there when I spoke to Beauregard, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she said, continuing to walk across the grass-filled cobblestone square that surrounded the large amphitheater. The ruined building loomed over her, its ragged outer wall cutting in a jagged diagonal to the ground.</p><p>\u201cSpoke?\u201d He didn\u2019t appear to be surprised, and suddenly Victoria knew why. He\u2019d been there. He\u2019d seen Beauregard try to bite her. Seen them kissing.</p><p>\u201cI knew someone was watching. So you needn\u2019t even bother to ask me what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Victoria...at first I didn\u2019t know if you were wearing a vis bulla.\u201d She paused for a moment to look at him, and he stopped next to her. \u201cBut what about you? You don\u2019t have yours.\u201d</p><p>He looked steadily at her. \u201cYou need not trouble yourself over it.\u201d</p><p>She began walking briskly again, but with his long legs he easily kept pace, continuing to speak. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to Sebastian for help, but there\u2019s something else afoot. Someone\u2014Sarafina, perhaps, if you didn\u2019t mistake her in the shadows\u2014arranged for what amounted to an ambush. You were lured away and could easily have been outnumbered and killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not foolish, Max. It was clear they wanted me alive. They must believe I know where the key is. No one raised a hand to injure me, and even the single vampire, who was nothing but a lure, simply ran away. Otherwise would it not have been easier to slay me\u2014or attempt to\u2014right there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishing for death already, Victoria?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the Colosseum\u2019s wall. Its three rows of arcades, circling the arena one atop another, rose like dozens of black eyes staring down on them. In the shadows Victoria could see that the walls were overgrown with foliage, sprouting tall plants and grasses along the top and from the sides. It gave the amphitheater a bushy, messy appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who has a wish for death. I have too much left to do here.\u201d She cast him a sidelong glance. He\u2019d had no gratitude when she saved his life the night Aunt Eustacia died; he\u2019d told her it would be easier not to live with the guilt\u2014despite the fact that he\u2019d done what he\u2019d done for the good of their race. What he\u2019d been ordered to do by Aunt Eustacia herself. That was the only reason Victoria couldn\u2019t hate him\u2014she knew he\u2019d had no choice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still living, am I not?\u201d He looked at her as she gawked up at the wall. More than four months she\u2019d been in Rome, and she\u2019d not had the opportunity to visit the Colosseum until now. \u201cDo you want to go inside? There will be no vampires there, for all that it\u2019s been consecrated for nearly a century, but if you can step aside from your duty for a time, we can walk through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She felt odd walking companionably with Max into the dark recess of one of the archways, instead of being on guard for a battle with undead. Inside the outer wall they were in a passageway that curved around the entire perimeter of the building, with more arches leading to the seats.</p><p>Victoria strolled along the dark passage, Max close enough to brush her sleeve. They were silent, and despite the openings on either side of them, the high ceiling loomed above in a vast cavern.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to walk around the perimeter all night?\u201d he asked brusquely. \u201cOr would you like to see the battlefield?\u201d</p><p>Victoria gave a small laugh. She felt a bit nervous, and wasn\u2019t sure why she should. After all, this was just Max. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d She turned abruptly toward one of the arches just as Max stopped walking, and she bumped forcefully into him. Her forehead slammed hard into his chin as her sudden movement pushed them into an unexpected embrace.</p><p>He caught her as they collided, his strong hands finding her arms and steadying her in the moment of her silent mortification. She\u2019d forgotten how tall he was. \u201cPardon me,\u201d she murmured formally, and pulled away to continue walking through the passage to the interior of the amphitheater. Her heart was beating harder; she couldn\u2019t feel more foolish and clumsy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis entrance is called a vomitory,\u201d Max was saying as if nothing untoward had happened\u2014and indeed, nothing had, she reminded herself, except that for a moment she\u2019d lost all of her Venatorial grace. In front of Max. \u201cBecause of the rapid ease with which the masses of people can enter or exit. Did you hurt your head?\u201d</p><p>His chin had been just as hard and stubborn as it had always appeared, and it had indeed been painful to crash into. \u201cI\u2019m a Venator, so I think there will be no bruise.\u201d Her voice was light with humor.</p><p>\u201cThe moss that grows here can be slippery,\u201d he added as they emerged from the short tunnel. \u201cTake care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s moss everywhere, and plants,\u201d Victoria commented, looking over the shadowy interior of what had once been a pristine arena. \u201cIt\u2019s so overgrown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannever finds many of the herbs and plants he uses in his medicinal treatments at the Consilium growing here. There are hundreds of them, presumably brought here purposely or accidentally from the far reaches of the Roman Empire over the centuries. It\u2019s very fortunate for us that there is this great variety.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him. His face was turned to gaze over the field below, and his profile struck her. With his long, straight nose, prominent forehead, and sharp-planed face, he looked like one of the very gladiators who might have fought below. Or perhaps he looked more like a senator, who might have sat in this very same section. In either case he looked strong and powerful and Roman.</p><p>Max must have felt her staring, for he shifted and turned toward her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you sound a bit like Zavier, expounding on the history of this place. I hadn\u2019t expected it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Zavier is quite fascinated with the history of our female Venators, among other things,\u201d Max replied, his voice dry. He looked back out into the darkness. \u201cBut it is this place in particular that appeals to me. Down there, somewhere\u201d\u2014he cast his arm out to encompass the arena\u2014\u201cGardeleus\u2014the first Venator\u2014died at the hand of a vampire. And set in motion this battle that has lasted for centuries.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the oval-shaped field, tufted with untouched grass and bushes on one side, and on the other rumpled and disrupted by a series of excavations in the form of dark holes. Aunt Eustacia had told her the story of Gardeleus and his final midnight battle with Judas Iscariot, the first vampire.</p><p>Max continued to stare down in silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve visited this place,\u201d he commented at last. \u201cBorn and raised a Roman, and yet I\u2019ve forgotten the sacrifices made by him and the others through the ages.\u201d</p><p>His words were so uncharacteristic and quiet, Victoria wasn\u2019t certain that she\u2019d heard them properly. She didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t want to break whatever spell had turned him into this pensive, thoughtful being.</p><p>At last he seemed to pull out of his thoughts. He turned and looked at her, and for a moment, as their eyes met, she couldn\u2019t breathe. There was this vast area around them, this great space, and yet she felt small and crowded. As though everything had circled down to the space between them.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d Max said at last, \u201cI never told you how sorry I am about what happened with Phillip.\u201d</p> <p>That was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. He\u2019d never mentioned Phillip, except to decry the fact that she\u2019d planned to marry him, claiming that Venators couldn\u2019t marry and that it would distract them from their duty.</p><p>Victoria was so shocked she couldn\u2019t respond at first. Then, breaking his gaze, she looked down at her hands, small and pale and deadly. \u201cI think of him every day. And Aunt Eustacia too.\u201d Tears stung her dry eyes.</p><p>He moved, shifting his tall, graceful body so that he leaned back against the wall. \u201cAnd yet you go on as if nothing has happened. You\u2019re a strong woman.\u201d</p><p>Victoria didn\u2019t feel so very strong at that moment.</p><p>There were times when she was able to keep the grief at bay, to move through life as though she were whole, as if she\u2019d never been torn apart as she had been that night she realized Phillip had been turned. There were even hours and perhaps, occasionally, a day where she might not have felt the weight of her loss\u2014losses\u2014and when, for a brief time, she could pretend that her life wasn\u2019t preordained by duty to be defined by loneliness.</p><p>She let her knees buckle gently and lowered herself to the ground. Even when she was sitting, the sides of the walls were at her shoulder height, and she could still see around the arena. But she had something to lean against here, and suddenly she needed it. \u201cHow could I turn my back and walk away? Evil and danger are everywhere, and their power must be stopped or eventually it will take over the world. Of course I go on.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said nearly the same thing to Sebastian only months ago. He hadn\u2019t understood.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His voice was a low rumble, almost a breath, but she heard him.</p> <p>She looked up at him looming above her, and her head brushed against the wall. Tiny crumbles of stone and a small shower of dirt and dried leaves filtered over her shoulder as the vampire dust had done earlier that evening. It was much easier to brush that away than the remains of an undead, easier to clean up a bit of dirt than the mess left by an immortal, damned for his desire to take and rape and devour the mortal version of itself.</p><p>They were silent again. This time it was a comfortable quiet, laced with sorrow, but without the underlying tension that always seemed to crop up between them. At last Victoria was moved to ask something that had been niggling at her mind.</p><p>\u201cDid you truly intend to marry Sarafina Regalado?\u201d she asked, thinking of the months he\u2019d spent pretending to be a member of the Tutela and being engaged to the young woman, remembering the time she\u2019d come upon him with his neckcloth loosened and his hair mussed after an obvious t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Instead of looking down at the field, he\u2019d turned his face up and was looking toward the dark sky. She wasn\u2019t certain, but it appeared as though his lashes closed and his lips moved into a slender line. He gave one bare nod. \u201cIf it was necessary, I would have.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised. Max would do what had to be done in the fight against Lilith and her vampires, no matter the sacrifice or pain. Would she ever be that cold and emotionless?</p><p>She nodded, and more dust sprinkled over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe right decision isn\u2019t always easy or evident. You\u2019ll find yourself making more and more of those choices as time goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>Max drew in his breath, and there in the silent, dark night let it out slowly. \u201cI miss her too, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Victoria realized he meant Aunt Eustacia.</p><p>Again they were quiet for a time. At last, Victoria saw the faint lightening of the sky in the east and realized dawn was near.</p><p>How odd to have spent a night in Max\u2019s company without once wielding a stake, and with very few razorlike comments. She began to pull to her feet, her legs stiff, and he reached his hand to offer her assistance.</p><p>Strong fingers and an impossibly warm, square palm closed over her small hands, easily bringing her to her feet. He released her hand immediately and started toward the exit, the vomitory, and she followed. All without speaking.</p><p>As they walked, she realized something that had been glossed over: He was wearing a vis bulla.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Her voice stopped him ahead of her in the dark passageway. Victoria looked at him, studying him closely. \u201cHow did you get a vis bulla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no consequence. The sun is rising, and it\u2019s time for me to find my bed. Good night, Victoria.\u201d He turned away, walking with his confident, long-loped stride.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Her quiet voice stopped him, and once again he turned to look at her. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re back?\u201d</p><p>His arms hung from his sides in an uncharacteristically useless way. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>In Which a Small Red Jar Becomes the Topic of Conversation</p><p>\u201cYou went to Lilith? Alone?\u201d</p><p>Max looked at Wayren, who\u2019d straightened up in her chair. Unsure how the other Venators would react toward him after Eustacia\u2019s death, he hadn\u2019t wanted to go to the Consilium to see her. He had invited Wayren to the small room he\u2019d rented.\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. I had nothing to lose, Wayren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Max. I know how much you want to be rid of her. But to take such a chance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I haven\u2019t been alone with her in the past.\u201d He knew his words came out harshly, but, bloody hell, the memories weren\u2019t pleasant ones. Blast it that he had to remind Wayren of them.</p><p>For all her calmness, all of her knowledge and wisdom, she was a bit absentminded at times. Now, realizing what she\u2019d said, Wayren softened and merely looked at him. Behind the perfectly square spectacles she wore, her wise eyes filled with understanding. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave me a salve she claims will release me from her thrall...but at a price.\u201d He pulled the small garnet jar from his coat pocket and set it on the table between them. Though his fingers itched to open it, he\u2019d not done so yet. During the last months he\u2019d kept it with him at all times, but had never opened the shiny pot, which was made from a walnut-size jewel.</p><p>It had weighted his coat. Burned his hand when he brushed it. Called to him when he emptied his pockets at night. One morning he\u2019d awakened with it clutched in his hand.</p><p>That was when he knew it was time to return to Roma, to speak to Wayren.</p><p>Wayren looked at it, but made no move to pick it up. Then she shifted her attention back to Max, and contemplated him as if she knew what he was going to say next.</p><p>\u201cIf I use the salve I\u2019ll lose my Venatorial powers, and because her bites have tainted my blood, I cannot regain them, even if I attempt the trial again. I\u2019ll forget everything I know of that world. As if I never had the knowledge in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a Gardella who has been called and refuses the call\u2014as Victoria\u2019s mother did\u2014you\u2019ll be ignorant and simply a man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simply a man.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even imagine what that would be like.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to be free of Lilith, but you haven\u2019t used it yet,\u201d Wayren commented.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided not to.\u201d</p><p>There were times, as now, when he was convinced Wayren could read minds, perhaps even see the future. God knew she\u2019d been around long enough to have learned the skill, if indeed it could be learned. She looked at him, her blue-gray eyes calm and penetrating. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough, Max. You\u2019ve given seventeen years of your life in penance for what happened to your father and sister. You can be free.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, Lilith had said nearly the same thing. The vampire queen had tempted him. Now Wayren was giving him permission.</p><p>He knew it was true. He\u2019d meditated on it, prayed on it, agonized over it...all these weeks since leaving Lilith\u2019s stronghold he\u2019d thought of little else. But...\u201cFree? But what would I leave behind? More deaths? More destruction and evil?\u201d</p><p>And what would he lose in the process?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d no longer have the memories. It would all be gone. You could truly be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? How tempting is the thought of not having this bloody nagging on my neck all the time? The pain that comes at her every damned whim?\u201d</p><p>Wayren gave a gentle shrug. \u201cMax, to live with guilt for one\u2019s entire life, to use it as a shield against truly living, an excuse for feeling...is that so much better? It\u2019s not something anyone is required to do for all his days.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and realized she didn\u2019t really understand. \u201cThe guilt doesn\u2019t burden me any longer, Wayren. It\u2019s Lilith\u2019s thrall that burdens me. I don\u2019t flay myself for what I did, for the choices I made. Those decisions are in the past and cannot be undone, and I\u2019ve done everything I can think of to atone for them.</p><p>\u201cBut as easy as it might be to contemplate the freedom of ignorance, I can\u2019t do it. I know I\u2019m needed. How can I live in ignorance when I\u2019m needed? How many deaths can I prevent by staying? I have no right to turn my back when I am one of the few who can prevent them.\u201d</p><p>Wayren had folded her slender fingers in her lap and was watching him during this impassioned speech. \u201cYou were not called to be a Venator. You made the choice. You aren\u2019t obligated as those Gardellas who are called.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you not understand? I became obligated the moment I turned Father and Giulia over to the Tutela.\u201d His jaw cracked beneath his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou were barely more than a child. You thought you were giving your family a gift\u2014immortality\u2014which is precisely what the Tutela led you to believe. That\u2019s how they draw in strong, smart young men like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare to excuse what I did? Feeding my father and sister to the vampires? At sixteen, I knew what was wrong and what was right. Yet I was blinded by the chance for power and wealth and immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for the next seventeen years, at the risk of your life, you\u2019ve worn the vis bulla. You\u2019ve paid your penance, and then some.\u201d</p><p>Max stopped suddenly and glared at Wayren. Wayren, who had been as close to him as Eustacia. Wayren, who, with her wisdom and calm, gentle ways, had been more of a mother figure to him than even Eustacia had. Eustacia had mentored and challenged him as a fighter; Wayren had touched and taught him as a young man.</p><p>She had been the one to help him through the life-threatening trial of attaining the vis bulla. She\u2019d been there when he reached the point where he would either live and wear the amulet of the Venators, or die when it was pierced into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me to use the salve?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m no longer fit to be a Venator? After what happened with Eustacia?\u201d His throat was dry, his hand tightly fisted into itself.</p><p>\u201cNo, Max. No.\u201d She stood, coming to him, resting her slender hand on his arm. Some of his tension eased at her touch, as it always did. \u201cI fear only that one day Lilith\u2019s hold on you will become too strong for even you to fight. Already she has caused you to do her work of destroying Akvan\u2019s Obelisk, bringing about the death of her rival and son. You could just as easily have failed as succeeded. What will she require of you the next time? And the next?\u201d</p> <p>The anger and annoyance that had whipped up inside him settled as he listened to her reasoning. \u201cI do not know. But she has yet to control me as she would like.\u201d Max stepped away and walked across the small room. On a small table next to the narrow bed was his favorite black-painted stake. It was sleek and heavy and it fit his hand perfectly. A cross was carved into the blunt end and inlaid with silver. \u201cVictoria told me about the Door of Alchemy. You\u2019ll need me if they get the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Victoria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night. Briefly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain she was glad you\u2019ve returned. It\u2019s not been an easy few months for her\u2014losing her husband, and then Eustacia, and you as well. Just as you disappeared after Phillip died, you disappeared after Eustacia\u2019s death. This inconstancy is becoming a habit of yours.\u201d Her head tilted to the side like a little wren\u2019s, her bright eyes watching him.</p><p>Max put the stake back with a soft clatter and glowered at Wayren. \u201cI was not fit to be here, to wear the vis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very difficult for her to lose you, someone she knows and trusts, during a time of such pain and upheaval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrusts? I hardly think she\u2019s foolish enough to trust me any longer. And she was not alone. You were there, and Ilias, and others.\u201d</p><p>Wayren stood abruptly. \u201cThat is true, Max. You\u2019re right. She has taken over her role as Illa Gardella with little trouble. A bit of grief, perhaps, some sorrowful moments...but overall, she is an amazing Venator. It\u2019s become her life. She\u2019s made some difficult decisions. In fact, she insisted that no one know that Eustacia died by your hand\u2014in order to protect you and your legacy. She carries on with her life as though unburdened with grief. It\u2019s rather astonishing how well she has adapted to the sacrifices and changes this life has brought her.\u201d</p><p>Wayren looked down at the little jar on the table, reaching to touch it with her slender finger. \u201cI would like to take this, if you do not plan to use it, Max. Perhaps I can learn what it is that would sap your Venator powers while severing your ties to Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the damned thing.\u201d</p><p>She picked it up and slipped it into a small pouch that dangled from her silver-link girdle. \u201cI presume you will join us at the Consilium tonight, now that you have returned. And are wearing a vis bulla again.\u201d Behind her square spectacles, she looked at him shrewdly.</p><p>Max picked up his favorite stake and traced the silver cross. Victoria had protected him. Bloody hell. \u201cOf course I will be there. I am ever the dutiful soldier.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was in a quandary by the time she reached Santo Quirinus late the next day.Having been awake until dawn, she\u2019d slept well past noon and met up with the ladies Melly, Winnie, and Nilly over a lunch filled with raptures about the hospitality of the Tarruscellis, the lovely view of the extinguishing ceremony from their balcony, and regret that there would be very little society during the next forty days of Lent.</p><p>Oh, and sympathy for poor, dear Victoria, who\u2019d been in bed the night through with the megrims and had thus missed the most riotous, beautiful, exciting night of all. How could she bear it?</p><p>Victoria explained that she\u2019d borne the annoying headache rather well, knowing that the ladies weren\u2019t inconvenienced by her illness. \u201cAnd it is very unfortunate that I cannot remain here with you ladies this afternoon to hear all of your adventures,\u201d she said, rising from the table, \u201cbut I promised to meet with a portrait artist about doing a new painting of Aunt Eustacia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor dear,\u201d Lady Winnie said, her pudgy fingers flashing rubies and emeralds as she patted Victoria\u2019s smaller hand. \u201cAfter being ill so often this last week, I should think you\u2019d be able to rest instead of gallivanting off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still look a bit pale,\u201d Lady Nilly added. \u201cPerhaps a brighter color gown would serve better to pinken your complexion. I shall have my Rudgers have a word with your maid.\u201d</p><p>Despite her hurry to get to the Consilium and tell Wayren about meeting Sebastian and Max last evening, Victoria\u2019s smile was genuine. The ladies could be dithering and overbearing, but they had only her best interests\u2014and those of her mother, of course\u2014at heart.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we shall be gone before you return, if you are very late into the evening,\u201d Lady Melly said. \u201cThe party...er...meeting begins at eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty? But it\u2019s Lent,\u201d Victoria replied, trying to keep her lips from twitching. Yet she was relieved to hear of their plans. Anything to keep the ladies occupied, and from worrying over Aunt Eustacia\u2019s personal effects, was fine in her book.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a party,\u201d Lady Nilly squeaked, her bright blue eyes wide with innocence and sparse lashes. \u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t go if it were a party. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting,\u201d the duchess added, nodding vigorously. \u201cDefinitely a meeting. With dinner. But no music or dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unfortunate that I couldn\u2019t join you at your meeting,\u201d Victoria replied, dropping her grip from the chair and taking that all-important first step away from the table. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably best if I rest again tonight. You ladies have a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain we will,\u201d Lady Melly said, smoothing the napkin in her lap. \u201cI haven\u2019t any idea why the Palombaras chose to have their par\u2014meeting on Ash Wednesday, but\u2014What is it, darling? Your head again? Benedicto, some tea for the young madam, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPalombara?\u201d Victoria had swiveled from the door so quickly it was, indeed, partly her head that spun. Her mind was the other part. \u201cTell me about this party, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a party at all,\u201d Lady Winnie remonstrated. \u201cDear me, Victoria, have you not heard what we\u2019ve been saying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever mind, Winnie. The pope hasn\u2019t been here in Rome since the war, so you needn\u2019t worry that he can hear you,\u201d Lady Nilly returned, one charcoaled eyebrow arching.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about the Palombaras?\u201d Victoria asked again, a bit more insistently. And she sat back down. The Consilium would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cTo be sure, it may not be the Palombaras themselves who are hosting the...meeting,\u201d Lady Melly said primly. She was twining one of the wispy curls that dangled along her cheek around her left index finger. \u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting, really, Victoria. What a shame it is that you cannot attend. I\u2019m not certain how many people will be there, though I doubt it will be such a crush as we might have seen back home, you know. After all, it is Ash Wednesday. Even though it isn\u2019t a party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut perhaps I won\u2019t want to miss it, if you would please tell me what this meeting is.\u201d Victoria noticed that her jaw was beginning to hurt, and she eased off before she cracked something. The strength of a Venator\u2019s gritting teeth could have lasting effects.</p><p>\u201cIt would be delightful for you to attend,\u201d Lady Winnie crowed, sounding rather unlike a duchess in that moment. \u201cThe family villa that has been closed off for decades is being opened tonight for a pa\u2014meeting. It shall be an adventure, for the Palombara villa hasn\u2019t been occupied for years, and the family has been gone and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be rather like a treasure hunt,\u201d Lady Nilly chirped. \u201cThey\u2019ve invited only a select group of friends to help in the search, and the Tarruscellis insisted we join them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA treasure hunt?\u201d Victoria felt a shiver across her shoulders. \u201cWhatever would you be searching for in an old, empty house?\u201d But she had a sneaking suspicion she might know.</p><p>\u201cA scavenger hunt,\u201d Lady Melly interrupted. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know exactly how to find what we\u2019re looking for, but it should be frightfully amusing. Well, perhaps not so amusing,\u201d she added, looking abashed. \u201cIt will be nothing more than a good deed, helping the family find a key that has been missing for more than a century. I\u2019m certain even the pope would approve. If he were here.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed.</p><p>\u201cIt does sound intriguing,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cI have decided I will attend after all.\u201d</p><p>It took her another several minutes to extricate herself from the ladies\u2019 enthusiasm, and then nearly forty minutes in the barouche with Oliver driving a roundabout path from the Gardella villa to the small church of Santo Quirinus.</p><p>Thus it was past five o\u2019clock when she entered the small, unassuming church where a bowl of ashes sat in the vestibule. Victoria crossed herself with the gritty soot, leaving a dark smudge on her forehead and bits of dust floating down to catch in her lashes.</p><p>There were several penitents in the church, and she paused to kneel in prayer before slipping past the rail at the altar to the confessional.</p><p>Inside the small confessional, she closed the door behind her as if to meet with the priest. But instead of kneeling, Victoria felt for the small latch to the hidden door next to her seat. It slid silently open to reveal three steps that led down to a long, narrow hall studded with icons.</p> <p>Victoria closed the door behind her and entered the passageway, taking care not to step on the middle stair as she did so. That middle stair was connected to an alarm in the Consilium below, warning when an unauthorized presence approached.</p><p>The hall in which she stood appeared to be nothing but a gallery of images that dead-ended in a brick wall. However, if one knew that the last icon on the left, the one depicting Jesus with the angels Gabriel and Uriel, concealed a subtle pattern of bricks that must be pushed in the proper order, one could release the rope-and-pulley mechanism that opened the dead-end wall and reveal the spiral staircase that led to the chambers below. After she\u2019d opened the hidden door, Victoria started down the curling steps that were lit by several sconces.</p><p>She walked through the marble archway into the main chamber of the Consilium, where the fountain of holy water splashed and sparkled, and she stopped.</p><p>On the other side of the circular font was gathered a group of Venators: Ilias, Zavier, Michalas, Stanislaus. They were all talking in earnest. One tall, dark head rose above the rest, attached to a set of broad, black-clad shoulders facing slightly away from Victoria, and that man seemed to be at the center of the conversation.</p><p>Zavier saw her first, and retreated slightly from the little group to hail her toward them. \u201cVictoria! At last you\u2019ve arrived. I couldn\u2019t help but be a wee worried after we were separated last night.\u201d He gestured toward her, his face bright with pleasure, nearly matching his hair. \u201cAnd see who\u2019s returned.\u201d</p><p>Max turned, and their eyes met briefly until she focused her attention back on Zavier, who, for all of his muscular bulk, looked as excited as a child with a new toy.</p><p>\u201cHello, Max,\u201d Victoria said, walking toward the group. For some reason she wasn\u2019t certain whether she should acknowledge that they\u2019d spoken the night before. The expression on his face was devoid of the soberness he\u2019d worn then and instead held the aloof, almost annoyed expression she was more accustomed to seeing. \u201cGood afternoon, everyone,\u201d she added, smiling at them all. The other Venators responded with nods and warm smiles, making her feel as if she were a long-lost sister returning to their midst.</p><p>But when Max arched a brow in that way of his and nodded in casual greeting, Victoria couldn\u2019t help but feel a spike of annoyance. Why did his face seem to blank and sharpen now that she\u2019d arrived when, before he saw her, even from behind, she could see that he\u2019d been relaxed and engaged in conversation?</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be late,\u201d she said, then was irritated with herself for apologizing, because she felt as though it was only for Max\u2019s benefit that she\u2019d done so. \u201cBut there\u2019s a problem that has arisen, which delayed me, and it must be dealt with. Ilias, do you know where Wayren is? I should speak with both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is in her library, of course, and was waiting for your arrival,\u201d Ilias replied.</p><p>Victoria had reached the group of Venators by now and found herself next to Zavier, who\u2019d taken her arm and drawn her into the group. \u201cMax,\u201d she said, looking at him again, \u201cwelcome back. Are you indeed back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked over the others and asked, \u201cHow was the last night of Carnivale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen vampires slain,\u201d Ilias told her.</p><p>\u201cThen seventeen in all,\u201d Victoria added with a smile. \u201cAnd I saw no evidence of victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye disappear to?\u201d Zavier asked, still holding her arm. \u201cI was worried that whoever attempted to grab ye the night before had succeeded.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt Max looking at her, likely wondering if she would share her conversation with Beauregard. But since none of the others knew about the Door of Alchemy, nor about the missing armband belonging to Aunt Eustacia, she felt no need to go into the detail of her evening. They would find out soon enough, if it was necessary.</p><p>Instead she gave Zavier the smile she\u2019d learned was helpful in distracting a man from his purpose and replied, \u201cI went after a vampire, and when I returned you were gone. But, more important, I have need of your assistance as an escort this evening. Are you free to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and with pleasure. Tell me only what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied, turning the smile just a bit warmer. Having Zavier with her to watch over her mother and friends would leave her free to do her own tasks at the estate.</p><p>\u201cDid you say you needed to speak with Wayren?\u201d Max interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, and Ilias as well,\u201d Victoria replied, catching the elderly man\u2019s eye.</p><p>Zavier looked disappointed when Victoria removed herself from his grip, but she said, \u201cI won\u2019t be long. Ilias, I have to do one thing, and then I\u2019ll go to Wayren\u2019s library to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>She excused herself and hurried through the long gallery of Venator portraits, this time passing the newest one of Aunt Eustacia. At the other end of the hall she reached what appeared to be a dead end, but actually contained three hidden doors. One led to an old spiral staircase, one of several secret exits from the Consilium. These steps took one up to the ruins of a tumbledown building that appeared to be nothing more than an abandoned house on the small street of Tilhin. It was located many streets away from the main entrance at Santo Quirinus.</p><p>A second door led to Wayren\u2019s private library, and the third door was the entryway Victoria sought. The doors were not secret to keep out other Venators; they all knew this chamber existed, and many of them had visited it.</p><p>They were hidden merely as a precaution. In the event the Consilium should ever be breached, the important and valuable items kept in this room and in Wayren\u2019s library would remain safe and would be able to be evacuated through the nearby alternate entrance if necessary. Thus, Victoria reasoned, this would be the safest place for Aunt Eustacia to have hidden the armband with the key.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d had the opportunity to secret it here before going to the meeting that resulted in her death. It wasn\u2019t likely, but Victoria wanted to make certain all other possibilities had been exhausted before she talked to Sebastian.</p><p>She pushed on the marble relief of a trail of vines, her fingers sliding one of the leaves to the side. The heavy marble wall rumbled and opened enough for her to slip through.</p><p>Inside this chamber, which always had torches ready to be lit, the Venators kept their greatest secrets, their most valuable weapons, and the most dangerous souvenirs of their history. Victoria held her candle aloft, showing cabinets with deep cupboards and shallow, wide shelves that lined the walls. Display tables with glass tops that enclosed some of the objects sat adjacent to one another. A desk with curling manuscript papers and a large magnifying glass was positioned in a corner.</p><p>On display here was the stake given to Gardeleus when he was called to his destiny of fathering the generations of Venators. It was made of aspen wood, and had been part of the True Cross. Lady Catherine\u2019s emerald ring, which she\u2019d worn during her days in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s court, was in a small, silver-cornered box made of ash. A head-size egg that belonged to the serpent demon Pithius was locked in an iron cage. It had never been incubated, but for security\u2019s sake it was locked up, just in case it might someday spontaneously hatch. So far it had been there for centuries with nary a wiggle, according to Ilias. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was the gold clasp that Eustacia and Kritanu had seized one Christmas Eve in Venice, thereby saving the city from horrific destruction at the hands of a powerful vampire. The golden anklet that had belonged to Dahhak, one of the divs of long-ago Persia. A twining copper ring, one of the five that had been given by Lilith to her most trusted Guardians centuries ago. An odd-shaped box made of jade that Victoria had never had occasion to see opened sat next to the egg. And, there on one of the tables, a long, obsidian object.</p><p>A shard from Akvan\u2019s Obelisk.</p><p>Victoria walked over and looked down. The piece of shiny blue-black stone was no longer than her forearm from wrist to elbow, and perhaps as thick as three fingers. It was splintered to a lethal point at one end and a wider, jagged edge at the other. One side was smooth and curved; the opposite was fragmented and ridged.</p> <p>It had been a part of a large obelisk that had contained a great, primitive evil harnessed by the demon Akvan. When the obelisk had been destroyed, it had shattered and disintegrated in a great explosion. Victoria had found the piece of obsidian during her escape with Sebastian from the aftermath of its destruction, and she had brought it here for safekeeping.</p><p>The gleam of her candle flame flickering on the shiny object reminded her of the blue and black flames that had erupted from the obelisk when it was still whole. As she looked at it, Victoria felt the shimmer of evil that had once been contained therein and placed her hand over her belly, where the vis bullae dangled, protecting her.</p><p>Stepping closer, Victoria smoothed her hand over the length of the shard and felt the prickle of evil present. She wondered, belatedly, if it was safe to leave it here, in the deepest, most remote part of the Consilium.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s voice caused her to jerk her hand away and whirl around. \u201cStop sneaking up on me,\u201d she snapped, hating that he\u2019d surprised her. She stepped away from the table, refusing to look at the shard behind her. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you weren\u2019t sure if you were back. And now you are everywhere, as if you had never left. As if you have the right.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d stepped into the doorway, filling it, casting a long, dark shadow from the brighter hallway behind him. \u201cI\u2019m back for now,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you looking for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making certain Aunt Eustacia didn\u2019t leave her armband here before going...that night. It was a possibility,\u201d she said defensively as he raised a brow. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m late for my meeting with Wayren.\u201d</p><p>Brushing past him, forcing him to back out of the entrance, she went into the small vestibule, closing the storage chamber door behind her. But to her surprise, when she turned to enter the library Max was right there in her wake. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked rudely.</p><p>\u201cAs an adviser to the previous Illa Gardella,\u201d he said smoothly, \u201cI was invited to attend. Ilias felt that it was appropriate for me to be here.\u201d</p><p>Wayren interrupted any response she might have made. \u201cPlease sit down, Victoria, and Max, perhaps you will take that seat.\u201d If the mild-mannered woman was surprised or upset by the barbed comments of the Venators, she gave no sign of it. \u201cNow, tell us what has happened.\u201d</p><p>With a glare at Max, Victoria had no choice but to speak. \u201cMy mother and her friends have been invited to a gathering at none other than the Palombara villa tonight for a treasure hunt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps they\u2019re searching for the missing key,\u201d Max said. He was settled back in his chair, nearly lounging, with his long legs crossed before him and his wrists resting on the arms of his seat. Almost as if he knew that the more relaxed he looked, the more irritated Victoria would be.</p><p>And she was.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, that was what I thought\u2014that the missing key is likely somewhere in the villa. I\u2019ll be attending tonight as well, however, to make certain all goes well...and to perhaps find the key myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the capable arm of Zavier,\u201d Max interrupted. \u201cA good plan, indeed, to have someone to watch over your mother. But not the best plan.\u201d</p><p>Victoria took a deep breath, forcing her bubbling annoyance to simmer and settle. She was Illa Gardella now...no longer the naive amateur Venator that Max had had the ability to pique so easily a year ago. She was the one; she\u2019d proven herself; she had the blood, the skills...the two vis bullae.</p><p>This was her life now.</p><p>He might have more experience than she, and it was valuable. But she still had her own merit and could listen to his suggestions without feeling challenged.</p><p>Even if it irked her. But as she released her breath slowly and evenly, as Kritanu had taught her, she merely lifted her eyebrows\u2014both of them, in direct contrast to Max\u2019s single eyebrow lifting\u2014and waited for him to continue.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that Sara Regalado attempted to kidnap you, so it\u2019s likely that she and her father are interested in the key, or something else related to the villa. There are no Palombaras in Roma, yet there are vampires\u2014we presume\u2014who are attempting to find the keys and open the Door of Alchemy. It is possible, do you not think, that someone is pretending to be the Palombaras, and opening the deserted villa up to this...party tonight in the hopes of finding the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that they might indeed be vampires or Tutela members?\u201d Victoria added. \u201cYes. Which is why I have asked Zavier to attend...as my mother\u2019s escort.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to settle back in the chair. \u201cI will be attending, Max, but anonymously. I don\u2019t particularly wish to be recognized by any vampires who might be at the treasure hunt tonight. And especially since my mother was invited by the Tarruscelli twins, whom I already know to be acquaintances of the Regalados, I was well aware of the dangers of promenading up to the villa unsuspectingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you plan to sneak into the villa yourself?\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll make up some excuse in the carriage on the way to the party that will allow me to leave Zavier as escort for my mother and the others while I pretend to return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant, Victoria. You\u2019ve thought the whole thing through.\u201d Max nodded as if bestowing a great favor on her. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there and we can find our way in together.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. It would have given him too much satisfaction.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d expected nothing less from him.</p><p>Eight</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Is Forced into a Gown and Its Accoutrements</p><p>Victoria slipped her hand through Zavier\u2019s arm after they alighted from the carriage at the entrance to the Villa Palombara.</p><p>She was dressed as if she were attending a ball at Almack\u2019s, attired more formally and finely than she\u2019d been in months. Despite the inconvenience of wearing a gown in a situation that could become anything but sedate, deep in the most feminine part of her it had been worth it to see the expression on Zavier\u2019s face when she came into the sitting room, ready to leave. She\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like to dress for an evening out.That part of her life was so far behind her now, so submerged, it was like a dream.</p><p>Lady Winnie had indeed spoken to her maid, Rudgers, who had unfairly taken poor Verbena to task. That had given Verbena at last an excuse to dress her mistress as befitted the marchioness she was. Her gown was a pink pearl hue, made of silk and trimmed with dark pink rosettes in two rows along the flounced hemline. More rosettes clustered at the tops of her sleeves in small red-and-white bouquets with long, grass-green ribbons dangling to brush her arms. The sleeves were short caps, but Victoria had pink gloves that reached from fingertip to past her elbow, so despite the fact that her wrap was little more than a cobweb of white lace, her arms were not chilled.</p><p>Rather than the simple plait she\u2019d taken to wearing, Victoria\u2019s coiffure was an intricate gathering of tiny braids, spiraling curls, and pink pearls at the back of her crown. It left her long white neck bare except for pale rubies that dangled from her ears, and the silver cross that sat at the base of her throat.</p><p>Into the coiffure, Verbena had slid one of the decorated stakes she and Oliver had taken to creating for their vampire hunter mistress. This particular one was long and slender\u2014but thick enough to be deadly to a vampire\u2014with roses carved on the handle and the whole stake painted pink. Victoria had been able to convince Verbena to leave off the feathers this time, although two pearls had found their way into the centers of the roses.</p><p>Beneath all these accoutrements of feminity was Miro\u2019s latest creation in the battle against the undead: a special corset. The idea had come from Verbena initially. Not only did she take her mistress\u2019s fashion seriously, but she was also the only maid in London who fussed over weapons and tools.</p><p>Flimsy slippers allowed every little stone to poke through to her soles as she and Zavier, with Lady Nilly on his other arm, walked up to the entrance of the villa. They followed in the wake of the ladies Melly and Winnie.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t very festive,\u201d Lady Winnie said, her comment loud enough for Victoria to hear from behind, and obviously forgetting that they weren\u2019t attending a party. \u201cIt\u2019s as if there\u2019s hardly anyone here. Not even a footman to help us down from the carriage! I know the family hasn\u2019t lived here for decades, but one would think they would have cleaned up a bit before having us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a treasure hunt,\u201d Lady Nilly trilled, edging closer to Zavier. \u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere! Intriguing, foreboding, haunting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t as if it\u2019s to be a crush of a ball,\u201d Lady Melly added, glancing back at her daughter. \u201cIt was made very clear that tonight is not a celebration of any kind, and only very few were invited. We were lucky enough to be asked. If it weren\u2019t for Barone Tarruscelli, who gave us their own invitation, we shouldn\u2019t have been included at all.\u201d</p><p>It was indeed an eerie, strange atmosphere. The mansion itself was hidden by the same tall wall Victoria and Ylito had climbed through to get to the Door of Alchemy, which was at the opposite end of the vast grounds of the estate, set away from the main building of the villa. Behind the crumbling wall, the manor house was gloomy and dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead of the great light spilling from numerous windows that would accompany most fetes or dinner parties or soirees, the building had only a small yellow glow from the front entrance. The door opened, giving just a brief glimpse of a butler, and then closed behind a cluster of people, as though loath to waste its illumination on the night.</p><p>Indeed, the line of carriages dropping off guests was hardly a line at all, for there weren\u2019t so very many guests. This was a fact that had not escaped Victoria, and as they approached the door and it opened again she paused, edging into the welcome shadows so that no one inside could see her. She wondered not for the first time whether it had been by accident or design that the mother of a Venator had been invited to attend.</p><p>Zavier stopped, urging Lady Melly to go on ahead as Victoria pretended to adjust her loose slipper. The older woman, thrilled by the same environment that set her daughter\u2019s instincts on edge, did not hesitate and gladly entered the door, opened by a butler who barely stepped far enough away for them to enter. She was followed by Lady Nilly and Lady Winnie.</p> <p>The door closed without the butler even looking about, and Victoria and Zavier were alone in the darkness together.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll take care now,\u201d Zavier said, capturing Victoria\u2019s gloved hand as she straightened from pretending to fix her slipper, a task meant to keep her from being recognized by anyone inside the villa.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you again for coming, Zavier. I know my mother will be safe in your care, and I\u2019ll be able to slip into the building without being noticed. If you see anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll tend to her. And I\u2019ll keep watch for anything odd, though I don\u2019t ken what it is we might find. I canna believe the key is hidden in this house any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begin to wonder myself. It could be a perfectly harmless, foolish little event meant to slip under the notice of the priests during Lent...but I do not believe it. However, I don\u2019t sense any undead nearby. So perhaps all will be well.\u201d</p> <p>She would have turned away to melt back into the shadows so Zavier could enter the house, but his hand, rough from the calluses on his palm, stopped her, brushing over her cheek. \u201cYour lip\u2019s nearly healed. Best take care not to run into more door corners,\u201d he said, reminding her of the lie she\u2019d given to excuse the nip Beauregard had given her the night before.</p><p>\u201cIt was very clumsy of me,\u201d she replied, thinking of how she\u2019d bumped her forehead into Max that same evening...and then she realized Zavier\u2019s intention.</p><p>He was going to kiss her. She tensed in anticipation.</p><p>Zavier moved closer and brushed her mouth with his, leaving a gentle scrape of whiskers and the musty smell of tobacco in the wake of the kiss. When he pulled back to look at her, their eyes were nearly level. Though it was too dark to see his expression, she could feel the faint tremble in his fingers against her chin. \u201cOch, now,\u201d he said, a smile in his voice, \u201chow does that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it feels much better,\u201d she replied lightly, smiling back, hoping that Max wouldn\u2019t appear from the shadows and ruin the moment. It would be just like him.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d Zavier said so softly his brogue was hardly noticeable, and then leaned forward to kiss her again. This time it was more than a brush of lips, yet there was still gentleness about it\u2014as if he still wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d allow it, or as if he wasn\u2019t sure it was real.</p> <p>The kiss was brief, as kisses went\u2014certainly not as long or involved as others she\u2019d experienced. When Victoria realized her hand had somehow made its way to the front of his massive shoulder and felt the slamming pounding of his heart all the way up in his neck, she drew back.</p><p>He pulled in a breath as if to speak, but she forestalled anything he might have said. \u201cMy mother will be wondering what\u2019s keeping us. Perhaps you\u2019d best make your way inside. Give her the excuse that the strap on my slipper has broken and I\u2019ve returned home to get a new one.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his shaggy hair falling forward. With a sweep of his hand he brushed it back over his brow and stepped away. \u201cYe have a care,\u201d he said, and turned to walk back toward the main entrance, which had, during this interlude, remained closed and deserted.</p><p>Victoria watched him go and waited for Max to emerge from the shadows as she stripped off her gloves. She didn\u2019t like to wear them when there was the possibility of a fight.</p><p>The world remained silent, however\u2014silent and empty, filled with shadows and looming walls. Since Zavier had entered the villa there was no further activity. A few more lights had winked on in various windows, accompanied by moving shadows.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s neck was warm, but she was beginning to feel a little chilled everywhere else. It was, after all, February, and though milder than it would be in London, it was still cool after sundown. Dressed as she was in flimsy evening clothing, she knew she couldn\u2019t wait much longer, when a tussle in the overgrown bushes caught her attention.</p><p>Max emerged, coming from the opposite direction she\u2019d expected\u2014not from the drive, but from behind the villa.</p><p>\u201cAnother key has been inserted,\u201d he said without preamble, stepping like a long black shadow into the circle of light cast by a lone lantern.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean to say you looked at the Door of Alchemy and there are two keys now?\u201d Victoria said, stepping toward him.</p><p>\u201cThat is what I said, yes. I\u2019ve just come from there. I wanted to see it for myself.\u201d His sharp nod indicated the direction behind the villa, off to the right and toward the back of the estate. \u201cThere\u2019s an old servants\u2019 entrance into the building back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich keys?\u201d Victoria asked, starting off after him into the darkness along the wall of the house. \u201cWhich ones were turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEustacia\u2019s wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>She felt a wave of relief; then something wet seeped through her slipper as she made her way along. Pursing her lips in annoyance, she continued on, not altogether certain it had been an accident that Max had led her this way.</p><p>At last he stopped in front of a door much less grand than the main entrance. A few sharp movements, the sound of splintering, and one powerful angling of his shoulders\u2014and the door opened into a dark room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d Victoria said, stepping past Max into a musty entryway. At least part of the information about the party wasn\u2019t a lie: The villa had obviously not been opened for years. If anyone had inhabited the place, the servants\u2019 entrance, at least, would have been well used.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>It was dark, and Victoria paused for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the unfamiliar environment. Then, without a word to Max, she began to walk quickly, silently, but cautiously down the hallway toward the main part of the house.</p><p>She\u2019d taken no more than three steps in her soggy slippers when a strong grip pulled her back. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Shaking off his hand, she looked up at him. \u201cBlast it, Max, where do you think?\u201d She managed to keep her voice low, although it was hard. \u201cTo the parlor or ballroom, where they\u2019ve likely all gathered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you might wish to follow me. That direction\u201d\u2014he pointed where she\u2019d been going, his hand boldly in her face\u2014\u201cleads to the servants\u2019 quarters.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing more, but turned and trotted off after him, annoyed with herself for getting her directions confused now that she was inside the building. Of course the servants\u2019 quarters were toward the back side of the villa.</p><p>The passageway was deserted, and there were cobwebs and dust everywhere. Victoria had to press her fingers over the top of her nose to keep from sneezing when Max brushed past an old drape that must have sent up a cloud of dust. She couldn\u2019t tell for sure, because of the darkness. There were voices in the distance, and as they moved along the servants\u2019 hallway the sounds grew louder.</p><p>Max stopped when they came to one of the back doors that obviously led from the servants\u2019 area to the main part of the house. He cracked the door and peered inside, deliberately\u2014Victoria was sure\u2014positioning himself so that she couldn\u2019t see around him.</p><p>Or maybe she was just falling back into that old habit of being perturbed by everything he did or said.</p><p>Certainly he\u2019d intentionally tried to irritate her when she\u2019d first become a Venator and they\u2019d had to work together. And last fall, when he\u2019d been pretending to be part of the Tutela, he\u2019d had to be even ruder and more snide than usual in order to keep her from asking too many questions.</p><p>But perhaps he really had come to respect her as a Venator, now that Aunt Eustacia was gone and he\u2019d had a chance to think about things. In any case, despite his blunt ways, she was glad he was back.</p><p>Victoria realized he\u2019d stepped away from the doorway and was looking at her. \u201cThey\u2019ve gathered there in what must be the ballroom,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019ll sneak in and listen to what\u2019s being said. I saw a flight of stairs that might lead above for a better look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up and see what there is to see,\u201d she said, and started toward the door, but his hand on her upper arm stopped her.</p><p>\u201cGo to the left, stay in the shadows, and you\u2019ll find the stairs.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, then turned back to add, \u201cMeet at the servants\u2019 door if we\u2019re separated.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a response she did as he\u2019d suggested, opening the door that, by virtue of the fact that it was designed to be an unobtrusive servants\u2019 entrance, was set in the darkest corner of the room beyond it. She found it no difficult feat to move quickly and rapidly along the wall to a flight of stairs that led to a balconylike alcove above.</p><p>As she scurried along the wall, she saw that the main room was not the ballroom, but an anteroom that offered three wide arches that led to the ballroom.</p><p>The people Victoria saw gathered barely constituted a crowd at all; perhaps twenty or thirty people stood about. They had sparkling goblets that looked out of place in a gloomy room lit not with lamps or sconces, but with only candles\u2014although there were nearly as many candles tonight as there had been last night on the Corso. And since there was no music to act as a backdrop, and their voices were low murmurs, the occasion had a rather eerie feel. The furnishings were spare. A small table presumably held the drinks the guests had received, and another long table across the room was covered with what appeared to be scrolls of paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria reached the stairs without incident, but as she rested her hand on the filthy balustrade she bumped into a small metal vase that had been hidden in the darkness. It tumbled off the bottom step and clanged to the floor. She caught it before it bounced again and, still holding it, dashed up the steps, seeking obscurity in the darkness above.</p><p>At the top she paused, looking back down the steps, privately berating herself for not being more careful. She held her breath, waiting to see if she\u2019d be discovered.</p><p>After a long moment she saw two figures down below her moving purposefully toward the spot where the vase had banged on the floor. One of them pointed up the steps, into the darkness that concealed Victoria, but the other shook his head. Easing back even more, Victoria watched the two men converse while looking around nervously. Since she\u2019d taken the vase with her, there wasn\u2019t anything to indicate the source of the noise they\u2019d heard, and at last they walked back toward the main room.</p> <p>She set the vase on the floor well out of the way and looked around, finding herself on a curtained balcony that overlooked what would have been the dance floor if, indeed, there had been dancing. The space was all shadows, for the only light came from the half-drawn curtains at the balcony\u2019s rail, hiding her presence from the room below. Very convenient.</p><p>So convenient that it made her wonder what the area had been used for when the villa was fully inhabited.</p><p>After a quick look around to ascertain that she was indeed alone, and that there didn\u2019t seem to be any other entrance or exit from the small alcove, she moved to the drapes and peered down through the large gap between them. Carefully pulling them closer together, so as not to draw attention to the movement of the velvet, she took advantage of her bird\u2019s-eye view and watched.</p><p>Although the group was small, the gathering looked no different from any other party Victoria had witnessed. It was certainly nothing like the Tutela meeting she\u2019d had the misfortune to attend last autumn. There was no hypnotically scented incense burning, no chanting, no dais with a Tutela leader urging the attendees to support and save the vampires.</p><p>It was merely a party. People talked, and although their voices seemed to echo loudly and eerily in a relatively empty room, and there was a sense of unease creeping over Victoria\u2019s shoulders, nothing else seemed amiss. She still sensed no vampires.</p> <p>There was Lady Melly...and Lady Nilly, too, hands flapping like spiraling birds as she made some urgent point. And Lady Winnie approached just then, holding a small plate of the dry Italian biscuits she claimed to disdain.</p><p>At that moment someone stepped behind Victoria, silent, sending her hair prickling.</p><p>Max.</p><p>Victoria didn\u2019t turn, didn\u2019t acknowledge his presence as she looked down from her hidden view, watching the people mingling below. The edges of the velvet curtain crinkled under her fingers as she pulled it taut from its moorings, positioning it in front of her face so she could look through the narrow opening. Max moved closer, brushing her shoulder as he peered through the same slit.</p><p>Now she saw Zavier in the center of the room below, talking with two men, and she focused her attention on him rather than on the man behind her, crowding her against the drapes.</p><p>Somehow Max must have known her thoughts, for he said in a low, amused voice, \u201cA nice lad, Zavier. A good Venator.\u201d He was standing so close behind her his words whispered over her temple. If she drew in her breath, Victoria was certain her shoulders would brush against his chest.</p> <p>She continued to watch Zavier, watch the way he gestured grandly, his large arms and broad shoulders setting him apart from the willowy dandies with whom he spoke: men who could be expected to parry a few fancy steps with an ep\u00e9e, and perhaps throw a punch or so if caught in an unpleasant situation...but who hadn\u2019t one iota of the power and strength in comparison to the more casually dressed Scot before them.</p><p>She looked down, turning her attention to count the people below, to give her something to focus on, willing her heart to slow its jagged pounding, and wishing Max would step away before she had to.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t move. His voice rumbled again. \u201cTake care with him.\u201d There was an edge to his words, a warning that hadn\u2019t been there a moment before.</p><p>\u201cTake care?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she felt the movement of his head against the top of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll break his heart.\u201d</p><p>Victoria started in surprise, but her grip on the curtains\u2014which had suddenly become deathly\u2014kept her from spinning around or even turning her head. Still looking down, she tipped her face slightly to the side so he could hear her cool words. \u201cBreak his heart? What on earth do you mean? Never say you are attempting to advise me on my intimate affairs, Max. The closest you\u2019ve come to any matter of the heart was an engagement to a lover of vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZavier is a good man.\u201d Max\u2019s voice was calm and even in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re too strong for him. You\u2019ll merely tread upon him with your silk slippers and trounce his heart, which he wears much too openly on his sleeve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never cease to amaze me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d he interrupted, still smooth but very firm. \u201cThe man is in love with the idea of a woman Venator. Any woman Venator. Had Eustacia been a few decades younger, he would have courted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crude, Max.\u201d</p><p>A short, sharp laugh rumbled. \u201cPerhaps. But at least I speak honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisgustingly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be better off with the likes of Vioget than that milksop Zavier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begin to wonder why you continue to push me toward Sebastian. Is it some form of punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush you toward Sebastian? I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you, after all, who ordered him to kidnap me last autumn to keep me out of your way.\u201d Max had known well enough that she\u2019d want to be involved in destroying Nedas, but she\u2019d had no idea how tenuous and risky his plans were, and how much her interference could have jeopardized them. So he\u2019d arranged for Sebastian to get her out of the way.</p><p>\u201cA task that he accepted with embarrassing alacrity\u2014but, of course, he had his own motives for cooperating. I\u2019m certain he found the rewards worth the risk. That carriage must have been quite comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s face burned. How could he know she\u2019d allowed Sebastian to seduce her in a carriage? Thank God he couldn\u2019t see her cheeks; they must be red with fury and embarrassment. And how dared he say such a thing?</p><p>Did he think that since she\u2019d seen and experienced so much more than other women that her sensibilities weren\u2019t as delicate?</p><p>\u201cAt least Vioget can recognize your faults,\u201d Max continued in that steady voice, as though he hadn\u2019t just insulted her. \u201cAnd, aside from that, I wouldn\u2019t bloody care if you were to tear out Vioget\u2019s innards and screw your heels into them. In fact, I\u2019d applaud it. Zavier, on the other hand, the blasted fool, wouldn\u2019t see your faults if you engraved them on his stake. He\u2019s already anointed you and ensconced you on a pedestal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still fail to see why you should be concerned about my affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand. It isn\u2019t your affairs that concern me. It\u2019s Zavier\u2019s. I should hate to see a Venator incapacitated due to a broken heart. And you will break his if you continue on this path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so certain of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not strong enough, Victoria. He\u2019s an exceptional Venator, but he\u2019s not equipped to manage his heart. He cannot see your faults; he will let you run roughshod over him...and, finally, he will bore you with his easy ways, his pathetic doggedness of wanting to make you happy\u2014all the time knowing he could lose you to this dangerous world we inhabit. And that\u2019s what I do not wish to see. For his sake. For ours, as Venators.\u201d</p><p>Tears had begun to sting the corners of her eyes, blurring her view of the party below. Burning tears of anger and grief. She blinked and took a long, slow breath, resisting the desire to spin a slap onto his aristocratic cheek like the Society miss she no longer was. \u201cYou would have said the same about Phillip had I listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice became sharper and more serious. \u201cPhillip was strong enough. He just didn\u2019t understand the world you live in. If he had...\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t need to finish, and Victoria didn\u2019t want him to. She released the curtains and slipped to the side, away from him. She knew very well that if Phillip had understood her life even a little, things would have been so very different. Her eyes stung and her throat felt as though she\u2019d swallowed a ball.</p><p>\u201cVictoria, you of all people know what it is like to suffer a broken heart. Take care not to bring the same onto one of your men. You have the power to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget that this Venator wasn\u2019t incapacitated with a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She drew herself up to reply...and then deflated. Oh, God, yes, she had been. For nearly a year after Phillip\u2019s death she\u2019d been afraid to raise her stake for fear she\u2019d turn berserker and annihilate anything in her path. The gifts she had, the powers, the strengths, the instincts: They could all be wielded for bad as well as for good. And the rage that had simmered beneath her calm exterior\u2014the rage and hatred and loss\u2014could have brought her down the wrong path.</p><p>The tears, silent and thus hidden in the darkness, were streaming down her cheeks now. Victoria had moved away from the gap in the curtains, away from Max and his insistent opinions, his ruthless words.</p><p>She drew in a long, deep breath, struggling to keep it from hitching and giving away the fact that he had brought her to this, and moved farther away. She wanted to get away from him, away from his damned truths.</p><p>Max turned, and the small slit in the curtains closed, leaving them in total darkness. The only relief was a dark gray essence that came from the direction of the stairs up which she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cVictoria?\u201d His voice was quiet.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to see here,\u201d she replied, relieved at how steady she sounded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen no members of the Tutela.\u201d She was moving quickly and silently toward the exit and the stairs, focusing on the barest sense of light and her outstretched hands to find her way. \u201cI\u2019ll go down to see what I can find.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d Max was moving behind her; she could hear him. But she kept going toward the stairs, moving as quickly as she could, her eyes now able to make out the faintest of shapes.</p><p>She came to the top of the stairs, her hand on the balustrade helping her to feel her way around the corner at the top of the landing. Suddenly something came out of the darkness in front of her.</p><p>It was strong and metal, and someone was poking it into the front of her shoulder. \u201cHow serendipitous,\u201d came a familiar male voice. \u201cWhat an unexpected prize our little trap has sprung.\u201d</p> <p>A candle flared to life in front of her, revealing Mr. George Starcasset...and Lady Sarafina Regalado.</p><p>Nine</p><p>In Which Three Ladies Are Set Loose upon the Villa</p><p>Max heard the soft click of a pistol being cocked, and he froze just as he realized the back of his neck had begun to prickle and chill.</p><p>Vampires...somewhere...but not in close proximity.The sudden flare of a candle lent a soft yellow glow from down the steps, just out of his sight. Then the light grew stronger and more yellow as three shadowy people moved up the stairs, into his view.</p> <p>\u201cAnd who were you\u2014Ah! Maximilian!\u201d</p><p>He knew that annoying voice all too well. Blast the chit.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d He couldn\u2019t bring himself to sound as delighted as his former fianc\u00e9e did. \u201cAnd Starcasset. What an unpleasant\u2014yet not wholly unexpected\u2014surprise.\u201d</p><p>He saw that Victoria\u2014whose face was streaked with two narrow rivulets of...tears?\u2014was under the control of George Starcasset and his pistol. She was also giving him, Max, a most loathing glare, as if it were somehow his fault she\u2019d stormed into the barrel of the firearm.</p><p>Before he could move Sarafina came toward him. She was the buxom blonde, with pretty brown eyes and a head filled with little but fashion sense and coy comments, that he\u2019d squired about Roma and engaged in many more t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates with her than he\u2019d cared to do. She was a lovely, fluffy piece\u2014just the kind of woman he should marry if he ever actually thought he would do the deed, except for her affinity for the undead. But her voice and simpering mannerisms tended to grate on his nerves when he was exposed to her for any length of time.</p><p>Of course, at the moment, that simpering, fluffy chit had a pistol in her hands, so he was going to have to watch his tongue.</p> <p>When she reached toward his right shoulder he merely looked down at her in annoyance and faint amusement, wondering if she was about to pull him into a reunion embrace. But when Sarafina yanked on his collar, pulling it back from Max\u2019s neck and exposing the raw bites there, he pushed her hand away, heedless of the pistol flailing about in her other grip.</p><p>\u201cGood gad, watch that thing,\u201d he snapped, flipping his wretchedly stiff collar back into place. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt someone, Sara. Put it away.\u201d</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she kept the pistol and steadied it, pressing it right into his middle. Painfully. \u201cSo it is true. You did go to her.\u201d</p><p>Max remembered belatedly that there was no fury like a woman scorned.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could settle your lovers\u2019 quarrel some other time,\u201d Starcasset luckily interrupted. He must have jabbed his firearm into Victoria\u2019s skin a bit more harshly, for she winced and jolted. Looking at Max, he added, \u201cI\u2019m certain you can appreciate the benefits of coming along quietly.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cIndeed. It would not be in our interest to involve the other parties below in a skirmish.\u201d He glanced at Victoria to make sure she understood that she couldn\u2019t go blazing into a fight, but she was studiously looking away, her lips firmed with annoyance.</p><p>Surely she wasn\u2019t concerned about their current predicament.</p><p>\u201cWell put, Mr. Pesaro. Now, if you and your jilted fianc\u00e9e would be so kind as to lead the way, Lady Rockley and I will follow.\u201d</p> <p>Thus they moved down the steps in pairs, remaining out of sight of the presumed party in the chamber beyond the anteroom where the stairs ended, Sara prodding him along in the opposite direction from which he and Victoria had come.</p><p>Max was armed with several stakes, including his favorite black one, and his own firearm, as well as a dagger sheathed in his boot. It was the mark of the amateurs who led them away that neither Starcasset nor Sara Regalado thought to check either of the Venators for weapons. Likely they thought vampire hunters would merely be carrying stakes and little else.</p><p>He would make certain they were far enough away not to alert or alarm the partygoers in the parlor before making his move. The last thing they needed was a hoard of frithering ladies and blustering would-be heroes getting in their way.</p><p>As they progressed, the sensations at the back of his neck grew colder and more intense, telling him that they were being taken to some conglomerate of vampires. They walked through a door, entering a large, dank room that appeared to be at least partially underground, if one judged by the greater chill in the air.</p><p>Obviously a contingent of undead had gathered in the Villa Palombara. Apparently that was the true purpose behind the ostensible treasure hunt: a harvesting of victims by the Tutela, likely for Sara Regalado\u2019s father, the conte\u2014and whatever minions he\u2019d managed to gather around him after he was run off by Beauregard last fall in the wake of the destruction of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk.</p><p>An argument could be made, Max reflected as he ambled along next to Sara, that being brought closer to where the vampires were waiting would make their efforts to subdue them more efficient.</p><p>A sudden movement behind decided him. Knowing it was Victoria who\u2019d somehow managed to catch Starcasset, the brainless devil, off guard, he swung into action as soon as Sara\u2019s attention was diverted and the pressure lifted from his ribs.</p><p>There was a fine line between disarming a woman and causing her hurt, and so Max allowed himself a bit of flair in this battle. He slid to the side, his feet lifting from the ground in the long, gliding leap of a qinggong movement, and came up and around Sara, Victoria, and Starcasset, executing the maneuver even in the low-ceilinged chamber.</p><p>The room was a blur as he spun and floated, leaped and glided, clocking Starcasset neatly at the back of his head with a well-aimed boot toe (he had no such qualms about injuring the dandy), and then coasting around to snag Sara around the waist and toss her through a nearby doorway.</p><p>In the midst of this effortless and liberating activity, Max saw a flash of pink that was Victoria, dashing away in the frilly gown she\u2019d chosen for this occasion. It wasn\u2019t like her to run from a fight, so he knew precisely why she\u2019d taken off.</p><p>Feet back on the ground, Max tossed Starcasset in after Sara, then shoved a heavy table in front of the door, wedging it under the knob, and started off after Victoria. His neck was cold; his fingers tingled. There were undead nearby, and many of them, if his senses were accurate.</p><p>And they always were.</p><p>The only reason he caught up to Victoria was because she\u2019d taken a wrong turn\u2014no surprise\u2014and ended up in a dead-end hall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask where she was going; she turned on him and said, \u201cMy mother!\u201d Her eyes were worried and her mouth set in an anxious line as she pushed past him.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>However, they\u2019d not gone very far back when they turned a corner and were running down yet another hall just as a second door opened. More than a dozen creatures streamed in, at least some of them vampires.</p><p>Max saw Victoria run right into one of them, and before she could react another creature had leaped on her from behind. She went down in a bundle of pink lace and red rosettes, bringing the vampire with her and helping him on his way over her head.</p><p>He saw nothing else after that, however, for he was, of necessity, fully engaged with the four who leaped on him. He quickly dispatched one with his stake, but two more took its place. Something slammed into Max\u2019s legs from behind, sending his knees buckling and him collapsing to the floor.</p><p>He reared up, swinging, just as a sharp report echoed through the room. A blinding pain drilled into his shoulder, just above the scapula, and then another flash of pain skimmed his boot top, above his knee. Breathless with agony, Max lurched forward, bringing his injured leg up behind to slam into the creature as he tried to catch himself on his good arm.</p><p>Rolling to the side, he jerked to his feet just as something crashed onto the top of his head and the world went black.</p><p>\u201cI vow, I expect a vampire to leap out at us any moment!\u201d Lady Nilly whispered loudly. She was clasping a slender hand to her flat bosom as she led the way down a dark, dusty hall, lit only by the candle she held aloft.The passageway was wide enough for the three of them to walk abreast, if they so chose, although the occasional table they passed might have necessitated that one of them temporarily fall behind. Vases or statues, many of them broken or lying on their sides, decorated the random furnishings. The ceiling was high, the walls lined with wainscoting, and everything was cobwebbed and dusty. More than once the ladies were startled by the sudden appearance of a cloudy mirror reflecting their progress along the hall.</p><p>\u201cVampire?\u201d Lady Winnie gasped, slapping her own hand to her chest with a loud thunk and a poof of powder. She crowded up behind her slight friend and the safety of her light. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing my cross! And I\u2019ve left my reticule with garlic at home! And my stake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Winnie,\u201d came Lady Melly\u2019s voice behind them. \u201cI scarcely need remind you that there aren\u2019t any such things as vampires, and it\u2019s just as well you aren\u2019t wearing that ridiculous cross. It\u2019s too large and bangs against you every time you move. It sounds like a morbid heartbeat, and it\u2019s so big it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be dangerous,\u201d Winnie replied, her voice bordering on a wail. She\u2019d grasped the back of Nilly\u2019s gown and was holding a fistful of silk. \u201cTo the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just the perfect house for the undead to be lurking about,\u201d Nilly said, turning to look back at her friends with wide eyes. The single candlestick she held made a yellow glow about her face, lighting her wispy blond curls. \u201cI can feel it! The restlessness in the air...the sensation of dark shadows, moving toward us...the sound of bat wings flapping\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d squealed Winnie, releasing her friend\u2019s gown to clap her hands over her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we came to this dark, horrible place anyway. And why ever did we sneak away from that nice Mr. Zavier?\u201d</p><p>Melly\u2019s hand on the duchess\u2019s plump arm nearly sent her friend through the cobwebbed ceiling, but her strident voice was sharp enough to penetrate the duchess\u2019s hysterics. \u201cYou\u2019re making a cake of yourself, Winnie. Do cease your wailing. And it was your idea to send Mr. Zavier for drinks whilst we sneaked away to start on this treasure hunt. Now, Nilly, let me look at that map. And do stop prattling about vampires. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re letting you be in the lead.\u201d</p><p>Lady Melisande pushed her way past her hysterical friend, who had twisted about to grab onto Melly\u2019s arm and was now clinging to her like a good corset.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear anyone else,\u201d whispered the cowering duchess fearfully. \u201cWe must be far away from the rest of the people. Oh, why did we come? We\u2019ll be found tomorrow with our throats torn open and three big Xs marked on our snowy white bosoms.\u201d</p><p>Melly had snatched the map, which was really nothing more than a crude drawing of the villa\u2019s floor plan. She struggled to aim it at the illumination of Nilly\u2019s candle, all without catching the large, curling paper on fire. \u201cHow badly have you lost us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tear our throats open,\u201d Nilly remonstrated the duchess, ignoring Lady Melly\u2019s question. \u201cVampires don\u2019t do that unless you fight them, or unless they are very angry. They just bite your chest or your shoulder and drink your blood.\u201d</p><p>Winnie\u2019s hands moved up to cover her alarmingly bare throat, her small eyes goggling as wide as they could, darting about as if to see the lurking vampires before they leaped. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s sister\u2019s friend\u2019s mother was bitten by a vampire,\u201d Nilly continued, peering into the darkness ahead of them. \u201cShe said it hardly hurt at all...and that it was rather pleasant, in some ways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how big fangs cutting into my neck would be almost pleasant,\u201d Winnie replied fearfully, bumping into a low table. \u201cI do believe I should faint dead away so that I wouldn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I help you ladies?\u201d came a genteel voice.</p><p>All three heads snapped toward the man, who\u2019d suddenly appeared from...well, it was unclear from whence he\u2019d appeared.</p><p>Winnie gasped and squeezed Lady Melly\u2019s arm so hard the other woman gasped too. \u201cWh-wh-wh\u2014\u201d was all she could manage.</p><p>\u201cDo not be frightened,\u201d he said, stepping closer, smiling gently, his hand outstretched as if to put off their fears. He wasn\u2019t a young man, but appeared to be of an age with them. He seemed harmless enough, dressed in dusty evening clothes and carrying his own candle. A cobweb clung to his sleeve, suggesting that he, too, had been digging his way through the house in search of the treasure. The man wasn\u2019t particularly handsome, but despite his trim mustache and beard\u2014likely grown to make up for the lack of hair on his head\u2014his face was pleasant. He certainly didn\u2019t look like he was about to sprout fangs and leap upon them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not frightened,\u201d Melly said in a strangled voice, trying to free herself from Winnie\u2019s death grip. \u201cWe just stopped to look at the map. Are you on the treasure hunt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Perhaps I can assist you? Did you wish to go back to the parlor, where everyone else is waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas everyone returned to the parlor already? Has the treasure been found?\u201d Winnie forgot her nervousness and stepped toward him, disappointment oozing from every pore.</p><p>Before he could answer they were interrupted by a loud sound, as if an altercation was happening, perhaps a short distance away. \u201cWhat is that noise? Are they celebrating the treasure being found?\u201d Winnie demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I do not believe so,\u201d the bald man replied, offering an arm to Melly. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for that. Please, let me be of assistance. If you would come with me, I shall take you ladies on your way.\u201d</p><p>Melly started off with him in the direction he indicated, followed by Nilly and Winnie.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s a vampire?\u201d Winnie squeaked softly to Nilly. \u201cHe could turn into a bat at any moment and swoop down over us and get caught in our hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he is, he\u2019s likely going to take us somewhere and ravish us,\u201d Lady Petronilla replied, her voice pitched nervously. \u201cI wonder if it will be in a bedchamber, or if he\u2019ll take us to his coffin and chain two of us up inside while he bites the other one?\u201d</p><p>Lady Winifred stumbled. \u201cRavish? Chains? Coffin? Oh, how could I be so foolish as to leave my cross at home!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall offer him to take me first,\u201d Nilly said bravely. \u201cThen perhaps there will be a chance for you and Melly to escape whilst he is ravishing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stake. Perhaps I can find something to use as a stake. It must be wooden, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear! But he cannot be a vampire,\u201d Nilly suddenly said.</p><p>Nearly fainting in relief, Winnie turned to look at her companion. \u201cNo? But are you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014he carries a candle. Of course, everyone knows that vampires can see in the dark. Why should he need a candle? And he isn\u2019t nearly handsome enough,\u201d she added. \u201cNot tall enough either, I venture to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yes, not tall enough. And he doesn\u2019t need a candle. Indeed, I am so relieved you are such an expert about vampires, Nilly,\u201d the duchess said, picking up her stride and jouncing along merrily now.</p><p>Lady Petronilla didn\u2019t appear to be quite as relieved as her friend. \u201cBut, of course, I could be wrong. After all, I never have met a vampire,\u201d she added. Perhaps there was even a bit of wistfulness in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe must have gotten very confused,\u201d Lady Melisande was saying to their guide, her voice carrying back to her two companions. \u201cI don\u2019t recall walking this way at all.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman\u2019s soft laugh was easy and full of humor at the ladies\u2019 confusion. \u201cNo, indeed, madam. This is the way to the parlor. Unless you wish to see where I think the treasure is hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreasure?\u201d Lady Winifred bounded forward to walk on the other side of their guide. \u201cDo you know where it is hidden?\u201d</p><p>He smiled ruefully. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014ah, you have caught me out, madam. I shall take you, if you vow not to tell a soul it was I who led you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course not! And if there is treasure to be found there, you can rest assured we shall share it with you, kind sir,\u201d Winnie soothed him. \u201cBesides, it is best to bring us there posthaste rather than wait until after you have taken us to the parlor and then come back...for someone else might have found our treasure before you return. And then what a fine fettle we\u2019d be in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Your logic, though intricate, is quite\u2014er. If I am to take you there, then we must turn on this hallway here,\u201d he said, ushering them along.</p><p>This passageway was smaller and closer than the other ones through which they\u2019d traveled. It was spare of furnishings and decor, which would imply that the area the ladies now traversed was part of the servants\u2019 quarters.</p><p>Winnie noticed this and thought it was a brilliant deduction. \u201cOf course! The treasure should be hidden in the back of the villa, where no one ever goes.\u201d Forgetting, of course, that the servants who ran the household would have quite outnumbered the residents of the villa.</p><p>Nilly had begun to lag behind her two friends, who\u2019d placed the gentleman guide betwixt them. So when she felt a hand on her shoulder, her soft gasp of surprise was lost in the treasure-hunting conversation ahead.</p><p>She turned and found herself facing a tall man with black hair and fair skin, dressed like a gentleman on his way to the theater. He smiled, and she saw the glint of very white teeth behind his lips.</p><p>His eyes glowed red.</p><p>Nilly opened her mouth to scream, then thought better of it. Instead she closed her eyes and turned her head away demurely, fully aware that between her coiled-up hair and the low cut of her gown, there was quite a lot of skin exposed. Holding her breath, she let the candle fall and heard it roll away on the wood floor.</p><p>Her skin prickled as she waited, her veins fairly leaping, her heart trammeling in her flat bosom. Then the air shifted, and she heard something that sounded like a shove, and then a faint little pop followed by a soft poof.</p><p>And then a very smooth, mellow voice said, \u201cAre you quite all right, madam?\u201d</p><p>Nilly\u2019s eyes flew open. The man standing in front of her was no longer dark haired and pale visaged; nor did he have glowing red eyes.</p><p>He was just as handsome, but in a golden sort of way, with curling tawny hair and skin that glowed like toffee in the light of the candle he held. He was looking at her with one cocked eyebrow and a humorous twist to his sensual mouth.</p><p>\u201cI...you...he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is gone, and you are quite safe, madam. Or should I say mademoiselle?\u201d He gave her a melting smile. \u201cBut what is such a lovely woman like yourself doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNilly!\u201d</p><p>Her attention was drawn back along the dark, narrow hallway to the bustling of gowns and the rustling of paper heralding the approach of her two friends, their gentleman guide nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d wailed Nilly, her disappointment firmly sinking in.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you dawdling?\u201d demanded Melly. \u201cAs we\u2019ve found, it\u2019s much too easy to get lost in this vast house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re keeping us from finding the treasure,\u201d the duchess informed her. \u201cI vow, if we get there too late because of your mooning about, I shall never forgive you, Petronilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow come along. Our lovely gentleman friend is waiting,\u201d Melly added, pointing down the hall into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your candle? Now we shall have only one light, and you know how weak my eyes are in the darkness,\u201d said Winnie. \u201cI vow I cannot see past my own fingers even in my own bedchamber at night unless Rudgers leaves the fire blazing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nilly turned to the golden-haired man and found he was gone. Her mouth opened, then closed once again without making an intelligible sound.</p><p>There was nothing about to indicate that either of the men had ever been there, except her dropped candle\u2014which had gone out when it landed\u2014and a small pile of dust that she hadn\u2019t noticed earlier.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Nilly gave up trying to speak and, with one last glance backward, followed the others.</p> <p>\u201cI begin to wonder if Victoria has made her way back to the party,\u201d Melly said suddenly, as she and her companions started back down the hallway. Their gentleman guide had been left standing at the corner of an intersection of two passageways when the ladies had realized Nilly was no longer with them.</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s found that nice Mr. Zavier,\u201d Nilly said, finally having obtained control of her tongue. \u201cPerhaps they are becoming better acquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d The Lady Winifred straightened up as though Nilly had suggested Victoria might have fallen in love with a vampire. \u201cAs kind as he might be, he\u2019s much too coarse and...and...unshaven, and he certainly isn\u2019t up to snuff for our marchioness. After all, she stepped up from being a mere miss to become the wife of the Marquess of Rockley\u2014God rest his soul\u2014and it won\u2019t do to have her sliding back into a dank, drafty castle in the Highlands. Why, there\u2019re probably vampires flapping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d called the gentleman guide\u2019s voice, beckoning them toward him. \u201cAre we all together again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed we are, sir. Please lead us on,\u201d Melly replied, conveniently ignoring the fact that they hadn\u2019t yet been introduced to their savior.</p> <p>Just as they rejoined their guide, a pretty blond woman came bursting on the scene from a different branch of the hallway. The man turned in surprise, and the young woman grasped his arm, pulling him away from the older ladies. \u201cAt last! I have been searching the whole villa for you!\u201d And then her voice dropped very low, and it sounded as though she said something about a...senator?</p><p>\u201cI shall not abide it if that chit insists on accompanying us,\u201d Winnie fumed, glaring at the pair, who\u2019d moved far enough away that she couldn\u2019t hear what they said. For, despite her complaint about failing eyesight, her ears worked perfectly well. What was so important about a Roman senator that the chit had to interrupt their treasure hunt?</p><p>And then from behind them came the sound of heavy, rushing feet. The three ladies turned to see Mr. Zavier hurrying down the hall toward them. With him was another gentleman\u2014unknown to Winnie and Melly, but perfectly familiar to Nilly as the handsome blond who\u2019d interrupted her t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the dark-haired, pale-skinned man.</p><p>\u201cThere ye ladies are,\u201d Mr. Zavier exclaimed, his brogue thick with emotion. His cheeks were flushed enough that they showed their ruddiness even in the low light, and he was holding something in his hand\u2014something long and thin and pointed\u2014but before anyone save Nilly could take notice, he shoved it in his pocket. \u201cWe must take our leave now,\u201d he said, looking about.</p><p>The blond man, who was also approaching, peered beyond them into the darkness. But when the ladies turned to follow his gaze, they saw that their gentleman guide and the young blond woman had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve almost found the treasure,\u201d the duchess complained as Mr. Zavier offered her his arm. \u201cWe cannot leave now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the treasure has already been located, and that it is well past time to leave. All of the other guests have gone,\u201d said the handsome blond man in his comforting voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Victoria?\u201d Lady Melly asked Mr. Zavier, taking his other arm, yet still looking behind her to find out what on earth had happened to that handsome man who\u2019d been leading them about. \u201cHow vexing that he should have disappeared so suddenly,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe was quite charming, and I didn\u2019t even learn his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria, thinking ye had done so, has already returned home after joining me for a short time in the parlor. After ye disappeared\u201d\u2014Mr. Zavier fixed a dark look at Winnie, and she returned his glance with all the haughtiness she could muster\u2014\u201cshe had come with her slipper fixed and was quite disappointed that ye\u2019d gone on without her. Come, ladies, \u2019tis best that we be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d The blond gentleman offered his arm to Nilly, and when she accepted it, began to hurry her along the hall.</p><p>If the two gentlemen happened to look back over their shoulders, the older ladies didn\u2019t appear to notice; they were much too intent on keeping their footing alongside the agile men and their long, rapid strides.</p><p>\u201cBut this is not the way we came in,\u201d Melly exclaimed when they came to a door\u2014a small, unobtrusive one that was most certainly not the grand entrance they\u2019d been welcomed into.</p><p>The night air was cool, and the half-moon glowed down on them as they stepped out of the villa onto...grass.</p><p>\u201cMy slippers,\u201d shrieked Nilly, lifting her feet one at a time in a mad, hopping manner. \u201cThey\u2019ll be ruined!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome, come,\u201d Mr. Zavier said, ushering them along the dark building toward the front of the villa where their carriage was waiting.</p><p>As the ladies climbed in, their creaking joints reminding them they\u2019d had hardly a spot of rest in the last week, with Carnivale and all of the other excitement, they noticed that theirs was the only carriage in sight. Mr. Zavier handed each of them in and then followed with an energetic leap, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>Rapping harshly on the roof, he settled back into his seat, surrounded by gowns and panting ladies. Not, perhaps, his preferred environment to be surrounded by such feminity...but it was his duty, nonetheless.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the carriage pulled away from the street in front of the villa that the ladies realized the blond gentleman had disappeared.</p><p>In fact, none of them could recall seeing him once they came outside of the villa.</p><p>\u201cWell, I never,\u201d snapped Winnie, looking back out the carriage window. \u201cThat man! He tricked us into leaving so he could have the treasure.\u201d</p><p>And she settled into her seat, plump elbows crossed over her just-as-plump bosom, and brooded all the way back to the Gardella villa.</p><p>Ten</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Finds Herself in a Compromising Position</p><p>Victoria slowly came to consciousness, aware that her entire body ached.</p><p>The last thing she remembered was seeing Max collapse under a cluster of vampires; then something struck her from behind and her world went dark.Now...she had no idea how long she\u2019d been lying here...wherever she was. She couldn\u2019t see anything; it was pitch-black. Even after she blinked her eyes numerous times to adjust them to the night, she could make out little but vague shadows.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. Her wrists were tied tightly behind her, and when she uncurled her fists the pads of her fingers pressed into something that felt like dirty stone or brick behind her. She felt the same underneath, suggesting she was in a chamber belowground. A dungeon, perhaps.</p><p>That in itself didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>Then there was the fact that the back of her neck was cold. Freezing, in fact; the prickles there felt as if a cold wind were blasting over her skin. Her hair sagged, falling over her shoulders, but provided no protection from that barometer of the undead. Her gown was disheveled, and she was quite certain that at least several rosettes and perhaps some of the flounces had been torn from its hem.</p><p>But that was the least of her concerns, for...She paused, forcing her racing thoughts to slow so she could concentrate. She closed her eyes, even though she couldn\u2019t see anything, and listened.</p><p>No. No, she hadn\u2019t imagined it.</p><p>Apprehension crept up her spine, spreading over the back of her shoulders. The smell was faint, but it was there: that musty, rotting, malevolent death-smell of a demon.</p><p>Demons and vampires? Here together?</p><p>They were mortal enemies\u2014at least, they would be if either of them were mortal. The battle for Lucifer\u2019s favor had raged between the vampires and demons since he\u2019d turned Judas into the first vampire.</p><p>Demons were, of course, fallen angels\u2014of which Lucifer was the greatest of all. They had been purveyors of evil and death since time dawned. But after Judas hanged himself, certain that he would never be forgiven for betraying Jesus, Lucifer had wooed him and his soul to the side of Hell and used him to create a new race that was half demon and half human.</p><p>Being the devil\u2019s own creation, the vampires felt they should take precedence over the demons; but the demons had existed for so much longer, they believed their race was the more powerful and should inherit the reign of Hell.</p><p>Either way, Victoria knew, it was very rare for the two races to be together, or to cooperate in any way.</p><p>Then she remembered her mother, and her apprehension exploded into full-force terror. Lady Melly and her two friends could still be in the villa, under the control of the vampires and the demons. Zavier could not have fought off all of the undead that had attacked her and Max. Her only hope was that he\u2019d sensed the presence of the vampires in time to bring the ladies\u2014and the other guests\u2014to safety.</p><p>Or...a new thought alleviated her anxiety a bit. If Regalado was after the key, perhaps he meant to use her mother only as a hostage or bait. In which case she wouldn\u2019t be harmed.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d she said softly. She thought she\u2019d heard a faint shuffling sound, perhaps even a groan. It was either Max or some other creature\u2014either of which was preferable to other options, such as the undead...or those of the eight-legged persuasion.</p><p>There was silence, and Victoria closed her eyes again and listened this time for something closer to her. She was sure she heard something, sensed some other presence.</p><p>One thing was certain: If Max was indeed here, he must be badly hurt if he made no sound. This greater worry galvanized her into action.</p><p>Her legs weren\u2019t tied, so she used her splayed hands on the floor behind to help shift herself from the ground and move onto her knees. Her head began to pound angrily above her brows as she came upright, and there was something wrong with her right leg...it was stiff and it ached. Horrendously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria tried to follow the wall so she could keep her bearings in the chamber and investigate every part of the room.</p><p>Suddenly she heard voices, and the cold prickles at the back of her neck increased. Before she could think of anything to do that might be proactive, a door opened across the room from her. Immediately Victoria sagged against the wall, half closing her eyes, pretending to be unconscious. Even a moment\u2019s reprieve could help her make a decision or gather more information that would help her escape.</p><p>With the opening of the door a bit of light spilled into the room. Shadows blocked the entrance, and the rotting death-smell of the demon became a bit stronger\u2014but not enough to alarm her. Whoever or wherever it was, it was not standing in the doorway.</p> <p>Through her slitted eyes, Victoria saw that the chamber was not much larger than a parlor, and it was fairly empty. There was a large, lumpy shadow halfway across the room that spiked her concern for Max; if she\u2019d kept going on her path around the perimeter, she would have brushed against it at one point. There were no furnishings, one door, and nothing else.</p><p>All of this she had taken in during the instant after the door opened. Now Victoria waited, her muscles tense, forcing her breathing to steady.</p><p>And suddenly something large and unwieldy came tumbling into the room. It landed on the floor in the middle of the chamber in an ignominious heap, barely illuminated by a small lantern hanging beyond the door.</p><p>\u201cDo not fear,\u201d said a voice from the entrance. It sounded familiar, but Victoria couldn\u2019t see enough to recognize the speaker. \u201cYou won\u2019t be here long. Akvan will soon be ready for you.\u201d</p><p>Akvan? Good grief...was that the demon she smelled?</p> <p>Before Victoria could react, the door closed. She heard the heavy grating of a bolt being drawn.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d grumbled the heap on the floor. \u201cWasn\u2019t beating me enough? Why did they have to pitch me in like a horseshoe?\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth fell open; fortunately, it was too dark for him to see what must be incredulous shock on her face. \u201cSebastian? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh. Or, rather, what\u2019s bloody left of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so surprised to see\u2014er, hear\u2014me? I was under the impression that you were looking for me. Or, be still my heart...was that nothing but a false rumor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had hoped to see you in a more...conventional situation. But, yes, I was looking for you. I have to ask you something.\u201d She was scooting on her rump as quickly as she could toward where she remembered seeing him fall. The room was, of course, dark now, but that short while of illumination had helped to orient her. At least she knew the location of the door, and how large the chamber was. And if that big lump was indeed Max, she could do more to help him if her hands were untied. \u201cDid he say that Akvan was ready for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2014Ow!\u201d he snapped when her shoe rapped sharply against something...soft. \u201cI appreciate your delight in seeing me, Victoria, but can you take a bit more care? That was my...er\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she replied, feeling her face heat in the dark. \u201cIf you would untie me? Then perhaps we can figure some way out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite the fact that I find the thought of you tied up and restrained remarkably titillating, I would be happy to release you...if only I could. You see, I am just as bound as you are. Perhaps more so, as apparently my feet are tied, while yours are not. Which was why I found it remarkably insulting that they had to throw me in here.\u201d</p><p>Blast it. She\u2019d realized when scooting across the floor that the knife that had been strapped to her thigh was no longer there...and she hoped, profusely, that it had been Sara Regalado who had removed it instead of George Starcasset. Or anyone else. \u201cSit up then, and we can move back-to-back and work on each other\u2019s knots,\u201d she said.</p><p>With much groaning and huffing of breath, Sebastian managed to hike himself up into a sitting position, leaning heavily against Victoria, who\u2019d planted her feet on the ground, knees bent, in order to stabilize herself for him. He was warm and solid against her, smelling familiarly of spicy cloves and a tinge of sweat, along with a faint rusty scent. Their shoulders brushed, the fabric of what must be his shirt against the bareness of her upper back. It was damp.</p><p>\u201cI thought Akvan was dead,\u201d she said after he seemed to be settled against her. She groped around behind, feeling his arms as he did the same, and at last their fingers touched. His were slick, but he managed to curl them around to gently stroke the center of her palm in a tantalizing caress. Slip, swirl, stroke.</p><p>Surprised at the innate eroticism of this unexpected, simple touch, Victoria swallowed as the light tickle traveled from her palm up along her wrist and arm and made her feel...warm and sensitive, even here in this dark, dank dungeon.</p> <p>Then his fingers\u2014and again she realized that they felt wet\u2014began to move with purpose, feeling around for the knots in the rope. She sniffed and smelled blood. \u201cIs that blood all over your hands? And your shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Sebastian said lightly, although she noticed a bit more strain than usual in his charming voice, \u201cthe vampires became a bit overzealous in their attempts to keep me from finding y\u2014where they were hidden, and I became rather...bloody in the process. I will endeavor to keep from staining your gown, but our positions might make that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t bite you,\u201d Victoria said. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t dare. I am, after all, the grandson of Beauregard, as you well know. A fact that didn\u2019t keep me from being relegated to these unwelcome accommodations, but at least it kept me from getting my throat torn out. At least for now. And...Akvan was dead, or at least living in Hell,\u201d he said, at last addressing her question, \u201cuntil Pesaro destroyed his obelisk. When it was shattered last autumn, Akvan was recalled back here to earth\u2014to Rome, to be more precise, in a weakened form, as I understand it. He\u2019s spent the last four months building up his strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is here? And so how did you get here? Do stop it and let me try your knots, Sebastian,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou\u2019ve done little but pinch me in the...well, somewhere you shouldn\u2019t be pinching me, and you\u2019re obviously hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the hero fails to save the damsel in distress.\u201d Sebastian sighed dramatically, but his fingers fell away and she thought she sensed an air of relief in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t the first time, and I\u2019m certain it shan\u2019t be the last,\u201d Victoria replied, groping around to try to locate the knots at his wrists. His skin was warm, but sticky, and even with the tips of her fingers she could feel the brush of hair that grew under his cuffs.</p><p>\u201cBut of course...since you are the Venator,\u201d Sebastian replied in a cool voice. \u201cI am here because my grandfather set me to watch the Door of Alchemy over the last days. Apparently he is certain someone is about to open it\u2014and it appears that Akvan and his fiends are the ones. I saw Pesaro skulking around it earlier this evening, and when I learned that there were several...shall we say, civilians invited within the villa, I thought perhaps I should investigate. I didn\u2019t expect to find you here as well.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had found the bulk of rope and begun to try to pry it loose, but the knots were tight and she was in an awkward position. \u201cYou decided to investigate, or was your real intent to find some way of bedeviling Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I bedevil him?\u201d Sebastian asked, his voice properly shocked. \u201cIn fact, he owes me his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? Somehow I cannot imagine that.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get a good fix on the knots; her fingers were chilled from the dampness, and her wrists sore from bending nearly double and trying to manipulate the rope, which was thick and difficult to grasp.</p><p>And then, with a twinge of annoyance with herself for forgetting, she remembered the special corset Miro had made for her, the corset he\u2019d executed at Verbena\u2019s suggestion. Her maid and Oliver had tried to create something similar at first themselves. But without the skills of the weapons master, it had been a disaster. Knives and stakes had protruded from every angle, and when she tried it on a blade had slipped from its place and sliced through the delicate shift to her skin. However, Miro had taken the idea and created the corset, and Victoria was wearing it right now.</p><p>But the problem was...she would need help accessing it.</p><p>\u201cMax wasn\u2019t terribly pleased,\u201d Sebastian was saying. \u201cIn fact, I do believe he offered to damn me for staking the vampire that was about to maul him\u2014it was last autumn, that night the obelisk was destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Victoria couldn\u2019t help a chuckle\u2014it was a nervous one, partly because of what she was going to have to ask him to do. \u201cYou don\u2019t stake vampires, Sebastian. Even if you could, you wouldn\u2019t. Now I know you\u2019re lying.\u201d It was true\u2014Sebastian loved his grandfather Beauregard, and as a result of his relationship with him and the knowledge that every single vampire had once been a mortal being, with family and loved ones, Sebastian refused to stake the undead, because of the eternal damnation that awaited them after their demise.</p><p>I can\u2019t send someone\u2019s father or sister to Hell for eternity, he\u2019d once told her. I won\u2019t be responsible for that.</p><p>\u201cShall we stop this nonsense?\u201d she said sharply. \u201cI want to get out of these ropes, and I think that might be Max over there on the floor\u2014but he hasn\u2019t moved or made a sound since I woke up. And I\u2019m sure if he were conscious, he would have had some scathing comment for you and your melodramatics by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. Then my sacrifice last autumn will have been in vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a knife,\u201d she said, ignoring his comment. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to help me get to it.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve taken all of your weapons, Victoria, just as they did mine. I haven\u2019t anything but my boots and clothes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, if the pinching of my skin is any indication, I\u2019m still wearing my corset,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the knife is.\u201d</p><p>She felt him go absolutely still. And then, after a moment of stunned silence, she heard the soft puff of a laugh. \u201cMy God, Victoria, I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. Are you saying you want me to help you out of your corset? Here and now?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help her own little smile, there in the dark, at the sound of pure lust mixed with shock in his voice. Even though it was not the time nor the place, the thought\u2014the memory of his hands on her skin and breasts and hips\u2014made that little shiver that had traveled up her arm just a moment ago turn into a longer, deeper one that spiraled down, tangling sharply in her belly. Her mouth dried and she swallowed back the absurdity of thinking of such things when they were in danger.</p> <p>As was her mother.</p><p>The sudden reminder of Lady Melly\u2019s possible fate put sharpness back into Victoria\u2019s voice. \u201cNo, not to take it off. Just...one of the front strips of boning, on the...er...the left side has been replaced with a slender stiletto blade. I\u2019ll need you to help me remove it, and then put it to use. Do you think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall certainly do my best,\u201d he said gallantly. \u201cEr...shall I start from the top...or the bottom?\u201d</p><p>There was much too much relish in those words, and Victoria had to resist the urge to snap back at him, especially since the answer was, \u201cFrom the bottom.\u201d Annoying how dry her mouth had become and how unsteady her voice was.</p><p>But Sebastian said nothing, nothing at all, to her surprise. He positioned himself so that he was in front of her, but with his back facing her. Thus, he was brushing up against the side of her left thigh. As he began to move his bound hands clumsily around, trying to find the hem of the skirt to slip between it and the edge of her shift, Victoria said a brief prayer of thanks that it wasn\u2019t Max who\u2019d been required to help her. The idea of his strong, long-fingered hands sliding up under her gown made her stomach flutter unpleasantly.</p> <p>She turned her thoughts smartly away from that and found herself distracted by the gentle stroking of Sebastian\u2019s fingers as he brushed his knuckles over the top of her stockinged leg, now separated from his touch by only the very thin fabric of her shift. The undergarment was of such fine cotton that it might not have been there at all. Her breathing was becoming a bit rough, and she tried to slow it, to steady and level it. She didn\u2019t want to think about the tingling that erupted between her legs as her sensitive skin was exposed from under the much heavier silk of her gown, and then as it was caressed by his finger.</p><p>\u201cI hope that you shall put me out of my misery and tell me that the skinny stick of a woman wasn\u2019t your mother,\u201d Sebastian said, his fingers sliding beyond the crease where her left leg joined her hip.</p><p>\u201cSkinny woman? What are you talking about?\u201d Her voice was a bit breathy, but maybe he wouldn\u2019t notice. He certainly seemed to be concentrating on what he was doing, if his own steady breathing was any indication.</p><p>\u201cThere were three of them together\u2014the dry, brittle one, the loud, large, pillowy one, and the bossy, elegant one. I was rather hoping,\u201d he said, his fingers at last beginning to tug at the bottom edge of her corset, searching by feel for the blade, \u201cthat none of them was your mother...but since they were talking about you as if they knew you well, I realized I was bound to be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw them? If you caused them to be captured too, Sebastian, I shall never forgive you!\u201d She focused on irritation rather than on the movements of his fingers as they felt around her stays. \u201cIt should be there somewhere. You\u2019ll feel the short handle protruding from the bottom of the corset...just...yes, there! I do wish you would hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, faithless woman,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was I, in fact, who saved the dry stick of a woman from being some undead\u2019s evening feed. And it was I who directed the man who was supposed to be protecting them\u2014Zavier, was that his name?\u2014to their location so that he could whisk them to safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo they are safe?\u201d Victoria breathed a long sigh of relief that had nothing to do with the gentle tickling of his knuckles as he worked on pulling the knife from its special slot in the corset. \u201cOh, how silly of me to forget, Sebastian, there is a little frog enclosure that keeps the blade from sliding out and wreaking its havoc on my gown. You must loosen it and the braid holding it in place will fall away and you will be able to\u2014Oh! Stop that!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in his Sebastian way, low and laced with warmth. \u201cBut you liked it before, ma ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was when I trusted you,\u201d she replied smartly, feeling him pulling on the corset again instead of letting his fingers stray where they should not have gone. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever trusted you, but that was before you drugged and kidnapped me. And why did you say you hoped Lady Petronilla\u2014the slender one\u2014was not my mother?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian gave a groan of relief as the stiletto at last came free of its place in her stays, and he pulled it away.</p><p>\u201cTake care you don\u2019t cut me with it,\u201d Victoria ordered, glad that the moment was over as she rustled her skirts back into place by shifting her legs. \u201cI\u2019ll move so you can slice my ropes\u2014no, no, on second thought, I think it would be best if I did the cutting. If you would put the blade down, I\u2019ll move so I can pick it up and saw your ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a splendid idea. At least the blood you\u2019ll draw will mingle with what\u2019s already there. And, to answer your question,\u201d he said as she maneuvered herself slowly around so that they were back-to-back again, she sitting on her haunches so that her hands were that much higher, \u201cI was particularly hoping the dried-up stick wasn\u2019t your flesh and blood because it is a well-known adage\u2014at least to the male population\u2014that a woman, when aging, takes after the looks of her mother.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had levered up the knife and was sawing delicately, and awkwardly, against the ropes. \u201cAnd whatever is wrong with the way Lady Petronilla looks?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the little grunt from her voice as she felt soreness and pain radiating up her wrists from the tense, awkward motions. Her injured left leg screamed under the weight of her body as she knelt there, working as fast yet as carefully as she could.</p><p>\u201cShe is as flat as a board. Flatter, even.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlat as a\u2014Oh.\u201d Victoria bit her lip and rolled her eyes in the dark.</p><p>\u201cAh, at last! I can feel my fingers again,\u201d Sebastian said, and he wiggled said fingers against hers.</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d she warned, \u201celse you\u2019ll get them cut and then you won\u2019t feel them at all. This blade is wickedly sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is indeed, for I\u2019m free already.\u201d</p><p>She felt a jolt as he pulled his wrists apart, brushing against her as the ropes fell away. He gave a relieved exhale as he took the blade from her aching fingers. Victoria heard the unmistakable sound of friction, as if he were rubbing his wrists and arms to get the blood flowing again. Which was something she longed to do herself, as soon as she was untied.</p><p>\u201cNow what are you doing?\u201d she asked, impatient to be free.</p><p>\u201cCutting apart my ankles. You do realize,\u201d he said with a sudden, low chuckle, \u201cthat I am free and you are still bound, my lovely Venator. And that I have the rare advantage over you?\u201d</p><p>A little squirm started in her middle, making her feel ill. Or...perhaps it was something altogether different from nausea. \u201cSebastian,\u201d she said in warning, then remembered. \u201cI have to ask you something about my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...and that you are at my mercy?\u201d His voice had taken on a low purr, and suddenly he was next to her, moving with such freedom that she knew his legs were also unbound.</p><p>\u201cSebastian, when you took her vis bulla\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hands found her face easily\u2014how, in the dark, she didn\u2019t know\u2014but when his elegant yet sticky fingers curled under her chin and around the back of her neck, the only thing she could do was try to pull back as she lost her train of thought.</p><p>She had no leverage, nothing but her aching wrists and chilled fingers to hold her steady, propped behind her. When Sebastian moved closer, bringing that familiar scent of clove that always clung to him and setting her heart to pounding, Victoria had nowhere to go except down to the floor...and that was one place she didn\u2019t want to go.</p><p>He missed her mouth that first time, his lips brushing just above his fingers, in the middle of her cheek. But he soon rectified the error and drew her forward, up on her knees and toward him, chest to bosom, as he covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>In Which Michalas\u2019s Wish Is Granted</p><p>As so often occurred when kissing Sebastian, Victoria found herself more helpless than not, with her hands still tied and her balance precarious. Yet she closed her eyes there in the dark and opened her mouth when he opened his, accepting his slick tongue and offering her own. The aches in her hand and leg eased, fading away in the wake of the deep kiss that reminded her how much she had missed this\u2014intimate touching, passionate kissing, Sebastian himself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see him, just barely the dark shape of a shadow close to her, blocking her vision. But she pictured his handsome face and the sensual curling of his tawny, lion\u2019s-mane hair, surely tousled from battle with the vampires. His eyes were a darker shade of the same hue, a chestnut, and his skin\u2014so unlike his grandfather\u2019s pale visage\u2014was golden. He looked like a bronze angel, she\u2019d often thought. An ironic description.His lips were soft and smooth, fitting to hers and then drawing closed to lick and then nibble at the corner of her mouth, his teeth gnawing gently at her bottom lip, right where his grandfather had bitten her the night before. Victoria started when she realized this, when she felt his teeth on the tender part of her lip, and tried to turn away. But he was cradling her face in his hands and only kissed her more deeply than ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought...you preferred...carriages,\u201d came a raspy, annoyed voice from across the room, \u201cVioget.\u201d</p><p>Victoria started and twisted her face violently from Sebastian, who seemed to have no inclination to release her. \u201cMax? Oh, thank God, you\u2019re alive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour...concern...overwhelms me.\u201d There was a soft shuffling sound, a sharp intake of breath. \u201cPerhaps...you could be...so kind as to...bring that knife...here. When\u201d\u2014his voice trailed off, then picked up more strongly\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ve finished...of course. I cannot...imagine...it should take...very long...at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarriages, parlors, dungeons,\u201d Sebastian said carelessly, \u201cwherever the opportunity presents itself. Which it does rather more often than I would expect you\u2019d imagine\u2014or be familiar with.\u201d</p><p>But as he spoke Sebastian had released her, mainly, Victoria thought, because she\u2019d mutinously kept her face away from his seeking fingers and mouth, twisting back when he tried to renew the kiss. Now he moved behind her, his hands on her hips as he found his position.</p><p>Too late, she realized she was at an even greater disadvantage with him kneeling behind her, knife in hands. \u201cDon\u2019t move now, Victoria,\u201d he said, his voice curling in her ear like soft smoke, his breath warm on her skin. \u201cThis knife is very sharp, and I cannot see what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019d hate to slice into your beautiful flesh...the fresh blood would draw the hungry vampires here in a moment.\u201d</p><p>One of his hands moved aside the great mass of hair that had fallen down from her coiffure, when her stake had been removed, and now his lips pressed gently to the sensitive skin there on the top of her shoulder, at the juncture of her neck. Featherlight at first, then heavier, then with a sleek brush of tongue, he kissed her flesh while he sawed away, one-handed, at her ropes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the smallest of gasps when he mauled and sucked at the tendon there, where he knew she was most sensitive. And Max couldn\u2019t help but hear her reaction, the faint sound of breaking suction, the quiet lapping of Sebastian\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>He did it purposely\u2014whether it was to titillate and arouse her or to annoy Max, she wasn\u2019t certain, but the only thing she could try to do was ignore the swipe of his lips, the warm slide over the top of her shoulder, up along her neck. But when one of his hands\u2014the one not holding the knife, fortunately, slid around to cover one of her breasts, Victoria couldn\u2019t hold back a sudden intake of breath.</p><p>Sebastian laughed softly against her skin, leaving a hot, moist puff there at the side of her throat, and Victoria pulled so hard to the side that she lost her balance and tumbled to the floor. But as she fell her hands moved automatically to catch herself, pulling at the ropes. She was strong enough\u2014and they were already frayed enough from the knife\u2014that they tore free, and even though she landed half on her cheek on the cold, gritty floor, her hands were loose.</p><p>She rolled away from Sebastian before he could grab her again, though she felt his swipe through the air. \u201cYour games are at an end, Sebastian. May I have the knife back?\u201d</p><p>Half expecting him to taunt her with it, to demand a kiss or some other payment, Victoria was surprised when she heard it drop to the floor in front of her.</p><p>\u201cIf we only had something for illumination,\u201d she said, feeling on the floor until her fingers brushed the stiletto. Gingerly she followed the blade until she found the handle and picked up the knife. It was no longer than the length of her longest finger to the end of her palm, and about the same width as her little finger. The entire dagger was nearly as flat as the piece of boning it had replaced, but was deathly sharp.</p><p>Miro had made the weapon specially for her, casting it to certain specifications. The silver handle was very short, extending only one knuckle\u2019s length from the small, flat hand guard. This was so that the blade could slide into the slit in her corset, and the handle would protrude just a small distance past the bottom end of her stays, keeping the metal from poking into her leg when she walked or bent. The other unique thing about the knife was that for perhaps another inch past the hand guard, the blade itself was covered with the same silver as the handle, so that Victoria could wrap her fingers around the hand guard and allow the blade to protrude between them without cutting herself. Since the handle was so short, it was the only way she could comfortably hold the dagger.</p> <p>It certainly had worked, cutting easily through the ropes.</p><p>\u201cI have something for light,\u201d Max\u2019s voice rumbled, a bit stronger now. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need...some help.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt Sebastian moving, but he seemed to be farther away. \u201cSebastian? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m examining the door to determine whether there might be a way to open it, of course.\u201d</p><p>Victoria wanted to protest that she would need his help with Max, but she did not. Instead, she felt around on the floor and finally brushed against something solid and warm. And very, very wet. Stickily wet.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Max...\u201d She started in shock, moving her hands frantically around, trying to determine what part of him had been injured, and accidentally poked him in the face.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Victoria...are you trying to blind me?\u201d</p><p>She slowed her jerky movements, brushing over his warm, moist cheek and down along his neck, staying far away from his sharp mouth. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be so profane. I cannot see a thing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he grumbled on a long breath. \u201cI have a light. After you cut these blasted ropes.\u201d His breathing was heavy, and she could feel it now, feel the exertion in his body as he struggled to keep it steady.</p><p>She quickly sliced through the ropes that held his wrists behind him, and heard his moan of relief when his arms fell back into place. With trepidation she asked, \u201cWhere is the light?\u201d The last thing she wanted was to be groping around Max\u2019s long, powerful body. Especially when he was injured.</p><p>\u201cMy left boot.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Victoria gingerly skimmed her hands lightly along the side of him, taking care not to investigate anything mortifying, and noting with increasing anxiety that there were several places that were soaking wet. The stench of blood was strong, and she could nearly taste the iron in her mouth. \u201cAre you bitten?\u201d she asked, reaching the bottom of his calf and finding the smooth, supple leather of his boot. \u201cAgain?\u201d she added, remembering Sara tearing away Max\u2019s collar.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m shot,\u201d he replied, as if she should somehow have known. \u201cAnd it hurts like the damned blazes, so if you could please...hurry.\u201d</p><p>Like a valet, she knelt at his feet and tugged at the boot.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snapped. \u201cUnder. In the heel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeel?\u201d she muttered, thinking that she was dealing with more heels than the ones on his boots.</p><p>\u201cIt slides off. Inside are small wooden sticks. Don\u2019t...drop them! And a piece of sanded paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the work of the famous Miro, I\u2019m certain,\u201d came Sebastian\u2019s patently bored voice from across the room.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about Miro?\u201d asked Victoria in surprise, prying at the heel of Max\u2019s boot as quickly as she could. It came off more easily than she\u2019d expected, and then, feeling around, she could tell that it was nothing more than a little box with a lid.</p><p>\u201cI know much about everything.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s breath caught audibly, as if he\u2019d heard something humorous\u2014or a new wave of pain had slammed into him\u2014but he replied, \u201cAnd do little with it, is that not...right, Vioget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the little sticks and the paper. Now what shall I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind something...to burn. One of those ridiculous flowers on your gown. Put them to use.\u201d</p><p>Victoria bit her lip instead of replying. The man was in great pain, Venator or no, so she could give him a bit of an excuse for his rudeness. Carefully she cut off one of the satin roses from above the hem of her gown and realized Max was right\u2014it would make a good candle. How clever, and she was abashed that he had thought of it before she did.</p><p>Made from tightly twisted and sewn satin ribband, the flower was about the size of the center of her palm. It wouldn\u2019t burn forever, but she had many flowers, and surely each one would last for several minutes. \u201cNow what shall I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them...here. Give me one of the sticks. And the paper.\u201d</p><p>She moved back up toward Max\u2019s head and their hands found each other easily. His fingers were frighteningly cold, and they shook slightly as he took the slender wooden stick from her, and then the paper.</p><p>Victoria heard a faint snick, and suddenly a little burst of light illuminated Max\u2019s face. It looked like a hollow-eyed, grimy mask, his dark hair plastered to his forehead and temples, his full, angular lips tight and flat.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody flower?\u201d</p><p>Victoria pointed to the floor and watched as he shifted to the side and held the little flame to the red flower. She could see the fire dancing nearer his fingers, watching how he struggled to keep his hand steady as he tried to light it. With her own sigh of exasperation, she picked up the flower and held it to the flame.</p><p>One satin petal lit, and she put it on the floor next to them as the flower kindled to life. Lifting her gaze, she found herself face-to-face, very close to Max, and their eyes met over the tiny flame on the stick before he huffed it out.</p><p>There\u2019d been pain there. She\u2019d seen it in the unguardedness of his expression for a moment, the deep, bone-crunching pain swimming in his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you shot?\u201d she asked in a kinder voice than she\u2019d used recently.</p><p>\u201cMy shoulder. My right leg, though I think it isn\u2019t more than a graze.\u201d</p><p>A normal man would still be unconscious\u2014between the chill of the dungeon and the loss of blood, not to mention the battering he\u2019d taken under the hands of the vampires.</p><p>Before she could move he was shrugging painfully out of his heavy coat, which smelled like bloody, wet wool. Victoria helped pull it away from his left shoulder and saw the huge bloom of darkness glistening on his white shirt. It was, she realized suddenly, just above where the tiny vis bulla hung from his areola. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her stomach squirmed, remembering how he\u2019d forced her hand to touch it when she needed power and strength, and how warm and firm his skin had been under her reluctant fingers.</p><p>She reached to help him, but he batted her hand away.</p><p>\u201cTear the coat and I\u2019ll use it to bandage this. Then we have to find a way out of here, or it won\u2019t matter,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYour coat? Don\u2019t be ridiculous; the wool will be too prickly.\u201d She tore at her chemise and wadded up a large piece of the fine cotton, handing it to him when he made no move to allow her to bandage him herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found, Vioget?\u201d asked Max.</p><p>\u201cLittle to assist us. The door is bolted solidly from the other side, and the hinges are outside as well. The door is made of wood, banded with iron, so unless you happen to be carrying some much larger accoutrements in your unmentionables, my dear Victoria, we shan\u2019t be leaving this chamber until they open the door. And we certainly don\u2019t want to wait for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Max agreed.</p><p>\u201cSara Regalado and her father\u2014and likely all of the Tutela\u2014have allied themselves with Akvan, then,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cAnd they tricked people into coming here to feed the vampires, I presume.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all of the Tutela,\u201d Sebastian corrected. \u201cA great number of them are still loyal to my grandfather.\u201d There was a bit of stiffness in his voice.</p><p>After Akvan\u2019s Obelisk had been destroyed\u2014and with it Nedas, who\u2019d been the most powerful of the vampires in Italy\u2014there had been a great power struggle between Beauregard and Sara\u2019s father, Conte Regalado. As a newly turned vampire, the conte wasn\u2019t nearly as powerful as Beauregard ...but by allying himself with Akvan the demon, perhaps he thought he could overcome Beauregard.</p><p>Not a bad strategy.</p><p>And now she understood what Beauregard had meant when he spoke of Regalado\u2019s new alliance.</p><p>\u201cAnd not only for the vampires,\u201d Max said. \u201cAkvan will feed...from the mortals trapped here.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at him and read the expression on his face. \u201cWhat does he do to them? Drink their blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuman heads,\u201d Sebastian said flatly. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong, both of you.\u201d Grim satisfaction laced his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the mortals they wished to draw here. I cannot believe you don\u2019t see it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. It was Victoria all along.\u201d</p><p>The understanding blossomed inside her. They\u2019d been kidnapping mortals\u2014and before them, dogs and cats\u2014to feed Akvan for months. \u201cSara tried to capture me before...this treasure hunt was nothing more than a way to get me to come.\u201d She looked at Max. \u201cThey want the key, Aunt Eustacia\u2019s key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they simply want you. Which I can understand most readily,\u201d Sebastian added dryly. \u201cIt seems to be quite a common ailment as of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that go out,\u201d Max said suddenly, gesturing toward the dying rose blossom.</p><p>Startled into action, Victoria quickly sliced off another flower and used the burning one to light it. When she looked back at him, he was drinking from a small vial.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, he looked at her in annoyance, then corked the tiny bottle and slipped it into a pocket. \u201cIs that a window?\u201d</p> <p>Victoria looked up and saw, for the first time, right at the junction of ceiling and wall, the faintest rectangle of dark gray. Really, it was barely discernible from the other bricks on the wall, except that it was bigger, and just a bit lighter in color.</p><p>\u201cSebastian, let me stand on your shoulders,\u201d she said.</p><p>She could see the amusement on his face when he approached the small circle of light they shared. \u201cWhat a serendipitous opportunity to refresh my memory about what\u2019s under your skirt,\u201d he murmured, drawing her toward the wall.</p><p>Victoria resisted the urge to acknowledge the comment. Instead she used her fingernails and the crevices between the bricks to steady herself as she climbed up onto Sebastian\u2019s bent knee, then onto his shoulders, and then even higher as he rose to a full standing position.</p><p>The top of her head brushed the stone ceiling, and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a window. Too small for any of us to pass through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s fingers had moved from steadying her ankles to sliding up her calves over the silky stockings she wore, creating a delicate, delicious friction\u2014and causing the stockings to sag. She gave him a little jab with her toe and replied to Max, \u201cThe window is level with the ground. I can see very little. A wall. The sky\u2014it\u2019s nearing dawn, and the sky is turning gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see a small iron gate? Low in the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very dark, Max; I can\u2019t see much of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>The light below her in the small room moved closer, and Victoria reached down carefully to take the small rose from Max, who\u2019d stood, but was now leaning against the wall. He was holding his right hand over his shoulder wound, though his face looked a bit less tense. Whatever was in that vial had begun to work quickly.</p><p>When she rested the little candle on the narrow sill of the window, Victoria could see into the yard in front of the opening. \u201cYes, I see a small thing\u2014it looks like a grate. It\u2019s very small, though, Max...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I thought. You can come down now.\u201d</p><p>She carefully handed down the candle, and found Sebastian to be exceedingly helpful in assisting her to get down from the window, his hands groping about and assisting in areas that weren\u2019t off balance in the least.</p><p>When Victoria got back on the ground and extricated herself from Sebastian\u2019s questing fingers, she saw Max on the floor by the wall.</p><p>\u201cMax? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop blocking the light,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She crouched next to him, aware that Sebastian was standing behind, likely watching the areas he\u2019d recently had occasion to caress.</p><p>\u201cThat iron grate is just outside of the Magic Door,\u201d Max told her. \u201cI saw it earlier tonight.\u201d She could see that he was moving the candle around the floor near the wall. \u201cIt confirmed what Ylito and I had suspected\u2014that this wall is next to Palombara\u2019s laboratory.\u201d He looked up for a moment, his eyes faint with wry humor. \u201cI, unlike you, have an excellent sense of direction when inside a building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re doing,\u201d Sebastian said from his pose against the wall, \u201cI suggest you do it quickly, for I expect our hosts to be returning shortly. I\u2019d prefer not to be here when they return, if we can arrange it otherwise. I\u2019m certain my relationship to Beauregard will hold me in good stead only long enough for Akvan to ask me a few pointed questions about my grandfather before he makes use of my head and its contents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps,\u201d Max said between obviously clenched teeth, \u201cyou might bestir yourself to assist. I have reason to believe there must be a way from the laboratory to this chamber.\u201d He must have heard Victoria draw in her breath, for he added, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time asking. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong\u2014but there is no other way out of this room. But...\u201d And he paused, then continued, \u201cApparently I\u2019m not wrong, for here it is.\u201d</p><p>He pushed back onto his knees. Through the streaks of dirt and blood on his face, the hollowness in his cheeks, Victoria saw satisfaction. \u201cA door?\u201d she asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cA drop of gold. Melted gold. Going under the wall here...see this brick...here.\u201d</p><p>Victoria needed no further instruction or information. She began to work with Max, feeling around with her fingers to fit them into the groove under the brick.</p><p>But then, as a familiar, portending chill scuttled over the back of her neck, Victoria turned and met Max\u2019s gaze only inches away.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be coming for me,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr to find out what the grandson of Beauregard might know that would be helpful to Akvan,\u201d Max said, a hint of relish in his voice. \u201cOr for any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it look like we\u2019re still tied up,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cThen we can take them by surprise when they come in. Max, you can still be unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian, if you can manage to do so without getting distracted, tie my wrists again. Quickly. Wait.\u201d She turned and slid her hand up under her skirt to the side of her corset opposite where the knife had been hidden and quickly slid out the slender but deadly stake that was hidden in the same way the stiletto had been.</p><p>Slipping it into one of the small loops at the back of her gown (ones Verbena had insisted upon adding for just such an emergency), she allowed Sebastian to bind her wrists loosely enough that it would be no problem for her to slip free. Then, awkwardly, she did the same to him.</p><p>Max arranged himself on the floor where he\u2019d been before, and Victoria slumped against the wall near his feet. Then she stomped her foot on the last of the burning satin flower.</p><p>Only the faintest smell of smoke hung in the air now, and the room became silent.</p><p>The back of her neck was colder, and her heart thumped faster as she felt the undead coming closer.</p><p>\u201cMax? Do you have the knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And a stake hidden in my boot. Don\u2019t attack until we\u2019re out of the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeb\u2014\u201d</p><p>But a rattle at the door silenced her, and Victoria closed her mouth and waited.</p><p>When the door burst open, Victoria watched again through slitted eyes. There were only three of them. Three!</p><p>They were tall and had red eyes, and she could see their fangs gleaming, even through the tiny slit of her gaze.</p><p>Two of them stayed at the door. Max was right; they couldn\u2019t make a move to escape until they were safely out of the chamber, for fear they\u2019d get locked back in. The third vampire, a tall woman, stepped farther in, and Victoria saw the glint of a pistol in her hand as she strode toward them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened her eyes fully and looked up into the gaunt face of the female. Her eyelids were dark, her chin narrow and pointed. Long blond hair fell in ugly hanks over her shoulders, and it swayed as she slammed her boot into Max\u2019s side so hard he jolted closer to Victoria.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, nor make a sound; even his breathing remained silent.</p><p>Now the vampire moved toward Victoria, looking down, pointing the gun directly at her. \u201cAkvan is waiting for you,\u201d she hissed, sliding a tongue over her fangs.</p> <p>Dressed in the convenience of men\u2019s clothing, she wore a jacket and a shirt that had possibly once been white, or some color close to it. When she bent toward Victoria, a leather thong around her neck fell from the opening of her shirt, knocked out by the weight of the short, black object that hung from it. Victoria caught her breath\u2014the slender pendant was shiny, sharp, and glinted blue-black. She recognized it\u2014a splinter, like the shard from Akvan\u2019s Obelisk that she herself had locked away in the Consilium.</p><p>With effort Victoria drew her eyes away from the glistening black fragment. The vampire was so close, breathing so heavily, she could smell the blood on her breath and knew she\u2019d just fed.</p><p>Victoria drew in a deep breath and grieved for the mortals who\u2019d obviously been her meal. The mortals who hadn\u2019t had a Zavier or a Sebastian to help get them out of the villa.</p><p>\u201cTell your friends not to move,\u201d said the female. \u201cOr I\u2019ll shoot you. Now get up slowly.\u201d</p><p>As Victoria shifted to struggle to her feet, keeping the stake hidden, hands bound behind her\u2014albeit loosely\u2014she brushed against Max and felt his fingers fumble against hers. In that instant she slowed her movements, made them more awkward so that he could slip something slender and smooth into her hands.</p> <p>The vial he\u2019d been drinking from.</p><p>Victoria closed her fingers around the tiny bottle and pulled to her feet, and this time her awkwardness wasn\u2019t feigned. Her right leg was still aching, but she was able to walk on it. When she started toward the door, the female vampire followed close behind.</p><p>A quick glance behind told Victoria that the gun was still trained on her. There was no chance for Max\u2014or Sebastian, should he be willing to risk it\u2014to jump to her assistance without getting her shot.</p><p>She wondered, as she stepped out of the chamber and heard the door close and its lock clang behind the three vampires, whether she would return.</p><p>And if she did, whether Max and Sebastian would even be there.</p><p>Flanked by the two silent vampires, Victoria walked down the hall, the presence of the female with the gun\u2014and what could only be a piece of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk around her neck\u2014slightly behind her.</p> <p>They were taking her to Akvan, but she wouldn\u2019t go quietly. The female had foolishly allowed the pistol to sag away from Victoria\u2019s person as soon as the door closed. She seemed distracted and was walking faster, almost as if she were in a hurry to return.</p><p>Victoria had other ideas. She walked as slowly as possible, exaggerating her limp so as to give herself time to flip the cork from the small vial Max had given her. She\u2019d started fiddling with it as soon as she\u2019d risen to her feet, back in the chamber.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what the liquid inside was, but at the very least it would give her an element of surprise. Max wouldn\u2019t have pressed it into her hands unless it would be useful, and he certainly didn\u2019t expect her to drink from it.</p><p>When the tiny cork popped free, Victoria carefully twisted her wrists, trying to keep from alerting the vampires to her acrobatics. But the female was muttering indistinctly\u2014and with annoyance\u2014to the vampire on the left, and the other appeared to be intent only on watching the placement of his feet as they strode down the gray-stoned passage. The female was obviously the leader, and her companions merely empty-headed guards of exceedingly large proportion.</p><p>Fortunately for Victoria, stakes were equally effective on all sizes and shapes of vampires, and unfortunately for them, she had a more than adequate one up her sleeve. Figuratively speaking.</p><p>Now she lifted one arm slightly, so that the ropes that had appeared to be tight around her wrists when they were crossed were now loose enough for her to free her hands.</p><p>They\u2019d walked perhaps only a dozen paces and were still within sight of the chamber door they\u2019d left when Victoria sprang into action.</p><p>She held the vial in one hand and the newly released stake that she\u2019d slipped from its loop in the other. As the rope dropped away she flung the contents of the vial at the two vampires on her left. As they screamed she spun, stake in hand, to jam its slender point into the heart of the undead on her right. He poofed into dust before he realized what happened to him, and Victoria pivoted back just as quickly to face the other two.</p> <p>Whatever was in the vial had splashed fully on the vampire closest to her, but some must have gotten on the female with the gun as well, for both of them shrieked in surprise and pain.</p><p>The one with the wet face clawed desperately at his skin and eyes, stumbling away, but Victoria caught him by his shirt and shoved him at the female just as she raised her pistol.</p><p>The crack of the shot snapped much too loudly in the hall. The vampire under her hands jerked as the bullet went through him, and then pain streaked along Victoria\u2019s side. As she staggered back in surprise, she saw the female fall under the weight of her agonized companion.</p><p>Pushing herself away from the wall there in the narrow passage, Victoria gripped her stake tighter and yanked the screaming vampire away from the female, tossing him aside for the time being.</p><p>The pistol had done its job but was no longer a threat, even when the female flung it at Victoria\u2019s head. She easily ducked and, despite the burning along her hip and the tangling weight of her skirts, she dove back toward the female.</p><p>Stringy hair plastered to both of their faces as they grappled on the floor. Victoria felt the wetness of her blood seeping through her gown, and the slam as the vampire landed a blow on her wound.</p><p>Smothering her cry of pain, Victoria grabbed the vampire by the shoulders and smashed her head back into the wall behind her, sending the female\u2019s red eyes rolling frantically. Her attention caught again by the leather thong and the obsidian chip that hung there, Victoria reached for it, yanking on the leather, and the necklace snapped free.</p><p>The vampire gasped, coming back to awareness, but Victoria gave her no time to recuperate. She slammed the stake down into the filthy white shirt, feeling immense satisfaction as the wood pierced flesh and bone as easily as if she\u2019d shoved it into an egg: the slightest of hesitation whilst it broke through the outermost shell, then eased in slickly and easily. Poof!</p><p>The female\u2019s dust had barely begun to settle when Victoria turned toward the third vampire. She was just about to stake him when she noticed the clanking of keys at his waist. Reaching down she felt the throbbing pain at her hip more strongly and plucked the keys away before putting the stake through his heart.</p><p>It was an odd thing about staking a vampire: Not only did the creature\u2019s flesh and person disintegrate, but also all of his personal belongings\u2014clothing or anything else on his body. The only exception appeared to be items made of copper\u2014which was how the Venators had been able to acquire one of the five special rings Lilith had made for her closest Guardians.</p><p>Wayren had described it as a sort of imploding that happened to the undead; but even she didn\u2019t have a real explanation for it. Instead she suggested, in a rare moment of levity, that perhaps it was merely Providence\u2019s way of making the Venators\u2019 duty that much easier: no remains, bodies, or personal effects to dispose of or explain away.</p><p>Whatever the reason, Victoria was glad she\u2019d seen the keys and snatched them up before staking the vampire. As she stood, breathing heavily and now feeling pain on both sides of her body\u2014in her leg and her opposite hip\u2014she saw the female\u2019s necklace where she\u2019d dropped it moments earlier. Picking it up, she felt a sharp tingle as she stuffed it into one of the pockets Verbena had sewn inside the skirt of her gown.</p><p>Again she could feel pure malevolence permeate the splinter from the obelisk, and was relieved that she\u2019d found it after losing it in the battle. It would be much safer with her, and in the Consilium with the other, larger shard.</p><p>Now...she had a ring of keys that she presumed would open the chamber door if she could get back there before anyone came to see what was delaying the delivery of the Venator to the demon. Victoria paused a moment to listen but heard nothing. Apparently no alarm had been given, and no one had heard the brief, volatile battle here in the passageway.</p><p>The demon and his court must be farther away than she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>The third key worked to open the heavy lock on the chamber door, and Victoria called out softly as she entered. Light from the passageway behind her spilled into the room.</p><p>\u201cBack at last,\u201d Max said from his position against the wall, but his eyes were sharp. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate you couldn\u2019t manage it without getting yourself shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot? Victoria.\u201d Sebastian was already moving toward her, his loose ropes in a bundle on the floor behind him. He didn\u2019t pull her into an embrace, for which she was simultaneously grateful and annoyed, but he did brush his hand over the huge splotch of blood flowering like an oversize rose over her waist. She was going to have a devil of a time explaining that to her mother. That and the missing rosettes.</p><p>\u201cYou can play nursemaid later, Vioget. Perhaps there will even be a carriage handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the door open, so you can lead the way,\u201d Victoria told Max, ignoring his comments, watching as he moved carefully toward the entrance. Obviously his pain was back. \u201cSince you have the direction of a pigeon. And I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just before Max led the way into the passage, she saw him tip a small vial to his lips again and sip from it. \u201cI thought you gave me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d And Max stepped cautiously out of the room. She noticed he held the stiletto in one hand and a stake in the other.</p><p>Curious. Perhaps he\u2019d had two tiny bottles\u2014one of holy water, which he\u2019d given her, and this other one. She would find out later...and also find out about the bites on his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had a suspicion she knew from whom they\u2019d come, and the thought made her stomach shudder.</p><p>To her relief, Max did not take the hallway where the vampires had led her, but turned in the opposite direction and set a surprisingly rapid pace down the hall. For all his injuries, he still moved with the grace of the hunter he was.</p><p>With an impatient gesture he motioned for Sebastian to close the door behind them, but didn\u2019t wait while he locked it again.</p> <p>Apparently Max did have the directional sense of a bird, for he led them unerringly down the passage and through a door that opened to a flight of ascending stairs. Just as she stepped onto the first one Victoria heard shouts of alarm behind them, and felt the sudden wave of increased chill over the back of her neck. The door closed after them, and she followed Max up the stairs, hearing Sebastian pounding along in her wake.</p><p>At the top Max turned left and hurried off down another passage. Victoria realized he was stumbling a bit at about the same time she felt her breath drawing in more sharply, and the increased dampness at her hip. The edges of her vision were shaky, and her knee nearly buckled once as they turned a quick corner, but if Max could move like that with two more serious bullet wounds, she, with dual vis bullae, would keep up with him.</p><p>At last they came around another corner and up a second flight of steps and into the hallway that looked familiar to her...the room just beyond the ballroom, where all the people had been gathered.</p><p>She stopped, and Sebastian nearly plowed into her. \u201cWe can\u2019t go without the others.\u201d She dug into her pocket, her fingers tangling in the leather thong necklace and receiving a shock from its smooth pendant before finding the wooden stake.</p><p>\u201cVictoria, no,\u201d he began, but Max had heard them and he spun around.</p> <p>His normally swarthy face was tinged with gray. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead. The vampires fed on them\u2014didn\u2019t you smell it? There\u2019s no one here to save but us. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as it pains me to say it, he\u2019s right,\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cMost of the guests made it safely from the villa, but the ones who didn\u2019t...they were dead long before we were even untied.\u201d</p><p>Victoria wanted to argue. She wanted to snap at them and tell them they were wrong. The sudden wave of black fury was so surprising that her breath caught and she coughed on the malignant words she\u2019d wanted to speak.</p><p>Max looked at her strangely; then he grabbed her arm and began to pull her after him. Not the least bit gently.</p><p>She remembered little of the next few moments, and then suddenly they were out of the villa, out into the crisp dawn air where the faint yellow in the sky brought texture and shape to the unkempt gardens.</p><p>Max whirled her around to face him, his hands on her shoulders as his eyes blazed down into hers as if trying to find something that was missing. As if he wanted to shake her. Victoria dragged in a breath of clean air, and the dull fog slid away taking with it that frightening anger. She blinked.</p> <p>He released her abruptly, muttering something she couldn\u2019t hear, and turned to Sebastian, who\u2019d stood there watching. \u201cGo back to Beauregard,\u201d he told him shortly. And then something else, low and staccato.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sebastian said quietly, and with unusual brevity. Then he turned away. He looked at Victoria, and she realized they\u2019d all begun walking and were approaching the wall of the villa\u2019s grounds. Beyond it was the street, and perhaps even Oliver, waiting with the carriage.</p><p>Or\u2014Victoria\u2019s thoughts flew away as she was caught up in Sebastian\u2019s strong hands and pushed against the stone wall. He\u2019d surprised her, and before she could shove him away, he was holding her shoulders there, pinned under his fingers as he leaned close. She drew in her breath, half wanting him to kiss her and half wanting to send him spinning away for his effrontery.</p><p>But before she could make her decision, he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again, but stay away from my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserves to be staked,\u201d she replied smartly, just before he bent to kiss her, catching her off guard again. When, moments later, he released her, Victoria opened her eyes to see both Zavier and Max standing there.</p><p>Sebastian was gone.</p><p>Max looked bored.</p><p>And Zavier looked as though she\u2019d just turned into a demon herself.</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>Lord Jellington Acquires a Rival</p><p>Victoria clawed her way out of the dream and came back to reality, panting as though she\u2019d been running.</p><p>Her skin was slick and her fingers fisted so tightly she could barely pry them open. The images stayed with her, even as she tried to focus her gaze on the familiarity of her bedchamber. But all she could see were the vestiges of glowing red eyes, glittering black shards, an ebony face with twisted green horns and an evil smile. Max, Sebastian, Aunt Eustacia...even Phillip...all with drawn, elastic faces in horrific expressions, and claws, and streaming blood.She made herself sit up, shake off the terror of the nightmare, and tried to slow the rampant pounding of her heart. She reached for the bellpull to call for Verbena.</p><p>The bedclothes were rumpled and twisted, half sagging from the bed, and sunlight\u2014so clean and pure in comparison to the horrific malice in her dream\u2014blasted through the filmy drapes. By the color and angle of the sunbeams, Victoria knew it was well past noon.</p><p>She started to climb from the waist-high bed, but a twinge in her side reminded her that Verbena had put her to bed very early this morning after much clucking and salving and bandaging.</p><p>After passing through the vampire, the bullet had shaved the edge of her right hip, leaving a deep red track in her skin. Her left leg had had claw marks and bruises on it that would already have started to fade this morning.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, her toes barely brushing the floor, Victoria looked at herself in her dressing table mirror. She had dark circles under her eyes and one slight bruise on her right cheek. She didn\u2019t look that bad.</p><p>But then there was Max.</p><p>Last night, after directing her toward the carriage where Zavier and Oliver waited, he\u2019d attempted to send her off without him. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here,\u201d she told him flatly, walking back in his direction. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost too much blood and you need to have those wounds seen to.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved in annoyance or amusement as they faced each other, both bristling with obstinacy. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Victoria. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve lost a great deal of blood, and I doubt it will be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Illa Gardella and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t attempt to order me about, Victoria, for the only result will be your own mortification. Now be off and have your own injury seen to.\u201d He turned and faded into the shadows, and she heard the unmistakable sound of a bridle clinking, then the soft snort of a horse.</p><p>Left with no other choice, Victoria climbed into the carriage, where Zavier waited. He said little during the ride back to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s villa (Victoria didn\u2019t believe she could ever come to think of it as hers, despite the fact that it was). Zavier merely watched her, as if trying to assimilate who she really was.</p><p>It had been unfortunate that he\u2019d seen her kissing Sebastian (or, rather, Sebastian kissing her, for she\u2019d been more a recipient than a participant in that particular instance), but there was no help for it. Sebastian had no doubt planned it thus, at any rate, although whether his intent was to annoy Max by wasting time with such frivolity or to stake his claim, so to speak, for Zavier\u2019s sake, Victoria couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>But the thing that bothered her most about the situation was that Max had been right. Zavier was not only hurt and offended, but Victoria knew that he wasn\u2019t the right man for her to become intimate with in any fashion. He\u2019d developed into a good friend and was a brave and skilled Venator, but his kiss had meant nothing to her. Having been kissed by two men last night, she knew there was only one of them she\u2019d want to kiss again.</p><p>Now, however, as she slipped from her bed, feet touching the flat, hooked rug that wasn\u2019t quite as welcoming as the thick Aubusson one back at home, she realized with great disgust that she\u2019d been diverted from getting information from Sebastian about Aunt Eustacia\u2019s bracelet.</p><p>Not that kissing Sebastian was a hardship\u2014it wasn\u2019t in the least, for the man had very skillful lips and hands and...well, other means of distracting her. But there was a time and a place for that sort of activity, and Sebastian was a master at disregarding propriety.</p><p>There was a brief warning knock on the door to her chamber just before it opened and Verbena bustled in. \u201cYer mother and t\u2019other ladies\u2019re belowstairs,\u201d she said. Behind her came a short parade of servants carrying a tub and buckets of water to fill it. \u201cThey\u2019re wantin\u2019 t\u2019see you, my lady, and find out what happened last night to ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlast,\u201d Victoria said under her breath. She needed to get to the Consilium.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m wanting to know,\u201d Verbena said as she closed the door behind the last of the servants, \u201chow th\u2019 corset worked. Just so\u2019s I can tell that Oliver so he\u2019ll quit badgering me about it. Just because he had the first thought of it don\u2019t mean he\u2019s got t\u2019know everything. And yer gown, my lady...what happened to them roses?\u201d</p><p>Victoria sank into the hot water and sighed a long breath as she listened to the maid\u2019s comfortable prattle. Her wounds burned, but it was more than bearable in conjunction with the pleasure of the bath. At some point, she\u2019d need to tell Verbena that her whole coiffure had fallen apart when the vampires disarmed her and removed her stake\u2014an inconvenience that would have to be rectified in the future. The long sagging of her hair had been a distraction.</p><p>At last, when the water was turning tepid, she stepped out into a large towel brandished by Verbena. As she turned to take a seat at the dressing table, her maid reached toward the clutter on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, my lady?\u201d Verbena asked, her fingers pausing over the leather thong and the obsidian flake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d Victoria said, snatching at the shiny black pendant, closing her fingers around it to keep it hidden from prying eyes. It was heavy and warm in her hands for something so small, and she felt a sizzle of awareness prickle her fingers just as it had at the villa. \u201cJust finish my hair so I can get on with my business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Verbena\u2019s eyes opened into full circles, but she wisely said nothing. Victoria was suddenly weary of the chattering maid, who always seemed to have to know what was going on. Could she not simply leave her to do her duty without trying to also be her confidante?</p><p>Images from her dream\u2014of grasping, clawlike hands, and the gleam of the black splinters of obsidian\u2014suddenly came back to her, nearly blinding her with their force.</p><p>But now, in the daylight, fully awake and away from her bed, Victoria wasn\u2019t as overwhelmed by the dream and the evil it portended. Shaking the images away, she recognized what it was telling her, what she must be aware of. The vampire had been wearing a piece of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk, and Akvan was back. He\u2019d been called back to earth by the destruction of his obelisk.</p> <p>If that little chip was important enough for the vampire to wear, how important must the larger shard be, the one Victoria stored at the Consilium?</p><p>One thing was certain: Victoria was going to take the small piece to the Consilium, where it would be safe from prying eyes and hands. As soon as she could make her excuses and extricate herself from her mother and the other ladies, she would remove the pendant from her home.</p><p>In the meantime, the safest place for it was in the pocket of her gown.</p><p>As she came down the stairs, Victoria heard the excited chatter of feminine voices in the parlor. She vacillated for a moment, considering whether she should ask for something to eat before joining the elder ladies, but her decision was made for her when she heard a high-pitched squeal from\u2014it could only be\u2014Lady Winnie, and the door opened as the other ladies chuckled in response.\u201cVictoria,\u201d crowed the duchess. \u201cCome and join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe feared you would lie abed all the day,\u201d her mother added. \u201cCome, sit, and let us tell you of our adventures last night.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria was swept into the elegant chamber and seated on the only uncushioned surface in the room: a straight-backed chair situated betwixt her mother and the duchess. Just where she\u2019d prefer not to be.</p><p>Before the ladies had an opportunity to begin their interrogation, there came a rap on the parlor door, and then Giorgio stepped in.</p><p>\u201cFor the signoras,\u201d he said, looking at Lady Melly and her two companions as he gave a little bow. And then he stepped back, and into the room came three more servants, each carrying a bouquet of flowers larger than the one before.</p><p>Victoria watched in amusement as the three ladies dug through prickly stems, fernlike leaves, and various colored petals to find each bouquet\u2019s enclosed letter.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Lady Winnie clasped the smallest collection of flowers to her ample bosom, burying her face in the beautiful lilies that carried their precious scent throughout the room. They were white with pink blushes down their centers, and when she pulled her face from their ivory petals her bulbous nose was streaked with yellow pollen. She didn\u2019t seem to know or care, even when she began to sneeze violently enough that the poor lilies released more pollen into the air. \u201cIt\u2019s from that lovely gentleman we met last evening,\u201d she gasped, trying to catch her breath as she finished her explosive sneezing.</p><p>\u201cSo he did not come to call, but he sent flowers in his stead.\u201d Melly, who was the recipient of the largest and most glorious of the flower arrangements, sniffed. It was made of roses of every shade of pink imaginable, and with a single white rose in the center.</p> <p>\u201cBut he sent you the largest of vases,\u201d Lady Nilly said, nearly hidden behind a profusion of pink gillyflowers and red tulips. \u201cYou most certainly must be the one who caught his eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did not come to call,\u201d replied Melly, her long, slender nose still lifted in disdain. \u201cI shall ensure that we are not home tomorrow in the event he should attempt to show his face,\u201d she added, thrusting the massive vase at Victoria. \u201cIn fact, my dear, I believe you should accompany us to make calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake calls? On whom?\u201d Victoria asked, startled into paying attention by the large bouquet Melly had given her, and her mother\u2019s imperious comment. \u201cWe know no one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in Rome nearly six months, and you know no one here? That is abhorrent, Victoria. But it\u2019s also not true. You know the Tarruscelli girls, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. That is all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will go on calls with us tomorrow. And we none of us will be here if Alberto deigns to show his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis handsome face,\u201d Winnie corrected her. \u201cHis very handsome face. Although he is a bit shorter than Lord Jellington. And bald. And he cannot spell \u2018enchanted.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlberto?\u201d squeaked Nilly. \u201cHe signed his name Alberto on your card?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe must be in love, Melly!\u201d the duchess said, arching her brows. They were thick and wiry, and when she lifted them they looked as though they were trying to meld into one long, dark swath across her forehead. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sign my card as Alberto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely name.\u201d Nilly sighed, clasping her skinny, blue-veined hands to her nonexistent bosom. \u201cSo Italian. So masculine! And the way one must roll one\u2019s Rs when saying it...Alberrrrrrto. Alberrrrrrto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Melly broke in, Victoria noticed, only when the other two ladies seemed to have run out of raptures. \u201cHe was merely being kind. If he truly had developed a tendre for me, he would have come calling. At least Jellington knew enough to do that, although he certainly didn\u2019t send flowers the first day after we\u2019d met.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had listened to enough of their prattle; her mother was always in raptures over some beau or another, it seemed. The obsidian chip felt heavy in her pocket, and curiosity about Max\u2019s health weighed on her mind. And she wished to speak with Wayren about all that had transpired last night as well. \u201cI must excuse myself,\u201d she said, standing. \u201cI have an appointment with my...my Latin tutor,\u201d she added, thinking that Wayren wouldn\u2019t mind being called thus.</p><p>\u201cLatin tutor?\u201d her mother replied in astonishment. \u201cBut Victoria, why on earth would you wish to read Latin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that I can better study the histories of Rome as they are written,\u201d she replied primly, and, having made a quick curtsy, glided toward the door as rapidly as possible. \u201cYou ladies have a lovely day today. I do not know if I shall see you this evening for supper, Mama, for my tutor has invited me to dine with her.\u201d</p><p>Victoria arrived at the Consilium late in the day, and the main chamber where the holy-water fountain glistened was empty and silent but for the sound of rushing water.</p><p>This was not unusual, for rarely were Venators at the Consilium unless there was a meeting or gathering of some kind. Most often there was no need for people to be there, and the fewer times Venators traveled to the Consilium, the less likely it would be discovered. Venators preferred to spend their time hunting vampires on the streets.</p><p>Even Wayren and Ilias were not always about, although they each had private apartments back in the depths of these catacombs. As well, Miro, Ylito, and the physician Hannever all had their own workshops nearby, in other parts of the underground property. But they rarely made an appearance in the main chamber or galleries.</p><p>Victoria was relieved that she was able to go immediately to the secret storage room near Wayren\u2019s library. After all that had happened last night at the villa, combined with her haunting dream, she just wanted to make certain that the shard was still there, and safe. And she wanted to get the other, smaller piece hidden away before anyone else knew about it.</p><p>The fewer who did, the better. The safer.</p><p>Once inside the chamber Victoria closed the door, remembering last time when Max had sneaked up on her. After lighting a lamp on the table, she pulled the leather thong out of her pocket, the pendant dangling, jet black streaked with dark blue.</p><p>The shard she\u2019d found still lay on the long, scarred wooden table where she\u2019d left it. It didn\u2019t appear to have even been moved, and for some reason that knowledge eased the deep-seated worry that had niggled at her since she\u2019d awakened from her dream. The shard was safe, and now its smaller counterpart would be as well.</p><p>When she dropped the leather necklace onto the table, the two pieces of obsidian clinked dully, and a single blue spark between them startled her. A faint aroma like old smoke, blended with something putrid, reached her nose, but faded almost immediately, just as the spark died out.</p><p>Victoria picked up the leather cord and moved the pendant so that it wasn\u2019t touching the shard any longer. Then, gingerly, she reached out to feel the bigger piece of obsidian. A sharp tingle zipped up her arm, blushing over her shoulder.</p><p>The feeling was similar to the sensation she experienced when she\u2019d touched the smaller piece, but this was stronger, strong enough that she yanked her hand away. And she stared at the large splinter, sitting there like a chunk of black glass.</p><p>The shard looked like a weapon she would carry; it was ironic that the obsidian piece that exuded such malevolence was the same shape and size of an ash stake she\u2019d use to destroy evil.</p><p>Of course, the source of this evil, Akvan, was not a vampire. Despite the fact that all demons\u2014whether they be fallen angels from ages and ages ago, or half-human demons called vampires\u2014came from Lucifer, they lived and died in different ways. Still, it was interesting that this particular piece could easily be carried as a Venator\u2019s weapon.</p><p>What would happen if she did pick it up and use it as a stake? What would be the result of slamming this obsidian pike into a vampire\u2019s chest? Or Akvan\u2019s, for that matter?</p><p>Victoria smoothed her hand over the glasslike weapon, noticing that the tingle had lessened. There were no further sparks, but the shard was warm. Just slightly.</p><p>But perhaps that was from the friction and heat of her fingers.</p><p>She wondered, suddenly whether this was what Akvan had wanted from her. This shard. This piece of his power.</p><p>A piece of the power that had called him back to earth.</p><p>It was possible, likely, even. If he wanted the shard back, what better way than to send his minions after her?</p><p>First he\u2019d sent Sara Regalado and her cohorts to lure her to the graveyard that night. They hadn\u2019t tried to hurt Victoria, only to capture her. Perhaps they\u2019d planned to bring her back to the villa, to Akvan, where he could demand that she produce the shard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how did he know she had it?</p><p>No one but Wayren, Ilias, and Ylito knew she\u2019d found it. Even Max was unaware.</p><p>No one else except\u2014</p> <p>Victoria felt cold; then a blast of angry heat shuddered over her.</p><p>Sebastian knew.</p><p>Sebastian had seen her holding the shard when they escaped from the burning opera theater on the night of Aunt Eustacia\u2019s death.</p><p>She stood abruptly, automatically feeling for the stake under her gown.</p><p>The sun would have gone down by now, and she would take herself out onto the street to hunt down someone who could bring a message to Beauregard or Sebastian. Or she would go herself.</p> <p>She\u2019d squandered her first chance to talk to Sebastian and find out what he knew about Aunt Eustacia\u2019s armband. Now she had two reasons to find him.</p><p>And to find out if the entire scene at Villa Palombara had been a farce put on by Sebastian and his grandfather to acquire the shard.</p><p>Perhaps Akvan wasn\u2019t back at all.</p><p>No. No, he was. Or something just as evil was.</p><p>Victoria had smelled him.</p><p>She looked down at the table where the shard sat, long and black and wicked. The little pendant glinted next to it on the rough wooden table.</p> <p>Now that Victoria was certain someone\u2014Akvan, Sebastian, Beauregard, or all of them\u2014was after the piece of the obelisk, she didn\u2019t want to leave it sitting so visibly on the table.</p><p>The heavy splinter was still a bit warm when she picked it and the leather necklace up. The obsidian stake felt good in her hand. Comfortable.</p><p>Her fingers closed around it, and Victoria positioned it as if a vampire were in front of her, making an experimental stab into the air. The swish and swirl of movement was audible in the silent chamber, and she imagined stabbing the shard into the chest of a vampire. Lilith. Beauregard. Any of the creatures with red eyes and flashing fangs.</p><p>The shard would send them back to Lucifer.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s lips tightened, curling in against her teeth, and she felt a surge of hatred for those red-eyed creatures who\u2019d taken so much from her. Sebastian had tried to make her believe that some vampires weren\u2019t wholly evil, that they didn\u2019t deserve to be damned to Hell. But he was wrong.</p><p>And if he tried to stop her, she\u2019d send him there along with them.</p><p>The large splinter was growing warmer, and Victoria looked down at it. Her fingers were leaving moist prints on the sleek black glass. It must be kept safe. Secret.</p><p>She had to put it away in a drawer or chest. No one would find it there.</p> <p>In the darkest corner of the room she found a small wooden chest filled with nothing but fragrant wood curls, as though someone had sat and stripped them from a branch of cedar. Or had been carving a stake.</p><p>The splinter and the necklace fit easily in the box, and it was with a sigh of satisfaction that Victoria closed the lid, placing another chest on top of that one.</p><p>The pieces of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk would be safe.</p><p>Now to deal with Sebastian.</p><p>She rose to her feet and, with one last look back at the dark corner where the chest held an evil treasure, Victoria moved quickly from the chamber.</p><p>Back out in the passage, she paused outside of Wayren\u2019s library, but there were no sounds from within. No one else was about; it was just as silent as it had been when she arrived. A gentle knock drew no response, and when Victoria gently prodded the door open, she found the room dark.</p><p>The Consilium was silent and bare as she walked back toward the main chamber, where the rush of the fountain made a pleasant hum.</p><p>At least Victoria had one of her questions answered: Max had to be all right, for if he\u2019d been otherwise he would be in the Consilium with Hannever, being treated for his injuries. A seriously wounded Venator would be kept safe in the Consilium until he was well.</p><p>Having had her question answered by omission, Victoria left the Consilium through the secret spiral staircase that led into a hidden passage behind one of the confessionals at Santo Quirinus.</p><p>Instead of leaving through the doors of the small chapel, she went into its tiny rear courtyard and into a ramshackle old building across from the church. She exited onto the nearly empty street, where she found it was indeed well past sunset on the chilly February night.</p><p>The sky was as black as the shard she\u2019d left below, and a full moon glowed high and small among the stars. She walked toward the unpleasantly sharp smell of wet umbrella silk. Her wooden stake felt light and weak in her hand after the heaviness of the shard, but it would do its duty if she required it.</p><p>There were no vampires about, however. Of course, that was no surprise, as this particular block of the Borghi was deserted of human prey.</p><p>Victoria had walked nearly all the way to the Passetto when she stopped. Had she closed the door to the storage chamber, where the shard was secreted?</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Just because the door was open didn\u2019t mean that anyone would find the piece of obelisk...but it made her nervous to leave such important things unattended and open.</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>She hesitated only a moment before turning to make the trip back to the little run-down building, moving at a more rapid pace than when she\u2019d been walking away from it. If any of the few shopkeepers or pilgrims Victoria passed noticed a slender figure wrapped in a dark cloak walking back the way it had just come, they gave her no second look.</p><p>Urgency built in her chest. The shard might not be safe, and she couldn\u2019t allow it to fall into anyone else\u2019s hands if Akvan and Beauregard and Regalado were after it.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d move it to a different place in the chamber. A locked chest? Or...</p><p>By this time Victoria was moving through the hidden passage behind the confessional in Santo Quirinus. She carefully stepped over the middle stair and moved silently along the short hall hung with icons, then pressed the intricate stonework that would reveal the spiral staircase.</p><p>The floor glided open without a sound, and Victoria hurried down the curling steps, driven to get to the storage chamber to check on the shard. Make certain it was safely in its dark corner.</p><p>Tomorrow she would tell Wayren about this, but\u2014</p><p>Someone was standing at the fountain.</p><p>Dipping his fingers into the sparkling holy water, there in the dim light, looking down into the pool. Only one sconce lit the area, as it had when she\u2019d left perhaps twenty minutes earlier, but she recognized him. Even from the back.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Yet...perhaps not.</p><p>He must have sensed her presence, for he turned, an uncharacteristic look of shock on his handsome face.</p><p>Victoria refused to allow him to see that he\u2019d caught her off guard as well. Instead she stepped closer, noticing the way he clamped a wet hand over his bunched-up white shirt.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was planning to tear the city apart looking for you, when all I had to do was wait for you to show up. What are you doing here, Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Divests a Gentleman of an Article of Clothing</p><p>A chagrined expression flashed over Sebastian\u2019s face for an instant, then was masked. He stepped away from the fountain, his wet hand making a print on his light shirt. She noticed a dark coat hanging over a nearby chair.</p><p>\u201cYou returned much sooner than I anticipated,\u201d he said, recovering quickly to summon a teasing smile. \u201cI should perhaps have waited a bit longer before coming down here...but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m terribly disappointed to have you alone at last. After all, last night in the dungeon with Maximilian was hardly\u2014\u201d\u201cGive me an answer, Sebastian.\u201d Victoria\u2019s heart was pounding, panic replacing bald shock as she realized what this must mean. Her mouth had dried; she felt it shrivel like a pea in the sun. Her fingers were shaking, and nausea curled in her belly. How could it be? \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t bring your grandfather,\u201d she said in a voice that didn\u2019t belong to her, even as she tried to assimilate what Sebastian\u2019s presence meant. He couldn\u2019t have done.</p><p>The Consilium, the safe, secret sanctuary, had been found.</p><p>No. Not under her watch. Not after almost two millennia of secrecy.</p><p>No.</p><p>Victoria felt fear and anger\u2014emotions she\u2019d struggled to keep out of her mind\u2014envelop her, clouding clear thought as she started to dash past Sebastian, desperate to get to the secret storage chamber\u2014and to Wayren\u2019s library\u2014before they could be despoiled.</p><p>His teasing smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m here alone.\u201d His voice, urgent and low, stopped her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The panic eased enough for her voice to be steady when she snapped, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t what? Infiltrate our sanctuary? How did you find out about this place? How?\u201d</p><p>But no, of course Beauregard wasn\u2019t here, she realized belatedly, her mind beginning to function again. She would have sensed him the moment she came into Santo Quirinus. That, at least, was good.</p><p>Sebastian was staring at her, his eyes shadowed by the dim light glowing behind tawny curls that made him look so absurdly holy. He seemed to be studying her, waiting for her to speak.</p><p>His chest rose and fell easily, but the tension that skittered between them made Victoria restless and unwilling to play the game of silence. \u201cAnswer me, Sebastian. At least tell me how you learned of this place, and how it is on my guard that you\u2019ve found us.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her. \u201cNever fear, ma ch\u00e8re. Your secret shall remain safe with me. I\u2019ve known of these chambers for a rather long time, and I\u2019ve told no one yet.\u201d</p><p>A lopsided smile tilted his lips as he reached for her shoulder, skimming his knuckles over her collarbone and then drifting his fingers loosely around the nape of her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you yet know that I\u2019d do nothing to endanger you? Now, since we are here together and unlikely to be interrupted, there are other activities we might find to divert ourselves. Ones that I, at least, have missed greatly.\u201d His smile, slow and sensual, mirrored the look in his eyes, a look she\u2019d seen more than once before. Despite her anger and confusion, the desire in his gaze had its effect on her, sending flutters through her belly. \u201cAfter all...you sought me out, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a necessity, Sebastian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen perhaps you might wish to tell me what was so necessary that you had to kiss my grandfather in order to send the message?\u201d These last words came out sharply.</p><p>Victoria shoved his hand away before it closed over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t try to play the jealous lover, Sebastian. It rings a false note. And the reason I needed to speak to you is in regard to something of my aunt\u2019s. You must have seen her...seen her...\u201d Blast. Her voice was rough, and her eyes began to tingle with tears. \u201cYou sent me her vis bulla. But there was a bracelet she wore, an armband. It\u2019s very important. Did you see it...when...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver? Wide at the top of her arm?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, I took it also. It was the only jewelry she wore, and the only other thing I could do for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is it? What did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was important to you. It\u2019s...I put it here to be safe from...behind Catherine Gardella\u2019s portrait. Apparently she liked jewelry.\u201d</p><p>A wave of relief, followed by annoyance, rushed over Victoria. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you send it to me when you sent the vis bulla?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered away, then came back to hers with a hint of chagrin in their expression. \u201cI...ah...didn\u2019t think it would have quite the same...flair,\u201d he said with a discomfited expression, \u201cto send both. The vis...well, it was more intimate.\u201d He quirked a smile.</p><p>Then, shrugging off whatever bit of discomposure he\u2019d had, Sebastian reached for her again, and this time he caught her upper arms with both hands. \u201cBesides...what if I needed a reason to contact you again?\u201d he murmured as he pulled her close enough that her skirt swished against his trousers. \u201cI\u2019m not one to leave all my cards on the table.\u201d</p> <p>His grip was strong, surprisingly strong. Victoria was tempted to twist away and send him sprawling to the stone floor, perhaps clipping his head on a table on the way down\u2014but at the same time, looking up into his face, she found herself focused on his mouth. It was close, and she well remembered how it felt sliding and fitting sensually to hers. Warm and mobile, slick and coaxing.</p><p>Perhaps it would be prudent to put him off guard. Prudent and enjoyable...and then she could change the subject back to a more pertinent one.</p><p>But apparently, for once Sebastian had other ideas; for he sobered, the flirtatiousness fading from his face, as if he\u2019d just recalled something important. \u201cVictoria, you must take care. He\u2019s made it clear that he wants you for himself,\u201d he said, maintaining the distance between them...yet looking at any moment like he might change his mind.</p><p>At first Victoria didn\u2019t know who he meant. She looked away from his lips and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard,\u201d Sebastian said, his voice tight and without its normal light edge. \u201cI\u2019m speaking of Beauregard. Although from what I understand, you\u2019ve wasted no time in finding other, less dangerous men to amuse you, such as that redheaded Scot.\u201d</p><p>Now she shoved hard at his solid chest, and he released her, stumbling back a step but easily remaining on his feet. \u201cYou are playing the jealous lover. How can that be, Sebastian, when you\u2019ve been no lover at all these past months? When, in fact, our attachment was of the briefest kind?\u201d</p> <p>His expression changed, the annoyance easing into a knowing smile. \u201cSo you have missed me.\u201d Triumph colored his amber eyes, and he reached for her a third time.</p><p>This time she let him bring her so that their bodies were flush: breast to chest, thigh to thigh, feet mingling. Her skin warmed, the flush traveling from her face down to her neck and beyond. It was good to touch him again, to feel the warmth of a man\u2019s body and the strength of his arms about her.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d They both knew she was lying.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have missed him\u2014she couldn\u2019t trust him, for his loyalty was to Beauregard\u2014but she had missed him, and she did trust him...after a fashion. It wasn\u2019t as if he could replace Phillip and the love and regard they\u2019d had for so brief a time, but she was human.</p><p>And she was a woman. A woman who\u2019d grown up cuddled and petted by Melly and her two friends, a woman who liked to be touched, who enjoyed being reminded that she was desirable, and who had made choices that kept her outside normal societal conventions so that she was a lonely outcast.</p><p>He made her feel. He\u2019d brought pleasure to a life that had once been so simple, so normal and easy and bland, and had become stark and dark and violent. With his irrepressible charm and unabashed flirtation, Sebastian had made her heart beat faster and her body reawaken from the grief-imposed stupor resulting from Phillip\u2019s death. Even now, as they faced each other, her belly flipped deep inside, knowing there was more to come. And she was ready for it. Her heart rammed in her chest as she remembered the way his hands would glide over her bare skin....</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I didn\u2019t want to stay away, Victoria,\u201d he said, his mouth hovering in front of hers, his lips twitching in a racy grin, and the clove scent on his breath a light brush over her skin. \u201cI wished only to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d She reared her head away from him so she could look directly in his eyes, knowing that her own were narrowed in annoyance. \u201cWhat did you mean to keep me safe from? The vampires I hunt every night? That is a poor excuse and another false note. Can you not even once be truthful?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom Beauregard.\u201d His voice had chilled, and eyes that had been soft and coaxing a moment earlier had flattened. \u201cYou have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fully aware of your Venatorial qualities, for you see fit to remind me of them\u2014as well as my own shortcomings\u2014at every opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am who I am,\u201d she told him. \u201cI told you this last autumn\u2014I made the choice, and if it\u2019s too much for you to bear, knowing that I\u2019m stronger and faster than you, that I have no need for you to protect me, that I\u2019m not like other women who will sit at home waiting to be taken care of by the men in this world, then begone with you, Sebastian. I need you no more than you need me.\u201d</p><p>She realized suddenly that she was crying. My God, crying! Victoria, Illa Gardella, who\u2019d not even squeaked in shock when her beloved aunt was killed in front of her, had tears rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>Now she was angry\u2014at herself, at Sebastian, at the choices she\u2019d made and the losses she\u2019d endured\u2014and she tore herself from his hold, turning away to focus her attention on something else...anything else. Anything.</p><p>The sparkling water of the fountain caught and then mesmerized her, soothing in its rhythm, beautiful in its clarity, comforting in its holiness.</p><p>And then...the realization came...a suspicion that must have been buried deeply suddenly came billowing out. She whirled toward him just in time to see Sebastian reaching to gather her back into his arms.</p><p>She went willingly, meeting his mouth with all of the angst and anger that had built inside her since she\u2019d had those five dreams that called her to her duty as a Venator.</p><p>Their mouths slipped and devoured as though released from a great restraint. His hands slid around to pull her hips sharply against his; then one moved up her spine, pushing her closer as he moved his lips from her mouth along the edge of her jaw, murmuring her name against her skin.</p><p>Victoria felt the dampness of his wet shirt seep into her hands, the warmth of the texture of fine linen molding to his chest under her palms, and then the direct heat of flesh beneath her fingertips as she slipped them under the hem of his shirt.</p><p>Sebastian caught his breath and tried to shift smoothly away, as he\u2019d done every time in the past, but she was too fast for him. She\u2019d found what she sought.</p><p>He froze and stepped back. Looking down at her, his face arrested and still, he said nothing.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s hands fell to her sides. \u201cSo, will you tell me why you wear a vis bulla in your navel? Or will it be more lies and prevarication?\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he hesitated for only an instant. \u201cI\u2019m born to wear one just as you are, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>Her throat crackled as she swallowed. \u201cYou think I\u2019d believe that you\u2014a man who refuses to kill vampires\u2014are a Venator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, ask Pesaro. He is well aware of it, as is Wayren.\u201d</p><p>It was true then. Max didn\u2019t lie, and Sebastian would know she\u2019d ask him.</p><p>Victoria sank down into the chair on which his coat hung. She had so many questions, such a swarm of emotions, that she didn\u2019t know where to begin.</p><p>He must have understood, for he stood over her, abashed and sober, so uncharacteristic of the brash Sebastian she knew that Victoria nearly softened. He was like a young boy who\u2019d been discovered swiping biscuits from the kitchen, ashamed and hesitant.</p><p>She almost smiled, but her growing disappointment and anger held it back. There were so many thoughts barreling through her mind, so many things that suddenly made sense. But she seized on one. \u201cThat was why you never undressed when I...when we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d he said simply. The fingers of his left hand closed and opened, closed and opened as he looked down at her, still unsure, still caught.</p><p>Why? Why would he hide such a thing from her? Then she thought maybe she knew. \u201cBeauregard. He doesn\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>But Sebastian shook his head, still sober. \u201cHe does know, and, as you might imagine, he appreciates the irony of it\u2014the grandson of one of the most powerful undead in Italy is a vampire hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hunt vampires because of him, even though you\u2019re a born Venator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Then, as if shaking off the discomfort of the moment, he bent toward her, resting one hand on each of the chair arms to bring his face closer to hers, a provocative grin lifting his lips. The charmer had returned. \u201cBut you need not fear, Victoria, that we\u2019re too closely related by blood to carry on with our...previous activities. The Gardella name hasn\u2019t been part of my mother\u2019s family for centuries, if not longer.\u201d He shifted to one hand, lifting the other to brush it over her cheek. \u201cYou and I are only distantly related. And for that I am immensely thankful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria jerked her face away, anger spiking through her again. He acted as if that were the most important issue at hand. \u201cIf you find it necessary to hide your calling, why do you bother to wear a vis bulla?\u201d That was perhaps what incensed her the most\u2014that he wore it, but didn\u2019t use it. It was blasphemy.</p><p>And it also explained, perhaps, the contempt in which Max seemed to hold Sebastian.</p><p>Max had handed his vis to her when he walked away from the Venators, and Victoria herself had removed hers when she took a year to grieve for Phillip, knowing that she didn\u2019t trust herself to wear it. She\u2019d almost killed a man\u2014a mortal\u2014because she\u2019d been overcome with grief and anger about Phillip, and the vis was a convenient weapon. It had been much too easy to let her fury get away from her and take over her actions. But once she regained control of herself, she\u2019d worn it again, just as Max had done.</p> <p>\u201cI move among vampires, and among them it\u2019s known that I\u2019m of Gardella blood, and also that I\u2019ve been Chosen. Beauregard, as I said, appreciates the irony, and the others respect me. I\u2019ve taken great pains to keep it a secret from everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was why you were so comfortable being around the undead when you owned the Silver Chalice. It was a way for you to protect your grandfather\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>He must have read the abhorrence in her face, the confusion in her eyes, for he took her reluctant hands and tugged her out of the chair with ease.</p><p>And this was why, she realized now, he\u2019d always seemed unusually strong. Even from the beginning.</p><p>Anger shot through her, sparking her emotions so that her cheeks burned hot. He\u2019d taken care not to appear too strong or too capable as they\u2019d faced vampires last year when Dr. Polidori was killed by the undead after writing a novel that told too many of the vampires\u2019 secrets. He\u2019d done just enough to let her think she\u2019d saved them both, that she\u2019d been the one to protect them all. She\u2019d almost died, and so had he. And he\u2019d never told her.</p> <p>And last autumn, at the theater where Akvan\u2019s Obelisk was being kept and when Aunt Eustacia was killed, he didn\u2019t tell her then.</p><p>He\u2019d even made self-deprecating remarks about himself in comparison to her, the Venator, the warrior. Now that she thought about it, she remembered bitterness in his voice when he spoke of her skill, and her assumption that he had none.</p><p>Anyone can stake a vampire, he\u2019d told her once.</p><p>If they can get close enough, she\u2019d replied flippantly, clearly implying that he hadn\u2019t a prayer of doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou stood by and watched my aunt die last fall,\u201d she said, anger bursting forth. \u201cYou watched it all happen, and you did nothing!\u201d</p><p>His hands were tight on her upper arms, and this time he didn\u2019t bother to hide his strength. \u201cWhat could I have done? What could you have done? It was two of us\u2014three, with Pesaro\u2014there was nothing that could have stopped those events. You know it.\u201d</p> <p>She knew he was right, but the anger didn\u2019t slide away. \u201cThat night\u2014when Polidori died...Sebastian, if I\u2019d known you were a Venator\u2014\u201d</p><p>His sharp bark of a laugh cut her off. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have disparaged my skill with a sword? You would have expected more from me? Victoria, it was I who held back the Imperial while you were nearly mauled by that Guardian vampire. If you\u2019d been less self-absorbed you would have realized you could never have matched against a Guardian and two Imperial vampires on your own, and wondered how a fop such as I could have matched swords with an Imperial.\u201d</p><p>While the pink-eyed Guardians were powerful in their own right, Imperials were even more fearsome. With blazing purple-red irises, Imperials were the strongest, fastest, and most powerful beings in the vampire race. They were often centuries, even millennia old, and not only glided through the air, but also wielded deadly swords as their weapons.</p><p>\u201cI was the one who\u2019d been charged with protecting Polidori, until you waltzed into the picture and insisted on taking charge,\u201d Sebastian continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were only too eager to let me! If there was someone else to do the dirty work, you\u2019d step back and let them. If you hadn\u2019t disappeared\u2014run away\u2014from the Silver Chalice when Lilith sent the Guardians after you, Phillip might still be alive! You might have been able to help him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But likely not. There were eight Imperials, along with a myriad of other vampire patrons who would have leaped to their defense, and only Pesaro and myself. I am sorry, Victoria. I\u2019ve told you before that I wholly regret what happened to your husband. I would not have wished that on anyone. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Her face was wet with tears, and she\u2019d stopped trying to pull free from his arms. But though her muscles eased, her fury and disappointment did not. \u201cAnd that night in the carriage in London...you tried to seduce me and then delivered me to those vampires. You let them take me away!\u201d Once finding herself alone with Sebastian, she\u2019d nearly allowed him to make love to her\u2014until they were interrupted by an angry group of vampires. She\u2019d always suspected he\u2019d delivered her to them on purpose.</p><p>Sebastian was shaking his head. \u201cAs lovely as that distraction was, do you truly think I\u2019d allow my attempt to seduce you to be interrupted by something as unpleasant as the undead? I realized they were present just when you did. I tried to keep them from taking you, but I wasn\u2019t able to. It was I who found your driver and told him where you were so that Pesaro could extricate you from Lilith\u2019s minions. She was too angry at me for helping you, and was watching me too closely to allow me to do any such thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you wished not to tip your hand to her that you were playing both sides of the game. What is it, Sebastian? Whoever is winning is the side you choose?\u201d</p><p>He looked as though she\u2019d slammed him in the stomach with all of the force of her two vis bullae. \u201cVictoria, you cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly\u2014\u201d</p><p>A noise behind her had Victoria whirling to see Zavier come to a stunned halt from what must have been a run from the back of the Consilium. \u201cHow could you!\u201d His face was tight with accusation, and he was breathing heavily. \u201cVictoria, do ye know what ye\u2019ve done? You may be Illa Gardella, but this is wrong.\u201d</p><p>His ruddy face flushed with anger as he strode toward her and Sebastian, his arms bunched in a threatening manner. In his hand he held a stake. \u201cFirst ye kiss the man; then ye bring him into our sanctuary. And now we are found!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop yourself there, Zavier,\u201d Victoria snapped, still reeling from the maelstrom of disappointment and fury Sebastian had raised in her. Stepping between the bristling Scot and her lover\u2014former lover\u2014she faced the redhead. \u201cYou do not know of what you speak.\u201d</p><p>Looking in his eyes, she saw mostly pain, and she realized how it must appear to him: a tryst being held in the most secret of places. As if Victoria were compromising security and secrets in exchange for a bit of a tup, as Verbena would say.</p><p>She had difficulty not being furious that Zavier assumed the worst of her, but Victoria managed to tuck that emotion away\u2014for the time being. Her voice gentled, but still kept a hint of steel in it. \u201cIt is not what it appears.\u201d</p><p>And then she smelled the blood and noticed the stain on Zavier\u2019s torso.</p><p>Before she could speak, a low, rolling sound, like the tolling of a bell, clanged. The sound filled the room, dull and ominous, and Victoria turned to look at a large bell high in one of the corners. She\u2019d hardly noticed it before, but now it seemed to swell inside the whole chamber. The deep sound reverberated through her limbs, and she saw the vibration in the feather of an old-fashioned quill that sat on one of the tables. Then more running feet grabbed her attention. Ilias hurried into the room from the opposite direction Zavier had come, Wayren close behind him, her gown billowing behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe warning bell. Someone has tripped the alarm above in Santo Quirinus,\u201d Wayren said, hurrying toward them. \u201cThere are trespassers near.\u201d</p><p>Victoria drew back as if she\u2019d been slapped, whirling to face Sebastian in horror. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it was not me, Victoria! I swear it!\u201d He looked as disconcerted as she, his attention flashing to Wayren, who did not appear at all surprised to see him. \u201cIt was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wayren reached for him, her fingers closing over the juncture of neck and shoulder. \u201cLater, Sebastian. We will talk later.\u201d She twitched her hand, and his eyes rolled back in his head as he crumpled to the floor. Obviously Wayren didn\u2019t trust him either.</p><p>Victoria looked sharply at her\u2014she\u2019d known all along about Sebastian! Why had she never told her?</p><p>\u201cThe vampires haven\u2019t found us yet, but there are undead and mortals above, in the streets and buildings nearby. Something has brought them here.\u201d It was Zavier, speaking to Ilias as though Victoria were not present. His normally jovial face bore darkness and accusation when he finally looked at her. \u201cWe must drive them away.\u201d</p><p>He started off toward the alcove that led to the spiral staircase Victoria had descended only thirty minutes earlier, but she called him back.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zavier, wait. We cannot go that way, for if we suddenly appear from the church they will know our secret.\u201d</p><p>Ilias kept hidden guardsmen within the small church and in the areas surrounding it: one Venator along with two Comitators, who were martial-arts experts like Kritanu who taught the Venators their fighting skills. If there were vampires about, threatening their security\u2014which Victoria had no reason to doubt\u2014presumably the guards were already engaged. Still, it would be rash to come from the church and confirm to the undead where the entrance to the Consilium was.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Ilias ordered with a sharp gesture. Victoria and Zavier followed the older man, who obviously knew more about the secrets of the Consilium than anyone else, back down the steps and through one of the pointed archways that led to a chamber Victoria had seen only once before. It was bare and dusty. Trunks and several wooden crates were stacked against one of the walls, but Ilias hurried past them toward the back corner. He reached up to one of the iron sconces that were studded throughout the entire Consilium and lifted the torch from its place. Fumbling around with his fingers inside the empty sconce, he grunted in satisfaction, then withdrew his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria watched with increasing tension, impatience nearly sending her back to the top of the spiral stairs. At least there she could hear if the threat was coming closer.</p><p>But when Ilias removed his hand from the inside of the sconce, he also pulled back on the iron cup, and it fell away from the wall. A dull grating sound drew her attention, and she saw the wall behind the trunks shift.</p><p>Zavier was there before she was, only, Victoria knew, because he\u2019d somehow been looking in that direction. He shoved the wall so that it opened wide enough to get through, and he dashed into the darkness beyond.</p> <p>She would have followed him, but Ilias caught her arm. \u201cYou cannot come back in this way, so take care. It is only an exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and ran after Zavier, noticing the splatter of blood he\u2019d left on the floor. She didn\u2019t know how badly he was injured, but she must rely on him. It was the two of them and the three guards who watched the church above; Ilias and Wayren would stay below as a last shield in the Consilium.</p><p>The secret door had closed behind her, leaving no illumination, yet Victoria did not slow her pace.</p><p>Her huntress blood was ready, her instincts on edge, when she saw gray relief ahead. Stake steady in her hand, Victoria slowed as she came around a corner and found herself at the bottom of a set of stone stairs. Up she climbed, the heels of Zavier in front of her becoming more visible as they ascended, and the pungent smell from the nearby umbrella makers more evident.</p><p>Then she followed him through a stone doorway that led to the street in front of Santo Quirinus church. The cobblestones were covered by moonglow. The sun had been set for some time.</p> <p>As Victoria burst across the borghi and up the five steps onto the brick street, she noticed two things: first, the bloody heap of what had been a Comitator, and second, the dank, musty death-smell she\u2019d smelled only last night.</p><p>A demon.</p><p>Sebastian had brought demons to the Consilium!</p><p>This fact was confirmed when Victoria saw Michalas, who must have been with Zavier before he came to sound the alarm, slam his stake into the chest of a red-eyed being. When he withdrew it and stepped back the creature leaped toward him, unharmed. Victoria vaulted herself at them and kicked into the demon, sending him off balance and slamming into the side of a building.</p><p>She rolled to her feet and looked around for something to use as a blade; demons had to be beheaded. A great force slammed into her from behind, and Victoria went sprawling onto the dirt, her knee twisting as she stumbled onto a large rock. She rolled away, kicking out with all the strength of her legs and painful knee as the demon with the vampire eyes lunged toward her again.</p><p>The shouts and blows around her ebbed into the distance as she fought hand-to-hand with the demon, who matched her in strength.</p> <p>This one appeared human, except for the red eyes of the undead and his foul, dank smell. Her arms ached where he grabbed them; her stomach burned when he jabbed her with an elbow. His head snapped back as she whipped her arm up under his chin, and he tumbled to the ground when she followed that up with a sharp kick behind his knee. She shoved him into a small bush and whirled around, again looking for something to use as a blade.</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d She heard her name and shifted her attention for the barest of moments. Something flew through the night toward her, something long and gleaming. She caught Zavier\u2019s eye with a quick thanks and snatched the sword out of the air, barely feeling the blade as it sliced into her palm.</p><p>It was in her other hand a breath later, her fingers safely behind the guard, and Victoria leaped toward the demon with a great swipe toward the creature\u2019s throat.</p><p>The blade cut through, and blood from her own wound splattered as she kept her momentum going. She didn\u2019t see the demon freeze and then shrivel into a dark mass before it bubbled into the dirt and old grass; she was already turning toward another creature bearing down on her.</p><p>A kick, a shove, a whirl and a slice, and she severed the ogre-faced demon\u2019s head from his doglike body. By the time she whirled back around, everything had stilled but for the ratcheting breathing of her companions. Michalas panted near the threshold of a building, sweat dripping from his tight curls.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell...\u201d Zavier\u2019s barrel chest heaved as he crouched against the corner of a small building that looked as though it might tumble over from his powerful weight.</p><p>\u201cIt is Stanislaus on the steps in the Icon Hall,\u201d came a voice. Ilias stepped from the small doorway of the church, his face stern and weary. \u201cHe is dead. But the door was closed behind him, preserving the secret door in the confessional. From the looks of the blood streaking the tile, he crawled in there to die...and to loose the alarm bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey nearly found the kirk!\u201d exploded Zavier, staring around with furious eyes. \u201cIf we had not been here they could have found it.\u201d He rose to his feet, the man never seeming so large and ferocious as he did then.</p> <p>Sudden comprehension welled inside Victoria, and she moved toward Zavier. That was when she saw there on the ground at his feet another body. This one had long dark hair in a crumpled braid, and his mahogany-colored face was turned to one side.</p><p>\u201cZavier, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, bending to kneel next to the man. There was nothing that could be done; the blood and the awkward angle of his head told her that in an instant. Mansur had been a Comitator recently assigned as a permanent guardian of Santo Quirinus, but prior to that he\u2019d worked with Zavier. She rose and placed her hand on the Scot\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling rose in her stomach. Could they have prevented Mansur\u2019s death? And that of the other Venator, Stanislaus? Had she made the wrong decision by delaying their arrival, taking the long way out?</p><p>They brought the bodies of the mortals into a nearby building, still taking care to stay away from the church. Their losses were one Comitator and one Venator, two-thirds of the guardians of the church. Victoria finalized the count of two demons dead, two vampires, and three mortals she didn\u2019t recognize, but suspected they might be Tutela. All were slain on the deserted street.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct. The mark of the Tutela is on the three men,\u201d Wayren said to Victoria after Ilias examined the bodies. There was worry in the older woman\u2019s pale blue eyes.\u201cMansur and Stanislaus realized too late that they were fighting demons,\u201d Victoria said, her mind back on the loss of her comrades. While all Venators and some Comitators could sense the presence of a vampire, not many also had the ability to identify demons, many of which could take any shape. \u201cAnd Stanislaus warned us the only way he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found Santo Quirinus, but they couldna find us,\u201d Zavier said, his burr thick. \u201cBut \u2019twas a near thing.\u201d He would not look at Victoria.</p><p>She fully understood, and accepted the blame. For, during the heat of battle, somehow her mind had become unfettered, and she realized how it had happened. How it must have happened.</p><p>For once she believed Sebastian, and knew he had not led the way or drawn the demons to them.</p><p>For demons could mean only one thing: Akvan.</p><p>Akvan must have sent them for the shard Victoria had hidden in the Consilium.</p><p>And he would be back.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Wherein Wayren Reveals a Disturbing Prophecy</p><p>\u201cNo matter what you think of me otherwise,\u201d were Sebastian\u2019s first words as Victoria blazed, limping, into the chamber where Wayren had put him earlier, \u201cyou must believe me. I took great precautions that no one would follow me, especially Beauregard. I left during the early part of the day, when the sun was still out.\u201d He lurched to sit upright on the bed on which he\u2019d been resting.</p><p>The room was small, one level below the rest of the Consilium, and outfitted almost as if it were a prison cell. There was a small bed, a table, a chair, and a thick rug on the cold stone floor. And an unlocked door. She closed the door behind her, locking it, and turned back to face him.Still energized and alert from the fight, and filled with fury that two of her own had been killed, Victoria stood in front of the door, her hands planted on her hips. She was going to get some answers from Sebastian, and there would be no equivocation.</p><p>Wayren had done the right thing, incapacitating him so that she, Victoria, could handle the threat above. It wouldn\u2019t have been prudent to leave him mobile, for even now Victoria wasn\u2019t certain of Sebastian\u2019s loyalties or his purpose in coming to the Consilium. It was best that he, an unknown entity, not be free to walk out when they were fighting a battle for the safety of their stronghold.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d she asked, intentionally baiting him. \u201cThe door wasn\u2019t locked. You could have left when you awakened. Isn\u2019t that your usual course\u2014slipping off into the shadows at the first sign of danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make certain I spoke to you.\u201d He was propped up on one elbow, his legs in dark trousers stretching the length of the bed, rich blond curls winging every which way about his face. He eyed her speculatively, as if wondering how to approach her mood. \u201cAnd then there was the fact that I still feel a bit dizzy from whatever it was Wayren did to me.\u201d Ah...now, there was a bit of that self-deprecating humor. \u201cPerhaps you would like to take a seat? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not quite able to stand as I no doubt should. Manners and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll stand. Though I\u2019m certain that if your hide was in danger, you\u2019d find yourself on your feet in an instant, running through the doorway.\u201d She was angry with him. She felt betrayed, and she was still reeling from the furious battle with the demons and vampires, knowing how close they\u2019d come to discovering the Consilium. The wound on her hand had been bandaged, and her wrenched knee had screamed pain with every step down the stairs to this level. Even now it still throbbed.</p><p>Yet...she was here.</p><p>He was watching her, for once seeming to understand that the moment didn\u2019t need coy comments or halfhearted jokes. He didn\u2019t even take the opportunity to mention that they were alone in a room with a bed, a fact Victoria forced herself to dismiss. After all, the last time they\u2019d been alone they\u2019d been on a bed. Or, rather, she\u2019d been on the bed, tied to it, after Sebastian had kidnapped her so that she couldn\u2019t disrupt Max\u2019s plans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annoyance fired in her again. She felt the tingle of it skimming along her arms to her fingers. They flexed.</p><p>\u201cIt was the shard from Akvan\u2019s Obelisk that drew them here, not you,\u201d she said, focusing on the matter at hand. The shard would have to be moved. But since it was almost sunrise, Victoria knew they had at least until the new nightfall to deal with that problem. She would take the shard away today, and she thought she knew exactly where to hide it.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s full lips tipped in half of a gentle smile. \u201cAh, my suspicions are confirmed. So the shard is still here. Beauregard is unaware that you have a piece of the obelisk, for no matter what you might think of me otherwise, Victoria, I did not tell him that interesting bit of information.\u201d</p> <p>She believed him, because once she\u2019d realized what had happened, everything made sense. The small piece of the obsidian obelisk on the leather thong had obviously been near Akvan, and likely he\u2019d roused, or somehow imbued it with power. That would explain the blue sparking that occurred when the two pieces had touched in the storage room\u2014the influence had thus been transferred to the larger one, or at least had triggered its own inherent powers.</p><p>\u201cAkvan knew where to send his people because he could sense the location of the obelisk shard,\u201d Victoria said, trying not to notice the deep, narrow vee of Sebastian\u2019s open shirt. Somehow he\u2019d moved, and the shirt, which she could have sworn a moment earlier had still been knotted at the neck, had gaped open, showing rich, golden skin beneath. She remembered with startling clarity that moment earlier today when her hands, sliding over the warmth of his skin and the ridges of his belly, had found the small silver vis.</p><p>This was not the time to be thinking of that, although from the sudden upswing in her heartbeat, Victoria knew it was too late to push the thought completely aside. Instead she focused on her anger and the vitality that still sang in her veins.</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d His voice, low and gentle, was more sensual. And it contrasted directly with her current on-edge nerves, which she steeled against his sensuality.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work, Sebastian. You can save your flirtations for another day. And another woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour rejection devastates me. I thought perhaps you\u2019d come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just lost two of my own to demons and vampires who had come after the shard from Akvan\u2019s Obelisk. They could have found us, assaulted our sanctuary, and destroyed what we\u2019ve built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so now you\u2019ve come to flay me with your frustrations and your anxieties? To vent your spleen about something for which only you can be blamed?\u201d Blast him, but the expression on his face was much too knowing, too complacent. Yes, there was guilt bubbling beneath her animation. Guilt, and an edginess that nipped at her, threatening to burst free.</p><p>\u201cDid you know the shard would draw Akvan out, call his people here? You knew I had it; you must know more than you divulge. As usual. You could have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had it here in the Consilium\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew I had it.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, graceful and unhurried, unaffected by her anger and her accusations. \u201cI am not your keeper, Victoria. Unless you want me to be. In which case we can certainly discuss the terms.\u201d The smile he sent her was lascivious and meaningful.</p><p>She whirled away in frustration, nearly cried aloud in pain from her wrenched knee, then spun back, gesticulating in frustration. \u201cSebastian, can you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words were cut off as she found herself suddenly pitching toward him, yanked off balance by a strong hand closing over her arm as she\u2019d pivoted back. The combination of her weak knee and being taken by surprise landed her half on top of him on the narrow bed, hands splayed one on the blanket and the other, the one he\u2019d pulled on, the unbandaged one, smack in the middle of his chest. She barely missed slamming her head into the wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember, Victoria,\u201d he said, grasping her wrist before she could pull away from touching him, \u201cthat first night in the carriage, in London? Before we were interrupted by the vampires?\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away, but he had no reason to hide his Venator strength now, and it was difficult. Especially since he\u2019d quickly scissored his legs around her good knee, leaving only her injured one with any mobility, wrapped in tangling skirts. His fingers were tight over her wrist, holding her hand stamped on the warmth of his chest, half on skin, half on linen. He was leaning over her from his half-sprawled position, and she looked up into his amber eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember? You were just as angry, simmering under the surface with frustration and guilt and need, just as you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Sebastian. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d She\u2019d stopped struggling, but the tension hadn\u2019t left her body. His weight, half on her, wasn\u2019t unpleasant; nor was it confining or even threatening. She suddenly felt drained and resigned. And expectant. Alive.</p><p>\u201cAnd you might, at that, but not in the way you imagine,\u201d he murmured, never taking his eyes from her face, never giving an iota of release. \u201cYou were angling for a fight then, that night in the carriage, just as you are now. That\u2019s why you came down here to me. You can admit it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d Her heart was thumping so hard surely he could see it, feel it, as it pounded through her body.</p><p>\u201cMad...yes, indeed, I don\u2019t deny it. I am mad.\u201d Those last words came out like a confession as, with one smooth movement, he shifted his weight and bent his face to hers.</p><p>The smell of cloves came with him, faintly, as it always did, along with tobacco and something else that was Sebastian. He was close enough that his lips hovered above hers, but he didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cThis is what you wanted, really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His voice was low, not quite a whisper, feathering over her skin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She felt, rather than saw, his mouth curve into a smile. \u201cAll that passion and heat and anger...this is the best way to let it all out. You know that. You\u2019ve missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only one time, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...we only...just once, in the carriage, last fall.\u201d He was so close, yet he still didn\u2019t kiss her. She would not lift her face that last bit to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall,\u201d he murmured, now brushing his lips ever so lightly along her jaw in a quick swipe, \u201chaving to stifle your cries of pleasure in that small parlor of your villa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...that wasn\u2019t...\u201d He\u2019d moved back so that when she talked her lips brushed against his when they moved.</p><p>\u201cIt was enough for me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth, just as coaxing as she remembered, covered hers with a deliberate firmness that told her he wasn\u2019t going to let her change her mind. She kissed him back, assuring him she didn\u2019t intend to, and then she gave way and let herself enjoy the moment\u2014and all of the lovely sensations that came with it.</p><p>He released her hands and moved her closer, driving his tongue in deep as it swept and swirled around hers. The slick movements tugged down through her belly, sending pleasant little pangs between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI want to see your vis bulla,\u201d she whispered against him.</p><p>Rolling partly away and up against the wall, he smiled with such pleasure that her stomach dipped again. He pulled off his shirt, and for the first time she saw his golden chest bare\u2014lightly haired and muscled and square-shouldered, tapering into lean hips. The dark blond hair grew down around his navel, where the small silver cross nestled, and a slender line led down into his breeches. The rest of his torso was as bare and firm as Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth dried, then moistened as she skimmed her hands up and over his shoulders. Pleasure indeed.</p><p>Clearly enjoying her touch, Sebastian pulled her down so that she lay on top of him, her breasts smashed against his bare skin, their legs mingling with her skirts, her left arm scraping against the rough stone wall. He kissed along the side of her jaw to her ear as his clever fingers flipped open the two fabric-covered buttons at the back of her bodice.</p><p>The neckline gaped away, and she lifted up from Sebastian\u2019s mouth as he tugged at the edges of her gown, pulling it down over her shoulders. The subterranean air was cool on her bare skin, raising little prickles there in the hollow of her collarbones. With two quick motions he yanked down her corset and her breasts tipped free, hovering and trembling above his face.</p><p>Hands sliding to hold her at the hips, pressing the juncture of her thighs into the bulge between his, Sebastian lifted his head to take her breast into his mouth. His tongue slid over the tip of her nipple, sending a renewed rush of pleasure down to where their hips ground together. She was breathing faster now, feeling the sweet build as he tugged and sucked and licked. Her arms trembled as they held her upright, and at last Victoria pulled away from his demanding mouth, sitting back on his thighs to look down at him.</p><p>His face was flushed with pleasure and his lips swollen, and when their eyes met a most mischievous grin quirked his lips. \u201cWell, now,\u201d was all he said as he groped under the mess of cotton and lace and muslin to slide his hands up her bare thighs. She lifted so he could pull the skirts up, placing her hands on the center of his chest for leverage and rustling her nails through the hair covering it...but when he slipped his fingers in and around the moistness between her legs, Victoria bent forward to kiss him with a ferociousness that spoke of her impatience.</p><p>They breathed together, gasping for air between kisses that moved from mouth to mouth, and then along jaws and cheeks and with teeth and delving tongues...and then he moved his hand, and they were both fumbling at the fastening of his breeches, the string of his drawers. She rolled to the side as he shrugged out of them, his legs solid and muscular, just as tanned as the rest of his skin.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he murmured, standing over her, for the first time completely undressed, looking lean and toned and all shades of gold and bronze. Her legs hung off the edge of the bed, and with a half smile he lifted her skirts again, parted her thighs, and, his hands on her shoulders, fitted himself into her in one smooth slide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria caught her breath, sighed, and closed her eyes as the sweetness blazed through her. She met his rhythm, rose and fell, greedy and demanding\u2014if she were going to take pleasure, she would take it all\u2014until the wave finally rolled over, undulating through her core to her belly and out to every limb.</p><p>Sebastian arched into her with one last stroke, his hands leaving her shoulders to curl into the blanket, tangling painfully into her hair as he matched her.</p><p>And then there was nothing but their bodies collapsed together, breathing heavily, hot and damp and sated.</p> <p>After a while Sebastian moved, lifting his face to look at her and using one finger to trace along her jaw. \u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked, his voice low and full of amusement.</p><p>Victoria shifted, and he let his weight slide onto the bed next to her. She smiled over at him and saw the way his eyes darkened from gold to brown when she did. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile is quite entrancing\u2014all those tiny dimples\u2014yet you don\u2019t show it often enough.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, working her chemise and corset up to cover her breasts again, and shrugged. \u201cPerhaps I find little to smile about as of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re smiling about this. I thought perhaps you might hold my little secret against me, and deny both of us this pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at his vis bulla, the only cold, silvery relief on his bronze and gold figure, and some of her pleasure slid away. \u201cYou deny your fate and your duty. I can\u2019t understand that any more than I can understand your leaving your grandfather\u2014and other undead\u2014to exist. You have a responsibility to take them out of this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd send them to Hell? For eternity? No, Victoria, I told you...I won\u2019t have that on me. They were once mortals, fathers, sisters, lovers. I can\u2019t damn them for something they cannot control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have...you\u2019ve done it, Sebastian, or you wouldn\u2019t have this.\u201d She brushed her fingers over the warm silver cross. \u201cYou had to have killed at least one vampire to get this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. I\u2019d killed two before...before last autumn, when the obelisk was destroyed. Exactly two vampires. And then...I killed another the night your aunt died. I told you, but you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d He reached for his breeches, no longer looking at her, but at them.</p><p>It took her a moment to realize what he was talking about. \u201cYou said you saved Max\u2019s life. That night? You killed a vampire to save him?\u201d She paused in the action of reaching around to button her dress. Impossible to do alone. \u201cWhy? You and Max...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespise each other? Hmmm...that word might be a bit strong.... No, no, it isn\u2019t. Yes, there is quite a history between us. I didn\u2019t do it to save him, Victoria.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why? Why shatter your own moral code, nonsensical as it might be, for a man you dislike?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the trousers up over his hips, busied himself tying them. She waited until he looked up. And then she saw the answer in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>He reached over to pull on his boots.</p><p>\u201cSebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be what I cannot. You need him.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, felt her face warming and stupefaction letting her jaw drop, just a little. \u201cNeed Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to persist in this battle against the undead, you need someone like him. It pains me greatly to admit it, but he\u2019s the best Venator alive. He can be what I cannot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill not, you mean to say. You will not.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the door rattled, sending Victoria leaping guiltily off the bed, her loose bodice flopping. She\u2019d locked it, and a good thing, too, for they could have been interrupted at a much more compromising moment.</p><p>Dear God, she hoped it wasn\u2019t Max on the other side, she thought as Sebastian quickly buttoned her.</p><p>But when she opened the door, it was to find Ilias there. \u201cThe sun is up,\u201d he said. To his credit, he barely glanced at Sebastian and his dishabille. \u201cYou are needed, Illa Gardella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d Sebastian said, standing and swiftly pulling his shirt back on.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, noticing the mark on the back of his shoulder. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d It was a small black mark, intricate and circular. It looked like the tattoo Max wore, signifying his membership in the Tutela. But the symbol on Sebastian\u2019s golden skin was much different, and smaller.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard\u2019s mark.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her steadily, and she understood. Her stomach soured, sending a nasty taste into the back of her mouth. He might wear the amulet of the Venators, but he also wore the mark of the vampires. And he would not choose between them.</p><p>Before she could stop him, he pushed past Ilias and strode down the passageway, leaving Victoria to gather up her shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send for me?\u201d Max growled, trying to shake off the grogginess. \u201cAnd what in the bloody hell did you give me last night?\u201d He hadn\u2019t slept so hard and dreamlessly for more than a year.Wayren, as quiet and calm as she always was, merely looked at him. Her face was a bit more drawn than usual, and instead of flowing in long strands over her shoulders, her pale blond hair was pulled back into a wrist-thick braid.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t ache as much as he\u2019d suspected he would, after two bullet wounds and innumerable punches and cuts. Perhaps whatever she\u2019d given him to help him sleep had also leached away the pain. Regardless, as a Venator, he\u2019d be completely healed within a matter of days.</p><p>Still. \u201cI should have been there. So close to Santo Quirinus? And the Consilium? You could have sent Myza for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pigeon, Max. Myza wouldn\u2019t have been able to wake you, even by tapping her beak on the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made damned certain of that.\u201d He sat up and gulped down a mug of watered wine. \u201cYou said there was something else.\u201d</p><p>Wayren didn\u2019t blink. \u201cSebastian Vioget was in the Consilium with Victoria.\u201d</p><p>Max stopped the mental barrage of thoughts and questions that image brought and focused on the important one. \u201cBeauregard?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t bring him. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Max didn\u2019t want to hear her platitudes about Vioget. \u201cIf he betrayed us, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Venator\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need say no more.\u201d</p><p>Wayren pursed her lips in a sign of annoyance, but didn\u2019t comment further on his interruption. Instead she continued, \u201cHe had Eustacia\u2019s armband, Max. We have the last key to the Door of Alchemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody nice of him to return it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have given it to Beauregard,\u201d she replied with just a bit of archness in her tone.</p><p>Max gritted his teeth but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cVictoria will want you to go with them to attempt to open the door, most likely later tonight, when it\u2019s still dark but nearing dawn. You\u2019ll be less noticeable, and the undead will be seeking shelter from the sun.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, he\u2019d be one of the contingency: Zavier, Vioget, Michalas, Ylito, himself. Was that what Victoria thought?</p><p>Max realized he must have grimaced when Wayren asked, \u201cDo her bites pain you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do. You know that.\u201d His hand went involuntarily to the never-healing scars on his neck. There were new ones, too, only a month old, on the tender part of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow often do you feel her pull, Max? Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Unreasoning rage bubbled in him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking, Max. I\u2019m demanding to know. We have to rid you of it.\u201d Now she was beginning to sound like Eustacia.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t control me. She\u2019d like to; she finds it amusing to play at it.\u201d Bitterness sat in his mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s not made me do anything against my will.\u201d At least, not to anyone else\u2019s knowledge.</p><p>\u201cAkvan is back, Max. You know she must have realized that when you destroyed his obelisk, Akvan would be called back to earth.\u201d</p><p>The grogginess had completely slid away, leaving his mind sharp again. \u201cAt one time I would have disagreed...but now I know better. She would rather battle a demon than her own son. Her son, who tried to unleash the powers of the obelisk, could have taken over Lilith\u2019s reign\u2014or at least weakened it. Whereas a demon would cause all of the vampires to unite behind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. I believe you are absolutely correct. All of the vampires would unite with Lilith except those few who have allied themselves with Regalado since the downfall of Nedas. Even Beauregard and his minions would join Lilith; he\u2019s no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. There are few vampires who will join the ranks of a demon, or support one in any way, unless they have some grief or complaint with their own vampire leader. Regalado has managed to convince only a relatively small number to join him. Then, too, there are some members of the Tutela, those who are still mortals and who were led by Regalado, who are still loyal to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Wayren agreed again. \u201cThe battle for Hell rages between the demons and the undead, and there are few who cross from one side to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus the threat from Akvan must be great enough to convince at least some undead\u2014and Regalado himself\u2014to join his ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis power is very great. When he was still ensconced in Hell and only his obelisk was here, there was the chance that the obelisk could be roused to imbue its possessor with great power\u2014the power to raise the souls of the dead into an immortal army. Of course, that was Nedas\u2019s plan, which you foiled by destroying the obelisk\u2014at Lilith\u2019s request. Now Akvan is here, and his presence brings that same power, but it\u2019s already inherent in his being. It doesn\u2019t need to be activated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why, if he\u2019s been back for more than three months, have we seen no sign of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is still weak. He\u2019s gathering his strength, likely with the help of the Tutela and Regalado and his followers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHence the reason for the event at the villa.

I\u2019ve no fear of that. You know that, Wayren.\u201d It was true. He\u2019d be free, and he\u2019d willingly give his life, as Eustacia had, as countless others had, for the mortal world\u2019s safety. \u201cI\u2019m bound as a Venator to give my life in the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is written...in a prophecy translated from the Persian by our own Lady Rosamunde Gardella...\u2018Neither Venator nor undead immortal shall slay Akvan; \u2019tis only a mortal man shall send him permanently to the bowels of Hell, using his own strength against him.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Max\u2019s mouth dried and he felt energy drain from him. Who else would be equipped, trained, prepared enough to slay a demon? Surely not any mortal man. Only a Venator would know how, would be brave enough. Would have the skills.</p><p>Only a Venator who was not a Venator.</p><p>Wayren leaned forward to touch his hand, but he pulled away from her slender fingers, reaching for his black stake. \u201cYou knew it would come to this. You knew it when I first brought you the salve.\u201d Though he tried, he couldn\u2019t summon the anger. It was what it was. His path would be thus.</p><p>He lifted his eyes and met her blue-gray ones and gave a short nod. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Becomes Quite Provoking</p> <p>Once she considered it, Victoria was relieved that Sebastian had slipped away from the Consilium and was no longer around when it was time for her to leave.</p><p>They had so much unfinished business between them, so many things she wanted to say and to demand...but until she figured out how she felt about everything she\u2019d learned in the last half day, Victoria didn\u2019t want to try to confront him. Her body still sizzled and hummed from the release of their lovemaking\u2014if one could call it that.And that was one path on which she wasn\u2019t ready to tread. Was it love that drew her to Sebastian? That caused her to open up to him, to share that part of herself?</p><p>How could it be, if she didn\u2019t trust him?</p><p>She might not trust him, but despite that and his predisposition to taking the easy way out of any situation, she found she could be happy, even relaxed, when she was with him.</p><p>It had been so much easier with Phillip. He was handsome and charming, wealthy and trustworthy. He obviously loved her, even adored her. He wanted to marry her\u2014and at that time she foolishly thought she could agree, that she could have it all, that both sides of her life would remain intact, safely separate.</p><p>So she fell in love with him. Married him.</p><p>And destroyed him.</p><p>Victoria blinked back the tears. This wasn\u2019t the time to berate herself for her mistakes; God knew she\u2019d done enough of that. All she could do now was continue on. And not make the same mistake again.</p> <p>Which was why, if she were going to have any kind of relationship with a man, someone like Sebastian\u2014one who knew her world, who understood it, who accepted it\u2014would be a ripe candidate. Someday she might have to stop taking the potion that kept her from getting with child, and consider having one of her own. There was no other Gardella that she knew of to continue their lineage. But now she couldn\u2019t even contemplate how she could do so.</p><p>All of these thoughts rambled through her mind as she left the main area of the deserted Consilium. It was late afternoon. She\u2019d slept for a few hours after Sebastian left, and she\u2019d met with Wayren and Ilias. The others had also gone home to sleep until later that night.</p><p>She passed Wayren, who was in her library quietly studying some ancient manuscript and didn\u2019t appear to notice her slinking by, and continued to the storage room. Victoria had one more thing to see to at the Consilium, although everyone else thought she, too, had already gone. They all planned to meet at dawn to go with her to open the Door of Alchemy\u2014Zavier, who would still barely look at her, Michalas, Brim. Perhaps Max, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since they parted ways at the Palombara villa early yesterday morning, but who Wayren said would be there.</p><p>Victoria had already retrieved the silver armband that belonged to Aunt Eustacia. It was just where Sebastian had told her he\u2019d put it, behind the portrait of Catherine Gardella and her boxy emerald ring. Loved her jewelry, indeed.</p><p>The thought brought a wavering smile to her lips, and a tangent on which she was happy to travel. In her portrait the woman was as bedecked in jewels as her liege, old Queen Bess. How she ever fought vampires in that massive gown and neck ruff, Victoria couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>The heavy armband was already on Victoria\u2019s upper left arm. As she closed the storage room door behind her, she felt its cold grip finally ease to match her body\u2019s warmth. The key was safely inside, and now all she had to do was to retrieve the pieces of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk and remove them from the Consilium.</p><p>Victoria quickly pulled the stake-size shard from its hiding place. She felt a sizzle of warmth as she did so, and its malevolence seemed to filter into the air. Victoria quickly slipped it into the large pocket of the long coat she wore over her split-skirted gown. The coat was too masculine-looking to pass muster with Lady Melly, but the gown, if Victoria was careful, might fool her into thinking her daughter was properly dressed.</p><p>Of course, the best course of action would be to keep Lady Melly from seeing her garbed in such a manner, and that was Victoria\u2019s intent. If all went well she would be returning to the Gardella villa much later tonight or early in the morning, and likely the ladies would be sleeping.</p><p>The little leather strip and its pendant of obsidian went into a small breast pocket on her coat. Victoria didn\u2019t want to chance the two pieces rubbing against each other again; nor did she want to put it in a pocket with her other weapons. It would be too easy for it to get lost if she suddenly had to yank out a stake, for example.</p><p>Closing the door behind her, she left the storage room, but instead of turning left to return to the fountain room of the Consilium and leave through Santo Quirinus, Victoria went to the right to exit through the other hidden passage that released her several blocks from the small church.</p><p>The late afternoon was dark and gloomy, the sun blanketed by heavy clouds, and the air damp with a cold drizzle. The obelisk shard clunked against her thigh, heavy in her pocket as she hurried along transporting a piece of evil in the midst of the few pilgrims and shopkeepers who were out on such a dank day.</p><p>Victoria had a pistol and several stakes as well: one hastily shoved in her hair in a manner that would have sent Verbena into fits, and the other in a small loop at the waist of her skirt. The heavy silver cross she favored sat directly on the bodice of her high-necked walking gown, and she also had three vials of holy water in various locations on her clothing.</p><p>And underneath it all she wore her special corset.</p><p>Victoria felt confident and prepared to face whatever she might as she made her way from the Borga across the Tiber River to the Esquiline District, where Villa Palombara sat. She could have ordered Oliver to pick her up and take her in the hack, but someone might have seen him waiting and asked...and this was a job Victoria wanted to do alone.</p><p>She\u2019d brought the danger of the shards to the Consilium all on her own, and she would draw that danger away while safely securing the pieces of the obelisk. Moving quickly through the streets, passing among shopkeepers who\u2019d begun to close for lack of customers on such a day, staying away from the carriages that rumbled along carrying more affluent Romans, splashing through chilly, dirty puddles, Victoria waited to feel the shift of cold air over the back of her neck, or the prickling awareness that someone\u2014or something\u2014followed her. Even though it was daytime, the sun was hidden, and some vampires could make their way about during cloudy days such as this.</p><p>But nothing stirred the air, tipping off her senses. She kept her head down but her eyes wary, scanning ahead and to the sides as she hurried along. Her fingers were a bit cold, as were her ears, for the collar of the coat wasn\u2019t tall enough to cover them, and her hair had been pinned up quickly and haphazardly and didn\u2019t provide any protection either. Victoria preferred not to wear gloves when she might be fighting, for they made her grip too slippery to handle the stakes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how fast or how easily Akvan could trace the location of the shard, but based on the speed with which the Consilium had been attacked after the shard had touched the splinter, she didn\u2019t think there was much time to spare.</p><p>If she could have waited until dawn, she would have. But to give the vampires and demons the cover of another night to track and come after the shard would be foolish. If she hurried she would have the task complete before the sun went down.</p><p>At last she reached the ragged part of the wall of Villa Palombara, at the backside of the elongated pentagonal estate. Far on the other end of the property, beyond the tops of the heavy thicket of trees, was the roofline of the villa itself.</p><p>She would have to traipse through the overgrowth again, and, just her luck, it was on another wet day. But the Magic Door was situated approximately in the center of the property, its crumbling stone wall a short perimeter around a smaller yard that belonged to the villa. Still, getting wet was better than trying to approach from the front, where someone in the villa might see her.</p><p>Climbing over the stone wall was rather difficult, even with the tree to assist, but Victoria managed it after nearly falling on her face when the heel of her boot caught in the back of her hem. As it was, she landed in wet grass on her knees, palms slamming one onto a branch and the other into a small thrush of weeds. Unfortunately, her wrenched knee landed on the corner of a sharp rock and sent a stab of pain blazing through her.</p><p>Swearing under her breath, she started to scramble to her feet when a pair of scuffed black boots stepped into view.</p><p>\u201cI expected you hours ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why did it always have to be Max to witness when grace deserted her?</p><p>\u201cWell, foolish you, waiting in the damp for so long. What are you doing here?\u201d she asked, standing gingerly on her weak knee and wiping her dirty, damp palms on her coat. At least the drizzle had stopped coming down, and now the moisture just hung in the air enough to keep it gray and dark and heavy.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, pushing away a lock of hair that had fallen in her eyes with the tumble, and saw that he was staring at her from under the brim of his dripping hat. It made her skin tingle, the way his dark eyes scored over her as if he\u2019d never seen her before. \u201cWhat is it? A smudge on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight there.\u201d He reached toward her, his large, rough thumb brushing the side of her cheek before she could blink. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the piece of the obelisk with you?\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be surprised. She wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cAnd the last key.\u201d She bumped into a tall sapling with a few leaves still clinging to it, and a light shower sprinkled over her arm and onto the ground.</p><p>Max was nodding. \u201cA good strategy. Use the last key to open the Magic Door, retrieve whatever is inside that we want, and then lock the obelisk piece safely in. Not only can it not be removed without the keys, but Akvan\u2019s own proximity will not allow him to sense the additional source of power from the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the power from any other splinters or shards he might have will mask the presence of this one.\u201d She realized they were still standing next to the large oak, the wall behind them and a trickle of wind sending its branches dripping old rain down on them. It was utterly quiet, and there among the gray and brown bushes they were well hidden from any prying eyes in the villa. \u201cHow did you know what I planned to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was the logical thing, of course. You found the last key and you realized the danger of the obelisk. Very simple to put the two together.\u201d Normally he\u2019d sound arrogant in such a discussion, but today he seemed rather subdued.</p><p>She thought she understood why. \u201cYou spoke to Wayren about the attack.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cEarlier today.\u201d Then he made an impatient Max gesture. \u201cWell, let\u2019s be on with it. Unless you\u2019re waiting for someone else? Zavier, perhaps? Or...no...it must be Vioget who has you hesitating.\u201d Now the familiar edge was back in his voice.</p><p>Victoria had started to walk into the brush but at his words she stopped and turned back. Max loomed over her, nearly on her heels. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me about Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>He raised one dark eyebrow. \u201cAbout...Sebastian? He\u2019s not generally my preferred topic of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Venator. You never told me.\u201d</p> <p>Again that supercilious brow. \u201cWhat difference does it make? He might have the blood of the Gardellas, might even be called to the duty...but he chooses to ignore it. He\u2019s worth little of my thought or concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which I am eternally grateful.\u201d The bitterness in his voice belied that statement. \u201cHe could have saved many other lives if he\u2019d taken his rightful place in the Consilium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still wears the vis bulla,\u201d she said.</p><p>Now both brows rose, and she felt her cheeks warm at the knowing expression there. \u201cAh. That explains your delay in taking the shards from the Consilium. You were otherwise...engaged.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath to force away the blush. There was no reason for her to play the modest miss with him; he already knew she and Sebastian had been lovers. \u201cAnd so I was. But I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at her, his dark eyes unreadable. Then his lips quirked in a hard smile. \u201cSo it is to be Sebastian. Have you left Zavier intact, or are there pieces to pick up there too?\u201d</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t feign a cool response to that, remembering the anger and pain on the Scotsman\u2019s face. Nevertheless, she lifted her chin, shoving her hands restlessly into the two side pockets of her coat. She wished suddenly for an undead to appear so she could stake it. Do something other than stand face-to-face with the man who bloody always seemed to be right.</p> <p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d Max said, correctly interpreting her silence. \u201cAnd who will it be next, Victoria? Surely you won\u2019t destroy your entire army of Venators, one after another, because you cannot keep your\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped, biting the words off, and seemed to draw himself up and away from her, cloaking what had been sudden ire. \u201cThis is a waste of time. We have only a short while until sunset.\u201d</p><p>Brushing past her, he started off on those long legs, moving rapidly through the brush along the stone wall, leaving branches and tall grasses shivering and dripping in his wake. Droplets rained down on Victoria\u2019s hair and arms as she turned to follow, wishing she too had a hat.</p><p>She felt the heavy metal of her pistol and the warm sleekness of the obsidian shard in each of her pockets. The not wholly idle thought of which one would invoke the most long-lasting pain in the back of his broad shoulders entertained her as she strode after him.</p><p>She dropped the pistol back into the depths of her pocket, but did not release the shard. It felt good in her hand, solid. Weighty. She\u2019d never noticed how well it fit, how it seemed to mold into her palm. She\u2019d thought before what a good weapon it would be, but had never held it long enough to really notice its strength.</p><p>The stone warmed under her grip, and she pulled it out to admire its shiny black length. Wicked. Gleaming blue-black even in the low light of a dreary day, even in the shadows of the sprawling, unkempt gardens, it seemed to burn from within.</p><p>Her steps slowed as she examined it, fascinated by the shimmer and shine coming from within the opaque object.</p><p>A great weapon. Something strong sizzled along her arm from where she held it, up and along her shoulder, surprising her so that she almost dropped it.</p><p>Sudden crashing through the brush drew her attention away from the shard. She realized why Max had stomped off as he had, and she looked up as he came back into view. He was missing his hat, and his hair dripped dark and stringy in a face shadowed by a day\u2019s growth of beard. He looked annoyed.</p><p>No more annoyed than she felt.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d he began, and then saw what she was holding. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she interrupted him, stepping forward. \u201cYou\u2019re merely jealous,\u201d she said, stopping a short distance away, looking up into his sharp-planed face.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He stared down at her. \u201cYou think overmuch of yourself, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo woman would allow you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His laugh was short and contemptuous. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019ve never been one to practice celibacy, forced or otherwise. I\u2019m merely selective in choosing my...companions. You\u2019ve seen evidence of it yourself, so how can you doubt?\u201d Sudden as a snake, his hand shot out and closed around the wrist of her hand that held the shard.</p><p>Victoria laughed, a deep, odd sound to her ears. \u201cYou speak of the time I saw you and Sara leaving a room, all in dishabille. I wouldn\u2019t put it past you to have staged such a scene; you were so determined to run me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd showing you evidence of the affection I had for my fianc\u00e9e would have served to chase you away? If only it had been that simple.\u201d He squeezed her wrist, smashing the bones horribly against one another, and pain shot through her hand. \u201cDrop it, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffection for Sara Regalado? You couldn\u2019t have felt anything for her.\u201d Her fingers were weakening under his grip, becoming numb and cold. She tried to jerk her arm away, but he moved too quickly and caught at her wrist with both hands. He was strong, very strong. She had two vis bullae, and she struggled against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll break your arm if need be. Release it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do it, too,\u201d she spat, anger blazing through her.</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d He tightened his grip, his face, his tall body much too close to hers, his eyes dark and intense, his mouth determined. \u201cLet it go, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>With a groan she allowed her screaming fingers to open, and the heavy shard tumbled from her hand. It thunked to the ground, landing next to her foot, and before she could reach down to pick it up, Max kicked it out of her reach.</p><p>Still holding her wrist, he drew her back up to look at him, grasping her other shoulder so he could glare down into her face. He gave her a little shake, his fingers so tight she could feel them through the heavy wool coat as they bit into her skin.</p><p>Though she had dropped the shard, her hand still felt its warmth, and a faint tingle still sputtered along her arm and through her body. She looked up into his eyes, and again she knew just what to say to goad him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me now?\u201d she asked boldly. He released her with a little shove that pushed her a step back into the branch of a tree, sending a little scatter of drops down the back of her coat\u2019s collar.</p><p>\u201cI prefer not to be one in a long line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Max?\u201d</p><p>Then he smiled. It wasn\u2019t a nice smile at all, but it matched the same unpleasant feeling that was skittering through her. \u201cSo you want me to kiss you, do you, Victoria?\u201d</p><p>His expression made her want to take a step back, but she stood firm. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The warmth from the shard had eased from her hand, and her fingers felt cold. He moved closer, and she felt the brush of ivy leaves that clung to the wall behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not...indeed.\u201d</p><p>As he loomed over her, powerful and tall and so close, Victoria\u2019s heart began to pound as if it were trying to burst from her ribs. Her lungs were so tight in her chest it seemed she could barely draw in a breath, but when she did she brought in the smell of Max\u2014his damp wool coat, the faint smell of wine, and whatever it was that made him who he was.</p><p>She felt the brush of the stones behind her, her fingers pushing back into the wall as if to help keep her steady.</p><p>Then, hands planted on either side of her head, far enough away that they didn\u2019t touch her, he bent forward, his dark head filling all of her sight before her eyes closed and his lips covered hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max kissed like he did everything else: with arrogance, grace, and consummate skill.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the least bit tentative.

If she\u2019d ever thought of his lips as stubborn or harsh, that thought was eliminated as their mouths fit together, drew apart, and parted in a sleek, choreographed motion, again and again, until it was all one smooth, slick spiral, curling down into the pit of her belly and beyond.</p><p>Her fingers were digging into the wet, dirty wall, and she let her trembling knees relax enough so she could sag gently back against it to keep her balance. Even so, there was still space between them; she sensed the warmth of his nearness in the chill afternoon, but touched nothing but his mouth matching and meeting hers.</p><p>When he at last pulled away with a long, gentle nibble at the corner of her lower lip, his nose brushing her cheek, she let her head tip back and felt the wetness of the leaves seep into her hair. Max shifted, his breath warm against her temple as he bent toward her again.</p><p>\u201cNow that your curiosity is assuaged,\u201d he murmured, \u201ccan we get on with our task?\u201d</p> <p>And with that he pushed away from the wall, away from her, and, presenting her with his back, crouched to pick up the forgotten shard. He had it up and quickly in his pocket before Victoria had quite caught her breath or thought to demand the splinter back.</p><p>Her fingers trembled and her knees were wobbly, but she propelled herself away from the wall before he stood\u2014or turned to see the dazed look on her face.</p><p>But she needn\u2019t have worried; he barely glanced at her before making that sharp Max gesture that told her to follow him. \u201cWe\u2019ve wasted enough time. It\u2019s getting close to sunset,\u201d he tossed over his shoulder as he started off again along the stone wall.</p><p>The same stone wall of which there were now little bits of mortar wedged beneath her fingernails.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>In Which Lady Melly\u2019s Courtship Takes on a New Twist</p> <p>The Conte Regalado, or Alberto, as he\u2019d insisted she call him, was the most charming man Lady Melisande Grantworth had had the pleasure to meet. Or be courted by.</p><p>And she was indeed being courted by the bald but dapper Italian count.The first time she\u2019d met him, when he had found her and Winnie and Nilly in the depths of that spooky old villa, he\u2019d been gallant and gracious\u2014and even though he hadn\u2019t actually taken them to find the treasure and had disappeared most inexplicably, he\u2019d still been intriguing and kind.</p><p>And well turned. Indeed, perfectly groomed, with his small, trimmed black mustache and the briefest of beards. His clothing was expensive and fashionable, he wasn\u2019t too tall, and best of all, he had a lovely accent.</p><p>Then, of course, there was the day following the treasure hunt at the Villa Palombara, when, instead of calling on her, he\u2019d only sent flowers...that had had her sniffing in disdain. The men in London had done the same; even Jellington had thought to woo her interests by plying her with flowers and jewels and the like.</p><p>But Lady Melly desired much more than cold fripperies and greenery that would die after a day or two in a vase. She wanted companionship, and wit, and above all, a man who worshiped her.</p><p>\u201cHe should be here any moment.\u201d Nilly squealed, her pale face flushed with excitement. She was peering out the window of Melly\u2019s dressing room from between lacy curtains, watching the street below for a sign of the conte\u2019s barouche as her friend was putting the final touches on her toilette.</p><p>\u201cI cannot imagine where he is going to take you on such a horrific afternoon. Why, there isn\u2019t a sunbeam to be seen, and the air is positively gray with rain,\u201d Winnie said disdainfully from her chair in the corner. \u201cYour hair will be droopy, and those bonnet feathers! They\u2019ll be plastered to your head before you climb into his carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Conte Regalado offered to drive me to see the Colosseum, and perhaps to Janiculum Hill. I am certain, though we might be a bit chilly, that we shan\u2019t be wet at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe conte? I thought you were to call him Alberrrrto.\u201d Winnie sniffed, but a smile hovered about her lips.</p><p>\u201cAlberto, then.\u201d But Melly smiled at the mirror, admiring her dimples as well as the slight pink to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Winnie hauled herself to her feet and lumbered to the window. \u201cIndeed, he is, dressed as though he were going to the theater. Well, I hope you shall return before supper tonight so that we can hear all of the details before bedtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Melly, flouncing toward the door as if she were once again a young debutante, \u201chope I don\u2019t.\u201d She paused to look back at them. \u201cAfter all, I am a widow, we aren\u2019t in London, and he is...very handsome. Perhaps we shall take an extended drive.\u201d</p><p>Nilly squealed again, but this time with disappointment. \u201cDon\u2019t frighten him away, Melly!\u201d</p><p>Winnie laughed. \u201cThe poor man hasn\u2019t a chance with our Melly on his trail,\u201d she said fondly, watching her oldest and dearest friend sweep down the stairs with more energy than she herself had ever possessed. \u201cI only hope this turns out better than the last matchmaking she did\u2014with Victoria and Rockley.\u201d</p><p>Nilly nodded. \u201cBut of course it will.\u201d</p><p>The two ladies were beginning to make their way down the stairs to the parlor when Victoria\u2019s maid\u2014the one with the unfortunate bushy orange hair\u2014appeared.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, madam. Your Grace,\u201d she said, bobbing a curtsy.</p><p>Startled that she should have spoken to them, the two women swiveled their heads in unison.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d asked Winnie in her duchess voice, pausing on the stairs, one hand clutching the handrail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019 mean to interrupt,\u201d said the maid with a bit less deference than Winnie would have expected. \u201cBut...did ye say that Lady Melly was going with a conte?\u201d Regalado\u2019s title came out sounding like \u201ccon-tayy,\u201d but Winnie knew what the bold-faced girl meant.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again the imperious duchess tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear...the Conte Reg\u2019lado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Winnie was becoming impatient. \u201cIf you have something to say, spit it out. I cannot stand here all the day long. It\u2019s nearly time for tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...Your Grace...Lady Melly is in grave danger.\u201d The maid\u2019s eyes were sparkling blue, and her round cheeks were flushed pink.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d Nilly spoke at last in a soft little sort of gasp.</p><p>\u201cThe Contay Reg\u2019lado...why, we must help my lady!\u201d As if suddenly galvanized into action, she whirled, starting down the hall in the opposite direction.</p><p>Lady Winnie\u2019s imperative voice stopped her. \u201cYoung miss, I daresay you\u2019d best not run off without telling us exactly of what you\u2019re speaking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeggin\u2019 yer pardon, Your Grace, but milady\u2019s in great danger, an\u2019 we have to help her,\u201d she said over her shoulder, then opened the door to Victoria\u2019s bedchamber and dressing room. She disappeared inside, disregarding the other women.</p><p>\u201cDanger? From what?\u201d Winnie didn\u2019t want to believe the little maid, but when she came back out of Victoria\u2019s bedchamber holding something that looked like a wooden stake, her heart nearly stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d asked Nilly faintly.</p><p>The maid was slipping on a large silver cross. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 vampire huntin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Zavier waited in the heavy afternoon drizzle, a hat he would normally disdain tipped low over his face to keep the rain from getting in his eyes. The chankin and wet didn\u2019t bother him at all; growing up in the Highlands, he\u2019d had enough of it so that he\u2019d become immune. The hat, something with a curling brim a London numpty would wear to protect his sensitive skin, served another purpose altogether: to keep his face from being seen.He wasn\u2019t certain how long he\u2019d have to wait. Despite the miserable weather, his worst discomfort came from the memories that plagued him, since he had nothing to do but think about things as he stood there, tucked into a nook between two narrow plastered buildings.</p><p>The carnage was bad enough...the image of Mansur sprawled on the brown grass, drenched in his dark blood, made Zavier\u2019s own blood churn and his stomach swish as though he were drunk from too much whiskey.</p><p>A waste. A fagging bloody waste.</p><p>And a betrayal.</p><p>Victoria wasn\u2019t seeing clearly. She couldn\u2019t be. She wasn\u2019t weak like that, and Zavier wasn\u2019t about to watch her tumble further. Aye, she\u2019d hurt him; he could accept that, though it still burned his gut. But he couldn\u2019t accept that it had been with the arse-dicht Vioget. The boughin\u2019 bastard who couldn\u2019t dirty his hands enough to fight with his kin. Unbelievably, apparently, he was a Gardella too, from somewhere back in the ages of his family. They all were.</p><p>How could he have turned his back on them?</p><p>The arse-dicht and Victoria had been locked away for too long in the same small chamber where Vioget had been held during the battle outside Santo Quirinus. They\u2019d been in there so long it made Zavier\u2019s fingers tighten into one another, his short, blunt nails creasing his leathery palms.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about the boseying that was going on in there. But he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>It made his head spin as if he were rubbered.</p><p>So he took himself outside and waited in the rain, and hoped for it to help make him a bit steadier.</p><p>But the anger built inside, simmered, sometimes roaring into his ears as he remembered the deaths last night, the intimacy and the expression he saw on her face when she was with Vioget. The Venator betrayer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe Wayren when she said he wasn\u2019t the cause of the attack. How else could it have happened?</p><p>It was well nigh onto noon when Zavier sighted his quarry. He waited until he walked past, head foolishly bent against the rain so that he didn\u2019t notice when Zavier slipped from the corner of a building to follow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fool.</p><p>Perhaps it was best that he\u2019d stayed away from the Venators if he was that careless.</p><p>Zavier stayed in the distance behind him, considering his options. He knew little about Vioget, but what he did know was enough to identify the influence behind the bastard and his defection: the legendary Beauregard.</p> <p>Zavier\u2019s hand searched the depths of his pocket, fumbling for the stake there. It was just about time that the vampire met his own damnation. He\u2019d be pleased to help him. And whoever else dared get in his way.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the key?\u201d Max asked as Victoria approached. Her skirts were drenched to her knees and so were her shoes. She should have found a pair of boots to wear before leaving the Consilium, but it was too late now.They had reached the stone wall on which the Door of Alchemy stood, after traipsing quickly through the tangled gardens with Max in the lead. He\u2019d seemed to be in a great hurry to get here, and Victoria, who couldn\u2019t quite tell where the sun was because of the clouds, didn\u2019t argue. She was still more than a bit unsteady from the kiss they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Although shared wasn\u2019t exactly the word to describe the experience. Received, perhaps. Became immersed in. Was surprised by. Nearly lost her balance because of.</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her attention back to the matter at hand, realizing he\u2019d asked a second time. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d She had to shrug out of her heavy man\u2019s coat in order to get to the armband, which was pushed up under the long sleeve of her simple gown.</p> <p>Max watched as she pulled off the wide silver armband and then bent it at the small hinge that divided its two halves. When the bracelet opened, the key was there on the inside of the cuff, fitted into a small nook.</p><p>Victoria thumbed it out and handed it to Max, who kept looking darkly at the sky. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry,\u201d he said, taking the tablike key and pushing the scrubby bushes away from the door.</p><p>He knelt as Victoria had done a week ago, when she\u2019d come with Ylito and Wayren, and scratched away the moss and dirt so that the small metal tab would fit into its place.</p><p>As he worked Victoria examined the other two keyholes\u2014one had been filled before, and the other she hadn\u2019t seen until now. She could see only the back edges of the flat little keys\u2014for once slipped into the narrow openings, the thin metal rectangles fit into place and couldn\u2019t be removed until the door was opened.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Max pulled to his feet and glanced at her. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>He grasped the round stone disk in the center of the door and began to turn it. When the circle actually moved in a clockwise direction, Victoria found herself holding her breath. She couldn\u2019t quite believe the door would actually open.</p> <p>There was a dull clunk, and Max glanced at her with a sharp nod. And then the door rolled to the side.</p><p>To her surprise he stepped back and let her enter first. Doing so, Victoria walked directly into a screen of cobwebs. Hiding an automatic shudder as she pushed away the stickiness, she brushed furiously at her arms and hair to make certain none of the spiders were crawling on her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of spiders?\u201d Max said, amusement coloring his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid...Ugh!\u201d She barely held back a shriek as one danced across her hand and she whipped it to the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. They\u2019re like little vampires, sucking blood, and they have too many legs.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d cleaned herself off she stepped completely through the door and stood inside a dark chamber that smelled of age and damp. But she needn\u2019t have feared, for just at the edge of the doorway was a sconce. Below it was a small tin kettle and a little table with flint and a coil of very old thread to start a flame.</p><p>There was oil in the kettle, she presumed, and she lifted it off its hook, pouring it onto the dry, brittle sconce. Max stepped in to help light a small piece of tinder, and only moments after the door was opened they had a blazing torch.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s close the door,\u201d she said. The back of her neck wasn\u2019t chilled, but it was best to take no chances. She had no idea how long they would be here.</p><p>The stone door rumbled back into its place, and Max said, \u201cBring the light here. I think we can remove the keys from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>She did, angling it over his shoulder as he bent toward the inside of the middle of the door. A few quick movements, the dull scrape of stone on stone, followed by a small grunt, and he produced the little silver key they had just slipped into its place on the outside of the door.</p><p>\u201cClever...so that one cannot get locked inside,\u201d he said. She held the light and he removed the other two keys\u2014one in gold and one in bronze\u2014and slipped them into his pocket.</p><p>Then he stood and they were facing each other in the small circle of light dancing around the dusty chamber.</p><p>\u201cLet me have the shard,\u201d she said, resisting the urge to step away even as her lungs constricted.</p><p>\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t you learn anything from last time?\u201d</p><p>Victoria bristled, drawing herself back to argue, but he reached out, captured her left wrist, and said, \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hand, palm up, and brought it into the light. When she uncurled her fingers Victoria saw with a shock that the inside of her hand\u2014the one that had held the shard\u2014and her fingers were marked faintly with blue.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said, handing him the sconce and opening her other hand to compare. When she saw that the bluish cast on the skin that had gripped the shard was no trick of the low light, she tried to rub it away.</p><p>\u201cWhen the obelisk touches flesh for any length of time, its power begins to seep in, leaving such a mark. If you\u2019re lucky it may fade in time.\u201d He looked at her, his dark eyes flat and hard. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it directly again. Or who knows whom you\u2019ll beg to kiss the next time.\u201d</p><p>And he turned away, taking the sconce with him, leaving Victoria with burning cheeks and a flood of annoyance...and embarrassment. Beg?</p><p>Beg?</p><p>But he\u2019d wanted to. She\u2019d seen it in his eyes.</p><p>Giving her head a little shake, Victoria turned around to look at the chamber for the first time and saw now that it wasn\u2019t a small chamber at all. The room was quite large and had been set up as a well-equipped laboratory. The single torch that Max held did little to light the room, but when Victoria saw another sconce on the wall she moved to light that one, and its illumination showed more details: long tables, five or six stools of varying height and condition, utensils, and scatterings of metal shavings and curds. There were shallow wooden bowls, deep metal ones, round and softly triangular, large and small. Goblets, corked jars, tiny carved boxes were all littered about, covered with dust, and some of them with dark stains. Larger chunks of silver, bronze, copper, iron, quartz, and marble were piled on the tables or littered on the floor, which was filthy with dust, dirt, and most definitely animal droppings.</p><p>She walked along one of the tables flanking the wall, quickly examining the remains of Marchese Palombara\u2019s alchemical experiments for whatever it was the undead\u2014and others\u2014wanted so badly. But there was nothing that caught her eye, nothing that looked important enough to be notes or journals about the mysterious pilgrim\u2019s work.</p><p>As she turned to look at another of the worktables, her wet slippered foot knocked against something on the floor. It made a soft metal clink, and she would have disregarded it as just another piece of scrap metal if it hadn\u2019t rolled in front of her, spinning in smaller circles until it spiraled to a halt. Victoria bent to pick it up, the hair on the back of her arms lifting.</p><p>She\u2019d seen this...something like this before.</p><p>It was a band\u2014similar to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s plain silver armband that had held the silver key\u2014but this was made of copper, and it was more distinctive. While Aunt Eustacia\u2019s ornament had been solid silver, as wide as three fingers, this band was made of three tendrils of copper, each perhaps the width of a finger and woven into a solid band. A smooth, elliptical shape had been formed where the ends of the three copper strands merged together, as if they\u2019d been melted down and pressed flat. A symbol was etched into it.</p><p>One she\u2019d seen before. Somewhere.</p><p>\u201cAh. And here we find our friend the Marchese Palombara,\u201d Max commented from across the room, drawing Victoria\u2019s attention.</p><p>Slipping the bracelet into her pocket, she walked over to find him standing above a skeleton, still dressed in the rotting clothes of two hundred forty years earlier. \u201cIs that what we\u2019ve come for?\u201d she asked, noticing the yellow, curling packet of papers clutched by two bony hands. \u201cI see nothing else that could be of interest to vampires and mortals alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suspect.\u201d Max bent forward, the lantern casting long, eerie shadows over the gray bones of the long-dead marchese. When he touched the skeletal arm it fell away, bone and fabric crumbling to dust in the same way an undead disintegrated when staked. And yet...not.</p><p>He lifted the papers gingerly, taking care to keep them intact, and handed them to Victoria. They were sewn together by a leather cord, and, when she gently lifted the top page, she found faded ink writing, mathematical equations, and diagrams and sketches.</p><p>\u201cYlito will be overjoyed to see this,\u201d she commented with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. So, now that we\u2019ve retrieved what we came for, shall we get it safely back to the Consilium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you planning to take the obelisk shard with you?\u201d she asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. While you were gawking about the room like a girl at court, I\u2019ve already placed it over there.\u201d</p><p>She looked and saw a small trunk in a dark corner. With a withering glance at him, she walked over and lifted the lid, still carrying the sheaf of papers. Inside the trunk was the shard of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d Max\u2019s voice behind her was soft and...she could only describe it as menacing.</p><p>\u201cYou of all people ought to understand duty,\u201d she replied coolly, looking at him. \u201cI needed to make certain that the evil that I brought upon the Consilium has been contained. I needed to see for myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave a short nod, and when he replied there was satisfaction in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve begun to learn, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>She started to turn away and noticed that his dark shirt, which was cravatless, had gaped away from his throat. \u201cThose are new bites.\u201d</p><p>His hand jerked slightly, as though he\u2019d begun to raise it to close his collar and stopped himself in time. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas Sara right? Did you go to Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do such a foolish thing?\u201d</p><p>He spun away as if to start to the door, and she reached out and grabbed his arm. Hard. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>His muscles flexing under her fingers, he turned back, his expression flat except for furious eyes. \u201cYes, I went to Lilith. Yes, she left me with yet more marks of her possession.\u201d This last word came out with rank bitterness. \u201cWhy it can make any difference to you, or to our current task, is not clear to me. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlone? With her? Surrounded by all her guards? Max, she could have killed you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let it go; she couldn\u2019t drop the subject. How could he risk himself that way?</p><p>What would have happened if he\u2019d not come back?</p><p>Or...worse? Dear God.</p><p>At her rapid questions he paused and looked down at her. Now his eyes were bleak. \u201cYou understand nothing of her, do you? Victoria, if I were to give you one last piece of advice, it would be this: Find out who Lilith is, or she will beat you as she has beaten so many others before.\u201d He pulled firmly away and started toward the massive stone door.</p><p>Victoria followed, anger still spiking through her. He was so high-handed, so reticent. So cold and removed. Why did he still act that way, treat her like a naive girl, after all they\u2019d accomplished together?</p><p>He had the door open before she reached him, and the pale gray that came through the crack was ominous in its dimness. The sun was nearly down, and Max was right\u2014they needed to get the papers safely back to the Consilium before Akvan or his followers realized they\u2019d come and gone from the very chamber the demon had been trying to gain access to.</p> <p>Just as she was about to walk through the door, where Max waited on the other side, Victoria remembered the leather cord in her pocket, and its small splinter of obsidian. Although she had considered keeping it as a potential way to draw Akvan out of his lair, after what Max had shown her in regard to its power, she realized it would be foolhardy to take that chance.</p><p>No one could say she didn\u2019t learn from her mistakes. Even Max.</p><p>But when she reached into the small breast pocket of her man\u2019s coat, it was empty. Empty! The cord had fallen out somehow...sometime since she\u2019d left the Consilium.</p><p>It had to have been, she realized, when she removed her coat just outside the Door of Alchemy in order to take off Aunt Eustacia\u2019s armband. The necklace must have fallen on the ground then, when she slung the coat over her arm and worked the bracelet down from her upper arm. It had to be on the ground outside.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Max, at the door, sounded impatient as usual.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but instead, with one last look about the laboratory, she slipped out through the narrow opening. It was going to be difficult to find in the lowering light, but they would have to try. She couldn\u2019t leave it for someone else to stumble upon. \u201cMax, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d he hissed suddenly, coming to attention.</p><p>She would have heard it too if she hadn\u2019t been focused on the loss of the little splinter: a crashing in the brush very nearby. Coming vaguely from the direction of the villa, it was loud enough to portend either a cluster of newcomers, or a very large, very careless person.</p> <p>And then Victoria heard voices. Shrill voices, raised much too loudly in argument.</p><p>Her entire body went cold and then rigid.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t because there was a vampire sending a chill over the back of her neck; indeed, there weren\u2019t any undead in the near vicinity.</p><p>No, this was much worse.</p><p>Max\u2019s face changed from one of arrested expectation to one of confusion. If Victoria hadn\u2019t been so disconcerted, she might have found it amusing. As it was, she started toward the noise just as something\u2014someone\u2014blundered through a pair of overgrown bushes spreading over an old path.</p><p>\u201c...daresay, you should have stayed home, Nilly! That little stick\u2014Oh!\u201d Lady Winifred, the Duchess of Farnham, shambled to a halt so quickly that her companion plowed into her from behind, sending her curls and jowls jouncing. The reticule-size silver cross around her neck bounced into the air, then thunked heavily onto the duchess\u2019s bosom. \u201cVictoria, what on earth\u2014Oh! Oh, my!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d squeaked Lady Nilly, peering from behind the duchess\u2019s broad shoulder.</p><p>Victoria had stepped toward them, followed by Max\u2014whose dark look had been the catalyst for their choked gasps.</p><p>\u201cStand back,\u201d Lady Winnie said fiercely, brandishing an unwieldy wooden pike the length of her forearm and thick as her wrist. She aimed the pointed end at Max. \u201cHas he hurt you, Victoria? One further step, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he bite you?\u201d asked Lady Nilly, her voice breathless and her eyes so wide that white appeared all around her irises. \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d Victoria asked, gently taking the duchess\u2019s wrist and lowering the ridiculous stake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hunting vampires,\u201d replied Lady Winnie in a stage whisper, still eyeing Max balefully. \u201cYou poor dear. I don\u2019t mean to frighten you, but I\u2019m certain that man is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a vampire,\u201d Victoria told her, trying to keep her lips from twitching. A quick glance at Max told her he was not finding the situation amusing in the least. \u201cAlthough I can understand the mistake.\u201d</p><p>The sound he made could only have been described as a growl. \u201cVictoria, it\u2019s nearly dark,\u201d he said, warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Duchess Winnie,\u201d she said, using her pet name for the woman, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly there was more crashing in the bushes\u2014although, to give her a bit of credit, it wasn\u2019t quite so ferocious as that from before\u2014and a puff of orange hair appeared, followed by the flushed-cheeked face of Verbena.</p><p>\u201cBeggin\u2019 yer pardon, my lady,\u201d she said to Victoria, giving a brief curtsy. \u201cI tried t\u2019keep \u2019em from doin\u2019 it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Winnie sniffed. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for her, we would be back sipping tea and preparing for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\u201d Max thundered.</p><p>Lady Nilly squeaked, her eyes popping again. Lady Winnie drew herself up bravely, but scuttled back a few steps as she closed her fingers around the crucifix, brandishing it like a talisman.</p><p>\u201cA bit on th\u2019 huffy side,\u201d Verbena said to Victoria, casting a glance at Max. She must have seen the impatience in her mistress\u2019s own expression, for she hurried on. \u201cLady Melly\u2019s been taken off by th\u2019 Conte Regalado. \u2019E\u2019s been courtin\u2019 her, milady, an\u2019 I didn\u2019t know until t\u2019day when I heard \u2019em talkin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegalado has my mother?\u201d Cold fear rushed through her, and her mouth dried. No, was her first thought. No. Not again. Not like Phillip...</p><p>Verbena nodded vigorously. \u201cAn\u2019 the ladies there\u2014they d\u2019cided t\u2019 come wit\u2019 me when I come \u2019ere to see to \u2019er.\u201d Now she produced her own stake, which, again to her credit, was much more of a comfortable size. And it looked a bit familiar, with its pink sequins and the remnant of a white feather still attached to the blunt end.</p><p>\u201cWhen did they leave? How long have they been gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2019more than two hours,\u201d Verbena replied earnestly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d take \u2019er for a drive. Th\u2019 ladies \u2019ere thought he\u2019d bring \u2019er h\u2019ere, if he was gonna\u2014y\u2019see\u2014hurt \u2019er, and since they\u2019d been here for that party, they insisted on coming wi\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother, in the clutches of Regalado. The thought made Victoria\u2019s insides churn like a sea storm.</p><p>She focused her sharp mind, pushed away the worry that threatened to turn her senses frantic.</p><p>Were they at the villa? If so, it was a blessing that she was already here herself...but there were any number of places he could have taken her. Victoria realized Max was looking at her, that he\u2019d stepped closer, almost as if to offer assistance. He\u2019d help her comb through the villa, go with her to delve down into the underground lair of Akvan and search for her mother.</p><p>Victoria looked directly at him, her veins singing and her mind working furiously, and pushed the numbing worry back. She could fret later. It was getting darker by the moment. She made her decision in that instant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take that back to...back,\u201d she finished firmly, looking at the bundle of papers he still had. \u201cI\u2019ll see to my mother.\u201d</p><p>He looked as though he might argue, but it was only for a moment. Then he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get this safely to Wayren,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake them with you,\u201d Victoria added, gesturing to the ladies, feeling the brittleness in her movements. \u201cI don\u2019t need them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t leavin\u2019 ye alone, milady,\u201d Verbena said, stepping toward her.</p><p>\u201cI daresay, you cannot think to order me about,\u201d said Lady Winnie, looking down her humped nose at Victoria. \u201cMelly could be in danger! I shall not rest until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d Victoria snapped to attention as the rush of a chill moved over the back of her neck. She and Max exchanged glances; he felt it too. \u201cGo,\u201d she told him, gesturing toward the rear of the estate grounds, where the darkness seemed to be growing even faster. He would go out the way he and Victoria had come in.</p><p>With a last, steady look, followed by a sharp nod, he disappeared soundlessly into the overgrowth, leaving Victoria with three ill-prepared would-be vampire hunters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seventeen</p><p>Wherein the Merits of Italian Desserts Are Discussed After an Eventful Evening</p><p>Pulling the stake out of her pocket, Victoria edged along the wall in the direction of the villa.</p> <p>The chill on the back of her neck wasn\u2019t alarming in its intensity; she guessed there were no more than three undead in the vicinity. Whether one of them was Regalado, with Lady Melly, she would soon find out. She prayed, firmly keeping her thoughts from worrying that one of them was...and terrified that it wouldn\u2019t be.Stake gripped comfortably, she slipped between some sort of prickly bush and the old stone wall, peering around its corner. The light had grown very dim, so she could see little more than shapes of blue and black and gray. But then she noticed a faint red glow in the distance: vampire eyes.</p><p>They disappeared. Either the creature had turned away or was now hiding. In either case, Victoria was not about to let the undead get away. She moved quickly and as quietly as the sagging branches and soggy grass would allow, peering into the darkness and wishing, once again, that one of the Venator powers was night vision.</p><p>A woman screamed in the distance\u2014or tried to, before it was quickly muffled\u2014and that set Victoria off more rapidly and carelessly through the brush. It didn\u2019t sound like Melly...but, then again, Victoria had heard her mother scream only once, when a mouse had the audacity to scamper across her dressing room table.</p><p>She moved toward the sounds of struggles ahead, refusing to let herself contemplate what she might\u2014or might not\u2014find.</p><p>One step at a time. One battle at a time.</p> <p>She ran along the side of the sprawling villa, between it and the tall enclosing wall that ran around the entire estate, toward the front, along overgrown paths and beneath unpruned trees. More screams and shouts from beyond gave her a burst of speed, and when she came near the front of the building, Victoria nearly ran into a bench that had been hidden in the lengthening shadows.</p><p>Swerving just in time to avoid cracking her leg against it, she paused, breathing heavily, and saw the cluster of moving shadows ahead. They were anonymous; she couldn\u2019t tell if one of the struggling figures was her mother. She could see six of them: three pairs of red eyes\u2014pure red, none of them the pink of Guardians or the magenta of Imperials, fortunately\u2014and the three pale, frightened faces of their victims, thrashing about as they were dragged toward the front entrance of the villa as if they\u2019d just arrived.</p><p>Victoria burst from the darkness and rushed one of the red-eyed vampires. The undead looked up in surprise, then delight, then shock as she saw the stake in Victoria\u2019s hand. The female undead released her victim and roared forward, blocking the stake\u2019s downward stroke with her forearm and grasping Victoria\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Cursing herself for getting stopped by such an unoriginal move, Victoria lobbed the stake to her free hand, jerked forcefully with her other, and yanked the vampire toward her as she reached around to stab the undead\u2019s heart through the back.</p><p>The vampire poofed, blasting dust over Victoria\u2019s arm, and she spun slickly in the mud to face the others. Her foot slipped, but she caught herself in time to duck a blow from a male undead and again swiveled around to come at her target from behind, slamming the stake into the center of his back.</p><p>Just as he disintegrated into dust, the third vampire released his victim, shoving the sobbing woman to the side so hard that she tumbled to the ground. He faced Victoria, and she saw that he had a large, broken branch in his hand. With a mighty swipe he flung it whistling through the air, and it slammed into her shoulder hard enough to send her staggering back.</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t down, and Victoria caught herself against a wet, prickly bush just as Verbena and Lady Winnie burst onto the scene. What came next happened so rapidly that Victoria wasn\u2019t certain exactly how the events unfolded...but the next thing she knew, her target was blocked by the wide skirts covering the behind of the Duchess of Farnham...there was a sudden shriek of pain from the vampire...a flurry of activity, a splash, and then...suddenly...the satisfying poof! of the undead imploding into dust and ash.</p><p>And then there was nothing but the quiet sobbing of the woman\u2014who, horribly, wasn\u2019t Lady Melly\u2014and the gasping of breaths from the other would-be victims, a man and a second woman, who, from the looks of their clothing, were returning from an evening out.</p><p>Victoria stalked over to the scene of the last vampire\u2019s death and found Lady Winnie clutching the hand-size cross to her pillowlike bosom. \u201cI...he...\u201d She wheezed, her little pig eyes goggling like shiny marbles.</p><p>\u201cI tol\u2019 ye, ye got to stab \u2019em in the heart, not the eye!\u201d Verbena was lecturing the duchess, hands on her hips, chin raised high in the air. \u201cWas a good thin\u2019 \u2019e saw your cross an\u2019 I had the chance t\u2019 throw this on \u2019im!\u201d She produced a small bottle Victoria knew had held holy water.</p><p>A convenient substance, of course, and one that Victoria tended to forget to take with her more often than not, unless her maid reminded her of it.</p><p>\u201cNow you must go,\u201d Victoria said firmly. \u201cI have to find Lady Melly if she\u2019s here, and you can finish your good deeds\u201d\u2014she looked reproachfully at Verbena\u2014\u201cand help these poor people get home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cannot stay here alone,\u201d Lady Winnie argued. She had regained control of her breathing and, along with it, her stubbornness. \u201cIt\u2019s much too dangerous! And although it really isn\u2019t difficult at all to stake the monsters, I cannot in good conscience leave you here alone.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s annoyance was growing by the moment, along with the rising frantic need to get away from the babbling women and search for her mother.</p> <p>She wished for her aunt Eustacia\u2019s special golden disk, which helped to remove unwanted memories from people who shouldn\u2019t have them\u2014such as would-be vampire hunters or near victims of the undead. Such an item would have come in handy now, although it would have taken time that she didn\u2019t have.</p><p>No time. She had no time to waste.</p><p>\u201cYou must go,\u201d Victoria insisted, much more harshly than she\u2019d ever spoken to the ladies. \u201cTake these people and go before you get hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d Winnie sounded perfectly righteous and angry. \u201cHow dare you speak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare because I must!\u201d A blaze of frustration, fear, and anger blew through her, and she rounded on the plump duchess, her entire mind focused on where her mother was and what Regalado was doing to her. The back of her neck was no longer cold\u2014which meant nothing good, in her mind, for that meant there were no vampires in the vicinity\u2014so Regalado was either not at the villa, or was so deeply inside it that she couldn\u2019t sense his presence.</p><p>Victoria started to tell her again that they had to leave, when she suddenly realized Lady Nilly wasn\u2019t there. Anywhere. She whirled away from the slack-jawed duchess, scanning the area and seeing nothing of the stick-figured Lady Petronilla.</p><p>\u201cLady Nilly!\u201d she said, streaking back into the darkness. Her neck wasn\u2019t cold, so she couldn\u2019t be...</p><p>Lady Winnie and Verbena crashed along behind Victoria, sounding like an entire coach and four tearing through a forest. Victoria was thankful she didn\u2019t have to go far, for several yards into the brush back toward the Door of Alchemy she found Lady Nilly walking toward her. The older woman was glowing, thin and pale, like a moon in the darkness, for by now the air was charcoal gray decorated with black shadows everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNilly!\u201d shrieked Winnie, barreling past Victoria, stake in hand. \u201cHow dare you frighten us like that!\u201d</p><p>But there was something wrong. Victoria\u2019s hands went cold as she came closer to Nilly and saw the dark streaks on her neck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been bitten,\u201d Verbena exclaimed before Victoria had a chance to say anything.</p><p>Nilly\u2019s eyes were wide and glassy, and a faint smile curved her mouth. Her hair, which was normally kept in a strictly smooth bun at the back of her crown, with two precise curls hanging from her temples, was loose and full and falling about her shoulders and past them.</p><p>\u201cNilly!\u201d Before Victoria could get to her, Lady Winnie took her friend by the arms and gave her a rough shake, and to the relief of everyone, Lady Nilly\u2019s eyes fluttered.</p><p>Her lips parted, lifted at the corners, and she sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Winnie,\u201d she added, reaching for her friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Victoria said sharply. A mortal couldn\u2019t be turned to a vampire that quickly...as far as she knew. The vampire had to drain most of the victim\u2019s blood, and then offer their tainted blood for the victim to drink to replace the loss of her own. And then the victim would fall into unconsciousness and awaken as an undead. Clearly not enough time had elapsed for that to have occurred with Lady Nilly.</p><p>Nevertheless, Victoria was taking no chances. And before she could speak, Verbena had already pulled out another vial of holy water. If, when she poured it on Lady Nilly\u2019s flesh, she screamed in agony, Victoria knew it was too late for her mother\u2019s friend.</p><p>Her mother. Dear God.</p><p>Victoria snatched the holy water from Verbena and splashed it over the older woman\u2019s wounded neck. She shrieked in surprise and indignance, but not in pain. Not in pain.</p><p>Thank Heaven.</p><p>\u201cTake her home. Now.\u201d She looked at Verbena and then at Lady Winnie, and they both seemed to realize there would be no arguing. \u201cIs Oliver here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told \u2019im t\u2019wait in th\u2019 carriage,\u201d Verbena replied as they started walking back toward the house. \u201cHe wanted to come wi\u2019us, but I told him someone had to wait there\u2014\u2019 specially if we \u2019ad to leave quick.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately Victoria\u2019s neck still wasn\u2019t cold when they approached the front of the deserted villa. The three others she\u2019d rescued from the vampires were huddled against the gate, backed into a corner. One of the women gasped as Victoria and her companions came into view, but Victoria ignored her.</p><p>\u201cThe gate\u2019s locked,\u201d said Verbena, stopping there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMove.\u201d Victoria realized she\u2019d begun to sound like Max, with her blunt, terse commands\u2014ironic, but she had no time for gentle manners. She got to the gate, saw the metal lock that had obviously been secured after her mother\u2019s companions had come through, and she started to pull on it.</p><p>That was when she heard the sound of an approaching carriage, and at the same moment her neck chilled.</p><p>Victoria froze for an instant; then with a jerk of her hand she sent the others scuttling into the shadows. Maybe...just maybe...</p> <p>She adjusted the grip on her stake, eased herself into the darkness, and waited.</p><p>The carriage rumbled to a halt in front of the gates, bringing with it the faintest bit of light from its lantern, filtering through the iron bars. Victoria\u2019s heart began to pump harder. It was possible.</p><p>Her fingers tightened, her breath quickened, and she waited.</p><p>The sound of someone alighting from the barouche\u2014a woman, she was certain, based on the faint rustle and swish\u2014spiked Victoria\u2019s hope. If it was her mother, and she was still...</p><p>A titter, a coy one that Victoria would never have attributed to Lady Melly, tinkled over the night air, and a surge of relief swept over her. Odd as it sounded, it was definitely her mother.</p> <p>The metal lock clinked at the gate, and Victoria eased flatter against the damp wall, realizing suddenly that her toes were like tiny pieces of ice inside her soggy slippers...but she didn\u2019t care. Her mother was here.</p><p>Only a moment more...</p><p>The chain fell away and the gates swung open. Lady Melly came into view, her arm slipped through the elbow crook of none other than the Conte Regalado, she looking like a fresh young woman strolling along with her beau, he with his bare head shining in the dim light.</p><p>Before Victoria could make a move, something\u2014someone\u2014pushed past her in a froth of skirts and lace and with an unwieldy stake.</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d pronounced Lady Winnie, as though she were a patroness at Almack\u2019s, refusing to let a debutante dance a third dance with the same man.</p><p>Regalado turned to the duchess, his even white teeth suddenly gleaming in a charming smile. \u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t your friend, my dear Melly. Have you come to join us?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother had given him permission to call her by her Christian name? Already?</p><p>Victoria gave herself a little shake of the head at the absurdity of her thought; perhaps it was the sense of relief that her mother was alive and well that had sent her mind scuttling to such a thing. Well, they were no longer in London, and they certainly had other things to concern themselves with besides the codes of propriety.</p><p>\u201cWinnie! My heavens! What on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, my dear, we had a bit of a fright, \u2019tis all,\u201d replied the duchess in a calm voice. She surreptitiously tucked the stake behind her skirts.</p><p>Victoria saw no reason to wait for them to politely discuss the situation, as they were wont to, so she stepped out of the shadows. When Regalado saw her, the menacing edge to his smile slipped.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Conte,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice was understandably shrill and horrified. \u201cWhat is the meaning of all this?\u201d</p><p>Victoria had no choice but to ignore her, although she knew she would pay for it later. Her ears began to ring in preparation. Unless she could get Wayren to use Aunt Eustacia\u2019s golden disk, what she was about to say and do would shock her mother far more than her unexpected\u2014and unladylike\u2014appearance.</p> <p>But brevity was necessary, for she had neither the wish nor the patience to spend several minutes churning through an explanation and its unavoidable discussion. \u201cRegalado, because you\u2019ve managed to keep your fangs off my mother thus far, and obviously she\u2019s had a lovely evening in your company, I\u2019ll allow you a choice: Release her, or I\u2019ll turn you into a pile of dust.\u201d</p><p>Regalado nearly leaped from Melly\u2019s side in his haste to comply. \u201cOf course, my dear. Of course. I meant no harm. Your mother is a charming and handsome woman, I must say. I meant no harm a\u2019tall.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s eyes narrowed. That was a bit too easy. But...her neck was still only a bit chilled\u2014just enough to account for Regalado\u2019s presence\u2014and she didn\u2019t smell the horrible, dank death-smell of any demons. Perhaps the man was just the same repulsive, superficial coward he\u2019d been before being turned into a vampire.</p><p>Apparently, though the soul became mutated and malevolent in its undead form, the personality attached to it didn\u2019t undergo any great change.</p><p>\u201cVictoria, how dare you,\u201d said Lady Melly, grabbing at Regalado\u2019s arm as if to pull it back into her possession. \u201cI do not know what has befallen you, but since you arrived here in Rome, you have been not at all yourself. I cannot begin to imagine what you think you are going to accomplish by interfering\u2014\u201d</p><p>As her mother continued to lecture, Victoria wished desperately for Aunt Eustacia\u2019s golden disk.</p><p>The irony of the situation was that many years ago, Lady Melly herself had been called to be a Venator. She had declined the task, opting instead to marry Victoria\u2019s father, and thus not only had her mind been wiped clean of information about vampires and Venators, but all of her innate skills and Venatorial powers had been passed on to her daughter.</p><p>Regalado himself, as creepy and slimy as he seemed, also appeared to be quite disconcerted by Lady Melly\u2019s leech-like propensity. He tried to extricate himself from the woman, all the while watching Victoria with trepidation.</p><p>It was, in the end, a blessing that two more vampires arrived at that very moment; for if things had continued as they\u2019d begun, Victoria wasn\u2019t at all certain how she would have pried her mother away from the most inappropriate of all candidates for a second husband.</p><p>But the appearance of two more undead\u2014apparently the coachman from Regalado\u2019s barouche and a female acting, ironically, as a chaperone, perhaps?\u2014set the next events in motion.</p><p>Unaware of the situation into which they\u2019d entered, the newcomers bared their fangs, let their eyes light up with a red glow, and dove into the melee. Moments later, after a flurry of lace and silk and damp feathers (from Lady Melly\u2019s bonnet, after she was shoved face-first into a bush), stakes of all sizes and efficacy, along with much poofing and grunting and thunking of bulky silver crosses, there were two piles of vampire dust, three would-be victims still cowering against the wall, an indignant widow being ushered off to Oliver and his carriage, and the flapping coattails of the Conte Regalado as he dashed up the front steps of the villa.</p><p>Victoria wasn\u2019t even breathing hard, but she was flush with satisfaction and a feeling of well-being. Verbena wore a smug smile, and somehow her mistress had a feeling that poor Oliver was never going to hear the end of the adventure, even though he\u2019d been relegated to stay in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for one moment,\u201d Victoria said to no one in particular, eyeing the door through which the conte had disappeared. If he thought she was going to let him live another day to court her mother, he was severely mistaken. \u201cKeep the carriage waiting.\u201d</p><p>She slipped away as the rest of them burrowed into the carriage, Lady Melly still screeching her outrage with her daughter and the world in general. She hadn\u2019t seen the dispatching of the vampires, for by the time she\u2019d extricated herself from that fortuitous bush, they were nothing but piles of dust.</p><p>Victoria intended to feed her mother\u2019s ignorance by utilizing the gold disk as soon as possible.</p><p>However, she had this one last thing to take care of.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard for her to find the conte. He was under the impression that she\u2019d allowed him to walk away a free undead, so he hadn\u2019t gone far into the villa and was peering through a side window at the ladies being helped into the carriage by Oliver.</p><p>\u201cCuriosity killed the cat,\u201d she said as he whirled. She slammed the stake into his chest and added, \u201cand the vampire too.\u201d His poof wasn\u2019t even especially large.</p><p>To ensure that they all returned home safely, Victoria crowded into the carriage with Lady Winnie, a pouting Lady Melly, and the dreamy-eyed Lady Nilly.</p><p>Two of the other near victims\u2014a Miss Anne Malloren and a Mrs. Stefania Faygan, both Americans\u2014clambered into the carriage as well. Their male companion elected to ride above with Verbena and Oliver, leaving Victoria crushed in the midst of skirts and the target of her mother\u2019s death-gaze.</p><p>There was nothing for it, however, and Victoria resigned herself to an uncomfortable\u2014yet oh, so relieved!\u2014ride back to the Gardella villa. Oliver had agreed to take the three others to their quarters, and until they left the carriage, at least, Victoria would be spared the lecture that was sure to come.</p><p>Instead she allowed herself to relax a bit, now that her neck was feeling normal and the carriage was moving at a rapid pace away from the horrible villa. As if unwilling to acknowledge the events of the evening, the ladies about her were chatting as if they were returning from a night at the theater. Victoria thought she heard the dark-haired Miss Malloren mention something about swimming with a shark...but that must have been a moment when her mind wandered and she\u2019d misunderstood. Surely no one would be so foolish!</p><p>Although...when one considered Victoria\u2019s own vocation, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so crazy.</p><p>The other woman, Mrs. Faygan, who was dressed in a lovely gown of rose, decorated with matching pink pearls, seemed to be quite enamored with the Italian pasta noodles she\u2019d become familiar with during their visit to Rome.</p><p>This launched the conversation into a direction quite distant from vampires and stakes and eerie villas...and the women began a heated discourse about the merits of cannoli versus English lemon biscuits.</p><p>Victoria faded in and out of the conversation, but it wasn\u2019t until they had delivered their three guests to their quarters that she realized what she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>The leather cord, with the splinter, was still lying somewhere in the gardens at Villa Palombara.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Wherein the Ruby Box Is Opened</p><p>Max stripped off his soaking clothes and slapped them over a wood-backed chair. His hair was still wet enough to plaster to his face and neck, but at least it wasn\u2019t dripping anymore, and at least it wasn\u2019t long enough to get in his eyes and mouth. He combed his fingers through the wet locks and slicked it back from his forehead and temples and over his ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Returning to the Consilium had taken longer than he planned. He had initially hoped to make the trip, then return to the villa in the event that Victoria needed his assistance to find her mother. But because he was carrying the alchemist\u2019s papers\u2014or whatever it was they were\u2014he\u2019d decided to take no chance of being followed or spied upon and took a much more circuitous route than he would have liked. By the time he\u2019d come dripping onto the marble floors of the Consilium, it was nearly midnight, and Wayren asked him not to go back out.As always, it was a request, not an order. But one he could not deny.</p><p>The time had come.</p><p>He avoided looking at the small ruby box that sat on a little table next to a small lamp. It was so small, yet it beckoned. Here in this sparse room in one of the far reaches of the catacombs that attached to the Consilium\u2014so distant and secret that no one but Wayren and Ilias, and perhaps Ylito, knew of its existence\u2014the small ruby box was the only bit of color.</p> <p>It mocked him. The life-altering box that he could no longer avoid.</p><p>The decision that was no longer his to make.</p><p>Had it ever been?</p><p>He pulled on the dry clothes Wayren had found for him, annoyed at the way they clung to his still-damp legs, hurrying because the subterranean room was chilly, and so was his skin. As he pulled on his shirt he looked down at the little silver vis bulla. The one that didn\u2019t really belong to him. Brushing his fingers over it, he touched the filigree cross, the impossibly dainty fingernail-size thing that hung there and gave him the power, the purpose, the exoneration he needed.</p><p>And then, with quick, nimble fingers, he slipped it out of the areola it pierced.</p> <p>Immediately the strength ebbed from him. It slipped away like a quilt whipped from over a sleeping body, so suddenly that at first his fingers trembled with the loss. The bullet wounds he\u2019d received only two nights ago, which had nearly healed, now pounded and throbbed deeply in his muscles, reminding him of what was to come. What his future would be.</p><p>Of course, he would remember none of this when he woke up.</p><p>He placed the vis on the little table next to a small lamp...and the mocking ruby box. And then, as if to counteract the blasphemous presence of Lilith\u2019s box, Max took his small leather satchel and pulled out the few items he\u2019d stored in it.</p><p>In the morning, or whenever it was he awakened, the box, the vis bulla, none of it would mean anything to him. The charred satin rose, the black stake with the inlaid silver cross on the blunt end, the small glass vial of holy water, the pearl earbobs, the gold watchcase...the items he placed on the table. None of them.</p><p>Max looked away, annoyed that he was feeling sorry for himself. He did what he had to do. There was no question. The day he\u2019d awakened after the tragedy into which he\u2019d brought his family was the day he promised himself in service. For the rest of his life.</p><p>And his life was not yet over.</p> <p>What would he do after this?</p><p>Max shrugged. The path would become clear. He had only to watch, and to follow it.</p><p>A knock on the door drew his attention, gratefully, from his self-pity. \u201cYes. Come.\u201d</p><p>Wayren entered, her gaze moving quickly over him, the items on the small table, the untouched bed. \u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d she asked, still standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Victoria?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes moved sharply over him, and she nodded. \u201cYes. She sent word by messenger bird, and asked whether you\u2019d returned as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelisande?\u201d</p><p>Wayren nodded again. \u201cAll are safe. Did you drink Ylito\u2019s decoction?\u201d</p> <p>Max nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. He claims it will ease your way\u2014although we don\u2019t know exactly what will happen, do we? He did study the salve, Max, to determine if there was a way to use it, or alter it somehow, so that you could sever your bond with Lilith but keep your Venator powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I would be no help in the destruction of Akvan, would I? No Venator or demon shall destroy him. And someone must.\u201d</p><p>Wayren chose to ignore his comment, replying, \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you awaken, so that I can remind you of your task.\u201d She came into the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>He resisted a disgusted snort and instead settled himself on the bed. She would remind him of the task he must set out to do\u2014to somehow annihilate Akvan, and to do it as a mortal man, a non-Venator. But what he might or might not remember and know of himself when he awakened was frightening to consider.</p><p>Wayren pulled the chair next to him and opened the small cachet box. The pomade\u2019s scent\u2014at once intriguing and horrific\u2014wafted into the room. To his great annoyance his stomach lurched when he realized that an undercurrent of the aroma was the same rose smell that always accompanied Lilith\u2019s presence.</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, wishing that there was another way. That he didn\u2019t have to make this choice, go through with this task, drink this cup...give up the life he\u2019d built for himself, the one he\u2019d managed to construct from the ashes of guilt and self-loathing.</p><p>She knew it, damn her. She knew this was the last thing he\u2019d ever want to do. Ever be willing to do.</p><p>By God, she knew him too well. And he, her.</p><p>He hoped Victoria would remember his advice about Lilith. That she would learn her enemy and find a way to keep herself distant from the malevolence, the conniving, so that she could remain untrapped.</p><p>A glint of brightness caught his attention, and he willingly trod out of the depths of anger and regret and back to the present, where Wayren was holding something in front of him.</p><p>He recognized the small golden disk that spun on a web-thin chain in front of him, the lamp having been placed at such an angle that the pendant appeared to glow and glitter. The memory of Eustacia was bittersweet...and appropriate.</p><p>Yet it was soothing to stare at it as Wayren murmured something in the back of her throat that was just as relaxing. He tried to force himself into ease, to let it go...and it wasn\u2019t as difficult as he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Cool, sure fingers smoothed over his neck and at the angle into his shoulder; the smell of roses became stronger, sickeningly stronger. He tried not to breathe too deeply, watching the golden disk, letting himself feel light.</p><p>Lighter than he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>But then it came to him: the ugly, evil tug, the insistent snakelike tendrils pulling at him, forcing, smothering....</p><p>She was there...her blue eyes rimmed with glowing bloodred...her hair a copper nimbus around her pale, blue-veined face. He could see the delicate markings on her cheek...the five marks that formed a crescent shape from temple to jaw...the pale lips...one warm, one chilled like death....</p><p>He fought it, fought to come out of it, just as he had before...tried to swim up from the deep pull of an ocean floor, an ocean of blue and glowing red, heavy and cloying, dragging him down.... Any moment now those lips of cold and warm would be on him...the smooth knife glide of sharp incisors into his flesh...her hands, chill and strong, over his skin\u2014</p><p>\u201cMax...Max!\u201d A voice penetrated his delirium. He tried to listen. \u201cMax...\u201d And then somehow, through the whirl of darkness and evil, he heard the throaty murmur, the calming chant. It sliced through the lowering darkness, the enveloping horror of memory, and he allowed himself to slide back into the bath of golden light and the gentle lapping of relaxation.</p><p>There was one more thing...one thing he had to know....</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d he managed to say, trying to focus, pulling his attention away from the gold gleam and instead to the sand-colored wall.</p><p>\u201cShe has returned...she\u2019s safe, Max. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, felt his head lighten, his eyelids grow heavy. \u201cTell her....\u201d He couldn\u2019t speak. The words were too heavy, but his lips, sluggish and slow, formed them silently.</p><p>The scent of roses, now warm on his neck, grew stronger, suddenly putrid.</p><p>And then he let go.</p><p>It was nearly three o\u2019clock that morning by the time Victoria extricated herself from her still-furious mother and her two twittering companions, not late at all by London Society standards, and certainly not unusual for Victoria herself. But because of everything that had occurred in the last few days, she felt utterly exhausted.She needed to go back to find the splinter she\u2019d dropped, but first Victoria wanted to change into warm, dry shoes and perhaps a split skirt. She\u2019d sent Verbena to bed, neglecting to tell her of her plans to go back to the villa. Oliver could drive her. She sat down on the stool in front of her dressing table and began to strip off her soaked stockings.</p><p>Last night had been the attack near the Consilium, the deaths of Mansur and Stanislaus, along with the horrible moment when Zavier found her and Sebastian...and the night before that she and Sebastian and Max had been locked in the cell at Villa Palombara.</p><p>If she\u2019d been bored and impatient a few weeks ago when she was without her vis bulla, now Victoria felt as though she\u2019d been plunged back into an uncontrollable whirlwind of battles. Not to mention how forcefully she was being reminded of the impossibility of keeping one side of her life separate\u2014and safe\u2014from the other.</p><p>It had been a near thing, her mother and Conte Regalado. The very thought made Victoria\u2019s stomach lurch and churn. She could not have borne it if she\u2019d lost a third person she loved to the vampires, especially one like her mother, who had no concept of the darkness and evil that pervaded their lives.</p><p>She had to find a better way to keep those two parts of her life safely apart. She had to keep her mother and her friends away from the vampires, and hide the fact that she was responsible for fighting them.</p><p>How had Aunt Eustacia managed? How had other Venators? Surely they all had had parents; some of them had siblings and other loved ones, either before or after they became Venators. How?</p><p>If Aunt Eustacia were there, she could ask her. It was something they\u2019d never really talked about, even when she\u2019d married Phillip. She knew Aunt Eustacia hadn\u2019t approved, but at the same time her aunt hadn\u2019t tried to convince her otherwise. Unlike Max, who\u2019d argued with her and warned her every step of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why hadn\u2019t her aunt stopped her? Was it because she wanted to give Victoria the chance to try to find love\u2014and happiness\u2014as difficult as it might be?</p><p>At least Aunt Eustacia had provided Victoria with a means to keep herself from getting with child.</p><p>But now she was gone too.</p> <p>To her chagrin Victoria\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and she felt the telltale sign of a dripping nose. She hated to cry. She was a Venator, and she\u2019d cried more in the last few days than she had the year after Phillip died.</p><p>Died?</p><p>No. Not died. She had to acknowledge the truth. It hadn\u2019t been an accident. And he hadn\u2019t simply died.</p><p>She\u2019d killed him.</p><p>She\u2019d killed him with her naivete, her selfishness, and her bravado. Her lies.</p> <p>Her lies.</p><p>And with her own hand.</p><p>A stake to the heart, as she\u2019d done so many other times before\u2014and since.</p><p>Blindly she reached for a handkerchief and wiped her nose, her cheeks, her chin. It was soaking when she pulled it away. In the dim light from the moon that shone through the villa window, Victoria could see her wet face reflected in the dressing table mirror. Her eyes were dark and shadowed, and her dark hair fell in horrible snarling curls around her face and neck. She looked like a Medusa. A hollow-cheeked, sad Medusa.</p><p>The only thing she had to be thankful for was that she\u2019d killed him before he\u2019d fed on a mortal\u2014thus before he\u2019d damned himself and his soul.</p><p>Suddenly, she became aware that the door of her bedchamber had swung silently open just a bit. Just wide enough for her to see a narrow, pale face glowing in the low light.</p> <p>\u201cLady Nilly?\u201d Victoria asked, hastily swiping the back of her hand over the last trails of tears.</p><p>The door opened enough for the slender woman to come in, silent and thin as a wraith in her lacy white night rail. A prickle began at the back of Victoria\u2019s neck...not a chill, but an apprehensive sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, coming to her feet, reaching automatically for one of her stakes, even though she knew...she knew Nilly was all right. But...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten...I have a message for you,\u201d said the older woman, her voice oddly hollow. Her eyes were wide and luminous in her long face, her fragile hand clasped to the fabric of her wrapper, her pale hair falling behind her narrow shoulders in a ghostly shadow.</p><p>\u201cFrom the one who bit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard. Master Beauregard,\u201d breathed Nilly, and Victoria saw a hint of fanaticism in her eyes. They lit like candles, her lips tipped up at the edges, and she seemed almost as if she were in a dream. \u201cMaster Beauregard...says...he has returned something that belongs to you...and that he expects you will return what you have...of his. Or...\u201d Nilly\u2019s voice faded. Her words launched Victoria to her feet, suddenly scrabbling through the pockets of her man\u2019s coat. Of course! At the mention of Beauregard\u2019s name it came back to her. She pulled out the copper armband, wondering how she could have forgotten where she\u2019d seen the etched insignia: on Sebastian\u2019s skin.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d not wanted to remember seeing that mark on him.</p><p>But it was there.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does he have of mine?\u201d Victoria asked as she turned back, just in time to see Lady Nilly slip silently to the floor.</p><p>She was at her side in an instant, feeling the older woman\u2019s neck on the unwounded side. Her heart was still thumping, and the odd, tense smile had faded from her lips. Reaching up onto her dressing table, Victoria fumbled for a little vial of smelling salts and pressed them under Lady Nilly\u2019s nose.</p><p>Almost immediately the woman stirred, coughed, and twisted her face away. Her eyes fluttered open. To Victoria\u2019s relief they were clear, and she seemed surprised to see Victoria.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, pushing herself into a seated position.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d Victoria asked, helping her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite all right. I don\u2019t know how I...\u201d Lady Nilly looked around in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you back to bed.\u201d Victoria did, and as they moved at a snail\u2019s pace down the hallway, she realized what Beauregard had that belonged to her.</p><p>The answer was not something she wanted to contemplate, but it was more than possible. It was likely.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d dropped the necklace near the Door of Alchemy, and Lady Nilly had been near the door when she was bitten.</p><p>But that meant that Beauregard had been there when she was fighting the other vampires near the front of the villa.</p><p>And he\u2019d left.</p><p>By the time she helped Nilly back into bed, she saw the faint tinge of gray in the east. The sun would be up in less than three hours, perhaps sooner. Beauregard had the necklace, so there was no need to go haring about the city tonight.</p><p>Tomorrow, in the daylight, she\u2019d take the copper armband to Wayren and Max and see what they thought. If copper rings were important to Lilith\u2019s Guardians, what would an armband mean?</p><p>She didn\u2019t consider showing it to Sebastian, Victoria realized as she began to drop off to sleep, clothed only in her shift and with cold, bare toes. She\u2019d shown and shared so much more with Sebastian...yet she wouldn\u2019t seek him out for help in relation to Beauregard.</p><p>Suddenly she was wide-awake again, staring out her window at the dark gray night.</p><p>Sebastian loved Beauregard. Last autumn he\u2019d asked her if, knowing how he felt about his grandfather, she\u2019d kill him in front of Sebastian. Victoria hadn\u2019t known the answer then...and she didn\u2019t know it now.</p><p>She knew that Beauregard was malevolent and selfish...but some of Sebastian\u2019s arguments had crept into her mind and sat there, mocking her. He couldn\u2019t bear to know that his grandfather, whom he\u2019d learned was a vampire only once he\u2019d grown to adulthood, would be damned to Hell for eternity with the well-placed strike of a stake.</p><p>Would Victoria hesitate to place that stake because of her feelings for Sebastian?</p><p>Her fingers had grown cold. Her feelings for Sebastian were nebulous and wispy, and she dared not contemplate them now...perhaps ever. But surely, surely...they weren\u2019t strong enough to keep her from doing her duty, should the moment arise?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Beauregard was an undead. He deserved to die, or at least to be turned into dust and sent to wherever he must live out eternity. It was Victoria\u2019s responsibility to rid the world of vampires whenever she had the opportunity.</p><p>Nothing would keep her from her task. Not even the golden angel named Sebastian.</p><p>Victoria must have dropped off to sleep at some point in the labyrinth of her thoughts and debates, for she dreamed of things: slow, sensual, curling, arousing things...dark, strong, metallic, angry things...loud, putrid, frightening things.</p><p>She woke, not because of the dreams, she realized belatedly, but because Verbena stood over her bed. Her hands were on her shoulders, as if she\u2019d been shaking her.</p><p>\u201cMy lady. My lady, you must awaken.\u201d</p><p>Victoria sat up abruptly, the last vestiges of the nightmares dissolving and clarity resuming in her mind. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Verbena handed her a small paper. It was tiny and rolled, as if it had come from the tiny container on a bird\u2019s leg. A quick glance at the window told Victoria that Myza wasn\u2019t there, waiting to bring a response back to Wayren. It was daylight, well past sunrise.</p><p>She unrolled the paper, her mouth dry. Come at once.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to change her damp, wrinkled clothes, just yanked on the man\u2019s coat she\u2019d worn the night before and left. It took Victoria less than thirty minutes to get to the Consilium. Oliver drove her in the carriage and let her off many blocks away, after ensuring that they hadn\u2019t been followed.</p><p>Crossing herself as she dashed onto and then off the altar inside Santo Quirinus, she hurried through the secret door of the confessional, leaped lightly past the rigged middle step in the hidden hall, and ran down the revealed spiral staircase.</p><p>Ilias was waiting for her near the fountain. His face was grave, the lines next to his mouth deep and cutting. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>She hurried behind him down a stone-cut corridor through which she\u2019d never had cause to go before. When he stopped in front of a door and gestured for her to precede him in, she did.</p><p>As she opened the door, Hannever looked up, gave her a brief nod, and moved his short, wiry body out of the chamber as if to leave her alone.</p><p>The room was small, but well lit and warm. A rug covered the floor; a bed lined one wall. Victoria\u2019s chest felt tight as she walked in, toward the unmoving figure that lay under the blankets. Harsh breathing filled the room, as if it were the last gasps of life coming from the man on the bed. Indeed, when she stepped closer and saw his face, smelled the blood, she knew that was exactly what it was.</p><p>The last gasps of life.</p><p>A small cry escaped from the back of her throat, and she reached out to touch him: his straggly, half-braided red hair, the brawny arm that lay crossed over his barrel chest.</p><p>\u201cZavier,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhat has befallen you?\u201d</p><p>A quiet movement behind her told Victoria she was no longer alone; whether Wayren had already been in the room when she\u2019d arrived or had just come in, she didn\u2019t know. \u201c\u2019Tis desperate he is,\u201d she said in her calm voice. \u201cYlito and Hannever have done all they can. We will know by tomorrow if he will stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr if we will be hanging another portrait in the gallery.\u201d Victoria\u2019s voice cracked. Not another. Not so soon. She lifted her face to look at Wayren. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went after Sebastian. And Beauregard.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s stomach dropped like a stone. \u201cNo.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Oh, God, yes, he would. She hadn\u2019t forgotten the look of betrayal on his face. The stunned hurt. The disbelief.</p><p>Was this another death that would be laid at her door?</p><p>Another that could have been prevented if she had made different choices?</p><p>Bloody hell, she\u2019d done nothing wrong! She\u2019d not brought Sebastian here. She\u2019d not betrayed them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do not know all that happened.... He was barely conscious when we found him. He said only the words \u2018Vioget\u2019 and \u2018Beauregard\u2019...the rest we have surmised. But\u201d\u2014she gestured to the patient\u2014\u201cas you can see, the evidence is there.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked again and saw that he\u2019d shifted, revealing tears in his flesh, ribboning through his neck and down beyond the blankets. It wasn\u2019t only fangs that had caused such destruction.</p><p>Whoever\u2014or whatever\u2014it was had meant to leave him near death...yet not dead.</p> <p>Enough that he would be found. But unable to be saved.</p><p>The thought plunged Victoria into burning fury. She stood, barely keeping her fingers from shaking, and made herself move slowly and deliberately...because if she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d explode.</p><p>She bent, placing her hands over Zavier\u2019s head, whispered a small prayer in his ear, a plea for him to forgive and to return...and then placed a gentle kiss on his cheek.</p><p>When she stood, Wayren\u2019s gaze caught hers, and Victoria knew the other woman understood.</p><p>She started toward the door and was out in the corridor, just entering the empty main chamber of the Consilium, before she heard Wayren behind her.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find Max,\u201d she said, pausing near the fountain, realizing that of anyone, Wayren would know where he was. She fingered the copper bracelet in her pocket. \u201cI\u2019m going to find Beauregard and kill him. I want him to go with me.\u201d</p><p>Victoria drew in a deep, calming breath, pushing away the fury and grief, reminding herself of Kritanu\u2019s admonishments never to let her emotions carry her away. \u201cI need Max. Do you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>Wayren\u2019s face did not change, but she reached out and gently grasped Victoria\u2019s arm. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s breath caught at the expression in her eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Victoria.\u201d</p> <p>Nineteen</p><p>Wherein Michalas\u2019s Other Wish Is Granted</p><p>Sebastian heard voices just in time to slip into one of the empty rooms\u2014at least, he hoped it was empty. It would be exceedingly difficult to explain why he was lurking in the catacombs of the Consilium, near the workshop of the dark-skinned man the Venators called a hermetist.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t quite certain he could satisfactorily excuse his presence even to himself.A little chill lifted the hair on his arm as he recognized Wayren\u2019s voice. He didn\u2019t want to be found, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to be found by her. Before yesterday\u2019s brief, unsatisfactory meeting, he hadn\u2019t seen her for years...but he remembered that she had a way of looking at him, at anyone, that gave the impression she could see right into their deepest hearts.</p><p>Not that Sebastian was ashamed of what was in his deepest heart. No, if nothing else, he had a loyalty to those he loved. Perhaps one that was inconvenient, or too strong at times, but it was all he had.</p><p>That and his good looks, which he was, of course, never shy about using to get his way.</p><p>As soon as Wayren walked past\u2014on her way out of the workshop, and quite fortuitously accompanied by the owner of said workshop\u2014Sebastian made a speedy, silent beeline to the closed door.</p><p>Holding his breath, he tapped the door open slightly, listening in both directions.</p> <p>Silence greeted him, so he pushed harder, making a large enough gap for him to ease through.</p><p>The papers should be here\u2014it was the logical place, and if Wayren was anything, she was logical. The hermetist\u2014Sebastian wished he could remember the man\u2019s name\u2014would be the one studying them, so it made sense.</p><p>The workshop was well organized: clean, neat, spare. A small pile of books rested on a slanted table, one of the tomes propped open with a curious metal object in the shape of an elongated S. Where were the journals from the villa\u2019s laboratory? Was he wrong in his assumption?</p><p>Then...he saw something that had to be it.</p><p>Thick brown papers, shiny, and coated with the thinnest possible layer of protective wax, bound together by a thin leather cord like a book.</p><p>Sebastian smoothed his fingers over it, then flipped quickly through the papers. He needed only the one page. Just one page, and it would hardly be missed. Especially since it had been locked away for nearly two hundred and fifty years.</p><p>But it could make all the difference to him. And Beauregard.</p><p>Ahhh.</p><p>This must be it.</p><p>He paused, quickly perusing the page. There was a drawing of an odd-looking plant\u2014a flower, really\u2014with a swath of petals that grew up and curled out like the inverted skirt of a woman, and a massive, upright stamen. Amorphophallus pusillum, read the faint script under it. And then a list of other ingredients, or so it appeared. Yes, this was most definitely it.</p><p>Carefully he tore the page from its leather moorings, trying to keep the wax cover from cracking, and taking care to make it as unnoticeable as possible. No one would see that a page was missing. Then he returned the journal to its position.</p><p>Slipping out of the laboratory as quickly as he\u2019d eased in, he began to hurry along the corridor. This was the trickiest part now, as he traveled back up to the area where he was more likely to come across Wayren or Ilias, or, God forbid, Victoria.</p><p>Once he thought he was caught, but he managed to duck into the dark corner of an intersecting corridor in time to keep from being seen. Good thing, too, for Victoria strode by in an angry swish\u2014he could almost feel the fury blasting from her. Fury and something else.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t see him, and she was gone in an instant.</p><p>With a relieved breath, he slid out of the darkness and followed her. For she was leaving the Consilium, and, now that he\u2019d retrieved what he came for, so was he.</p><p>By the time Victoria reached the fresh air of the street above the Consilium, she was out of breath. Her throat was tight. The need to vomit lingered in her belly. But damned if she was going to shed tears again.There\u2019d been too many.</p><p>Her last conversation with Wayren, having begun with an air of desperation and determination, had ended with Victoria stunned speechless with disbelief and grief, and then great fury.</p><p>Max too?</p><p>She was filled with such blazing anger\u2014at Beauregard, at Zavier, at Sebastian, and Max and even Wayren and Phillip and Aunt Eustacia\u2014such blinding and numbing emotions that she blundered out onto the street several blocks from Santo Quirinus, exiting from the entrance on Tilhin that she\u2019d used only once before. At first she didn\u2019t know where she was.</p><p>Only when she tripped over a broken step in front of the empty building she was skirting did Victoria gather herself together. She stopped and hugged herself under the coat she wore, blending into the shadows between two buildings to lean against the plaster wall...and mentally she pulled her thoughts, her scattering emotions, and her wayward instincts into line. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes and asked for guidance.</p><p>It was a while before she opened them, and she forced herself to focus. These were not the actions of Illa Gardella, this shattering of concentration, of instinct. She was glad no one had been there to see these moments of insecurity and loss.</p><p>She already knew what she had to do. And she\u2019d hoped, planned, for Max to come with her.</p><p>But Wayren had told her it was likely she\u2019d not see him again.</p><p>She explained that his memory of her, of them, along with his Venator powers, were gone. He\u2019d had to do it to free himself from Lilith, and he would slip into the rest of the world to live out the remainder of his life.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to see her.</p><p>Perhaps that was the biggest blow of all.</p><p>Victoria didn\u2019t understand why...and yet perhaps she did now, as she drew in long, steady breaths and focused her attention on the smattering of stars above her.</p><p>He was so proud. So arrogant and proud and confident that he didn\u2019t want her, or anyone\u2014she needn\u2019t take it all on herself\u2014he didn\u2019t want anyone to see him weak or confused.</p><p>In spite of her anger with him and his high-handed ways, she understood, after a fashion. For if she had to give up part of herself in that way, she, too would be lost.</p><p>Being a Venator had become the largest part of her. Perhaps the only part.</p><p>Victoria felt her mouth twist bitterly as she remembered how blithely she\u2019d attended balls and soirees, fending off suitors, flirting with Phillip, alternating her courtship with him and her nighttime adventures of staking vampires. Now being a Venator defined her. Almost wholly.</p><p>There was very little left of Victoria Gardella Grantworth, debutante miss, wife\u2014and now widow\u2014of the Marquess of Rockley.</p><p>If she had to give that up, who would she be?</p><p>So, yes, she understood.</p><p>Now, there in the cool evening, she understood and she wept and she grew angry and determined again.</p><p>She looked up when a shadow went by, hurrying along the street in front of her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice her, for she was backed into the shadows in the dark, but she saw him and recognized the smooth movements, the elegant stride. She knew the tousled, curling hair and the sweep of that well-tailored coat.</p><p>The nasty feeling swirled again in her belly, making the back of her throat dry and scratchy. He\u2019d come from the same direction as she\u2014from Via Tilhin, on which sat the abandoned building that gave access to the Consilium. So she hadn\u2019t been mistaken when she thought she saw a flash of movement in that deserted corridor.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence that he\u2019d been back there again. Not tonight.</p><p>Not after what had happened to Zavier and Lady Nilly. Not after what Beauregard had done.</p><p>Firming her lips, she followed.</p><p>The moment Max stirred Wayren put aside the delicate, curling manuscript she\u2019d been studying. She slipped it into her ancient leather bag, followed by her square spectacles, and waited.She didn\u2019t know how long it would be until Max woke, but since this was the first time he\u2019d so much as altered his breathing, she knew it wouldn\u2019t be long. She knew she had to be on hand when he became aware. The only thing that had taken her away was when Zavier\u2019s unconscious body had been brought to the Consilium hours ago, and then Victoria\u2019s subsequent arrival. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wayren wasn\u2019t given to sensitivity, but the recollection of Victoria\u2019s face when she\u2019d seen Zavier, the shock, anger, and fear that had passed over her beatific countenance, would long be in her memory.</p><p>Such anger.</p><p>It worried her.</p> <p>Max groaned softly, drawing her attention again. The golden disk lay on the table next to him, its chain coiled around it in serpentine fashion. He shifted again, becoming restless, his large hand rising as though to ward off something, then falling heavily onto the table, sending the lamp and the earbobs that had belonged to his sister jiggling.</p><p>Hoping to calm him, Wayren took his warm hand in her smaller ones, noticing scraped fingertips and cracked nails that looked as if he\u2019d tried to climb a stone wall.</p><p>She knew many things of past and future, of possibility and truth, of good and evil...but she did not know whether Ylito\u2019s plan would succeed. She wouldn\u2019t know until Max awakened, and she used the golden disk into which she had collected his memories.</p><p>As if she\u2019d called him to waken, his eyes fluttered open, suddenly clear and dark. He looked around. She released his hand, watching as he curled his fingers closed.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her, half sitting, the blankets falling to his hips. \u201cYes. Where am I?\u201d</p><p>The bites were gone, she saw. His neck was smooth and clean, sweeping gracefully into powerful, broad shoulders. But he recognized his own name, seemed comfortable with his body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Max. I\u2019m Wayren.\u201d She waited.</p><p>He nodded, but she knew he didn\u2019t remember. \u201cWayren. What am I doing here? Have I been ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion, yes. Please. Drink this and let me talk to you.\u201d She handed him a metal cup filled with another of Ylito\u2019s concoctions.</p><p>He hesitated, sniffed at it. Hesitated more.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cIf I wanted you dead, I had ample opportunity while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and drank.</p><p>When he looked back at her, she had the golden disk spinning eerily in her hand. She began to murmur again, calling down the power of the Spirit, asking for help, and watched as his eyes were drawn irrevocably to the flat pendant.</p><p>Wayren knew the moment he remembered it all...a tightening of the face, a tension in the shoulders, a return of the sharpness to his eyes. He reached for the tiny, delicate vis bulla. Closing his fingers around it, he picked it up, shuttering his eyes, and drew in a slow breath.</p><p>And then opened his eyes. They were bleak. \u201cNothing. I feel nothing.\u201d</p><p>Wayren nodded. \u201cBut you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He swung his feet off the bed. \u201cWhat time is it? I must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s midday. But you cannot go hurrying off, Max.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d half risen, but at her words he sat back heavily. \u201cOf course not. I\u2019m the shell of a Venator now. I have the knowledge and the skills, but not the strength or the powers. A shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not go alone.\u201d</p><p>His beautiful lips snarled. \u201cI may not be a Venator any longer, but I\u2019m not helpless. I killed vampires and at least one demon before I earned the vis bulla, Wayren. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you told me to tell Victoria, just before you went to sleep?\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his face blank. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring her here.\u201d</p><p>Wayren shook her head. He\u2019d made her promise not to let anyone see him\u2014anyone, especially Victoria. \u201cOnly Ylito.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say? Did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>She felt his tension; it was as if it hung in the air over them like a heavy blanket. She knew much, but now she knew even more. \u201cYou wanted me to tell her you were sorry.\u201d</p><p>Because they were bare, she could see the slight shift in his square shoulders, the bit of ease that came over him. \u201cI can only imagine how she received that bit of information.\u201d</p><p>Wayren couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. It wasn\u2019t amusing, not at all, not in these moments, not ever. But the look on his face...it was the Max she knew. Thank God. \u201cShe had a few choice words.\u201d</p><p>He stood again, energy simmering below his muscles so that she could feel his need to move, to do, to get out of there\u2014almost as if she were inside his skin. \u201cOne person to go with me,\u201d he said, reaching for the clothing that lay folded on a chair. \u201cWhite? It\u2019s too easily seen at night,\u201d he said, frowning at the shirt. \u201cIt glows. Zavier. I\u2019ll take Zavier with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriyani and Michalas will go with you.\u201d</p><p>He must have read the expression on her face, for he didn\u2019t pursue it. There would be time to tell him about it all later. But for now...\u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished dressing we will make our final plans\u2014not to worry, Max. You\u2019ll leave soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. I want this done and over with.\u201d</p><p>So that he could get on with his life. Get away and get on with life.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say it, but he didn\u2019t need to. She understood.</p><p>Max hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d missed the companionship of Briyani, who was not only the nephew of Kritanu, but also Max\u2019s own Comitator. Kritanu had trained both of them together, enhancing his nephew\u2019s fighting skills as he taught Max, eventually turning over the training to Briyani when he himself became older and less flexible.He\u2019d certainly not stinted in his training of Victoria, despite his age and proclaimed lack of flexibility, but Max didn\u2019t begrudge her that. It made sense that he should personally teach Eustacia\u2019s niece and the future Illa Gardella.</p><p>Having Briyani back with him reminded Max of those early years, when he\u2019d been much more of a loner and kept away from the Consilium while fighting his battles with the undead\u2014and within himself. Not quite thirty, Kritanu\u2019s nephew was a bit younger than Max, and had the same wiry build and wide-jawed, tea-colored face as his uncle. He wore his straight black hair in a single braid that reached to the middle of his back, and he was wickedly talented with a kadhara sword. Now, as the two of them crept along through the back of Villa Palombara\u2019s grounds, for Max\u2019s third time in the last four days, they needed no words to communicate.</p><p>Michalas brought up the rear. He was as silent as fog, and thin and tall and quick. Wayren had chosen well for the team, but it was all up to Max. He led the way through the brush and between the unpruned trees, hurrying with nary a glance past the wall against which he\u2019d kissed Victoria.</p><p>They reached the Door of Alchemy without incident, and with much dryer clothing and boots than last night. Max had the door open quickly and easily. When he was here with Victoria he\u2019d found the traces of an opening that led to the cell in which they\u2019d been imprisoned. Although he hadn\u2019t opened it, he decided it was the best way to gain unnoticed access to the place where Akvan lived.</p><p>Akvan. Thanks to Wayren\u2019s studies, and assistance from Ylito and Miro, Max felt as prepared as he could be.</p><p>\u201cThe trick with Akvan,\u201d Wayren had told him, \u201cis to remember his great weakness: He will always do the exact opposite of what he thinks you want him to do. Use this against him, and you will outsmart him.\u201d</p><p>Ylito had added, \u201cBut you must make certain that there are no remnants of the obelisk left. They must be destroyed in order for Akvan to be destroyed. Remember the prophecy.\u201d</p><p>The prophecy. \u201c...\u2019tis only a mortal man shall send him permanently to the bowels of Hell, using his own strength against him.\u201d</p><p>A mortal man.</p><p>Closing the Door of Alchemy behind them, Max and his companions worked quickly to locate the mechanism that opened the door to the cell. Either the marchese hadn\u2019t known about it\u2014which was absurd, since it was his laboratory\u2014or he hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to use it that night he\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>Briyani had excellent hearing and nimble fingers, and he was the one who located the lever behind one of the stones. Max was at his side in an instant, and they peered through the narrow opening and saw only darkness.</p><p>Michalas brought one of the sconces over, which illuminated the cell in which he, Victoria, and Sebastian had been imprisoned. And when he looked at the floor, he saw the same telltale splotches of melted gold spattered on the stones beneath his feet.</p><p>This had been the simplest part; now he had to move forward.</p><p>But before he did, Max slipped quickly back into the laboratory and retrieved the long shard from Akvan\u2019s Obelisk that Victoria had found. His hands were gloved for protection from its power, and he slid it into a hidden pocket Miro had sewn inside the leg of his trousers. When he lifted it, he saw the leather thong with a small splinter of the obelisk he\u2019d seen fall from Victoria\u2019s coat yesterday. He\u2019d placed it in there for safekeeping as well, but now he snatched it up and stuffed it in his pocket.</p><p>Max had had two reasons for accompanying Victoria when she came yesterday afternoon to open the Door of Alchemy. First, to confirm that there was a way into the villa, and second, to ensure that she left the shard there, for it was crucial to his plan for destroying Akvan.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, and led the way into the cell.</p><p>After testing to make certain they could reopen the door back into the laboratory\u2014the process of which wasn\u2019t at all instinctive\u2014they closed it behind them and made their way across the small cell.</p><p>Max had explained the first part of his plan to Briyani and Michalas, and so when they stepped out of the unlocked chamber into the corridor they paused for a moment. Max looked at Michalas, who shook his head that he didn\u2019t sense the nearby presence of any undead.</p><p>But as he took a few steps, Michalas tilted his head, closed his eyes, and pointed. Silent, they moved along the passageway in the direction he\u2019d indicated, Max taking the lead. As they approached a corner, he felt Michalas touch his sleeve. When he looked back, the Venator gave him a nod.</p><p>Max continued around the corner, filled with sudden anger. His neck felt the same\u2014no prickling or tingling to announce the presence of the undead that Michalas could sense as easily as taking a breath. It was true: His abilities were gone.</p><p>Lilith had succeeded in taking everything from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The vampire was there, probably meant to be guarding the hallway in which she stood, leaning nonchalantly against the wall. But when Max came into view she straightened, her eyes gleaming red with interest.</p><p>He remained relaxed. He\u2019d been bitten both before and after becoming a Venator...and he\u2019d slain undead both before and after as well. Still, it nagged at him that he\u2019d had to bring Briyani and Michalas as support. Doing so was smart and logical\u2014and by God if he hadn\u2019t told Victoria more than once that their duty was to do what was right, not what they wanted.</p><p>So, when he faced the vampire, he let her come toward him, let her grab at his shoulders, let her eyes attempt to enthrall him. She wasn\u2019t very powerful, which was not surprising, since Regalado\u2019s followers were young and inexperienced. Her breath was clean\u2014she\u2019d not fed recently\u2014which made it easier for him to entice her to bite his neck by tipping his head and baring it suggestively, pretending to be completely under her power.</p> <p>Perhaps the vampire guards were supposed to bring any potential victims to Akvan or Regalado, but since she hadn\u2019t fed, and since he\u2019d offered his flesh to her so openly, the female undead didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>Her fangs ripped into his neck with none of the easy, seductive slide of Lilith\u2019s, and Max jerked a little in surprise. Or perhaps it was because he was weaker now. Weak and lost. He was weak, and the world was dimming.</p><p>He fumbled for his stake, feeling the familiar weight in his hand, and pulled it out from under his coat as the blood pulsed from him. She sucked roughly, greedily, and if he didn\u2019t act soon he\u2019d lose consciousness or, worse, need to be saved by the others.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the most powerful thrust, nor the smoothest, but Max felt the echo of satisfaction slam through him as he staked the vampire, driving the ash pike into her back.</p><p>The world was spinning, and his neck ached and dripped, but he was still on his feet when he blinked back the darkness and found Briyani there, stake in hand, as if he\u2019d just come around the corner. Michalas was right behind, his stake at the ready as well.</p> <p>Max bristled at the concern in their faces, and he turned to start off somewhere\u2014in any direction, he didn\u2019t bloody care\u2014but Briyani stopped him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The gentleness in his voice and touch caused Max to tighten his jaw in annoyance, but Briyani was right.</p><p>The flush of salted holy water over the open wounds was a painful but necessary shock, and Max was glad his friend had acted. It would slow the bleeding and, once the initial pain had eased, would help to stop the wound\u2019s incessant throbbing.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Max said, ignoring the lingering pain, \u201cyou must go back and wait for me. It will do me no good if you are found, so hide as we discussed, and I will return. Or I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will attend you,\u201d said Briyani, his face determined. \u201cYou cannot go alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can and I will. That was our agreement.\u201d Max fixed his sharpest glare on him, willing him to understand.</p><p>Briyani\u2019s brilliant white teeth flashed in a humorless smile. \u201cYou agreed; I did not. Michalas and I have discussed it, and he will wait. I will come with you. Either with you or behind you\u2014but you can be certain I will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no child in leading strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am no dog to be ordered about.\u201d</p><p>As Max glowered at him, once again damning Lilith for driving him to this, and cursing Wayren for giving him back his bloody memories but nothing else, Michalas stepped forward. \u201cThey\u2019re coming. Now is not the time for arguments. I will be in the chamber as planned, and if you do not return in two hours I will search for you.\u201d He fixed bright blue eyes on Max and said, \u201cI fully intend to walk out of here alive, so you\u2019d best return, Pesaro.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the left, and then took off on silent feet in the opposite direction.</p><p>With a murderous glance at Briyani, Max stalked off down the hall Michalas had indicated. His fingers closed tightly into his palms, the stake still clutched in one hand, and he felt the tension all the way up his arms.</p><p>And then he forced himself to relax. There was a time when he would have easily accepted Briyani\u2019s presence, and now was an instance when he might need it more than ever. As much as it made him furious to admit that he was weak, the truth was that he was.</p> <p>He was no longer the man he\u2019d been.</p><p>Yet, when they came face-to-face with the cluster of four vampires, Max greeted them with great boldness and confidence, Briyani at his side.</p><p>\u201cI am Maximilian Pesaro,\u201d he announced, looking at the undead with all the haughtiness of the Venator he no longer was. \u201cTake me to Akvan.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Wherein Our Heroine Finds Herself in Yet Another Dark Tunnel</p><p>Victoria moved silently down the stairs, staying well out of Sebastian\u2019s sight as he descended into the cool cellar beneath a slender three-story house. The plaster-walled building that overlooked a small courtyard was unexpectedly familiar to her, for it was the same place he\u2019d imprisoned her last autumn when he and Max tried to keep her away from Nedas, the vampire who\u2019d planned to activate Akvan\u2019s Obelisk. Fortunately Sebastian\u2019s attempt had failed, and she\u2019d freed herself by climbing out a window, and had thus been able to witness not only the destruction of the obelisk, but also to slay Nedas.</p><p>Perhaps he\u2019d been staying here all along, all these months, and Victoria could have contacted Sebastian if she\u2019d been able to find this building again...but it was a moot point now.She was here, and vengeance was on her mind. Blood pounded in her temples and reverberated in her chest as she moved along, flush with the wall, gun and stake within easy reach. The back of her neck had been chilled for quite some time, and she guessed there were a good number of undead nearby, doubtless fawning at the feet of Beauregard.</p><p>The passageway was cold and dark and very narrow. It occurred to her as she stayed far behind Sebastian that she had spent an inordinate amount of time sneaking, running, or being chased through deep, dank tunnels since she\u2019d become a Venator. That was one of the hazards of hunting the undead, but it was becoming rather predictable. Stalking a vampire? Follow him underground. Searching for the undead? Look in a dark, damp cave. Seeking a potentially evil artifact? Follow a tunnel to find it.</p><p>These absurd thoughts served to distract Victoria and tame her urge to barrel ahead and confront Sebastian. If she showed herself, or was discovered too early, it would make things much more difficult. When outnumbered, as she surely was, Victoria preferred to have the element of surprise on her side.</p><p>It also occurred to her as she paused at a corner that, for as powerful a vampire as Beauregard was, his accommodations were rather primitive. She discovered close, dark corridors, rough walls, scattered stones underfoot, and more than one swath of clinging cobwebs that brushed her face and hair.</p><p>A rat scuttled near her foot; no, there were two of them; but Victoria didn\u2019t react even when she felt the brush of a small furry body against the hem of her skirt. Rats coexisted with Beauregard? She couldn\u2019t imagine Lilith\u2014or even Regalado\u2014putting up with such an affront.</p><p>But when she finally heard voices ahead and slunk her way along the dirty wall to peer around the last corner, Victoria had to revise her private thoughts. The wall that she came upon ended in a neat doorway that appeared to be covered by some kind of tapestry; it wafted back into place, indicating that Sebastian had just slipped through there. So she sneaked forward and pushed away just a corner of the cloth in order to peer in.</p><p>Beauregard\u2019s lair, instead of being simple and inelegant, was as nicely apportioned as Lady Winnie\u2019s parlor\u2014albeit a bit less lacy. Rugs covered the floor. Candles and lamps shimmered from sconces and tables and shoulder-height candelabra. The ceiling was surprisingly high, nearly as tall as men of Max\u2019s height. The furnishings included a harpsichord, and were of fine dark wood and plump brocaded upholstery. A large wooden door on the opposite side of the chamber told Victoria that Sebastian had led her to the hidden rear entrance to the room. Based on the size and strength of the other door\u2014not to mention the frigidness on the back of her neck\u2014she presumed Beauregard had friends located on the other side of that main entrance.</p><p>Inside the room two fair heads, one the color of wheat, the other more of a lion\u2019s-mane shade, but both with the same thick curls, were bent over a table examining what looked like a single piece of paper.</p><p>Victoria chose that moment to step fully into the room. \u201cIt appears that I have yet another grievance to air with you, Beauregard.\u201d</p><p>To her immense satisfaction, both of their heads snapped up in surprise. Sebastian\u2019s face wore a frozen, chagrined look, rather like the one he\u2019d had when she\u2019d found him in the Consilium. But Beauregard...after the initial shock evaporated, his was replaced by a sly, pleased expression that made the hair on Victoria\u2019s scalp lift.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, my dear, welcome to my humble abode.\u201d Beauregard made a sweeping gesture, inviting her in.</p><p>Victoria moved past the tapestry door, taking care to keep her back to the wall so there wouldn\u2019t be any nasty surprises creeping up behind her. She remained calm and focused, reining in the fury that vibrated through her muscles and veins. One step at a time.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s voice drew Victoria\u2019s attention to him. He was all too appealing in the flattering candlelight, with a boyish curl falling on his forehead and that guilty expression on his face. But before she could speak, Beauregard interrupted. \u201cI presume she found her way here the same way in which her paramour\u2014Zander, Zavier, what was his name?\u2014did. Surely he gave her the direction.\u201d He smiled, now looking directly at her. His eyes were still a normal shade of blue, and his fangs were out of sight, but Victoria was properly wary. \u201cOr perhaps you recalled your stay here last autumn, before all of that unpleasantness occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpleasantness?\u201d Victoria said, refusing to look at Sebastian. She couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted. \u201cI rather thought you welcomed the destruction of Nedas and the thwarting of his plan to activate Akvan\u2019s Obelisk. After all, it put you in a much greater position of power.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beauregard bowed his head in acquiescence. \u201cIndeed it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is a battle of wits, you shall find yourself overmatched. In fact, I rather think you might find yourself overmatched on all counts.\u201d She allowed him to see the stake in the hand at her side.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, if that is the case, let us get to business. I trust you\u2019re aware that I\u2019ve returned your possession, and thus you\u2019ve come to return that which is mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have your copper armband, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut you\u2019ve yet to return that which you took from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he not make his way back? I do hope Gardriel and Hugh weren\u2019t too rough with him.\u201d</p><p>He? Then, with a cool rush of understanding, she realized that Beauregard didn\u2019t have the splinter necklace she\u2019d lost, but that he\u2019d been referring to Zavier all along. Or what was left of him. What had happened to Zavier had been purposeful and malevolent violence meant to send her a message.</p><p>Her head pounded as anger surged anew, setting her fingers to trembling in her effort to keep from attacking now.</p><p>Victoria drew in a steady breath and glanced at Sebastian, who was watching them sharply. She had no illusions about which side he would take...and she was glad she had a gun.</p> <p>\u201cHe must have been in no condition to tell you how to find us then,\u201d Beauregard was saying. He\u2019d stepped from behind the table and moved casually toward her, the piece of paper they\u2019d been examining curling in his hand. \u201cSo you came upon us quite by accident.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s attention was caught, no doubt as he\u2019d intended, by the piece of parchment he gently wafted against his leg. It reminded her of the journal Max had taken from the laboratory at Villa Palombara.</p><p>The journal that had been taken back to the Consilium.</p><p>Her attention flew to Sebastian, and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cLet me see that paper.\u201d</p><p>The alacrity with which Beauregard proffered it to her confirmed her suspicions before she even glanced at it, but she did take a moment to examine the single page. Then she looked back at Sebastian. \u201cA coward and a thief.\u201d</p> <p>He met her gaze boldly, and for that she had to give him credit. But that was all.</p><p>\u201cIt was a necessity, Victoria. A matter of life and death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, and your excuses,\u201d she said, the darkness of anger closing in on the edges of her vision. She\u2019d actually begun to trust him, to believe in him. To let him close. \u201cDamn you, and your grandfather too, Sebastian Vioget.\u201d She turned to Beauregard. \u201cAnd you nearly killed Zavier\u2014merely to turn my attention away, so you could send your grandson to do your dirty work.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard smiled at her. \u201cBy the devil, you\u2019re quick, my dear. Quick to understand, quick to judge, quick to blame. And quite appetizing when you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>She raised her stake, flying across the room at him, no longer willing to restrain herself.</p><p>\u201cVictoria, no!\u201d Sebastian leaped between them, and her stake slammed into his shoulder. It was much more difficult driving it into mortal flesh than a vampire\u2019s heart; she felt the unpleasant give as it pierced skin and muscle. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, gasping in surprise, his fingers closing over her arm to propel her away. \u201cHe wants\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away,\u201d she said. He grunted as she pulled out the stake. Blood colored its tip and seeped quickly through his shirt, an unfamiliar sight. There wasn\u2019t supposed to be blood.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t let that stop her now. She pushed at Sebastian with all of her strength, sending him stumbling backward as he reached again for her.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria, don\u2019t,\u201d he said again, coming toward her, the bloodstain blossoming on his shirt. \u201cHe wants to fight you. He wants to come between us.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him, empty and angry and determined. \u201cEither get out of my sight or you\u2019ll go with him. I\u2019m through with your games and lies.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Beauregard, who was watching them with a half smile and a glint in his gaze. \u201cDo you really want him gone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you forget, I am already dead these last six hundred years.\u201d He lifted his hand in a nonchalant gesture, his eyes turning pink. \u201cBegone, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He moved like a large cat. He carried no weapon, nothing but himself, and stood solidly between them.</p><p>Victoria looked at him, scanning his pale face, the determined look in his eyes, the dark patch spreading beneath his left collarbone, seeing that his breathing was faster than it should be. Still handsome as sin, still appealing, still able to tug at her because of all they\u2019d shared. Thank God he wasn\u2019t a vampire with the strength of the thrall behind him too. \u201cYou stole from us. You betrayed us, Sebastian. I don\u2019t...want...to...see...you.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard had moved away toward the wall behind his desk as Victoria and Sebastian faced each other. She heard a faint, low sound in the distance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve chosen, Sebastian,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou made your final choice when you did this\u2014sneaking in while we worried over Zavier, while Max was\u2014\u201d She stopped herself. \u201cIt was your choice. Now get out of my way so I can finish this.\u201d</p><p>The large door burst open and four massive vampires\u2014three men and a woman\u2014surged in. Victoria spun to face them, her heart knocking suddenly harder and faster. The stake was in her hand, but it would be a tough battle. She crouched, ready.</p><p>Sebastian had turned too, also taking a defensive stance, but he kept talking to her. \u201cVictoria, the armban\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words gasped away as the first of the undead slammed a fist into his gut, and a second came from the other side and threw him to the floor as he spun to defend himself. Instinctively Victoria raised her stake, but a strong hand grasped it from behind, holding her wrist aloft, sliding an arm around her waist, and squeezing her so that her breath was caught. She struggled, kicking backward, watching Sebastian rise to his feet, only to be knocked back down by a boot to the jaw. On a normal man the blow would have cracked the bone. Another vampire dragged him back to his feet, and Sebastian managed a well-placed punch, but he had no weapon with which to stop them.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted him out of the way,\u201d Beauregard said in her ear.</p><p>Victoria slammed her head back and felt it crash into Beauregard\u2019s nose, at the same time trying to twist away from his strong grip. But he held on tightly and slipped his other hand around the front of her throat, pulling her back against him.</p><p>The hand tightened, cutting off her air, sending her struggling in his arms, stomping her foot down, slamming back with her free hand to jab her elbow into him, kicking, trying to breathe....</p><p>And then suddenly she was released with such force that she stumbled against a chair; then her hand clashed onto the keys of the harpsichord. She turned in time to see the door close, leaving the room silent but for the last echoes of discordant notes.</p><p>Silent, but not empty.</p><p>Her neck was cold; her fingers were trembling. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done for you?\u201d she said in a shaking voice that she abhorred.</p><p>Beauregard, who bent to pick up the paper she\u2019d dropped, placed it on the table and looked at her. \u201cIs it not what you expected from me? No loyalty? Manipulation? Where do you think Sebastian learned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill him. He\u2019s worth too much to you.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard looked horrified. \u201cKill him? Of course not. I merely assisted him in complying with your wishes. You should be grateful, for now we can converse without his interference. Now, shall we get to business? You were going to kill me. Or attempt to.\u201d He looked pointedly at the stake that had fallen from her hand and rolled across the floor. \u201cBut I think that will have to wait. You have something of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have something of mine.\u201d She would play his game for the moment. Until she had the chance to cut the bastard\u2019s head off.</p><p>\u201cIt was only one page,\u201d he said, lifting the paper from the desk. \u201cAnd you mustn\u2019t blame Sebastian. The man would do anything for me\u2014loyalty is his great flaw, much as I\u2019ve tried to teach him otherwise. But I\u2019m all he has, and he just cannot abide the thought of me burning in the fires of Hell for all eternity.\u201d Beauregard gave a genteel shudder. \u201cIt\u2019s not a particularly pleasant thought to me either. And so when at last the door to Palombara\u2019s laboratory was reopened, I was understandably interested in obtaining not only my missing armband, but also this particular page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, will you tell me what is so important about that page?\u201d Victoria kept her tone easy, unconcerned, even as she divided her attention between the details of the room, any potential weapons, and the undead himself.</p><p>His eyes were pink when they looked at her, and she turned her gaze firmly away.</p><p>\u201cI think you can guess, if you put your mind to it.\u201d His voice was soft and seductive, and she felt the tendrils of his thrall reach out gently and brush over her skin as if he\u2019d actually touched her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plant. It must have something to do with your immortality...or your destroyed soul, if Sebastian was willing to help,\u201d Victoria replied. She heard her voice as though it were in a tunnel, far away and hollow, and she blinked and took a step. Her fogged ears cleared, and she felt steadier.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t forget the image of blood soaking Sebastian\u2019s shirt. Blood she\u2019d drawn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very useful flower,\u201d Beauregard told her, \u201cto the undead, in particular, and, if one believes the work of the alchemist pilgrim who came to Palombara, to mortals as well. But it grows rarely only once or twice per century. I needed the page to identify it, for this year is a year it\u2019s expected to bloom. And with your aunt\u2019s death, I knew the key to the workshop would be more readily available.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou must appreciate my brilliance. It was my intent all the while to divert your attention to Akvan as he and his worthless followers tried to find the keys. I made sure he knew about the journals and about the keys, and I even made certain the key Palombara had kept\u2014which I, of course, had stolen from him that last night\u2014was found by one of Akvan\u2019s servants. I knew once the door was opened I could retrieve my armband\u2014one way or the other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria kept her gaze far away from him and his pink eyes. She moved so that the desk remained between them and she was a good distance away. She wasn\u2019t frightened; she\u2019d been in worse situations before, much more overmatched. But if he called for help again, as he\u2019d obviously done when he moved behind his desk earlier, she would find herself in the same situation as Sebastian.</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted Sebastian to steal the key, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He inclined his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d actually had the key in his possession until much later, when you described it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you allowed me to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe refused to steal it, if that is what you\u2019re asking. But it didn\u2019t matter to me\u2014once you got the door open I could get what I needed. Except that you and that bloody Pesaro were too quick and he went off with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you actually thought that by mutilating and nearly killing one of my men that you would get what you wanted from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, are you not?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t like his smile. Didn\u2019t like the way she suddenly remembered his mouth covering hers, sucking the warm flow of blood from her lip.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would come to avenge your friend. Your fellow warrior. What else would you do?\u201d he said, his voice alluring and coaxing, as if he were trying to lull her. \u201cYou are a Venator.\u201d</p><p>What else would you do?</p><p>It was as if he\u2019d read her mind and her private thoughts earlier. She was a Venator\u2014only, wholly, and without reservation. Of course she would come to avenge the death\u2014or near death\u2014of one of her own.</p><p>What else would she do?</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI want my armband.\u201d He\u2019d moved closer to her, and she tensed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it with me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. His fangs were long and sharp and brushed his lower lip. His silvery-blond hair curled becomingly about his handsome face, and his pink eyes gleamed. \u201cOf course you do. I can sense it.\u201d</p><p>She dodged and spun away, scooping her lost stake off the floor. \u201cCome and get it.\u201d She bared her teeth and crouched, waiting. She\u2019d finish him now.</p><p>He looked at her, then turned back to the desk, his back toward her.</p><p>And that challenge, that careless dismissal, was her ultimate undoing.</p><p>Victoria, bold and angry, ready to end the standoff, launched herself at him, stake outthrust in her hand, poised to drive it into his chest. He turned, caught her wrist, and with a snapping movement used her momentum to jerk it behind her, slamming her body full-force into his.</p><p>He looked down at her with burning eyes, and she closed hers, turning her face away, tilting her head back, and then bashing her forehead into his chin before trying to spin away.</p> <p>He was strong, and she barely pulled free of his grip, but he was after her in an instant, grabbing at the hem of her man\u2019s coat and hauling her back. She pulled, twisting, and its three buttons burst off, scattering to the floor. For a moment she was trapped, the sleeves capturing her hands behind her as Beauregard pulled the coat off. But she shrugged quickly out, spinning away, leaving the length of coat in his hands, and managing to keep the stake in hers.</p><p>The sudden release sent her stumbling, but she righted herself quickly and turned back around, stake ready, pulling the crucifix she wore from beneath her bodice so that it hung in plain sight.</p><p>He flinched when he saw her pendant, cowering back, and she jumped toward him, the blood racing through her body with the thrill of the fight. But he managed to dodge at the last minute and avoid the stake. It slammed into his shoulder in the same place she\u2019d struck Sebastian, easily and harmlessly. Pain jarred her arm as the stake went through and into the stone floor, but Victoria recovered, finding comfort in the weight of the cross thumping freely on her bosom.</p><p>As they faced each other, the desk between them again, she realized with a start that he still held her coat...that he was turned away from her and her necklace, fumbling with the fabric, feeling for the pockets.</p><p>Before she could lunge toward him to rip it away, he removed his hand from the folds, holding the copper armband he sought. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, still holding back, but satisfaction rang in his voice.</p><p>Victoria somersaulted across the table, kicking him aside as she landed on the opposite end, and he pulled her to the floor with him. The cross bumped up against him, and he gasped, recoiling in pain, but held on to her nevertheless as they rolled on the floor. Then the cross slipped up and over her shoulder so that it fell behind her, out of sight.</p><p>With a quick jerk he snapped the chain and the necklace broke at the back of her neck, leaving the cross under her as they shifted over the floor, grappling furiously with each other. His fingers closed over the wrist with the stake, squeezing, while she fought to reach the armband he held in the other hand. She didn\u2019t know why he wanted it, but it was for nothing good.</p><p>Their legs were tangled like lovers\u2019, and he rose over her, hips pressing into hips, suddenly releasing the wrist and letting her plunge the stake down. Beauregard rolled away and the stake whistled past him, grazing his arm, jarring Victoria as she smashed it into the floor. Her arm was still reverberating from the blow, and she tried to flip herself away when she felt hands closing around her other wrist, pulling her back. She kicked out, but it was too late\u2014something smooth and cool latched into place on her left wrist.</p><p>And then a soft clink and her arm felt sluggish. She felt stopped, slowed, heavy.</p><p>She raised the stake again, rolling toward him where he held her arm, but he caught her blow in midair and they were locked, straining, face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cAnd so it is,\u201d he said with great satisfaction.</p><p>Panting there next to him on the floor, she looked over at her right wrist.</p><p>The copper armband clasped her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAt last I have you where I want you,\u201d he said, looking at her with glowing pink eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo...you...don\u2019t!\u201d she cried, fighting to look away, whipping her stake arm about with all of her strength, struggling to snap his hold.</p><p>They were at an impasse for a moment, hand to hand, he squeezing, she fighting to drive the stake down, lying on the floor next to each other with her braceleted arm, extended by his grip, above them.</p><p>She felt her heartbeat begin to slow to match his. Their breath mingled, and everything seemed to ebb into a fog, or an underwater, slow-moving world. The copper on her arm felt warm, as if its weight burned into her flesh, and she couldn\u2019t move it without dragging his hand with it. The relentless pressure on her other wrist had numbed her fingers as he fought to loose the deadly weapon.</p><p>With a last scream of exertion she bucked her whole body and pulled her arm free, the stake slipping from her numb fingers as her hand slammed harmlessly onto his chest. She heard the stake rattle to the floor, the dull sound as it rolled away, somehow so loud in her ears that it drowned out everything.</p><p>\u201cNow...at last...\u201d Beauregard said, yanking her closer. His pink eyes captured her, and she couldn\u2019t breathe. His face moved closer, blocking out her view as she struggled to break free of the thrall...of his hold...of the sluggish, wanton feeling that moved through her.</p><p>He bent toward her, his mouth closer, darkening her vision as she lost her own breath and her heartbeat became one with his.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>In Which Max Befuddles a Contrary Demon</p><p>Akvan was just as Wayren had described him: ungainly, horned, and tailed. His body was a solid trunk with thick arms and legs, both of which ended in curved claws. His face was jowled and porcine, with tiny eyes, puffy cheeks, and a large pug nose. Fangs protruded from his mouth like small tusks, and his skin had a bluish cast.</p><p>The stench of rank evil hung in the air as Max was ushered fully into the room where the demon was holding court. The room was large and simply furnished. Perhaps ten people were standing about, clustered loosely in front of a low dais on which the demon sat. Max couldn\u2019t identify exactly which ones were vampires any longer, but he recognized some of those present as members of the Tutela, and knew that there had to be at least a few undead among them.On the dais next to Akvan was a slender stone table, hip high, and on it was a cluster of obsidian shards.</p><p>Briyani had been made to stand at the doorway, but Max was allowed to step forward into the center of the chamber.</p><p>\u201cSo you demand to see me?\u201d Akvan boomed from a large chair. With his return to earth he had taken human form, but in a horrific, distorted manner in that every aspect was exaggerated and awkward. And, by any definition, horrifically ugly. He was much larger than any man, easily half again as tall as Max himself. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am who called you back to this earth,\u201d Max told him, facing him boldly.</p><p>\u201cHe is a Venator,\u201d came a voice he recognized all too well. \u201cA powerful one. You are right to keep him at a distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarafina,\u201d Max said, turning as the blond woman he\u2019d nearly married appeared, pushing her way through the small throng from the side of the room. George Starcasset was close by her side. \u201cI see you have wasted no time in finding another companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not be jealous, Maximilian...no one could replace you.\u201d She smiled in a manner that was much less naive than any expression she\u2019d worn when he\u2019d first met her, more than a year ago. The glint in her eyes reminded him of the one he\u2019d seen when he\u2019d been unable to extricate himself from a shopping trip with her: sly and covetous. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see that you\u2019ve returned to us. I was quite annoyed to find you missing after our visit. Is it perhaps too much to hope that you\u2019ve seen the error of your ways and have come back to the Tutela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Venator?\u201d Akvan\u2019s low, grating voice drew Max\u2019s attention back to the matter at hand. \u201cNo Venator can harm me\u2014it is written in the Shah-Nameh. Let him approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is the concubine of Lilith,\u201d Sara, ever the gossipmonger, insisted. She was moving toward him as if she owned the chamber, not Akvan.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing,\u201d Max said, turning away from her. \u201cBe still.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold him,\u201d she ordered, gesturing sharply at four of the others, \u201cand I shall prove it, Master Div.\u201d She gave a short, almost insolent bow to the demon as the guards she\u2019d summoned swarmed toward him.</p><p>Max\u2019s skin crawled as four pairs of hands grasped his shoulders and arms, but he stood stoically as Sara\u2019s delicate little fingers pulled at his shirt, opening the collar to show the new bite.</p><p>\u201cSee? She has marked him, and the bite never heals...and no undead dares to touch him for fear of bringing her wrath down upon them.\u201d Her hands were warm and smooth over his skin, brushing his neck and dipping down beneath the fabric of his shirt as if she owned him. \u201cAnd here\u2014Hold him, I said!\u201d She yanked on the ties of the shirt, and then the two halves, opening it over his chest, flicking her finger over the vis bulla that hung uselessly from his areola. \u201cHow I\u2019ve missed this,\u201d she murmured cannily, giving it a tug\u2014without noticing that it wasn\u2019t his.</p> <p>It was painful, but he kept his face blank and his breathing steady. He hadn\u2019t expected Sara to be such an asset to his plan, to move things along so quickly and easily. \u201cTell your fiends to release me,\u201d he ordered Akvan. \u201cI came of my own will.\u201d</p><p>Akvan waved his hand and the four men stepped away, but Sara remained. \u201cBegone,\u201d Max told her. \u201cI have things to discuss with your master.\u201d Sara did not like being mastered by anyone; now that her father was gone she was the heir apparent to the Tutela leadership. The flare of annoyance in her eyes told him he\u2019d hit the mark.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him.\u201d George Starcasset, the cowardly weasel, spoke. Jealousy colored his voice. \u201cOr you will drive Lilith\u2019s anger down upon yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am safe here with Akvan,\u201d Sara said pertly, her eyes sliding over Max one last time as she glided back toward her companion. She shot a coy look at the demon, and Max was certain he saw her flutter her eyelashes. \u201cShe\u2019d not dare to show her face here, for she\u2019s been hiding in her mountains for almost two years now.\u201d</p><p>Max would have laughed at her innocent comment if he\u2019d been in any other situation. How little she knew Lilith.</p> <p>\u201cWhy have you come?\u201d Akvan boomed. \u201cOnly three days ago you escaped from my...hospitality.\u201d His laugh was deep and raspy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come because I called you back from nothing when I destroyed your obelisk. And for that you owe me a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boon? I owe you a boon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout me you would still be trapped in nothing, whilst the son of Lilith would wield your power here on this earth.\u201d Max felt the cool air over his bare skin, but held off the urge to draw his shirt back together.</p><p>Akvan\u2019s jowls were shaking, and his eyes had nearly disappeared among the folds of their lids and his crinkled skin. His laugh was silent, yet condescension exuded from every one of his large pores. \u201cAnd what favor is it that you demand?\u201d</p><p>The demon was obviously just humoring Max\u2019s conversation, but that served the plan. Weave the web, one thin skein at a time.</p> <p>For the first time Max allowed himself to show a bit of a falter, a hesitation. Now he pulled the edges of his shirt together. \u201cWhat I have to say is for your ears only.\u201d And large, malformed ones they were.</p><p>Akvan looked at him, his eyes visible again, and sharp. \u201cNo. You speak aloud, here, among all.\u201d</p><p>Indeed. \u201cThere is no love lost between you and Lilith,\u201d he began, letting his eyes flicker around. \u201cAnd I bear her no love myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it was so,\u201d Sara hissed from the side.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Starcasset snapped back.</p><p>Ah. Division among the ranks.</p><p>\u201cThose pieces are too small to reconstruct your obelisk,\u201d Max said, gesturing to the small pile of obsidian. \u201cI can obtain a much larger shard that you can use to rebuild and restore your power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one in the possession of the Venator?\u201d asked Akvan. \u201cI do not need it.\u201d</p> <p>Max shrugged. \u201cThen our business is concluded.\u201d He turned to leave, his eyes meeting Briyani\u2019s at the back of the room. The other man gave a bare nod of readiness. Now they would see.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Max turned and faced Akvan, allowing a trace of apprehension to show on his face. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have this shard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to ally myself with one who has greater power than Lilith. I desire to destroy her hold over me. She promised to release me if I destroyed your obelisk, but she has refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Sarafina is to be believed, once you are set free, Lilith will bring all of her wrath down upon your ally. I am not foolish enough to step into that trap.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded, allowing even more concern to tinge his expression. \u201cI presumed she would be no match for you, in any regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would not! I merely do not wish to concern myself with her and her puny, half-demon creatures. I have enough of them about me now.\u201d His voice grated harshly. \u201cBut I will have the shard. And when you give it to me, I will allow you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to fight you,\u201d Max replied, his face tightening. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>Akvan considered him again. \u201cA fight, then. A fight for your freedom. If I win, you give me the shard and you serve me. If you win, I allow you to go free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maximilian,\u201d came a shout from the back of the room. They turned to see Briyani straining against the hold of two men. \u201cI will do it! I will fight him. You are still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence him,\u201d Akvan thundered, his command reverberating off the walls. \u201cI shall fight him. And if he dies, you die as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cannot endanger yourself,\u201d Sara cried from the side. She ran to Akvan\u2019s chair, her little hands grasping his bulky arm.</p><p>Max could have kissed her at that moment, not only for her confidence in his skills, but also because the timing could not have been more perfect had he paid her. \u201cI will give you the shard,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not wish to fight you. Only let us go free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no fear of you, Venator. You cannot harm me, but there is nothing writ that says I cannot draw you into pieces. But perhaps I should fight your friend first, and then when I win, you shall tell me where the shard lies.\u201d</p><p>Blast.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish,\u201d Max said, trying to sound a bit eager. \u201cThat is more than fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is not a Venator,\u201d cried Sara. \u201cIs he?\u201d She spun a look at Max, who refused to answer. \u201cYou are not fully recovered from your return, Master Div,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he is not a Venator. Do not jeopardize our plans by putting yourself in danger.\u201d</p><p>Akvan had pulled his bulk from the large chair and now he towered over all in the room. His muscles, bare beneath a short-sleeved tunic and traditional Persian skirt, rippled. If he was not fully recovered from being recalled to earth, Max was loath to imagine what he would look like when he was.</p><p>\u201cI shall fight you, Lilith\u2019s concubine. And when you die\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I die you shall not know where the piece of obelisk is,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Akvan lumbered to a stop. \u201cYou do not wish to fight me. If you tell me where the piece of my obelisk is, I will not fight you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will allow me to go free? And my companion?\u201d</p><p>Akvan settled back in his chair. \u201cOf course. Now tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell it aloud, where all can hear.\u201d Max looked at him, tensing inside. This was about as far as he could go; they\u2019d gone back and forth, around in circles so much that he hoped Akvan was now thoroughly confused about what he wanted and what he feared. \u201cSo that you may send them out to obtain the shard and wait here with me for them to return with it in their possession.\u201d</p><p>Akvan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDraw near to me, Lilith\u2019s concubine.\u201d</p><p>Max blanched. \u201cI cannot. The bites...she can sense it, and they sting and burn if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw near! I command you, or your companion will be my next meal.\u201d</p><p>Max looked around, visibly disconcerted, but then regained his courage. \u201cSend your people from the chamber so I can speak freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not! Draw near me and speak in my ear.\u201d Akvan glowered at Sara, who peeled herself from his arm and moved away. \u201cYou as well, all of you, step back. Allow him to approach.\u201d</p><p>Max took measured steps toward the demon, gasping once and pressing his hand to the bites that still oozed blood. He stopped in front of the dais, slightly to the left side, where the table of obsidian splinters rested and looked up at the massive creature. \u201cI cannot move...any closer.... The pain...is unbearable.\u201d</p><p>The stench was awful too. Max wasn\u2019t completely feigning discomfort as he drew near, but he was tense and prepared. One chance.</p><p>When Akvan\u2019s haunch-size hand lashed out, Max took the opportunity to dive to the ground, his hands busy under his long coat as he rolled. The demon grasped him by the arm and hauled him easily onto the dais as Max winced, pretending to hold an injured arm.</p><p>\u201cTell me where the shard is!\u201d demanded Akvan, his breath spewing a hot, sickly death-smell over Max\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt is here!\u201d Max said, whipping his arm from beneath the folds of his coat and plunging the shard into Akvan\u2019s chest as if he were staking a vampire.</p><p>The demon shrieked, his eyes goggling, his mouth gaping; but Max didn\u2019t hesitate. He was already pulling the short sword from his other trouser leg and, as the demon remained paralyzed by the stab of the shard, he sliced through his meaty neck with a blade barely long enough for the job, and then he turned to the pile of splinters.</p><p>Everything happened so quickly that before anyone in the room could react, he had the time to dump the table and its cache of obsidian, as well as the splinter necklace, onto the shriveling, blackening mass of Akvan as the demon bubbled into the floor.</p><p>But no sooner had he done that, letting every piece of the obelisk melt into its maker, than Max was turning to defend himself from the hoard of guards that descended upon him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t know who was a vampire and who was a man, and therefore what weapon to use against each\u2014but the question became moot as a massive explosion erupted from the back of the room, sending scatters of stone blasting through the air. At last, Briyani!</p><p>Max took advantage of the distraction to slip away from the red-eyed creature he\u2019d been battling, using the cover of the sudden smoke to duck low and scuttle his way toward that end of the chamber. Their plan was to meet outside of the room if possible, with Michalas rushing to meet them as soon as he heard the explosion.</p><p>He ran into something small and soft, and from the familiar grasping fingers knew it was Sara. She was still a mortal, misguided as she was, but a mortal. Instead of shaking her off, as he wanted to do, he dragged her after him through the smoke and over the piles of rubble, past the bodies buried under it, and out into the hall. Smoke filled the passageway, but when he felt the grasp of sure fingers on his arm, he turned and recognized Briyani.</p> <p>His face was covered with soot, but his white teeth shone in a complacent smile...and as Max turned to follow him, Michalas emerged from the darkness too.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, leading the way. Max followed, and as they hurried down the hall, Michalas turned twice more and lobbed something behind him. Explosions followed them, and a sudden loud rumbling told Max that something had finally collapsed the ceiling behind them. The whole villa was going to come down.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>They ran, the smell of stone dust billowing through the narrow hall behind them as the ceiling caved bit by bit, each topple bringing down the section after it. He still had Sara by the arm, and she was running as fast as they were, even in her skirts.</p><p>They finally reached the cell and burst into the secret laboratory, then more slowly through the Door of Alchemy and out into the night that had fallen.</p> <p>\u201cYou killed him,\u201d Sara said as Max flung off her grasping hands. \u201cHow did you do that? It was against the writings of the Shah-Nameh that a Venator could hurt him! It is never wrong.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, looking over the wall that housed the Door of Alchemy. Half of the villa had collapsed in upon itself, sending puffs of smoke that were visible even in the low moonlight.</p><p>\u201cHow, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, turning to Michalas and Briyani. \u201cWe\u2019ve finished here.\u201d</p><p>Without another word or glance he turned and they started off, leaving Sara Regalado staring after them.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she called again. \u201cAt least tell me that, Max.\u201d</p> <p>He kept walking away. He would never see her again. Never deal with this again.</p><p>His chest was tight. It was over.</p><p>Sebastian cursed as he opened his eyes. At least, one eye. The other one was swollen shut. His shirt was wet with blood, and he felt as if a cart had driven over him, more than once. What had he done to himself?Then his eyes widened, even the painful one, and he scrambled to his feet.</p><p>Good God.</p><p>Victoria.</p><p>He was unsteady, but he\u2019d felt worse before, and the throbbing didn\u2019t stop him from rushing toward the door of the room in which he\u2019d been tossed. It was one of the extra chambers that Beauregard used, and Sebastian\u2019s immediate fear that he\u2019d been locked in was unfounded, for the door opened easily. The hallway was empty, and Sebastian hurried out and down the passageway, refusing to think about what he would find.</p><p>Gardriel and Hugh, two massive vampires particularly loyal to Beauregard, stood outside the door to his private chamber\u2014not the one with the harpsichord, but one adjoining it through yet another hidden door. Sebastian, however, was fast and determined, and managed to push his way in.</p><p>As strong hands locked around his upper biceps, whipping him back to a halt, he stared at the scene before him. His vision dimmed at the edges as he gave a single, futile jerk to try to free himself. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>His grandfather looked up casually from where he reclined on the large, pillow-strewn bed, stroking Victoria\u2019s dark hair. It was long, and rich and thick, and it covered her bare shoulders, streaming over the lush red velvet bedding. Her skin was white, pale in the light cast from a roaring fire\u2014a comfort for her, not for Beauregard\u2014and her mouth was curved in a sensual smile. She looked at Sebastian from her position curled up with his grandfather. Her eyes were horribly bright and seemed deep in her skull.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrived rather more quickly than I anticipated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Sebastian struggled again, but the two who held him were taller, bulkier, and much stronger than he. \u201cBeauregard, let her go.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian couldn\u2019t take his eyes from Victoria, his heart slamming in his chest, his gut twisting painfully. Her lips were dark red and puffy, as if they\u2019d been well kissed, and her gown...it sagged at her bodice, leaving no doubt what his grandfather had been doing, what he had planned.</p><p>Worst of all, her ivory skin seemed paler than usual, the hollow at the base of her throat darker and deeper. As she moved to kiss Beauregard her hair fell away, and he saw the streaks of blood on the side of her neck. Dark, but still glistening, still thick and rich.</p><p>He knew that there was still a chance, yes...he\u2019d drained a good amount of her blood, but as long as she hadn\u2019t drunk from Beauregard, Sebastian could save her.</p><p>His grandfather pulled away from the deep, thrusting kiss he\u2019d been sharing with Victoria, a kiss that made Sebastian\u2019s vision dim further and his struggles more desperate. He saw tongues slide and lips mesh, and it was horribly erotic and disturbing and shocking all at the same time.</p><p>Beauregard lifted his face, pulling away from Victoria\u2019s lips with a loud smacking sound, and looked directly at Sebastian. She continued to kiss his chin and on down his neck, her small, powerful hands smoothing over the front of his chest in the same way she\u2019d done to Sebastian himself only days ago. \u201cYou certainly may join us, if you promise to behave,\u201d Beauregard told him.</p><p>Nausea flooded him, and Sebastian couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. This couldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked finally, his voice low and broken. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could no longer chance your divided loyalties, Sebastian. Now there will be no question, will there?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian just stared, the world falling away and leaving him standing on the edge of a precipice in a cold and angry wind. \u201cVictoria!\u201d he said, his eyes never leaving her as he kicked futilely at the undead who held him. If he could get her attention, pull her from the depths of the thrall...\u201cVictoria, look at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not fear. She\u2019ll be just as accommodating now as she was before...yet she\u2019ll never change. You\u2019ll thank me in a few decades. If you\u2019d listened to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, as she moved and her other arm came into view, he saw the copper band biting into her wrist, and realized that was how she\u2019d fallen. It had to be. She was too strong otherwise. \u201cVictoria.\u201d Desperation began to skim his nerves; his voice came out in an agonized whisper.</p><p>Her eyes were heavy-lidded and alluring, her dark lashes a thick fringe beneath brows and delicate lavender eyelids, her irises wide-pupiled. Her head tilted back as she smiled up at Beauregard again, reaching to brush her fingers over his jaw and chin in an overtly seductive manner so very unlike the proud, restrained Victoria he knew.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Sebastian told Beauregard again, hating that there was an edge of pleading in his voice. His body trembled. \u201cRelease her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not.\u201d Beauregard\u2019s eyes glowed more deeply, and Sebastian felt the edge of his thrall tickle over his shoulders. For the first time in a long while, he recognized the power of his grandfather, and the danger he represented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never asked you for anything. I\u2019ve done what you\u2019ve bidden; I\u2019ve protected you. Now let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Beauregard reached out his long, narrow hand and smoothed his fingers over Victoria\u2019s neck. Blood covered them when he pulled them away, bringing them to his mouth and gently tasting.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t fed from you. It\u2019s not too late.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s neck was prickling and his head pounded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will. She will feed from me. And then you\u2019ll be happy, Sebastian, I promise. Trust me.\u201d Beauregard looked at him. \u201cI never could understand why you did what you did to Giulia, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sebastian managed to wrench his left arm free from Hugh\u2019s grip, surprising both of the undead as he sent his fist plowing into the vampire\u2019s face, and then twisted to pull free from the other.</p><p>But they were on him immediately, pummeling and kicking, fangs bared and eyes glowing, and Sebastian felt the room spinning as he sagged to the floor after a vicious punch in the abdomen.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d he heard Beauregard say. The voice was dim and far away, but Sebastian fought to bring himself back to the room, back to save Victoria.</p><p>But before he could, strong hands dragged him out of the chamber. And as the door closed behind them, the last thing he heard was a low, feminine laugh filled with pleasure.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>Wherein the Worst Possible Happening Occurs</p><p>\u201cSo you leave us once again,\u201d Wayren said, looking shrewdly at Max.</p><p>He nodded, his hand on the doorknob of her library. He hadn\u2019t said so, but Wayren was no fool. She understood him.\u201cNow that Akvan and his obelisk are no threat and you\u2019re useless, you see no reason to remain. Such self-pity doesn\u2019t become you, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-pity? I bathed in that enough in the year after my father and sister died.\u201d He turned the knob and heard the gentle click of the door\u2019s latch releasing. \u201cI have no illusions that Lilith will not be furious when she learns of my...defection...and she\u2019ll soon be searching for me. My intent is merely to disappear for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no need to belabor things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZavier is dying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry for it, too. He is a good man.\u201d</p><p>Wayren nodded. Then she looked at him again with those sharp, pale blue eyes. \u201cWill you leave Victoria\u2019s vis bulla?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s hand tightened, but he didn\u2019t allow it to rise to his chest and touch the amulet beneath his shirt. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need two.\u201d He knew it was an equivocation, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>\u201cShe already wears two vis bullae.\u201d Wayren was looking at him, her head tilted to one side like a wren.</p><p>\u201cThen she doesn\u2019t bloody well need three,\u201d he snapped. He wanted to leave this blasted place before Victoria came back from wherever she was. Before he had to talk to anyone else. \u201cGood-bye, Wayren. I will be in touch. Essere con Dio.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door behind him and hurried away before he saw anyone else, or before Wayren tried to stop him with another of her blasted cryptic comments or knowing looks. The hidden entrance near the library was closer and less noticeable. He wouldn\u2019t have to walk through the fountain room and chance running into anyone.</p><p>Moments later he ascended the dark, narrow stairs that opened into a small cellar in an abandoned building blocks away from Santo Quirinus. As he stepped out of the rickety structure, he realized he might very well be doing so for the last time.</p><p>He ducked out of the small opening at the rear of the building and then moved silently through what passed as a courtyard, but was really no more than a gap five paces wide and filled with rubble and dirt. The sun had begun to rise, sending a soft glow over the ramshackle buildings, and Max drew in a deep breath of chill air, this first full day of his bloody, detestable freedom.</p> <p>He was free, yet still trapped by his memories and knowledge. He should have had Wayren use the golden disk to capture them again and take them away. At least then he would have some peace.</p><p>But he kept going, walking away from the Consilium and the world that had been his life for more than a decade.</p><p>Fast footfalls from behind drew his attention, and he reached automatically for his stake before realizing he had no way of telling whether whoever approached was friend or foe.</p><p>\u201cPesaro!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want, Vioget?\u201d Max released the stake and kept walking, head high, shoulders straight. He was acutely aware of his lack of power, the weakness that seemed to pervade every step he now took.</p><p>\u201cVictoria. It\u2019s Victoria.\u201d</p> <p>Max stopped, but he didn\u2019t turn around. There was something in the bastard\u2019s voice....</p><p>\u201cBeauregard has her.\u201d</p><p>Now he turned back, and what he saw made his spine turn to ice. The blasted fop\u2019s face wasn\u2019t so pretty any longer, and he limped, but it was the expression in his eyes that made Max cold.</p><p>\u201cHas he...\u201d The word dried in his mouth, but Vioget knew what he meant.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But he will if we don\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at him, every bit of antipathy he felt for the other man rising to the surface. He knew precisely where to place the blame for this travesty.</p><p>But instead he turned to start back toward the Consilium. If Vioget had lowered himself to ask Max for assistance, Victoria\u2019s situation must be bad, very bad indeed. They would need others. \u201cHave you seen Wayren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She sent me after you; the Venators are waiting.\u201d</p> <p>So Sebastian knew.</p><p>Max closed his mind off from that path and gave a short nod. And he said words he never thought he\u2019d say to Sebastian Vioget: \u201cI\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian gritted his teeth. \u201cYes, I am aware that Beauregard will be expecting us.\u201d Although he was a man who avoided violence, he thought he might just forget about it for a moment and plow a fist into...something.But that would mean he\u2019d have to stop, and it would waste time he already didn\u2019t have. They had no time. No time. Thank God they were nearly to the house where he and Beauregard lived, albeit in separate quarters, the five men half running as he explained the situation.</p><p>It was early morning, perhaps an hour since he\u2019d stumbled out of the underground lair, and the sun was high enough in the sky that the undead would be safely below\u2014sleeping or otherwise. The slowest-moving carriage ever had dropped them off near their destination, but not close enough to be seen by those who stood watch over their master\u2019s domain from dark buildings or underground nooks. Sebastian knew how to get there without being seen by them, but it necessitated traveling on foot.</p><p>Too slow. They were moving too slow.</p><p>\u201cThen we cannot all go in together.\u201d Pesaro\u2019s voice had an edge to it\u2014it always did, but this was different. There was some odd air about him.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s fingers itched. \u201cI was just about to say, before you interrupted me, that very thing.\u201d He turned his attention from the cold-blooded bastard and glanced at the other three Venators who had come with him to rescue Victoria. For a moment he couldn\u2019t keep away the terror of what might happen to her.</p><p>What might be happening.</p><p>Or have already happened.</p><p>How long had he been gone now?</p><p>Too long.</p><p>Long enough.</p><p>Sebastian marshaled his concentration, focusing on their path as they hurried along through courtyards and between closely built buildings. Losing his focus would do no good for her, regardless of what had happened.</p><p>Pray God it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>How long? How long would Beauregard play with her, kiss her, touch her, before making her drink?</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s stomach rolled greasily. Once that happened, there was no hope.</p><p>Gritting his teeth again, pushing away the paralyzing worry, he barreled along, keeping his mind on a straight path. What they had to do.</p><p>How they could save her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the names of two of the others who\u2019d been chosen to go with him\u2014it had happened so quickly\u2014but one was Michalas. Sly, wiry, and sharp-eyed Michalas he\u2019d met once briefly, many years ago.</p><p>\u201cThere are two known entrances to Beauregard\u2019s main quarters,\u201d Sebastian said, speaking quickly and quietly as they ducked behind the wall of the courtyard behind his house\u2014the very one into which Victoria had dropped during her escape from his fourth-story window last autumn.</p><p>The memory threatened his control, but he recaptured it. \u201cAnd a third secret entrance that only I know of\u2014besides Beauregard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll expect you to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we must split into two groups. One group will go to make a disturbance and draw away the undead that guard and serve him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many undead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen or more. A dozen\u2014perhaps you can handle that task, Pesaro. You can easily take on a dozen undead, or so I hear.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Sebastian thought Pesaro was going to strike him, but he just gave that proud, sharp nod of his.</p><p>Michalas spoke for the first time. \u201cWe now have a fine way of making a disturbance, do we not, Max? All thanks to Miro. Yes, we\u2019ll draw attention away from you so you can enter the secret way.\u201d</p><p>There was a deliberate sneer in Pesaro\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd what will you do once there? Ask Beauregard to hand Victoria over to you? I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll do that without a thought.\u201d</p><p>In this Sebastian was completely forthcoming. \u201cHe won\u2019t expect me to fight him, but I will. I\u2019ll kill him if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Pesaro looked at him sharply and gave another single nod. \u201cI believe you will.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian gave them terse, sharp directions, and they split up appropriately: Michalas and a blond Venator accompanied Pesaro, and the other one called Brim was to follow Sebastian.</p><p>As they began to walk away, Pesaro turned back to Sebastian and grabbed his shoulder in a hold that dug in too deeply to be friendly. \u201cBring her back.\u201d His dark eyes, flat and cold, told him everything that remained unsaid between them\u2014now and in their past. At least in this their wills were united.</p><p>And then he spun away, hurrying off with harsh footsteps to follow Michalas and the blond Venator.</p><p>And Sebastian, fear banding his chest, started into the deep, narrow tunnel beneath the house where he did not want to go.</p><p>Because he was terrified of what he might find within.</p><p>They were nearly to the secret entrance when Sebastian heard it: a dull, rolling boom in the distance, above and from the other side of Beauregard\u2019s private chambers. He realized it was the sound of the promised distraction.</p><p>There was no worry that the three of them, including the legendary Pesaro, would hold back a dozen undead. For all that he hated the fact that he\u2019d had to ask for his help, Sebastian knew there was no one better for this task.</p><p>Another boom sounded a bit closer, echoing in the distance, and Sebastian knew it was now up to him to do his part.</p><p>At the secret door he turned for one last look at Brim. The man towered over him, and he was ebony-skinned, with unfashionable close-cropped hair; he wore his vis bulla through a slender, well-tended eyebrow. Like his name, he brimmed with energy. He gave a brief nod of understanding, and Sebastian turned to the door.</p><p>He hesitated then, again afraid of what he might find, then steeled himself and barged in, feeling the entrance of Brim behind him, hearing the flap of the tapestry as it closed. A vampire waited just inside, grabbing for him, but Brim had his stake out, and Sebastian heard the quiet poof as he charged toward the red velvet bed and the two figures on it. The sounds of struggle behind him told Sebastian that Brim had found others waiting for them, and was holding them back\u2014but Sebastian had no goal except to get to Victoria.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell. He couldn\u2019t see\u2014his legs didn\u2019t seem to be moving him closer fast enough.... It was as though he were slogging through a river, trying to rush through pounding water. But the stench of blood was deep and metallic in the air.</p><p>Suddenly Beauregard was in front of him, his eyes pink and his fangs long and sharp. \u201cYou are too late. Pardon me if I don\u2019t offer my condolences, but that\u2019s because I know that someday you will thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sebastian said, his attention flickering to the prone figure on the bed. Her long hair obscured her face, and a blanket covered her body. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBelieve what you must, but she is mine now. See?\u201d</p><p>He showed Sebastian his arm, a long lean one, bared by a rolled-up sleeve, corded with muscle and decorated with the damned copper band. A deep cut above the wrist, between it and the armband, still oozed dark, glistening blood.</p><p>\u201cShe drank willingly, greedily. She enjoyed it, Sebastian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d He started toward the bed, and to his horror Beauregard didn\u2019t try to stop him. That was the worst sign of all.</p><p>So then he knew.</p><p>\u201cWith her power and my blood, by Lucifer\u2019s sword, she\u2019ll be as powerful as Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d Everything slowed again, but this time Sebastian was focused on his grandfather. The stake, the weapon he\u2019d disdained for more than a decade, felt light and useless in his hand after the guns and swords he\u2019d taken to using in hunting and fencing. But it was lethal, and he would use it.</p><p>By God, he would.</p> <p>Beauregard stopped the blow, blocking Sebastian\u2019s wrist with the flat of a sword that seemed to come from nowhere. \u201cSebastian, you are overwrought,\u201d he said with a calm that burned Sebastian. \u201cI\u2019ll share; I promise you this. And now, with the page you obtained from the journal, we\u2019ll have the power\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a grunt Sebastian reared toward him again, caught his grandfather by the neck in his long fingers instead of in the chest, as the older man had expected. With a shove, with power long dormant and a strength he\u2019d forgotten he had, he slammed him back against a tapestried wall. The bed curtains next to them brushed their legs as Beauregard struggled, dropping his sword with a clatter, and trying to pull Sebastian\u2019s hand from his throat.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d Sebastian said, readying his stake.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot do this,\u201d Beauregard wheezed, his fingers still pulling at him. His sharp nails tore into the tender flesh on the back of Sebastian\u2019s hands. \u201cAfter all I\u2019ve...done for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took her from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pulling you from...me. I did it for both...of us.\u201d</p> <p>Sebastian tightened his fingers, ignoring the blood that was streaming down onto his wrist. He steadied the stake. One plunge and it would be done.</p><p>\u201cI raised you...when no one else...would.\u201d His eyes were no longer pink; his fangs had retracted.</p><p>\u201cBecause my father was taken by your lover!\u201d Sebastian spat. \u201cShe mauled him, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was...jealous...of him.\u201d Beauregard\u2019s throat convulsed under his hand as he coughed. Sebastian wasn\u2019t fooled. He couldn\u2019t strangle a vampire; this would merely slow him down, cause him pain enough to hold him until he could stab the heart. \u201cAnd he...like any Vioget...could not resist...a beau...tiful...woman.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian became aware that the sounds of struggle behind him had ended. He glanced back and saw nothing but the signs of their battle. Brim was nowhere in sight.</p><p>They were alone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Sebastian. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d Beauregard\u2019s breaths were stronger now. His hand wrapped around Sebastian\u2019s wrist instead of pulling at it, scratching at it. Gentle. Imploring. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. You know it. You\u2019ve lived with it for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Sebastian felt his fingers cutting into the flesh beneath them, tearing into his grandfather\u2019s throat. He lifted the stake. \u201cI do love you.\u201d</p> <p>The door burst open at that moment, and Pesaro charged in. His arms and shirt were streaked with blood, his face hardly recognizable in its intensity.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate but went straight to the bed, and Sebastian watched as he yanked back the blanket with a bravery he himself hadn\u2019t had.</p><p>Victoria murmured, moved sinuously, and her eyes fluttered, then closed completely. The hair fell away from her face when Pesaro lifted her, her head falling back to show the bites and blood streaks on her throat and shoulders. Her lips curved in a sensual smile, and a quick trickle of blood spilled from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cChrist Jesus,\u201d Pesaro breathed. He lifted his face, and Sebastian was struck by the loathing there. The stark fury. The same madness he knew was on his own face, grinding in his own gut.</p><p>Everything else fell away, and Sebastian plunged his stake.</p><p>The soft poof resonated, the ashes scattered, and he heard the tinny clatter of the copper armband as it fell to his feet.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>In Which There Occurs a Bedside Vigil</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d Wayren looked around the room. The Consilium\u2019s fountain rumbled behind her, all of its sparkling, blessed water of no help in this instance. \u201cDo you not feel it? You can sense her, even here.\u201d</p><p>She knew they recognized the presence of an undead\u2014a destroyed one of their own, brought into the sacred and secret halls of the Consilium; she knew because of the stark hopelessness on Sebastian\u2019s handsome face, the self-loathing and guilt that certainly churned inside him.And the murmurs and exchanged glances of Michalas and Brim, who, though injured and knocked unconscious during their battle with the undead, still stood strong at the back of the room.</p><p>And Max, whose face was devoid of expression. Who couldn\u2019t sense it any longer himself, but who knew. Who kept in the dark alcove as if he would separate himself from them all.</p><p>Perhaps it was best if he did, now that Victoria was gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait with her until she awakens. Ylito, too. The rest of you\u201d\u2014Wayren glanced at Sebastian, and then Max\u2014\u201ccan do as you wish. It won\u2019t be sundown for hours.\u201d</p><p>She turned from them, from the dark, hopeless faces and the simmering undercurrent of rage. She hoped, prayed that it wouldn\u2019t be directed at Sebastian\u2014for as much as Max wanted to place the blame there, and as much as Sebastian himself did, Wayren knew it was not that simple.</p><p>Sighing, she passed by the portrait gallery. There would be the need for more paintings, for Zavier would expire soon. And Stanislaus\u2019s had not yet been completed. And Victoria...</p><p>Footfalls drew her attention, and she turned to see Sebastian in her wake. \u201cI want to be there when she wakes,\u201d he said. Gone was the charm, the light, flirtatious manner. There was deep sorrow and angry regret, but determination as well.</p><p>He would be a good Venator. His time had come at last.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to fully join us now?\u201d she asked, making way for him to walk abreast with her.</p><p>\u201cI have no reason not to. If I had...I\u2019ve been foolish and irresponsible.\u201d</p><p>He had been, but she understood, as she was wont to do. He, as Max had done, would find his place here, and learn to grow beyond his faults and mistakes.</p><p>\u201cYou dispatched your grandfather. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how difficult that was for you. You will grieve.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looked at her, his face set and haggard. Despite the weariness and pain there, he reminded her, as he always did, of the great Uriel\u2014but with an extraordinary sensuality she didn\u2019t think Uriel would appreciate. \u201cIs there truly no hope? Nothing that can be done?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d Max\u2019s voice was flat and sharp behind them, startling Wayren. \u201cShe drank from him.\u201d</p><p>She paused so that Max could join them, then replied, \u201cHe drained much of her blood\u2014she was very weak, and by drinking from him she replaced hers with his. She\u2019ll awaken and be an undead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not stake her now and relieve us of the waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you must see her as she\u2019s become so that you can say your farewells,\u201d she told Sebastian. \u201cAnd know that it is so, and irreversible.\u201d</p><p>They had reached the room where Victoria lay. No one had been allowed in since Max burst into the Consilium carrying her unconscious, blood-streaked body. He\u2019d then relinquished it to Ylito and Ilias.</p><p>The chamber was small, too small for five people, but Wayren knew it was futile to try to keep Max and Sebastian out. Victoria had been bathed and dressed as though she were a corpse, ready for burial. Her dark hair lay in a thick braid over her breast, and the crisp white lawn of her simple gown served only to show how pale she was. A blue-veined hand rested on her stomach, and another prominent vein lined her face from temple to jaw.</p><p>When they came in, Ylito looked up from his examination of Victoria and met Wayren\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe needs more blood,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it will do any good, but Hannever wishes to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she drink?\u201d Max asked, a flash of metal in his hand. He had a knife at his wrist and would have sliced into it before Wayren grabbed his arm. She sensed a viciousness, a recklessness there that boded no good.</p><p>\u201cWait. It must be Gardella blood,\u201d Ylito said.</p><p>Sebastian was already rolling up his sleeve to bare a muscular arm. \u201cGive me the knife, Pesaro.\u201d</p><p>Max turned away and went to stand against the wall, watching. His arms hung at his sides, his shoulder against the wall in a deceptively casual stance. His face was expressionless.</p><p>The tension in the room was heavy and solid, and even Wayren, who usually wasn\u2019t affected by such energy, felt stifled and on edge.</p><p>Hannever came in the door at that moment. \u201cBlood. Now.\u201d He was carrying a tray with a stack of cups on it, two small vials, and other accoutrements, and he put it down on a table. Next to the stake that lay there.</p><p>Without another word he moved to Victoria and made a small cut on her arm, squeezing a drop of the dark blood into a small bowl. The room was still and silent and tight, nearly choking in its intensity.</p><p>Anger, guilt, terror, madness...all simmered and swelled.</p><p>When Hannever turned away from Victoria, Sebastian offered his arm, and Hannever made a small incision, forcing the blood into one of the bowls. Drip, drip, drip...The sound was like little explosions in the tiny room.</p><p>\u201cWhat good will it do?\u201d Max\u2019s voice was sudden and harsh.</p><p>\u201cNo good, I think. But she needs it. We must try,\u201d Hannever said, busy with one of the vials. He put a tiny drop of a liquid into Sebastian\u2019s blood and used a slender reed to stir. \u201cNo. Not this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTry Max,\u201d Wayren said. She met Ylito\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Max\u2019s wasn\u2019t right either, according to Hannever.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get her some blood!\u201d Sebastian said, his teeth tight around the words. He was already moving toward the door, opening it.</p> <p>\u201cZavier,\u201d Max said. \u201cLet Zavier try.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and then Wayren looked at Ylito. Yes. It was fitting. He\u2019d want to.</p><p>\u201cWe must have his permission.\u201d</p><p>Wayren nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll give it. Let us go and I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four</p> <p>In Which There Is a Chilling Draft</p><p>Victoria murmured, shifting restlessly, moving for the first time since they\u2019d come into the room. Sebastian brushed the hair away from her forehead, the soft, lush curls that had been captured in a braid that lay in a thick line past her breasts. Her skin was damp and clammy, and still so pale.</p><p>This would be the last time he\u2019d touch her.Sebastian looked at her lips, at the curve of her jaw, remembering how strong it could be\u2014how defiant when she lifted it and pretended she didn\u2019t want him as much as he wanted her. Now he would have no one to taunt in a carriage, no one to tease and tug and coax into his arms.</p><p>His wound from her stake still ached, oozing blood, and he remembered again why she was lying there, and how she had found Beauregard\u2019s lair. Who had led her there, and why. How Beauregard had manipulated them both.</p><p>He\u2019d sat there\u2014it had been hours\u2014since he and Pesaro had been allowed to enter after whatever Hannever and Ylito had done with Zavier\u2019s blood. Somehow they\u2019d fed it into Victoria using some sort of tube, but it hadn\u2019t seemed to do any good. The back of his neck still prickled and chilled, and she still lay there, cold and pale.</p><p>She moaned again, and Sebastian looked up. He met Pesaro\u2019s eyes from across Victoria\u2019s body. There was no hope there, nothing but grim determination. A stake sat on the table near Pesaro; Sebastian had no doubt he\u2019d not hesitate to use it.</p> <p>A cold one, he was.</p><p>Wayren and Ylito had found a small corner of the room where they both sat reading or studying some old text. The sight of them brought to Sebastian\u2019s mind the fact that the page he\u2019d stolen from the Consilium was still in Beauregard\u2019s lair.</p><p>He would have to go back and find it once...once this was over.</p><p>At that moment Victoria\u2019s eyes fluttered, and the sensation in the room shifted. It became closer and smothering, and no one seemed to breathe.</p><p>Wayren was suddenly standing at the foot of the small bed. Ylito took his place near the head, and before Sebastian knew what was happening he heard a soft whisk, and then a faint clink. Pesaro was doing something at his side of the bed, and Wayren and Ilias near the foot.</p><p>Restraints.</p><p>God, restraints.</p><p>How demeaning for her.</p> <p>He felt and found the soft leather cuffs, the metal fastenings on the side, and let them drop. He wouldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Victoria was breathing more stridently now, and her eyes were fluttering. One of her legs moved; her lips parted; she rolled her head. She tried to raise an arm, but it was held in place by...not a cuff, but Pesaro. His hand on her arm, around her wrist. Clamping it onto the edge of the bed.</p><p>All of a sudden her eyes fluttered open. Wide. They opened wide, and she looked around. They weren\u2019t red; they were the same brown-green they\u2019d always been.</p><p>The room seemed to hold its collective breath, waiting. Ylito shifted near the head of the bed, and Sebastian saw him reach for something on the table.</p><p>No. Not the stake. Not yet.</p><p>But when he glanced over, he saw that it was still on the table, held in place by Pesaro\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d Victoria said, looking around, her eyes moving slowly from face to face. \u201cBeauregard!\u201d She tried to move, and a confused look passed over her.</p><p>Ylito moved, and something splashed through the air, sprinkled down on her face before Sebastian could stop him. Not her face!</p><p>But instead of screaming and tearing at the spray of holy water, Victoria twisted around, merely turning her face to get away from it as if it were nothing more than a summer rain shower.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked, her voice stronger now.</p><p>Something in the room changed. It was as if a sudden light had come on. They all looked at one another, afraid to hope....</p><p>\u201cIs it possible?\u201d Ylito asked, looking at Wayren.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it can be,\u201d she replied. She\u2019d moved next to Sebastian, and he felt her palpable...was it relief? Could it be? She reached down, smoothing her hands over Victoria\u2019s face, over her shoulders, her eyes closed, a low hum coming from the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cThe two vis bullae.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at Pesaro, who\u2019d removed his hand from the stake. Whose face actually bore an expression now. \u201cShe wears two of them, does she not?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian stared at him. How the bloody hell could Pesaro know that...when he himself didn\u2019t?</p><p>Wayren straightened, her hands continuing to move in soft, rhythmic gestures over Victoria\u2019s body as if to soothe it...or to somehow measure it. \u201cIt must be. There can be no other explanation. The strength of the two overpowered Beauregard\u2019s blood, and she was not turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so that is why she needed blood,\u201d added Ylito. \u201cWhen the tainted vampire blood did not take hold, it had to be replaced with mortal blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d demanded Victoria. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looked down at her, a sudden jubilance rushing over him. For the first time in a long while he felt something other than doom and guilt. Thank God.</p><p>But then, as he took her cool fingers into his hand, he realized something horrible.</p><p>His neck was still cold.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Wherein We Are Reminded That Hell Hath No Fury</p><p>Sarafina Regalado walked boldly into the chamber where Lilith the Dark awaited.</p><p>Her journey from Roma to these mountains in the depths of Romania had been long, and she was exhausted. But she refused to be cowed by the powerful undead who stood before her. What was the worst that could happen?The queen of the vampires could bite her.</p><p>And Sara would rather enjoy that.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d Lilith asked after a moment. \u201cWhy have you braved my guards to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was Conte Regalado, but he is dead. The woman Venator killed him.\u201d</p><p>The blue-red eyes narrowed. \u201cAh, so you are the one. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bring you news,\u201d Sara told her, looking around at the sumptuous furnishings, and examining the vampire\u2019s gown. Out of style, wrong fabric...but somehow it suited her. \u201cAkvan is destroyed. The Door of Alchemy has been opened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is no news to me.\u201d The queen was watching her hungrily. \u201cBeauregard is dead, too, at last. Although his armband is missing again.\u201d</p><p>From under her cloak Sara pulled a sheet of paper, brittle with age and from the thin wax that covered it. \u201cPerhaps you would find this interesting. I obtained it from one of Beauregard\u2019s minions\u2014the one who brought me to you.\u201d</p><p>Lilith took it lazily, but Sara saw the way her gaze sharpened when she looked at the drawing of the plant and the instructions, written in a language that Sara didn\u2019t understand. But she didn\u2019t need to. She\u2019d brought it to someone who would know how to read it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you wish from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Max kill Akvan?\u201d asked Sara. \u201cHe should not have been able to.\u201d</p><p>The queen looked at her, and before Sara\u2019s eyes she became even paler than before, nearly translucent, so that more ribbons of blue veins showed through her white skin. \u201cMaximilian. No.\u201d</p><p>She rounded on Sara, who was suddenly taken aback by the fury in the vampire\u2019s eyes. They burned in her skull, burned as they looked at her, burned as though they touched her skin. \u201cDid he slay Akvan with his own hand? With his own hand? Tell me!\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I cannot\u2014No.\u201d Her mouth compressed; her hair swirled about her in a cloud of copper. \u201cNo! He has betrayed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are not the only one,\u201d Sara told her. \u201cAlthough,\u201d she added hastily as the vampire spun back to her, fangs bared as though to tear into her, \u201chis betrayal of you\u2014whatever it was\u2014must be much more important than what he did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax. How dare he!\u201d Lilith was shrieking now, her chest heaving with anger and malevolence. \u201cAfter all of the graces I\u2019ve bestowed on him, all of the freedoms! And he betrays me.\u201d Her voice had dropped now, steadied. \u201cI shall have my vengeance.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Sara. Lilith\u2019s eyes glowed, but no longer burned. All but one of the veins under her skin had faded. Her lips curved invitingly. \u201cBoth of us shall. Now come closer, my dear, and give me your pretty little neck.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
