His lips were frozen in a tight smile as his eyes did what they had been trained to do, put into action for the past twelve months\u2014scan for snipers, out of place looking buildings and suicide bombers posing as families.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t deserve this honor. This back of the Christmas Parade position by the Snow Queen with Old Saint Nick trailing behind them. No, there had been others more worthy. But instead of a ride in a convertible, they had a one-way ticket home in a casket draped with an American Flag in the underbelly of a plane.</p><p>Festive decorations lined the street. Garland wrapped around light posts while wreaths with dark red bows swayed with each gust of wind. Dirty slush lined the sides of the street, a strange sight to see in North Carolina, since the coldest part of winter tended not to hit until about February.</p><p>Eyes blurring, he blinked and exhaustion hit him hard. Twenty-six hours ago, he\u2019d turned in his weapons and gear, given his landlord notice, packed up his truck and driven straight home.</p><p>Or rather the place he used to call home.</p><p>Not much had changed in the years Joaquin had been gone.</p> <p>The corner drugstore still served vanilla cokes and grilled cheese sandwiches at its lunch counter. The only movie theater in town still played movies two months after their release for discount prices. Tetterton\u2019s Hardware still had the same two rocking chairs being rocked by the same two men arguing over the same game of checkers.</p><p>A loud popping noise made him dive for cover in the back seat as he shouted, \u201cGet down.\u201d Adrenaline infused his bloodstream. His heart beat a sharp staccato.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze and speed up all at once. He heard every beat of Holland Springs High School\u2019s drum line as they marched down Broad Street while the screams of the crowd become one long roar.</p><p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d a voice screeched in his ear, but he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. In fact he shoved the head belonging to that voice into the floor mats.</p><p>The popping noise went off again, followed by the sound of children\u2019s laughter. Firecrackers. Firecrackers. Dammit.</p><p>He looked down.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Snow Queen, Ella Swanson, lay pinned under him, murder gleaming in her perfectly made-up eyes.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>He scrambled off of Ella, grabbing her arm to pull her up to a sitting position. Her crown was askew, hair halfway out of its perfect bun and her dress had a rip. Frowning, she patted her hair into place and looked down, then smacked her hand over her mouth. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t completely muffle the scream of fury and he winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d she hissed, her frown giving way to the biggest fake smile he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it...I\u2014\u201d What was he supposed to say\u2014that he saved her from kids messing around with a bag of Snap Pops? Inspiration struck. \u201cThere was a bird getting ready to er, poop in your hair.\u201d Never mind it was December and too cold for even the birds to venture out.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she quickly fixed her hair. \u201cYou really are a hero.\u201d She whipped out a pair of scissors from a bag in the floor and began working on her dress.</p><p>Joaquin didn\u2019t know what impressed him more\u2014her acting skills or how quickly she pulled herself together. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>They resumed their former positions and the crowd let out a loud cheer. He struggled not to flinch from the sound. A part of him wanted to jump out of the car and run away from the humiliation. And yet another wanted to find the closest bar and drink his way to oblivion. But he had a job to do after this parade.</p> <p>One that scared the ever-loving hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cSmile bigger, sugar. Maybe put your arm around me,\u201d the perky brunette beside him whispered. He glanced at her, watching in morbid fascination as her glossy red mouth barely moved as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting two years to beat Hannah Jane Simpson, and you\u2019re not gonna ruin my moment.\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t want to put his arm anywhere near her. Hell, he really hadn\u2019t wanted to be in the Christmas Parade in the first place, but saying no to Pastor Mike was unthinkable. Especially since Pastor Mike was also the newly elected Mayor of Holland Springs. All Joaquin had wanted was a steaming mug of decaf and some sleep. But all he\u2019d gotten was a cold cup of obligation.</p><p>Exhaling, he forced a smile as well as his arm around Ella, barely touching her back.</p><p>\u201cWant to be my date to the Lighting of the Christmas Tree Ceremony?\u201dshe asked, executing a pageant wave.</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen.\u201d She snuggled up to him, then wrinkled her nose and edged away. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d</p><p>Thank God and three cheers for wearing old ACL\u2019s, ones that he\u2019d dug out of one of his duffle bags. Pastor Mike had insisted on it. Besides, barely legal wasn\u2019t remotely appealing to him, not even if he were single. \u201cIt\u2019s the smell of \u2018I\u2019m way too old for you\u2019.\u201d And war. He still smelled of sand, sorrow and violence. There wasn\u2019t enough detergent on the planet to get it out of his clothes. Not enough soap to scrub it from his skin. And there was nothing that could rip it out of his soul.</p><p>Ella started talking again, but he\u2019d already tuned her out and looked at the clock tower sitting on top of the courthouse. Only ten more minutes and he\u2019d be free.</p><p>Sweat trickled between his shoulder blades. The small of his back itched. Jesus, he needed a shower. He rubbed at his jaw, bristles scratching his skin, and a shave.</p><p>Auburn hair glinted in the morning sun and his heart sped up. The crowd shifted to the left, obscuring his view. He craned his neck and pushed up on his hands, searching for another glimpse.</p><p>\u201cWould you sit down,\u201d Ella said, tugging on his uniform. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>Miraculously, the crowd parted and there she was\u2014just as beautiful as he remembered. Pretty grey eyes framed with black square glasses and curves that made his mouth water and his hands itch to caress. The beginnings of a smile crept on his face.</p><p>The vision before his eyes crossed her arms and glared back at him.</p><p>\u201cSage Caswell?\u201d Ella asked, her voice incredulous. \u201cBut y\u2019all\u2019s parents hate each other. Oh! So, that\u2019s why you won\u2019t go out with me.\u201d She sighed dreamily. \u201cLike Romeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>Sage waved a piece of paper at him, and the tips of his ears grew hot.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d But only if Juliet had woken up and stabbed Romeo.</p><p>Sage knew.</p><p>Of course, she knew, he rationalized. Sage was one of the most intelligent people he knew. Maybe she would understand why he\u2019d done what he\u2019d done. That he\u2019d been a coward, but ultimately, he had wanted to make it up to her, to earn her forgiveness...and love.</p><p>Sage had always had a soft spot for dumbasses. Hell, she\u2019d fallen for him hadn\u2019t she? Hard and fast. Bright as the summer sun before he\u2019d left town. Without her.</p><p>Sage tore his letter into pieces and he cursed under his breath. She threw them into the air, turned on her heel and stormed away. White confetti trailed behind her as it was tossed around by bodies and small gusts of wind.</p><p>Defeated, he sank back down and mentally licked his wounds. Guess it was time for Plan B.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m the Snow Queen. Let me bat my eyelashes and pout my trouty lips while you eat it up,\u201d Sage cooed in a falsetto, then lowered her voice to a husky baritone. \u201cAs soon as this parade is over, I\u2019m going to show you just what you can do with those lips.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes at the childish conversation that was most definitely not caused by jealousy, Sage made a sharp right on Oak, walking as fast as she could to her family\u2019s car dealership.</p><p>Waving at Eddie and Fred as they washed inventory, she ducked through the open side door, and made her way to the back office.</p><p>Pressing trembling hands to her cheeks, she tried to get a grip on her volatile emotions. Emotions that hadn\u2019t gotten the best of her in years. And it was all his fault. Joaquin Morales, looking all irresistible with his muscles and soulful brown eyes. And hands. Good Lord, his hands....and mouth. That kissable mouth that could form the sexiest of smiles.</p><p>She unwound her scarf from her neck and pulled off her knit hat, hanging both on a hook near the door. Breathe and get back to work, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cThought you were going to the parade,\u201d a voice boomed, making Sage almost jump out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d She moved to the file cabinet and began sorting through the manila folders on top. \u201cI\u2019m yours until closing.\u201d Her dad made a noise and she turned around. \u201cSomething you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorales has a Twelve Days of Christmas deal going on and we\u2019re gonna price match.\u201d Charles Caswell grimaced, then gulped down his coffee and threw the paper cup in the trash. \u201cI\u2019m sick of losing business to that underhanded son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Sage turned back to her work and bit back a sigh. Same story, different day. Caswell versus Morales. Morales versus Caswell. It had been that way for the past fifteen years and would most likely be that way for fifteen more. Usually, she made a quick exit when her dad got all riled up, but today, she needed the distraction he could provide.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting all the construction crews from Jacksonville, and the soldiers coming home,\u201d Charles complained.</p><p>\u201cMaybe because Mr. Morales has the cars they want,\u201d Sage said, but she knew he wasn\u2019t listening. Their family\u2019s car business depended on repeat customers, but they were ageing, and a young veteran returning from war didn\u2019t want a Cadillac. Neither did those constructions crews. They wanted minivans, trucks or sports cars.</p><p>\u201cI got in two minivans and three SUVs last month.\u201d He pointed to the lot in front of the store. \u201cAnd they\u2019re still sitting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put them on the left side, toward the back. No one can see them, and you didn\u2019t tell Fred to push them,\u201d she pointed out, then opened the second file drawer.</p><p>The desk chair creaked as her dad sat down and back. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll have Eddie drive them to the front and put some balloons on the antenna. People love balloons.\u201d</p><p>Sage turned as Eddie entered the office and said, \u201cHey, boss. Morales is cooking and giving away hotdogs and hamburgers\u2014just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell for?\u201d Charles asked, brow creasing.</p><p>\u201cJoaquin is home from Afghanistan, for good, I heard,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration.\u201d</p><p>Sage mentally braced herself for her dad\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Charles\u2019s face turned red, but remarkably he held his temper. \u201cGo put the minivans up front and tie on some balloons, add some garland. Make it look festive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eddie said, then left.</p><p>Charles turned to her. \u201cYou know about this?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was in her throat but she managed to speak around it. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all those letters he wrote you, I figured you might have some insider information.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cMomma told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid she was worried, is all.\u201d He pulled at his collared shirt. \u201cSo was I.\u201d</p><p>Face flaming, she started to give her dad a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He pulled out a pen and a yellow legal pad. \u201cWhat did the Morales boy tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all that concerns you? Not my feelings, not...\u201d She hit the file cabinet drawer with her hip, closing it.</p><p>\u201cYou just said you were fine.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her purse and fished her keys out of it, fury and disappointment making her hands shake as she yelled over her shoulder, \u201cThis is the south: it\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to say.\u201d</p><p>Three hours and a pint of Cherry Garcia later, Sage texted her best friend, Mandy Little, to let her know that she would not be going to the Lighting of the Christmas Tree Ceremony tonight.</p><p>Of course Mandy texted her right back to let Sage know that she would be over in a couple of hours for them to talk. And by talk Mandy meant drink margaritas until they couldn\u2019t form coherent sentences and passed out laughing\u2014or crying.</p><p>Which was fine with her, because there was no way in hell she\u2019d chance another encounter with Joaquin. In the meantime, she could work on lesson plans.</p><p>Sage threw the empty ice cream container in the trash and washed her hands.</p><p>Although she would miss the change of pace that working at her parents\u2019 dealership had been providing over winter break, she was ready to get back to what she loved\u2014teaching fourth graders. But she wasn\u2019t too proud to admit she would miss the extra cash once school started in January. This past summer, she had insisted on getting paid and her dad had agreed without too much fussing.</p><p>Usually, she didn\u2019t rock the boat, and did what everyone expected of her, no matter what her heart was telling her. Her heart couldn\u2019t be depended upon anyway. It made her think and do things that her brain would have logically concluded were extremely bad for her well-being.</p><p>Like get romantically involved with a man like Joaquin Morales.</p><p>After drying off her hands, she moved into her bedroom. On the dresser she kept a small jewelry box, the top engraved with her initials. Opening it, some silly love song played. She picked up the diamond ring hidden in a side chamber.</p><p>Sliding it on, she held it up and splayed her fingers to examine the tiny jewel in the center. This was dumb. They had been dumb. Shaking her head, she pulled at the ring, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she muttered, then walked to the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After ten minutes of tugging and applying every slippery concoction to her ring finger, she gave up and plopped down on her bed. Tomorrow she\u2019d go down to Nelson\u2019s and get Henry to cut the thing off. Then she\u2019d take the stack of letters from Joaquin and cut them into tiny pieces, just like he\u2019d done to her heart.</p><p>Just like she\u2019d done today. The sweet revenge of seeing the shock on his face had made her want to cheer. Heck, it had made her want to tear up three more of his letters and lead the town\u2019s parade.</p><p>Flopping back on the bed, she let out a soft snort.</p> <p>Who was she kidding? That \u201cletter\u201d she\u2019d torn up in front of him had been her yesterday\u2019s grocery list. Her stupid heart had told her to hold on to the sweet memories of them for just a little bit longer. To give him a chance to explain why he had deceived her. Why he had made her fall in love with a fictional character, because it couldn\u2019t be him she was actually in love with.</p><p>Like always her heart had been wrong.</p><p>When she\u2019d first spotted him, sitting on the back of one of his dad\u2019s shiny convertibles, her heart had gone into overdrive, beating so hard she had been shocked it hadn\u2019t flown out of her chest. For the briefest of moments, she felt nothing but pure joy at seeing him. Pure joy that he was home safe and sound from danger.</p><p>It was all she could do to keep herself from running out there and jumping into the car with him. To put her arms around him and kiss his face.</p><p>Then his smug grin and strong arm around a perky brunette with pouty red lips had dashed all that away and made her want to lob mugs of hot chocolate at his head.</p> <p>One thing she needed to remember and keep close was that Joaquin had always liked a challenge and loved to do the exact opposite of what was expected of him. It was the reason they\u2019d gotten together in the first place. She had been forbidden, the enemy\u2019s only daughter.</p><p>Turning on her side, she faced the nightstand and the very first letter he\u2019d ever written her. Had it been only twenty-four hours since she\u2019d figured out that Gage Huntstone didn\u2019t exist? That Joaquin had gone so far as to disguise his handwriting, or worse, gotten someone else to do his dirty work. Had he and his buddies laughed and talked about her? About how na\u00efve she was? About how much of a fool she was?</p><p>For the life of her she couldn\u2019t figure out why Joaquin had done this, nor could she stop the tears from falling as she picked up the letter and began to read the words she knew by heart.</p><p>Dear Ms. Caswell,</p><p>I wanted to thank you for your letter. It was really nice of you to think of someone like me. I haven\u2019t gotten a lot of mail since I deployed, mostly because my family isn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d call supportive of my decision. Anyway, everyone in my unit enjoyed the pictures your class drew and the letters y\u2019all wrote. Guess our unit should thank the powers that be that ours was the winner of your class\u2019s writing assignment. Nothing beats getting letters from home.</p><p>We\u2019ve put them up on a makeshift bulletin board. Every time we\u2019re sent out on a mission, we touch one of the drawings or letters for luck. So far, so good. (Except for Sanford smacking his head on the door of an M-WRAP, but he doesn\u2019t count, because he couldn\u2019t find his way out a room with one door and no windows.)</p> <p>I know you sent this to \u2018any soldier\u2019, but I could really use someone like you in my life right now. Would it be too weird to ask you to me write again?</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Gage Huntstone</p><p>She should have replied with a firm but polite no. Actually, she shouldn\u2019t have replied at all, but all she had been able to think about was Gage being lonely.</p><p>What if he died without a letter from her? What if the only thing that kept him going in a war-torn country was a little piece of home? Couldn\u2019t she make that ice cold sliver of distrust that pierced her heart melt for someone like him? A man who was doing something noble, going against his family\u2019s wishes and putting his entire life on hold to protect people like her. It really was the least she could do for a soldier serving in a war.</p><p>Dear Mr. Huntstone (or should I say 1st. Lt. Huntstone?),</p><p>Writing to you would be an honor.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry your family doesn\u2019t support you, but maybe they\u2019ll come around one day. I know a little bit of how you\u2019re feeling\u2014there have been times that my family hated the choices I made. But you can\u2019t live your life for them, otherwise it would be their life and not yours.</p> <p>And that sage (ha!) piece of advice only took me four years to put into practice. You do, however, have my support. Although, I\u2019m not sure how much a small town girl like me could help you feel better.</p><p>We\u2019ve been getting ready for the statewide writing test in class, and my students love practicing their skills with letters to your unit. After that test is over, we have end of grade testing for reading and math. Summer vacation can\u2019t come fast enough for my class.</p><p>It\u2019s been really windy here and we\u2019re anxiously awaiting March to go out like a lamb. Last week\u2019s storm ripped off the roof of Carter\u2019s Repair Shop and it ended up twelve miles away in Narron County. According to the local news, the farmer whose field it landed in and John Carter are arguing over who now owns it. The cows taking shelter under it have no opinion on the matter.</p><p>What\u2019s it really like in Afghanistan? My class looked it up on Google Maps, and I\u2019ve been doing mini-lessons in Social Studies, but you can\u2019t substitute a book for actual experience.</p><p>I hope my letter finds you safe.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Sage</p><p>\u201cSo stupid,\u201d she whispered through her tears. She should have signed it \u2018the biggest fool in five counties\u2019.</p><p>There was a knock on her door, then another.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d she called out. Rising from bed, Sage wiped away her useless tears and glanced at her clock. It was too early for Mandy.</p><p>Frowning, she let out a big sigh.</p><p>It had to be her momma. That woman couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone, and to be sure, Sage\u2019s dad had told Virginia about the great stomp off. Or her mother was here for their monthly \u201cpep talk\u201d to encourage Sage sell this house.</p><p>She could hear mother\u2019s voice in her head, noting all the reasons why Sage should follow her advice: A single woman didn\u2019t need something so big. Why, what if a man was interested in her and already had his own house? Better to live in apartment and not risk scaring him away. And why didn\u2019t Sage just move back home, like God intended?</p><p>Heck, if Virginia had her way, Sage would be working full-time at the dealership and heading up projects for the Holland Springs Town Improvement Committee.</p><p>Sage opened the door, prepared to give her mother a piece of her mind for telling her dad about the letters, and to defend herself for acting like a three year old.</p><p>Instead she found the most gorgeous man on the planet staring back at her, his smoldering brown eyes searched her face, then slowly traveled the lines of her body. A thick blanket of heat covered her, making her palms wet and her body tingle\u2014in all the unfortunate places.</p><p>Joaquin looked pointedly at her left hand and her face heated.</p><p>Their eyes met again, and she shoved her arm behind her back, fixing him with her best teacher glare.</p><p>A grin broke out on his face as he said, \u201cMissed me, Mrs. Morales?\u201d He held out a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Then Sage did exactly what her heart and brain agreed was a good idea. Something that the old Sage would never have done in a million years.</p><p>She slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cThat went well,\u201d Joaquin muttered to the flowers, then knelt down to set them beside her door. He flipped up the doormat, raising an eyebrow as he found the spare key. His safety girl was really living on the edge these days.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the old one. I had the locks changed,\u201d she yelled through the door. The deadbolt clicked and he rose to his feet.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she was still a couple feet shy of the edge. Laughing, he shook his head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t expect nothing less, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are Mrs. Morales.\u201d And she was wearing his ring. That had been a shot of pure lust. Forget skimpy outfits. That tiny diamond declared before the world that Sage Caswell was his. No greater aphrodisiac had existed in that moment.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet before someone hears you.\u201d</p><p>His lips flattened. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept our marriage a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d she shot back. \u201cAnd there is no \u2018us\u2019. There hasn\u2019t been an \u2018us\u2019 since you went for a drive and never came back.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t merely gone for a drive. Eight weeks he had given her to tell her family. Eight damn weeks he\u2019d given her before he expected her to join him in Texas at Ft. Hood. He had picked out an apartment off-base for them to live in. Nothing fancy, but nice. The familiar stirrings of anger and resentment threatened to derail their reunion.</p><p>Determination to set things right made him try again. \u201cWell, I\u2019m back, and we\u2019re still married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for much longer,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time there won\u2019t be any unsigned paperwork mistake.\u201d</p><p>A large part of him had hoped she had purposefully not signed the annulment papers. Yeah, hope was a four letter word that could suck it. He placed his palm on the blue door, wishing he could sweep the lacy curtains aside and look in the small window at the top. \u201cWhat did you do, Sage?\u201d</p><p>The door flew open, dislodging his palm and making him take a step back. She stood in the doorway, her grey eyes stormy behind her glasses and her cheeks flushed. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She poked him sharply in the chest with her finger. \u201cDo you really want to go there, Joaquin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for us to talk,\u201d he said, keeping his voice calm. The old him would have stomped off and not talked to her for a couple of days while he brooded. What an ass he\u2019d been.</p><p>She tilted her chin and raised her brows at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not long enough,\u201d he protested. He took off his cap and wiped his forehead with his arm.</p><p>\u201cFour minutes and thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she said, her grey eyes like steel.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do whatever I want. This is my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that teacher voice. I\u2019m not one of your students.\u201d He\u2019d forgotten how damned bossy she could be.</p><p>God, he missed her.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d It sounded as though she relished taking away his time.</p><p>He had this whole speech rehearsed. He knew every word by heart and thought it would melt hers, but there was no way it would work. She\u2019d slam the door in his face before he would be able to get to the best part\u2014the down-on-his-knees-apology.</p><p>Instead he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. \u201cSpend Christmas with me, like we\u2014\u201dher eyes narrowed \u201c\u2014planned. Then I\u2019ll head back to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe planned?\u201d</p><p>He sliced his gaze to the side, then back at her. \u201cFine. Like you and Gage planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass, and you\u2019re not going back to Texas. Do you really think I\u2019d miss the ginormous U-Haul trailer hitched to your truck?\u201d She punched him in the arm, just like she\u2019d done when they were in high school whenever he\u2019d done something stupid to get her attention. He was pretty sure pretending to be someone else was ranked way up there on the stupidity scale. \u201cBesides, in what reality would I spend even an hour with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Sage, I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so darn lonely, then ask the Snow Queen to spend time with you.\u201d</p><p>She was jealous? This was a good sign. A very good sign. \u201cI don\u2019t want her. I want you.\u201d There. The truth all laid out.</p><p>Sage fisted her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t have me, so learn to deal with disappointment!\u201d Then she shut the door in his face again.</p><p>Time for Plan C. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come with me, Sage, I\u2019m gonna tell everyone that we\u2019re married. I\u2019ll go to church on Sunday and make an announcement in front of God and your momma. I\u2019ll even announce that we ah, consummated our marriage in the back of your daddy\u2019s Cadillac.\u201d</p><p>The door flew open again. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d Bright spots of color highlighted her cheeks and her eyes flashed.</p><p>He placed a palm on the doorframe and leaned in, his mouth inches from hers. Good God, he wanted to kiss those sweet lips. They\u2019d be soft and supple, and she\u2019d taste like heaven. Like his Sage. His wife. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>There was a wariness in her eyes, but wariness gave way to fury. \u201cI\u2019m calling bull on you. There\u2019s no way you\u2019d embarrass your parents like that.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hands in defeat. She was right. \u201cFine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun with the Snow Queen,\u201d she said in her sweetest voice, one that made him want to choke something\u2014mostly himself for goading her.</p><p>Shoving his hat back on his head, he gave her a long hard look that made her squirm. Good. \u201cSee you Sunday.\u201d Then he stomped off to his truck and drove off.</p><p>He really was full of bull. There was no way he\u2019d embarrass anyone like that, especially Sage. But maybe it would make her think a little about what he\u2019d said. Then again, maybe he should have told her how proud he was of all she had accomplished. Like her sunny little cottage she\u2019d bought, or how she\u2019d graduated at the top of her class in college, and that she\u2019d done all of it without help from anyone.</p><p>Sure he had told her in the letters he\u2019d written her, but that had been Gage talking, not him. He patted his uniform, searching for the pocket over his heart and pulled out a creased piece of paper. It was one of the many he had kept stowed away in his pockets. They were his ties to a world he\u2019d used to live in, one full of sunny days, starry nights and no bombs. One without helpless families being starved and abused by evil, powerful men that used religion and ignorance to keep them in line. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her second letter to him had almost made him tell the truth. Almost made him reveal that he was the one writing to her, not a fictional man he named after a wounded dog his unit had adopted and nursed back to health.</p><p>One way or another he was going to convince her to spend Christmas with him. He tucked the letter away and smiled. There was no need to read it. He knew the words by heart. Hell, he knew every word of every letter she\u2019d written and the ones he\u2019d written, too.</p><p>Sage and Gage.</p> <p>He rolled his eyes. That should have been her first clue. It sounded like a couple on one of those soaps his abuela faithfully watched on Univision.</p><p>Dear Sage,</p><p>Please call me Gage. Mr. Huntstone makes me sound old and you\u2019re not one of my \u2018men\u2019, so no 1st Lt. anything in our letters.</p><p>It\u2019s not too bad here. When the sun sets just right, the country looks peaceful and for a little while, a man can forget what he\u2019s been sent here to do. Sometimes, when I\u2019m going to sleep, I pretend I\u2019m at the ocean, drinking a Corona while listening to Sublime on my iPod. It\u2019s easier than you\u2019d think. My \u2018bed\u2019 is a hole dug in the ground since the only structures we have around here are a chow hall and command center.</p><p>I know it would probably be easier for us to chat on Skype or Facebook, but our internet connection is sketchy at best, and non-existent at worst. Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I don\u2019t have a Facebook page, and I don\u2019t use my army email for personal correspondence.</p> <p>Please keep writing me. I won\u2019t be able to respond right away the next few weeks or so, because I\u2019ll be heading up more missions into certain regions. Can\u2019t say when I\u2019ll be back, or even where I\u2019m going exactly\u2014mostly because I\u2019ll get in trouble (just kidding...sorta).</p><p>Keep me in your prayers; you\u2019re in mine.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Gage</p><p>Dear Gage,</p><p>I guess it\u2019s official\u2014we\u2019re pen-pals! Dare we identify our relationship to the world? It has been two months since we first \u2018found\u2019 each other.</p> <p>Although I appreciate your police description of yourself, I wish you would send me a real picture (your hand on the unit\u2019s adopted dog doesn\u2019t count and neither did the one with the gas mask covering your entire head). I\u2019d like a face to picture when I\u2019m writing to you...or thinking about you.</p><p>However, it\u2019s easy to imagine your brown eyes when I close mine. They\u2019re my favorite color eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry your dad and mom haven\u2019t written back, but at least you tried. If you\u2019d like I could write to them, or even drive to their house to talk to them in person. North Carolina isn\u2019t that big of a state, and you said you were from Alleghany County. I\u2019m sure I could find their house.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019ve been thinking more and more about your missions and how dangerous they are. It led me to do some research on the Army and I found out it has a patron saint. So, in the care package I sent you, I included a Saint Christopher\u2019s medal. You don\u2019t have to wear it, of course.</p><p>Missing and thinking of you,</p><p>Sage</p><p>Sweet Sage. That was one of the things he loved the most about her\u2014her soft heart. There would be no Sunday announcement. He would have to do things the old fashioned way, with some old-fashioned courting. By Christmas Day, he would have her in his life again. Permanently this time.</p><p>But first he had to deal with his parents.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Joaquin slowed his truck down, raising his brows at all the fanfare.</p><p>Balloons, cotton candy machine, jugglers\u2014jugglers?\u2014a stainless steel pig cooker where his dad stood serving up hotdogs and hamburgers, but overshadowing it all was a giant banner with the words, Welcome Home Our Hero, Joaquin!, strung from one end of the car lot to the other.</p><p>Now he was a hero?</p><p>After four years and not one damn letter or phone call, they were proud of him? Exhaling, he focused on what he\u2019d come here for. Besides, things could have changed. His parents really could be proud of him. Hell, knowing he was coming home today let him know they\u2019d gotten his voice mail. Maybe they had read all the letters he\u2019d sent, too.</p><p>He loved his parents\u2014despite what they had done to him, or maybe because of it. Kicking him out had forced him to grow up, to quit playing at being a man and skating through life with his family\u2019s money. Although if he had to be honest, there had been many times he wished he\u2019d had that security.</p><p>Scanning the parking lot as he parked his truck in an out of the way spot, he smiled faintly at all the balloons secured to antennas and the tops of open hoods, showcasing polished chrome head gaskets. On every vehicle parked on the strip of grass by the highway, windshields were covered with bright red and green lettering that proclaimed: \u2018Great on Gas!!\u2019, \u2018Great Family Car!!\u2019 or \u2018Great Deal!!\u2019.</p><p>The trifecta of sales, according to Juan Morales: Exclamation points, car swag and the overuse of the word \u2018great\u2019.</p><p>He allowed his grin to widen. Some things never changed.</p><p>Then he noticed all the discount car tie-ins to his homecoming and his grin faded. Some things really never changed and his dad\u2019s focus on the almighty dollar was one of those. This wasn\u2019t a homecoming; it was a sales gimmick. One that had probably driven Charles Caswell to price matching and cursing the day the Morales family moved to Holland Springs.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted his dad and turned.</p><p>Juan cooked hotdogs and hamburgers on a huge stainless steel grill, complete with twenty foot flagpole and gas burners on each side. Old Glory waved in the constant breeze as families stood near fake Christmas trees eating and talking. Families that were in no way related to him, confirming what he knew to be true.</p><p>What a fucking joke.</p><p>Joaquin backed the truck up, then found the nearest exit and sped away. He hadn\u2019t talked to his mom and dad in four years. What would another day hurt?</p><p>All that mattered was getting Sage back in his life\u2014permanently.</p><p>Sage sat on the steps of her front porch, her head in her hands when he pulled in the drive.</p><p>Joaquin cut off the engine and got out, slowly making his way to her. He shivered. In the last few minutes the weather had turned bitterly cold, so cold that he could see his breath.</p><p>Sitting down beside her, he left just enough distance between them so she didn\u2019t feel crowded and he didn\u2019t fall off the step.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said and she looked up at him, red rimming her eyes.</p><p>After wiping at her nose, she balled up the tissue and shoved it into her pocket, then gave a little sniff that shredded his heart. \u201cWhat for\u2014lying to me? Threatening to embarrass me? Leaving me four years ago, or for getting caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything, but the getting caught part only because I\u2019d come to tell you in person what I\u2019d done, but you\u2019d already found out,\u201d he admitted and rocked his neck from side to side, trying to relieve the tension that had been building up since is plane had landed. \u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin.\u201d</p><p>That certainly narrowed things down. He had tons of cousins living around Holland Springs. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto let it slip about the dog while he was cutting my hair last week.\u201d</p><p>He should have seen that coming a mile away. Roberto was Joaquin\u2019s mother\u2019s favorite nephew and hairdresser. Roberto loved to gossip with his clients. Hell, Roberto loved to gossip with anyone who\u2019d listen. Joaquin didn\u2019t know how Roberto\u2019s wife, Carmen, put up with him. The man never shut up about anything. \u201cI swear to God, the next time I see him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault or your mom\u2019s. It\u2019s yours,\u201d Sage pointed out. \u201cBesides, I\u2019d begun to suspect it a couple of weeks earlier. Still...\u201d She tucked and untucked a strand of auburn hair behind her ear, something she\u2019d always done when she was nervous. \u201cI\u2019d always wondered why things seemed to flow so easily with us. It was like we were old friends who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a while. It felt like...\u201d\u2014She paused, her eyes the color of rain on a dreary winter day\u2014\u201cwe were meant to be.\u201d</p><p>They were!, he wanted to shout. Instead he cleared his throat, struggling for the right words. \u201cIt was supposed to be my apology. A way to start over. Show you the man I\u2019d become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, you don\u2019t seem much different from the boy I knew.\u201d</p><p>A low shot from her, considering what he\u2019d given up for her. \u201cI\u2019d like the chance to prove to you that I am; that those letters were me, and I wrote what was in my heart. Consider spending Christmas with me.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cNo strings attached. No expectations\u2014just you and me as...friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn one condition,\u201d she replied, so softly that he couldn\u2019t be sure she\u2019d actually said the words.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d And he meant it. He\u2019d salsa butt naked down Broad Street if she wanted him to.</p><p>She held out her hand, the tiny diamond ring glimmering, making it hard to breath. \u201cGet this off of me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Coffee colored eyes blackened and his jaw hardened. Sage thought for sure Joaquin would say no. That he would stomp off and go brood.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he gently caught her hand and her breath hitched. She had missed his touch, but now she knew she\u2019d also craved it.</p><p>\u201cStuck?\u201d</p><p>She could only nod.</p><p>Holding it closer to his face, she could feel his hot breath on her skin, and she shivered. \u201cYou already tried getting it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything, but it won\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>He turned her hand sidewise, his brows coming together. \u201cThere\u2019s a raw spot on your knuckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d He kissed that little red spot and her eyes went wide. She tried to snatch back her hand, but his grip tightened. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn to get this ring unstuck.\u201d Then he did the unthinkable. He put her finger, ring and all, in his mouth and began to suck.</p><p>Good Lord, she didn\u2019t want to pull her hand away. Not only did she not want to pull it away, she let it stay there. She might had even let it slide deeper into the recess of his mouth. He swirled his talented tongue around the ring and her finger, making everything slippery and hot.</p><p>Oh, so very, very hot.</p><p>She placed one hand on her chest as it rose and fell. As if that could calm her wild heart.</p><p>He stared into her eyes as he licked and sucked on her finger, and to her mortification her nipples tightened. Unable to take his knowing gaze, she closed her eyes and simply felt. remembering their last night together:</p><p>His tongue licking the backs of her knees and between her thighs. His hands cupping her breasts and his fingers pinching her nipples. He\u2019d whispered how sexy she was, how beautiful she was, how much he loved her, before he thrust inside of her and the world went up in flames.</p><p>A moan slipped past her lips as his teeth grazed her skin, then cold air hit her finger.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open to find Joaquin holding her ring, longing and desire etched on his face. Her gaze dipped down to his lap. She drew in a sharp breath, then jerked her gaze back to his.</p><p>\u201cI told you I want you. Only you,\u201d he rasped, then a hard smile covered his face. \u201cI\u2019ll come by tomorrow and take you to breakfast, in public.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open as he tucked her ring in his pocket and walked away. She started to argue, but he stopped in his tracks. \u201cYou made the condition and it was met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said consider.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look and she let out a thick sigh. He was right. She had only made that condition because she\u2019d thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the ring off. She had gambled and lost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done playing games, Sage.\u201d</p><p>So was she. She thought she was finally done with him. Finally able to move on with a man the opposite of her should-have-been ex. For a long while she studied him. There were dark circles under his eyes, his mouth was drawn tight and weariness worn in the lines of his face. The boy she knew and had married wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing.\u201d His lips curled at the corner a little. \u201cRemember that letter I wrote about my mission to take wheat and water to the locals?\u201d She nodded and he continued, \u201cWe\u2019d been on the road sixty hours straight, taking turns driving and keeping watch. At one point, I fell asleep in the middle of a sentence I was writing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had wondered where those lines came from,\u201d she said on a smile.</p><p>He shifted from side to side. \u201cDo me a favor?\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cUm, depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I shower, then crash here for a couple of hours?\u201d He rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cI promise to leave afterwards. You can even call the nearest hotel and get me a room.\u201d A grin kicked up the corners of his mouth. \u201cI assumed you cancelled the one at Haven\u2019s\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and she\u2019s already rented it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Fairway?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she said, \u201cClosed two years ago. Mr. and Mrs. Bell are travelling around the country in an RV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d He frowned, then looked at her house. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you decorated for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Actually she had, but once she confirmed his deception, she\u2019d taken everything down and shoved it in her guest bedroom. The tree she\u2019d bought had been placed on the back porch. Only a love of all things living had kept her from chucking it in the forest, so she kept it watered. \u201cWhy bother,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and I planned on spending it at my parents\u2019 house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like your plans have changed,\u201d he said with a smile so smug that she almost reneged right then and there.</p><p>\u201cUs spending Christmas together entails family time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Grunting, he shoved his hands in his pocket. \u201cAbout that shower?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d fallen asleep sitting up on the sofa, head back with his mouth slightly open and his eyes closed tight, dark stubble on his jaw and cheeks. Unbidden, sympathy flooded her heart.</p><p>\u201cJoaquin,\u201d she whispered, gently patting on his arm. His lids opened and closed, drowsy eyes staring up at her. \u201cLet\u2019s get you comfy, okay?\u201d Snagging an afghan from a basket by the sofa, she shook it out and held it up.</p><p>A thick sigh left him as he stretched out on her sofa. She covered him up, resisting the urge to brush back his hair or kiss his forehead.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he rumbled, then yawned.</p><p>She smiled, pushing her glasses back in place. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Turning away, she moved to the kitchen to fix herself a pot of hot chocolate. In some ways he looked exactly as she remembered, while in others, she didn\u2019t quite recognize him at all.</p> <p>Joaquin hadn\u2019t been a bad guy. She wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with him if he had been. They\u2019d been young, stupid and head-over-heels in love, hiding their relationship from almost everyone for months.</p><p>The Morales cousins had loved to race her Caswell cousins as often as possible for pink slips. Somehow, they would all avoid getting arrested or ticketed by the sheriff, but that hadn\u2019t stopped most of the town from viewing them as rival gangs.</p><p>Apparently, this had amused the Moraleses to no end and they had perpetuated the stereotype by cruising through town in flashy cars with tinted windows while blasting rap music. Not to be outdone, the Caswells had driven jack-up trucks and serenaded Broad Street with Hank Williams, Jr and Lynyrd Skynyrd.</p><p>The summer before her senior year of high school, she\u2019d started sitting in the back of flashy cars instead of her cousins\u2019 trucks\u2014first with Mandy and a couple of other girls as sort of a dare. It had been fun and exciting to be with the Moraleses, their laughter and camaraderie contagious.</p><p>Every time she saw or talked to one Morales in particular, she couldn\u2019t stop the sweet thrill that had run through her body. They\u2019d been friends since middle school, deciding that their respective parents\u2019 problem with each other was just that\u2014their problem, not Sage and Joaquin\u2019s.</p><p>The more Sage was around Joaquin, the more she liked him, until like had turned into a full blown crush. Not that she thought anything would\u2019ve come of it. He was a year older and dated lots of girls, never settling for just one. She dated boys her parents approved of\u2014safe, boring and most importantly, not a Morales.</p> <p>She\u2019d never forget the way Joaquin had swaggered over to her, confidence gleaming in his smile when he asked her to go for a ride. She had said no for three weekends straight, until one night he\u2019d ditched his cousins and asked her out on a real date, one that had ended with them steaming up the non-tinted windows of his truck.</p><p>Sage frowned as she poured the hot chocolate into her mug and added tiny marshmallows to the top.</p><p>The second date, however, hadn\u2019t ended so well. Her cousins, Fred and Lloyd, had found them parking in the woods and called their daddy, the Sheriff. Uncle Neil had threatened to arrest Joaquin for trespassing, and her for breaking curfew.</p><p>From then on, they\u2019d sneaked around and headed out to Palm Beach to have their alone time. A month later and she\u2019d given her virginity to him. College hadn\u2019t stopped them from dating. There they could be a couple out in the open and Sage came home every weekend to see her parents, making them none the wiser.</p><p>One month after Joaquin had graduated from college, he\u2019d asked her to marry him and for one wild moment she\u2019d said yes, despite having one more year to go. They\u2019d driven all night, across several state lines to get married, then spent their honeymoon in a rundown, seaside motel with no hot water and only one working light.</p><p>It had been magical.</p><p>Turning from the counter with her cup of hot chocolate, she moved to the living room and stared at the man sleeping. Yeah, they\u2019d been young and dumb, but in love.</p><p>And now she was older and wiser. Joaquin didn\u2019t have a chance.</p> <p>Liar, her heart whispered</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>A gentle shake of his arm had Joaquin blinking and yawning awake. He rubbed his eyes and cracked the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSorry to wake you, but you need a driver,\u201d Sage slurred in his ear. \u201cI mean we need a driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a transfusion,\u201d another woman giggled.</p><p>\u201cIs that your professional opinion, Mandy Doctor, er, Doctor Mandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandy Intern is the correct ansher.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and sat up. Sage and her best friend since first grade stood beside the sofa, watching him. They both listed to one side at the exact same time. Dear God, he\u2019d bet his truck that they been watching a marathon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. \u201cWhich season?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBritish bras and slangs straps,\u201d Sage said, her brow wrinkling. \u201cWait, switch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you two a little old for drinking games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did it during the Presidential debates,\u201d Mandy said, her chin-length black hair glossy in the light. \u201cThere was this thing on Twitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know Twitter has its usefulness.\u201d Pushing the afghan to one side, he rose to his feet and stretched, then walked to the bathroom. When he returned, he found Sage wrapping a yellow scarf around Mandy\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s orders are to take me home,\u201d Mandy said, her eyes narrowing on him. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better be good to my girl this time or I\u2019ll scalpel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessage received. First, let me get my coat and warm up the truck.\u201d He glanced behind him and paused. \u201cI was going to say that you two get your coats, but...\u201d Mandy shoved a knit hat over Sage\u2019s head, covering her eyes, until Sage flipped up the edge. \u201cLooks like y\u2019all got it covered.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, they were on the road and heading into town. He glanced in the rearview mirror and shook his head. Mandy leaned against Sage, her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cAt least she doesn\u2019t snore,\u201d Sage said, her words remarkably not drunk sounding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked her,\u201d he said, his eyes back on the road. Spattering of rain and sleet hit his windshield. \u201cDo you usually pretend to be drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t in the mood, but Mandy was determined to cheer me up and I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her no. Mine were virgin.\u201d</p><p>Silence reigned as they entered the town limits of Holland Springs.</p><p>\u201cWhich street?\u201d he asked as the highway turned into Broad Street. Everything in Holland Springs was accessible from Broad.</p><p>\u201cLeft on Oak, then right on Poplar. There\u2019s a new apartment complex called Poplar View.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went all out with the name, didn\u2019t they?\u201d He made a left at the light, then sped up. \u201cWhat\u2019d the two of you talk about?\u201d</p><p>Sage snorted. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether Spike or Angelus is the biggest badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe give you any advice about us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe advice wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d Sage said, her voice firm.</p><p>A smile kicked up the corners of his mouth. If Mandy\u2019s advice had been to kick him to the curb, Sage would have relished telling him. Hell, he wouldn\u2019t have had to ask what they talked about. He glanced up at the rearview, catching Sage\u2019s eye. The reflection from the lights in the dashboard made her face glow.</p><p>\u201cI think you should follow Mandy\u2019s advice to the letter.\u201d</p><p>Sage rolled her eyes, but she didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mandy said suddenly, coming to. \u201cEspecially the part\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sage slammed her hand over her best friend\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, especially that part,\u201d he said, laughing. Then he parked his truck and helped Sage get Mandy into her apartment.</p><p>Joaquin drove back to Sage\u2019s house in silence, but at least his wife had deigned to sit up front with him.</p><p>He glanced over at Sage. Her posture was rigid and she had a death grip on the seatbelt. \u201cTrying to delay the inevitable?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Instead she stared straight ahead.</p><p>A couple minutes later, he pulled the truck in the driveway, cut off the engine and opened the driver\u2019s side door. Light illuminated the interior. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNo expectations, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her hands visibly shook as she searched her purse. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Sure, he\u2019d almost exploded when she let out that little moan while he was working the ring off of her finger. Hell, he\u2019d almost scooped her up and taken her to bed when a look of pure lust covered her face, but he\u2019d been truthful. He had no expectations of what would happen between them while he was here.</p><p>However, it didn\u2019t mean that something couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Auburn lashes free of mascara slowly lifted, revealing luminous eyes ringed in black and infused with distrust. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can trust myself around you.\u201d</p><p>A part of him wanted to pump his fist in the air, but the look in her pretty eyes made his gut clench, and he tempered his response considerably. \u201cThen trust me to not hurt you this time.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a brittle smile. \u201cYou\u2019re asking too much of me.\u201d Then she opened her door and slid out.</p><p>Grabbing his bag from the back, he caught up to her on the porch and took the keys from her noticeably shaky fingers, unlocking the door.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve worn my gloves,\u201d she said as he handed her the keys and their fingers brushed.</p><p>Her fingers had been toasty warm. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you next time.\u201d Opening the door, he said, \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>She slid past him and he followed, closing the door behind him with an easy back kick. \u201cSo where should I put my stuff?\u201d</p><p>Stopping in the middle of the living room, she pointed to a door on the right. \u201cThat room is mine.\u201d There was a noticeable emphasis on the word \u2018mine\u2019. Walking another couple of feet, she flipped on the light switch in the hallway. \u201cYour room and bathroom are down there, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He saluted her with two fingers and the hint of a smile played on her lips. Encouraged, he tried to make her comfortable. \u201cLook, it\u2019s eight o\u2019clock and I\u2019m starving. Any place around here deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue Moon delivers pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He dug his wallet out of his back pocket and held it out to her. \u201cMy treat. There should be enough cash to pay for the pizza and give the guy a tip.\u201d</p><p>Her brows raised, but she gave him a nod, walking so close to him that he could have touched her when she took his wallet. \u201cYou trust me not to spend all your money? Maybe go online and clean out your bank account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours...and you\u2019re mine.\u201d Deliberately, he let his gaze drop to her lips. Her pink tongue darted out and licked the bottom. He went rock hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how the saying goes,\u201d she said breathlessly. Her chin tipped up fractionally, but it was enough to make him step closer, so close that only a small distance separated them and he bent his head.</p><p>Her hand pressed against his chest and he trembled, imagining how it would feel against his bare skin. How soft her skin would be. How sweet her touch. It was everything he needed, softness and comfort. He dreamt of it, of her, night after night. The tangible and intangible\u2014the rarest of commodities while fighting a war. \u201cThat\u2019s how it goes for us.\u201d</p><p>Clasping her hand tighter to him, he watched as her lashes drifted down and her pink lips parted on a sigh. God, he wanted to kiss her. He wanted to devour her, mark her and claim her for his own. He knew that if he kissed Sage, he wouldn\u2019t stop until he was inside of her and she was crying out his name.</p><p>\u201cDo it already,\u201d Sage said. \u201cIt\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He jerked away from her. A bucket of ice dumped down the front of his pants wouldn\u2019t have been more effective than her words on his libido. There was no way in hell he\u2019d touch Sage now, not with her thinking herself a martyr, or that she was just a convenient piece of ass for him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because when we make love\u2014\u201dHe ignored her snort.\u2014\u201cit\u2019ll be for all the right reasons. It will be because you love me as much as I love you and want to stay married. I won\u2019t accept any less.\u201d He stalked past her, then paused beside the kitchen counter and tossed over his shoulder, \u201cThing is, Sage, I didn\u2019t drive for twenty-six hours just to fuck you. That I could\u2019ve gotten in Texas, without all the bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Sage made an inarticulate noise as he walked down the hall to her guestroom.</p><p>His wallet smacked the wall near his head, but he didn\u2019t take the bait. If Sage had wanted to hit him, she could have\u2014without trying. When they were in high school, she had been captain of the varsity girls\u2019 volleyball team and her deadly accurate serve had won many a game.</p><p>He calmly shut the door and locked it behind him. Time for Plan D.</p><p>Sage sat in the living room, pulling out the last of the Christmas decorations with jerky movements that sent a helpless elf flying across the room to land on top her fireplace mantle. She retrieved the elf, tossed in on the sofa and sat down in one of the large chairs by the bay windows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For over an hour, she\u2019d been out here alone. Blue Moon had called to cancel their order, because the roads had become too slick. Snow fell in thick white flakes beneath the yellow glare of the utility pole in her yard.</p><p>Curling her legs to one side, she balanced her elbow on the arm of the chair and leaned her jaw into her hand. She sighed, thick and loud enough for him to hear, but Joaquin remained in the guestroom. She\u2019d offered to fix him something to eat, but he had declined through the door. God forbid he actually open it and talk to her.</p><p>Although she couldn\u2019t exactly blame him for not wanting to come out.</p> <p>There had been no excuse for what she\u2019d done. She\u2019d never been a violent person in her life; never striking out at anyone with pure spite. The only reason she\u2019d missed hitting Joaquin in the head was her last second hesitation. The only reason she\u2019d thrown the wallet was because what he had said pissed her off. Instead of using her words, like she would have scolded her students for not doing, she resorted to throwing things.</p><p>But there was so much water under the bridge, and he\u2019d broken her heart once before.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she moved to her bedroom and pulled out the stack of letters she\u2019d left on her dresser. Briefly, she contemplated throwing them in the fireplace.</p><p>Her fingers traced the thin yellow ribbon holding the letters in one tight bundle. It could not have been true what he had written. She must have imagined the emotions in his letters, the heartbeats in his words and the love in every paragraph.</p><p>Determined to prove him a liar, she pulled out the third letter from the bottom and removed it from the envelope, then sat down on the bed and began to read.</p> <p>Dear Sage,</p><p>There are times when words cease to matter. When words cease to be able to describe the horrors I\u2019ve seen, the people I couldn\u2019t help and the rage I had to keep in check.</p><p>Today was one of those days.</p><p>But if I don\u2019t get it out, if I don\u2019t tell someone\u2014I\u2019m going to go out of my mind. If you want to stop reading now, I won\u2019t hold it against you; just the thought that you\u2019ve got my back and won\u2019t give up on me gives me comfort and keeps me sane.</p><p>It\u2019s a razor thin edge, sweetheart, but I\u2019ll keep walking the line for you.</p><p>Our mission was nothing unusual\u2014taking wheat and water to the locals, and keeping our eyes and ears open for any insurgent talk. I guess you could say we\u2019d gotten a little cocky, a little too used to ordinary days of war (if ever such a thing existed).</p> <p>Sanford was moaning about having to relieve himself every five minutes. Pretty soon the rest of the guys were joining in and I was the only adult. It reminded me of this trip I took to Miami with my cousins. What should have taken thirteen hours, ending up being almost twenty. I thought my dad and Uncle Cesar were going to lose it and kick us all out of the van before we hit Las Palmas.</p><p>Finally, growing so sick of their bitching and moaning, I ordered the convoy to stop and for everyone to get out. So we\u2019re all standing around, stretching our legs, but keeping an eye on things, when I see a local heading our way. He\u2019s walking all determined and I notice Sanford gets this funny look in his eye, before he starts heading for the local.</p><p>Everything inside of me is screaming that something wrong. I start shouting at him to get back, but that hardheaded ass doesn\u2019t listen. The local starts running away from us, I start running and so do three of my men. Next thing I know, Sanford tackles the bastard and there's a loud noise; moon dust starts flying everywhere and my ears are ringing. I\u2019m on the ground, sprawled on my stomach and coughing up sand. The whole situation is FUBAR.</p><p>Visibility is nonexistent, but I scramble to my feet and start shouting Sanford\u2019s name. My ears are still ringing and I start stepping on things, only those things turn out to be hands and feet and, well, you get the picture.</p><p>I found Sanford only a couple feet away, his mouth open and staring at the sky. He starts blinking, and so do I, because half his body is missing and he\u2019s bleeding out. The rest of our brothers join us, keeping watch and trying to get Sanford as comfortable as possible.</p><p>What I am supposed to tell his wife? His little girls?</p><p>Jesus Christ, I want to scream. I want to rip the bastard that blew up my brother into pieces, but he\u2019s dead. And the worse part, the biggest fuck you of all, was his death was instantaneous while Sanford held on while we waited for Medevac. All I could do was grip Sanford\u2019s hand and lie to him. Give him bullshit lines that everything was going to be okay.</p><p>Tell me, Sage. Write to me and tell me that what I feel for you is real\u2014that what you feel for me isn\u2019t a fucking dream. That I haven\u2019t been reading between the lines you\u2019ve written.</p> <p>If I\u2019m wrong, then feed me bullshit lines. Maybe that will fill up the hallow parts of my soul.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>JGage</p><p>So she had, but she hadn\u2019t fed him lines.</p><p>Dear Gage,</p><p>I love you.</p><p>No matter where you go, or what you have to do in this hateful war, I won\u2019t stop. You are a good man, an honorable one and I wish I could be with you.</p><p>I\u2019d hold you tight, so tight that you could feel my heart as it beats for you. Keep walking the line for me, but just know that I\u2019ll catch you if you fall and help you get right back on.</p><p>Since I can\u2019t be with you, I\u2019ve sent my emissary. She\u2019s soft and fluffy. There are some spots on the ears that are missing fur, but it only means she\u2019s been well loved.</p><p>A long time ago, there was a boy who loved a girl, and she loved him right back. Well, this girl wanted the ugliest looking bear you\u2019d ever seen. But to her, it was so ugly it was cute. Anyway, that boy, despite his grumblings, spent fifty dollars playing a rigged county fair game and won that bear. (A bear that they would later find out cost five dollars at Wal-Mart.)</p><p>Unfortunately, the boy and girl couldn\u2019t stay together forever\u2014no matter how much the girl wished they could have, so she took that ugly bear and slept with it every night, instead of the boy she loved.</p><p>Now that ugly bear\u2019s ready to give you sweet dreams, but only on one condition You have to deliver my bear in person when you get back. And you will come back. Come home to me. Spend Christmas with me...maybe even longer.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Sage</p><p>There was only one person she would have sent that ugly bear to and that was Joaquin, only she\u2019d been too much of a coward to admit it. He\u2019d all but shouted who he was in his last letter.....In every letter.</p><p>She owed him the chance to tell his side\u2014and she owed him an apology.</p><p>The house was quiet, only the hum of the refrigerator and warm air blowing through the vents made any noise. If the auxiliary heat came on, she\u2019d have to start using the wood-burning fireplace.</p><p>Taking a deep, shaky breath, she made her way out of her room and down the hallway. He didn\u2019t answer on the first knock so she tried again. She tried turning the knob, but it was locked; however, the key was sticking out on top of the frame and she made use of it.</p><p>Light from the hallway illuminated her way as she tiptoed to the side of the bed. She found him bare-chested, with the covers riding low on his hips as he slept. The St. Christopher medal she\u2019d sent him, hung on a thin gold chain around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped and smacked her hand over her mouth.</p><p>A guilty flush heated her cheeks. She really shouldn\u2019t be ogling the man in his sleep, but his body fascinated her. It was different than what she remembered, but parts of him remained the same. He was still lean, but new muscles from hard work defined his chest and arms, his abs and the dents on the side of his hips.</p><p>He mumbled, then moaned. His hands unclenched and clenched into fists. His moans turned into shouts as he tossed and turned in the bed.</p><p>Sage reached out, murmuring his name over and over as she lightly touched his face. Joaquin began to settle down and finally his breaths became less labored. She smoothed away the damp hair from the top of his brow. It had always grown fast. He had told her in his letters that he didn\u2019t have to keep it in a buzz cut anymore, because the Army had slightly relaxed its rules in order to attract new recruits.</p><p>She began to rise from the bed, but he grabbed her hand and held it to his chest. His skin was smooth and hot to the touch. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d His eyes slitted open. \u201cNightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay for as long as you need me, okay?\u201d She sat down beside him and he scooted over, making room for her. However, her hand stayed firmly in place. \u201cDo you wear that often?\u201d She touched the gold chain with her free hand, then placed her hand back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d As his eyes drifted shut, she thought he whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d Or had it been, \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart flipped in her chest and tears tightened her throat.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what he said, she knew what he meant. She slid down into the bed, lying beside him with his heart beating steadily under her palm as she breathed him in.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>He woke up with the unmistakable shape of a woman\u2019s breast in his hand and her ass tucked in his groin. Automatically, he pressed closer and pulled her tighter against him. The scent of vanilla invaded his senses as silky hair tickled his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSage,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d came her sleepy answer.</p><p>His eyes snapped open. Holy shit. He was in bed with Sage, and he was feeling her up. He let go of her breast like it was burning piece of coal . Which might not be far from the truth, because he was seriously hot, seriously overheated and in need of a cold shower.</p><p>Rolling away from her, he grimaced.</p><p>He scrubbed at his face, then rubbed his eyes. What a way to repay the woman who\u2019d helped get him through the night. He couldn\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d woken up sweating and grasping for his sanity. Sage had been there every time, whispering words of comfort and tenderly wiping his face with a cool cloth.</p><p>Not one time had she tried to get him to talk about what was keeping him up. There was the very real possibility that he might never share those nightmares with her, even if she knew the underlying cause\u2014Sanford\u2019s death.</p><p>After pulling the comforter over her, he slid out of bed and headed to the bathroom. A quick shower and shave, along with minty fresh breath, made him feel human again.</p><p>Glancing at the clock on his cell, he made up his mind to go for a run. He ducked into the guest room to grab his shoes. Sage mumbled in her sleep and he quietly padded over to her, placing his cell on the nightstand beside her glasses.</p><p>Waves of auburn hair spilled over her shoulder and along her face. He lightly touched her cheek, moving the bright strands to reveal smooth skin, highlighted with gold freckles. She stirred and he tucked the blankets around her, the way he had on their wedding night. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been so young, so convinced that their love would overcome any obstacle thrown their way. Except they hadn\u2019t counted on him acting like a spoiled child, then joining the Army as a big fuck you to his parents.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t counted on her to be a coward and stay in Holland Springs. He hadn\u2019t counted on her falling for her mother\u2019s full-press guilt. Hell, she hadn\u2019t bothered to even tell her family that they were married. And she was still afraid to rock the boat. .</p><p>Pressing his lips together in a flat line, he let his gaze linger on her, then walked out of the room, softly closing the door behind him.</p><p>The smell of the snow hit him first. Fresh and clean, not the acrid stench of death. Sparkling white and untainted, tempting him to plunge in headfirst, to see if it could do the same for him. If it could make him the man he was before he\u2019d kicked up the first cloud of moon dust, without blood and death on his hands. But like the Army shrink had said, Joaquin had to move past this, but not by forgetting. He needed to honor those who didn\u2019t make it out by living life fully.</p><p>Easier said than done, he thought with a grimace. But he would try with everything inside of him.</p><p>He stretched his calf muscles and arms.</p><p>Snow gave away easily as he began to run, his sneakers sinking deeper with each depression. Sweat trickled down his back and gathered on his brow. He ran until he couldn\u2019t, then he simply walked, hands low on his hips taking in great gulps of cleansing air.</p><p>Passing a Christmas Tree farm, he watched a family pick out the perfect tree. Little squeals and shouts as healthy children with rosy, plump cheeks ran around the place. Everyone had a Christmas cheer glowing about them as they wandered in and out of the rows of trees.</p><p>The mental container he\u2019d packaged those memories in tipped over, images spilling out and merging with the present. Scrawny arms and legs, stomachs distended from hunger, and brilliantly colored eyes rendered dull and ancient. Men and women\u2019s bodies riddled with tumors, with defeat and despair\u2014the most he\u2019d been able to offer them were words of kindness in another language, wheat and fresh water.</p><p>In less than a week he had to convince Sage that they made sense. That they still belonged together. Despite their past, they had a future.</p><p>If he failed, he wouldn\u2019t last a day.</p><p>Turning from the happy families, he began the long trek back.</p><p>Sage appeared in the kitchen as he flipped the last pancake, the comforter wrapped around her and her hair all tangled around her shoulders. Her rumpled appearance and cute black glasses made him want to take her back to bed and spend the rest of the day in it with her.</p><p>\u201cGood Morning.\u201d He looked at the clock on the microwave, then back at her and smiled. \u201cMake that \u2018Good Afternoon\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled up at the corners as she sat down at the bar. \u201cHi.\u201d The comforter slipped down around her shoulders, unfortunately for him she still had her shirt on from the day before.</p><p>Grabbing a plate, he filled it up with her favorites.\u201cBlueberry pancakes, cheese eggs and apple juice.\u201d Astonished eyes flew to his. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do after last night.\u201d He set the plate in front of her, then handed her a container of syrup before joining her. There was no use in being embarrassed about what had happened. She had seen him at his most vulnerable and stayed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d She shifted her gaze away from him, staring at a point over his shoulder.</p><p>Was she embarrassed?

In her attempt, their fingers collided.</p> <p>His throat caught on a sarcastic reply. He hadn\u2019t heard her laugh in four years. No, the times he\u2019d actually spoken to her on the phone had ended up with accusations, shouting and blocked numbers.</p><p>Abruptly her laughter stopped and she flushed, the guilty look in her eye reminding him of the time he\u2019d caught her spying on him skinny dipping with Angelica Braxton the summer before his senior year.</p><p>Grand plans of seducing the soon-to-be college freshman had dwindled to the size of his shrunken libido as soon as he\u2019d spotted Sage\u2019s fiery hair. He\u2019d shouted her name and half ran/swam to shore after her. The shrieks of laughter belatedly emitted by Sage and her best friend, Mandy, as they disappeared into the woods had added insult to injury. The beauteous Angelica had stomped to shore, put on her clothes and had given him the silent treatment the entire way to her house.</p><p>Clearing his throat, he pushed his eggs around on his plate. \u201cSo, I was thinking about what we should do today.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of apple juice, then speared a bite of pancakes. \u201cIf it includes long talks about our feelings, how you were wrong to deceive me and why we should give our sham of a marriage another chance\u2014count me out.\u201d</p> <p>Guess last night had been a fluke. Maybe he had imagined the tenderness in her touch and voice. Frustration simmered in his gut, but he kept his voice cool as he said, \u201cI was thinking we should take advantage of the weather today, maybe go pick out a tree and shop for presents. Tonight they\u2019re calling for sleet and more snow.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, she flushed even more and nodded at the back sliding glass door. \u201cI already have presents and a tree. I\u2019m sure you saw the boxes of decorations in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and followed her line of vision. A large Christmas tree sat on the back porch, its limbs devoid of decoration or lights. There had been three large boxes of decorations in the room he\u2019d slept in last night. She really had gone all out for Gage.</p><p>God, he felt like an ass.</p><p>Taking a last bite of scrambled eggs, he washed them down with coffee. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the tree inside.\u201d</p><p>Rising from the barstool, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p> <p>The smell of Christmas hit him, all pungent and nostalgic. Kneeling, he grasped the tree at the base and lifted it. Water sloshed around the bottom, making the tree extra heavy and awkward to lift.</p><p>\u201cTo the right,\u201d she said, helping him guide the tree through the door. \u201cNow three steps to the left.\u201d</p><p>His hip hit the stove and he grunted. A tree branch scraped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSorry, should\u2019ve been two steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn this into a life lesson, Joaquin,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Pursing his lips, he hefted the tree higher. Luckily for him, the ceiling in her house had been stripped down to the original exposed beams and allowed him to move the tree without scraping it. \u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the living room, right in front of the bay window. I\u2019ll get a sheet to put under it.\u201d He heard doors opening and closing, the sound of her footsteps. \u201cAll set,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He peered around the tree. Sage knelt on the hardwood, smoothing out a corner of a green sheet. Shuffling forward, he managed to place the tree exactly in the middle.</p><p>Exhaling, he brushed off his hands, then moved to the kitchen to wash off the tree sap. \u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to decorate it?\u201d She rose to her feet and moved to the iPod dock in the corner. Turning to face him, she smiled as she tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cI have a whole playlist of Christmas songs.\u201d</p><p>Just as he was about to answer, his phone buzzed. Drying his hands, he pulled it out of his side pocket and read the text message from his mother. Time to face the music. \u201cHow about tonight? When I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She shrugged, but disappointment clearly shone in her silver eyes before she turned away and began to rearrange the Christmas village on her mantle. \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>He strode to her, cupping her slender shoulders and turning her to face him. Her lashes fluttered down, skimming her cheekbones. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m not blowing you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019 doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYes it does.\u201d Hooking a finger under her chin, he lifted it up. A pink tongue darted out to lick at her top lip and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from doing the same. She gasped, her full lips parting at his touch. Never one to let opportunity slide by, he nipped at her full bottom lip. \u201cAsk me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands came between them, lightly resting on his chest. The heat of her palms searing him. \u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d He let his hands travel the length of her arms, then back up again to cup her elbows and pull her closer. Full breasts pressed against him, her hands drifting lower to grab the waistband on his jeans. He hadn\u2019t been with a woman in years, his determination to make something of himself and winning her back his only goal. Meaningless one night stands weren\u2019t part of the plan, which totally explained the hard-on pressing against the zipper of his jeans. \u201cAsk me.\u201d</p><p>What seemed like an eternity passed before she replied, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Sage expected him to go in for the kill, mostly because that\u2019s what she felt like doing, but she restrained herself, locking joints and tightening muscles. However, Joaquin had other things in mind.</p><p>He started at the base of her neck, his tongue and teeth working in tandem to make everything inside of her warm and gooey.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, not this time,\u201d he whispered against her jaw, pressing butterfly light kisses along it. He teased the corner of lip. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>And as if that was somehow a magical command, she did. In her next heartbeat, his mouth was sealed over hers and he was drinking her in. She couldn\u2019t stop kissing him, touching him, or moaning in his mouth. Four years of longing passed between them. In that moment time fell away, old regrets and new frustrations erasing from her heart with each toe-curling kiss.</p><p>Their tongues touched, then tangled as her body cried more. He was hard against her stomach and she touched him there, sliding her hand under the waistband of his loose jeans and caressing him until she was so damn weak in the knees that she all but thanked God when Joaquin swept her off of her feet.</p><p>Their mouths tasted and explored one another, remembering and showing exactly what the other liked as he carried her to bed. Don\u2019t think, don\u2019t think, she chanted in her head.</p><p>Her back hit the mattress, then the delicious weight of Joaquin pressed against her. Moaning into his mouth, she pushed at his shirt and sat up. \u201cI want this off.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on his calves, then gently removed her glasses and set them on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an order, soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he said on a laugh and pulled his shirt over his head, in the sexy way that men do. Tight abs greeted her and she kissed the center of his chest, rubbing her cheek in the crisp black hair. \u201cDamn, woman.\u201d</p><p>Tugging her own shirt over her head, she arched off the bed when his hands cupped her breasts. \u201cOh God.\u201d Her bra was the next to go, then their pants and underwear. Panting, she lunged for him, kissing, licking and biting at every inch of his skin.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d He lifted her to his face, slanting his mouth over hers and burying his fingers in her hair. This time he kissed her like a man starving. His kiss dominated, taking and demanding.</p><p>Heat and desire swept over her, tangling together. Four years she had missed this. Four damn years she had gone without a man\u2019s touch and kiss.</p><p>His hands coasted down her side, grabbing her hips and squeezing. His erection pressed against her sex as he settled himself between them. Kissing his way down her body, he stopped at her breasts, tugging on her hard nipples and sucking them deep into his hot mouth. She sank her hands into his short hair, her nails scraping as he growled low in his throat.</p><p>Suddenly, he shoved her thighs wide and buried his face between them. She screamed at the first pass of his tongue, then again when he sucked her clit into his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he said against her tender skin and slid a finger inside of her. \u201cOh hell, you\u2019re so damn tight and wet.\u201d Pulling her to her knees, he sank another finger inside of her and ordered her to move her hips. \u201cSo fucking beautiful. Look at us, Sage. Watch me fuck you with my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Helpless, she glanced down just as he added a third finger. She whimpered at the slight pain, but then his thumb brushed her clit and she bore down on his hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby...\u201d He caught a tight nipple with his lips and teased the tip of it mercilessly. Blood pounded in her ears. Her heart galloped in her chest. He bit down on her nipple and did something with his talented fingers that shook her entire body.</p><p>It all became too much.</p><p>Grabbing his wide shoulders, she held on for dear life; her body shattering into a million pieces as she moaned his named with one long exhalation of air that left her limp and weak.</p><p>Joaquin gently lowered her to the bed and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cKeep the bed warm. I\u2019ll be back in a little while.\u201d</p><p>As he moved away from the bed and picked up his shirt, she frowned. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to see my parents.\u201d</p><p>She gave a pointed look at his groin, where he remained hard and mouthwateringly ready for her. Of course she still wanted him. The orgasm he\u2019d given her was merely an appetizer. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d give you something to think about while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I won\u2019t get the image of that\u2014\u201d She waved her hand in the direction of his penis. \u201c\u2014out of my head.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin covered his face, wicked and full of desire. \u201cYou gonna do something about it?\u201d</p><p>Licking her lips, she nodded. \u201cI think I can help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did for me,\u201d she added, lest he think that what she wanted was something more.</p><p>His features turned grim for only a moment, then dropped his shirt and moved to stand beside the bed. She rolled to one side, facing him. A drop of arousal had formed on the tip of his cock. \u201cTaste me.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she took the head of him into her mouth and slowly caressed the length of him with her fingertips. He grunted and captured her chin. \u201cJust your sweet mouth.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes and lips, she took him deep inside, letting him set the pace as he held on to the sides of her head. Sucking harder, she let him hit the back of her throat and he cursed. She rolled to her hands and knees, and took him deeper.</p><p>She licked the hard length. \u201cWant more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d he said, his voice raspy and deep as she traced her name on the underside of his erection with her tongue. \u201cOpen up.\u201d She did as he commanded, her eyes closing once more as he breached her lips. Slowly and steadily he thrust his length into her mouth, his fingers curling in her hair. Doubling her efforts, she sucked on him until her cheeks hollowed.</p><p>\u201cI have to come, Sage. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>She caressed his balls, then lightly squeezed when he exploded in her mouth. The taste of him making her wetter and hotter, not stopping until he gently pushed her away. Licking her lips, she looked up at him and smiled. \u201cNow we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes were dark and guarded, not what she expected. Stepping away from her, he dressed in silence.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Probably the dumbest thing she could\u2019ve asked.</p><p>Looking at her, his mouth opened and closed, then thinned. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dropped to her toes, but she put on a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d be better than fine.\u201d Feeling more than exposed, she grabbed the throw at the end of her bed and wrapped it around her. \u201cI know I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take you for that kind of woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He paused at the bedroom door, his broad shoulders rigid. \u201cThe kind to play mind games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d She rose from the bed, one hand clenching the blanket around her and the other fisting. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who pretended to be someone who didn\u2019t exist. That was you, Joaquin. You. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd this hot and cold act is my punishment?\u201d He turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cYes...no. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She threw her free hand in the hair, then let it drop. \u201cYou messed with my mind and my heart. I was expecting Gage to be here at Christmas, not you. I bought him presents, not you. I decorated my entire house for him, not you. Yet you expect me to say \u2018It\u2019s okay Joaquin. I forgive you for breaking my heart again. I forgive you for lying to me.\u2019\u201d Her lower lip trembled, but she would be damned if he saw her cry. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>He took a step towards her. \u201cYeah. \u201c A shaky breath left him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for fucking up your life, for deceiving you. But most of all I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stay and fight for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you\u2019re going to?\u201d She bit at her bottom lip.</p><p>Another step and he was standing so close that he could almost touch her. He nodded. \u201cWith everything inside of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whirling away from him, she clutched the blanket tighter around her and placed her other hand over her heart. It beat a million miles a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me on this, Sage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI want my life to return to normal.\u201d The blanket slipped lower along her back, exposing a circular scar on her shoulder blade.</p> <p>Unable to help himself, he traced it and she shivered. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. It hurt like all get out,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>Sage had fallen on a floating log while knee boarding with her cousins on the Pamlico Sound. They hadn\u2019t been dating then, but he\u2019d almost swallowed his tongue when he\u2019d seen her fall.</p><p>Diving into the water to get to her hadn\u2019t been a second thought, or a regretful one. Not even when his cousins were catcalling him from their boat. Floating and holding her while she cried and bled all over his hand had nearly made him cry, too, as they waited for her cousin\u2019s boat to turn back around to get her.. A temporary truce had been brokered that day between the Morales\u2019 and Caswells, as they worked together to get them both out of the water and Sage to the closest emergency room.</p><p>A week later he worked up the nerve to ask her out. It had taken a little over three weeks before she\u2019d said yes. And only two weeks more to realize he was crazy about her. Only a month more to realize he\u2019d found the woman of his dreams.</p> <p>\u201cYou saved me,\u201d she added.</p><p>That he had. \u201cI need you to save me back.\u201d He kissed a bare shoulder. \u201cI need you, Sage. I\u2019ve brought all my worldly goods in that moving trailer. Holland Springs is my home and I plan on making a life here, with you. I want babies and t-ball games...and ballet lessons. I want you to yell at me when I track mud in the house or when I say something majorly stupid, then have make-up sex. I want to grow old with you and drive real slow on Sunday afternoons. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI need more time, Joaquin,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear, but she hadn\u2019t said no. \u201cYou can have more time, sweetheart, but I\u2019m coming home, to this house, when I\u2019m done talking with my parents,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll decorate the tree...Hell, we\u2019ll finish decorating the house like we\u2019re the Griswolds.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head, dark red strands falling forward, exposing the nape of her neck. An eternity seemed to pass before she turned to face him. Grey eyes soft like rain. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll need to tell my parents, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents already know,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason they disowned me and kicked me out of the house.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cI did, in my first letter to you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Pain sliced his heart like a knife. \u201cBut I mean then.\u201d</p><p>Tipping his head to the side, he asked, \u201cIs that why you keep all of them by your bed?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks turned red, eyes dropping to the floor. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI got them out to tear up in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Clenching his jaw, he fought to remain calm. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll be back later. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m on my way\u2014unless you changed your number again.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>Despite the rage and pain he felt, he kissed the top of her head and left the room.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Joaquin barely made it in the door before he was assaulted with hugs and kisses from his family. Aunts and uncles talking to him in a mixture of Spanish and English.</p><p>Jesus, he missed this. Almost as much as he\u2019d missed Sage.</p><p>\u201cMy baby!\u201d Mariela charged through the group, throwing her arms around his neck while she sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Guilt and relief flooded him. He hated not talking to her, hated that she\u2019d worried, but in his mind, she\u2019d chosen to side with his father- his stubborn, hard-head father.</p><p>He tightened his arms around his mother. \u201cI missed you, too, Mam\u00e1,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. Damn, but if he didn\u2019t feel like crying like a five year-old.</p><p>She pulled away, inspecting him from head to toe, her brown eyes liquid and filled with everything he was feeling. Her hands shook as she touched his face. \u201cYou look older...still my Joaquin though.\u201d Smiling, she patted his arm. \u201cToo skinny. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see my son,\u201d Juan boomed and the crowd parted like the Red Sea. His father strode up to him, proud and pompous as usual. Joaquin braced for the lecture and the insults. That he wasn\u2019t welcome at this house, the car dealership, yes, but never here.</p><p>Joaquin ticked up his chin. \u201cI\u2019m home and still married to Sage Caswell.\u201d</p><p>To his utter shock, his dad\u2019s face crumpled as thrust out his hand. \u201cForgive me. I was wrong. Forgive me, por favor.\u201d</p><p>Unable to move, Joaquin stared at him. There was a vengeful part of him that wanted to tell his dad to go screw himself. That he\u2019d had four years to ask for his forgiveness. Too little, too late. But the larger part of him, the part of him that his parents had instilled deep in his heart, and had been honed in the Army knew when to show mercy.</p><p>His father had bent; Juan Morales had swallowed his pride first. A feat Joaquin thought he\u2019d never see.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, pap\u00e1,\u201d he said, grabbing his dad\u2019s hand and pulling him in for a hug.</p><p>Joaquin sat at a table big enough to seat twenty, but his mother still had to bring in two more folding tables. It was amazing how easily he slipped back into the role of the doted upon son. His mother fixed his plate, his drink, and if he had let her, would have cut up his enchilada.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your wife?\u201d Juan asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t she be here celebrating, with her husband and family?\u201d</p><p>Mariela tsked, shaking a finger Juan. \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d Then she patted Joaquin\u2019s cheek. \u201cEat up, ni\u00f1o.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He speared a bite of chicken and green chilies. \u201cShe\u2019s talking to her parents, pap\u00e1 .\u201d Not wanting to hurt their feelings, he didn\u2019t add that he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d be treated here. \u201cWe plan on decorating our house tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecorating?\u201d his cousin smirked. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re calling it now days?\u201d</p><p>Carmen smacked Roberto on the back of the head. \u201cManners.\u201d</p><p>Joaquin bite back a grin at the couple. \u201cI should take you out back, Berto, for telling Sage.\u201d</p><p>Roberto toasted him. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Eying his mother, he leaned in and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and pap\u00e1 come over Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Mariela teared up once more. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stay long though, sales strategies to plan,\u201d his dad said around a bite of empanadosas. \u201cThe day after Christmas can be very good.\u201d</p><p>Mariela smacked the table and everyone grew quiet. \u201cNo, Juan. We will stay as long as Joaquin and Sage want us there. Sales can wait.\u201d</p><p>Joaquin fully expected his dad to storm away from the table, muttering and cursing in Spanish, but once more Juan surprised him. He wiped his mouth with a napkin, looked at his wife, then at Joaquin and nodded once. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Everyone resumed talking and eating, as though something spectacularly amazing hadn\u2019t just occurred before their very eyes.</p><p>\u201cGuess a miracle really can happen at Christmas,\u201d Roberto whispered to Joaquin.</p><p>\u201cDo they happen twice?\u201d Joaquin asked, his mind turning to Sage. \u201cBecause I\u2019m in need of another one.\u201d</p><p>It was just another Saturday night at the Caswells\u2019 house. Her aunts, uncles and cousins were hanging out in the rec room, shooting pool, playing Wii, and drinking at the built-in bar in the corner.</p><p>\u201cThat rat bastard\u2019s truck was seen at your house last night,\u201d her cousin, Rachel said. \u201cI got a set of keys ready and willing to write something pretty on the side.\u201d</p><p>Had her momma told everyone in the family about those letters? Struggling to maintain her composure, she lined up her Wii remote with the flatscreen. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to quit listening to Carrie Underwood songs,\u201d Sage said.</p><p>\u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted and appreciated, but Joaquin\u2019s being less rat-bastardly for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage, darling, come over here and sit with your momma.\u201d What was it about southern mothers that made them talk in the third person about themselves and no one called them out for it?</p><p>Handing off her remote to Rachel, Sage joined her mother on a gold sofa with large plaid pillows. \u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you insist on those horrible glasses? Contacts would do you a world of good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my glasses and I only need them to see far away.\u201d And since it was easier to keep them on all the time, instead of just when she needed them. Besides, it was another victory over her mother\u2019s insistence on what Sage should do, wear or act.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll call Dr. James and schedule you for laser eye surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Sage said, earning a pleased smile from Virginia.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Virginia handed Sage a manila envelope and smiled. \u201cMerry Christmas, sugar. Hope you don\u2019t mind it\u2019s early, but your Uncle Joe came by today.\u201d</p><p>Sage tilted the envelope to one side, dread making her heart pound. Uncle Joe was a divorce attorney in Charlotte. He was vicious and mean, and always got his client the most amount of money and custody, whether they deserved it or not. A stapled document slipped out.</p><p>After reading through it quickly, Sage shook her head and shoved it back in the envelope. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d married?\u201d</p><p>Tossing back a glossy strand of red hair, Virginia smiled sweetly. \u201cA mother always knows.\u201d</p><p>Meaning a mother that used her brothers and sisters jobs to snoop and spy on people knew everything about everyone. Was her dad that much of a push-over?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this. I think I want to try to work things out with Joaquin. He\u2019s staying at my house and we plan to spend Christmas together,\u201d Sage began, but Virginia suddenly went pale, her breaths coming out in little gasps.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she panted, her hand over her heart.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Sage shouted, moving to the end of the sofa to prop up her mother\u2019s feet. \u201cMomma\u2019s having one of her dizzy spells.\u201d</p><p>Charles came hurrying over, beer in hand, and a frown on his head. \u201cI\u2019ll call Doctor Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Virginia said, all breathless and pale cheeked. \u201cJust give me a minute.\u201d She sliced her gaze to Sage. \u201cYou know how my condition affects me.\u201d</p><p>For years, Sage had suspected that her mother used her asthma and heart murmur as an excuse to get her way, but she\u2019d never tested that theory. \u201cI know and wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a son-in-law like Joaquin to help out in times like these? Just think of all the things he could do with Daddy, so you don\u2019t have to worry?\u201d</p><p>Virginia frantically waved her hand in front of her face. \u201cOh, dear. I swear, my heart is beating so fast. Get me my pills, Charles.\u201d</p><p>Her dad hurried off</p><p>A warm hand clasped hers. \u201cSage, darling, I want you to swear that if anything happens to me that you\u2019ll take care of your daddy. He\u2019s looking at that Cutter boy to take over and who knows what will happen with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed Hank would buy Daddy out.\u201d</p><p>Long lashes fluttered closed. \u201cBut what would happen to my baby girl? You know those Moraleses will try to leave you high and dry. Better make the first move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should divorce Joaquin in order to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go, sugar,\u201d Charles said, kneeling on the floor with two pills and a glass of water.</p><p>Virginia took the meds and sipped at the water, flashing her husband a grateful smile. \u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>Sage rolled her eyes.</p><p>Her mother accepted a kiss on the cheek and waved her husband away, fixing her bright blue eyes on Sage. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you agree, Sage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy word...it\u2019s happening again,\u201d her mother said, cheeks even paler.</p><p>\u201cLet me think on it.\u201d</p><p>Her mother beamed at her, all signs of breathlessness and heart problems magically gone. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long. While Uncle Joe is family, he ain\u2019t cheap.\u201d Virginia rose from the sofa and made her way to the bar.</p><p>For a few minutes Sage watched her mother laugh and carry on as if she hadn\u2019t a care in the world or a heart problem. Had Sage really been that gullible? Rising to her feet, she grabbed the envelope and made her way upstairs to her parents\u2019 bathroom. In the medicine cabinet, she found her mother\u2019s pills.</p><p>They looked legitimate, with a prescription filled by Sage\u2019s Aunt Helen. She popped off the top and frowned. The pills looked exactly like the ones she had to take before she flew across the country by herself. Anxiety pills, Aunt Helen had told her, nothing that could hurt or form an addiction from taking a couple.</p><p>All this time, her mother had been taking anxiety pills?</p><p>Fury coursed through her. All this time, Sage had thought she\u2019d done the right thing by staying in Holland Springs with her family, because her mother needed her close.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told her mother about the marriage, only that he\u2019d asked her to marry him. Her mother had had one of those \u201cspells\u201d as she called them that had lasted for weeks. So Sage had stayed, and when Joaquin never came back to home to get her, or even try to convince her to come with him in person, she had just known she\u2019d made the right decision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just like she had known her mother had medical problems.</p><p>Sage walked to the toilet and opened the lid, then poured every damn one of those pills in and flushed, leaving the empty bottle and the manila envelope on the counter in plain view.</p><p>With her head held high, she left her family\u2019s house and drove straight home to wait for Joaquin.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Sage tackled Joaquin as he walked in the front door. He caught her up in his arms and she wrapped her legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sobbed, between kisses. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful and grateful and happy you\u2019re alive; you\u2019re healthy and home.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her back, murmuring, \u201cStop it. We were both young and dumb. Well, you were. I was most recently dumb.\u201d</p><p>A small bit of laughter escaped her lips and he drank it in. He only wanted laughter or happy tears with Sage.</p> <p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d she said, leaning back in his arms. \u201cI should have known it was you in those last letters, but I was too stupid to realize it and the handwriting threw me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to improve my penmanship during officer school,\u201d he teased, sitting on the sofa with her. She laid her head on his shoulder and he closed his eyes, sending up a prayer of thanks. \u201cGot hazed for my chicken scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to bed with me, Joaquin.\u201d</p><p>His cock stood at attention with that softly uttered command, but his brain made him say no. He wasn\u2019t sure what had changed her mind, but he couldn\u2019t have sex with her, only for things to fall apart when or if her parents or his decided to go against them.</p><p>\u201cWe should wait.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cLet\u2019s decorate instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you turning down sex?\u201d Disbelief colored her words. \u201cI thought it had been a while for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh it\u2019s been longer than a while.\u201d</p><p>Sage jerked up. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince June twenty-second, two-thousand and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since our wedding night?\u201d Her eyes were round and full of hope.</p><p>Hope was so his friend right now.</p><p>\u201cThat so hard to believe?\u201d He cupped her face. \u201cWe were still married and once I make a promise, I keep it. Although I will admit there were times I wanted to break that promise. Luckily, I got Rosie and her five sisters with me at all times.\u201d He waved one of his hands at her.</p><p>Her brows drew together, then understanding dawned. \u201cOoooh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t take care of business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI prefer to call it my happy time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would.\u201d He snorted. \u201cWish I could have seen you do it.\u201d</p><p>Glancing away, she nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cMaybe tonight.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, that would be perfect. Then she ground her sweet ass into his dick. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>Her fingers tiptoed their way down to his zipper. \u201cI can make it better.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk first, spend some time together and\u2014\u201d She ran her free hand under and up his shirt, caressing his chest. He swallowed a moan. \u201cTake things slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this afternoon?\u201d Her tongue touched the base of his neck and he struggled to keep his hands from going to the hem of her sweater.</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all about that, Joaquin.\u201d She kissed her way up his neck, then bit down on his earlobe, nibbling and sucking. \u201cLet go of my wrist.\u201d Taking a deep breath, he did as she asked and placed his hands on each side of her waist. She dropped back a little, looking him in the eyes. \u201cDid you ever come back here, after you left?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI drove up from Georgia the very minute I was able.\u201d It had rained the duration of his ten hour trip. By the time he\u2019d arrived at Sage\u2019s house and she still hadn\u2019t answered his calls or texts he had sent at every stop sign or light, he\u2019d been pissed off and unreasonable. \u201cYour mother wouldn\u2019t let me in and she said you didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d Hating the words that had damned her mother, he continued, \u201cI sent you letters and called you every damn chance I got. Even after Virginia sent me away and I got stationed at Ft. Hood, I kept writing and calling, until, well, that day.\u201d Hoping and praying that Sage would tell him to come get her. When he had finally gotten her new number from his cousin, Roberto, and had called, Joaquin had been a first-rate ass to her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get the letters or any of your calls while you were at boot camp and officer school.\u201d She rubbed her temples. \u201cI\u2019ve told you this a million times. The first call I got from you was in November and we fought the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Being served annulment papers tends to bring out the beast in me.\u201d He titled his neck to one side, then the other. \u201cDoesn\u2019t excuse my behavior. You didn\u2019t deserve to be talked to that way. I\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Tears glistened in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my mom kept me from getting your letters, and she\u2019s the one that dropped my phone in a tub full of water.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cAnd I thought she was being so nice for once, buying me a new phone and offering to pay for it, even though I had to get a new number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you got another new number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho kept giving you my number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighborhood hairdresser.\u201d</p><p>Sage made a face. \u201cHe would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Roberto can\u2019t help but be a romantic. It\u2019s the Latin in him.\u201d Joaquin smiled sadly. \u201cYour mom doesn\u2019t want you to ever leave Holland Springs. She pitched a fit over you going to college an hour away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, if I was adult enough to decide to get married, I should\u2019ve acted like a married woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should have acted like a man, instead of a spoiled brat who didn\u2019t get his way. It\u2019s called communication and I\u2019ve been studying up on it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her curious fingers roaming beneath his shirt and touching his stomach. \u201cI hate that it took a war to bring us back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love being here with you.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her, squeezing her tight. \u201cI love you Sage.\u201d</p><p>This time when she kissed him, he didn\u2019t stop her. He kissed her back, hungry and eager for the taste of her.</p><p>Time seemed to slow as he undressed Sage. He lowered her to the floor, in front of the fireplace, where her capable hands had started a fire. Staring at the lovely vision as firelight played on her perfect skin, he debated where to start first. His memories of this afternoon not even doing justice to the body laying before him, all lush curves. Everything about her was sexy and feminine, from her tiny hoop earrings to her red and green toe nails.</p><p>Now this was a homecoming every hot-blooded man should have with his wife.</p><p>\u201cYou have on too many clothes,\u201d she complained, her nipples tightening to hard peaks that begged for his mouth.</p><p>Leaning over her, he licked one and blew on it. \u201cBetter this way. Gives me time to have some fun. Studying what you like and what makes you hot.\u201d Her nipple tightened even more and he gave a low laugh. \u201cYou still like being talked to during sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste since you\u2019d never shut up,\u201d she said on a squeal. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just bit me there!\u201d</p><p>Stroking the side of her firm breast, he traced a lazy path down her body and stopped right where the thin strip of curls began. \u201cHow much do you want to bet that you liked me biting you there ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so\u2014\u201d His fingers parted her and she bucked her hips. \u201cSo not fair,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Touching her with the tip of one finger, he found her sleek and hot. \u201cAnd you are so damn wet.\u201d He slid two fingers inside of her, briefly closing his eyes as her tight inner muscles clenched. \u201cIn exactly five minutes, I going to put my cock right here and make you scream.\u201d Curling his fingers inside of her, Sage let out a moan. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to come inside of you, marking you.\u201d His dick pressed hard against his fly. If he didn\u2019t watch it, all of his talking would turn five minutes into five seconds. \u201cBut first, I need to do things right by you.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his mouth, he tongued her clit and teased the delicate folds that were open to him. All hot pink and wet and tasting like heaven. He feasted on her, until all he could taste, see and breathe was Sage. Until she was wild and pulling at his head while moaning his name.</p><p>Unable to take much more, he tugged off his shirt and shucked off his jeans and boxer briefs, before settling himself between her thighs. Placing his elbows on either side of her, he cupped her face and kissed her with a gentleness that he did not remotely feel. \u201cI have to ask. Are you on the pill?\u201d</p><p>Her legs parted and she coasted her hands down his back as she answered, \u201cYes and I\u2019ve been faithful to you, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deserve her, not for one damn second. Not for the way he\u2019d left her behind. But he would take her forgiveness, her apologies and work on making the next sixty years worth taking another chance on him.</p><p>One of her hands guided his erection to her sex. He sealed his mouth over hers, plunging his tongue and cock inside of her. Her body jumped, hands clenching at his back and her tight warmth surrounding him. She felt beyond wonderful, beyond anything. Being inside of her with nothing between them was a first for him. Hell, being inside of anyone without a condom was a first for him.</p><p>Rolling his hips, he kissed and held her close. He whispered to her in Spanish and English all the reasons why he loved her. He wanted, he craved to do the right thing, to speak of love and the future, but the more he thrust inside of her, the less he thought and the more he felt. The more he concentrated on her breathy sighs and sexy moans.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to say a word when she talked like that.</p><p>\u201cJust like that, baby. Move your hips.\u201d He kissed her jaw. \u201cI feel you tightening around me and you\u2019re so fucking wet.\u201d Sinking deep inside of her, he pulled a thigh over his arm. \u201cKnow you like this. I know how you like your legs on my shoulders and me pounding that sweet\u2014\u201d He groaned as her ankle hit his shoulder, opening her up to him in the most amazing of ways.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take much more,\u201d she moaned. \u201cPlease...I need you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching between them, he found her clitoris, pressing down and rubbing it firmly. She screamed his name. He joined her, driving deep and hard until he saw stars and shouted her name.</p><p>Sweat trickled down his back as he lowered himself beside her and enveloped her in his arms. He kissed her nose and watched as her eyes drifted shut. Then he did the same, thinking he could die a happy man right about now.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Over the next six days, Sage existed in her very own happy bubble. Not even a snowstorm could pop it. Oh no, being snowed in with Joaquin was pure joy, consisting of hot showers, making love in every room in the house\u2014including the kitchen table\u2014and decorating their tree.</p><p>Their tree.</p><p>She smiled dreamily out the window, watching as Joaquin gathered more firewood from the woodpile outside. Suddenly, he turned her way and gestured for her to join him. Dressing as quickly as possible, she ran outside and jumped into his waiting arms. He spun her around until she threw back her head and smiled up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cWanna build a snowman?\u201d he asked, setting her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cHow about a snow family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusband and wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a baby or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr three or four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Scooping up some snow, she threw it at him, hitting him squarely in the chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be fat and tired.\u201d</p><p>Brushing off the snow, he flicked some back at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be beautiful. And I plan on helping with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They worked together to make a snow family, complete with two kids and a snow dog.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put the carrot there,\u201d Sage said, pulling the carrot out of the bottom of the snowman and placing it on the face.</p><p>\u201cBut how will people know he\u2019s the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping a scarf around the snow toddler, he asked, \u201cHow would you feel about my parents coming over tomorrow? I asked them to spend Christmas Day with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Usually she spent Christmas Eve and Day at her parents. In fact she had planned on Gage spending it with them, but now she didn\u2019t want to spend Christmas with her parents. Heck, her dad had called two days ago to check on her, since Virginia had told him Sage hadn\u2019t been herself since that Morales boy had gotten back.</p><p>It had been all Sage could do to not give her dad the real story. Instead she\u2019d asked how Virginia was doing and if Charles was going to fry a turkey this year. They avoided the big question of whether or not Joaquin would be welcome at their house.</p><p>Sage still felt like a coward for not bringing it up.</p><p>\u201cGuess I should have talked to you first, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Your parents are more than welcome to come over. Just...I usually spend Christmas at my parents, and this year\u201d\u2014She shrugged.\u2014\u201cI\u2019m all up in the air with my plans.\u201d</p><p>Catching her hand with his, he laced their fingers together as they walked back to the house. Their boots crunched in the snow as they walked. A stiff breeze lifted the hair sticking out of the bottom of her knit hat.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of dinner tonight. I\u2019ll grill some steaks. You know, manly stuff involving fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it. While you do that I\u2019ll finish decorating Christmas cookies and wrapping presents.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blast of warm air greeted them as they walked in the side door. Kicking off their boots and hanging up the coats, scarves and hats, they made their way to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cCrazy weather, huh?\u201d</p><p>Joaquin rolled his shoulders and sliced his gaze to her. \u201cHave we already come to this: Boring weather talk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, cause it snows all of the time in eastern North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Hollands put a spell on the weather,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one Holland in particular is finally going to get her happily ever after for Christmas.\u201d Sage sighed and held out her hands, wiggling them. \u201cRose certainly deserves it, after all the trouble she goes to helping everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anyone you would know.\u201d Sage grinned at him. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, charming, blonde, and has an English accent. Something every American girl loves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you like tall, dark and Cuban then,\u201d his voice deepened as he turned her to face him, his hands on her hips. \u201cAnd I know what my Southern accent does for you.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her chin, she stood on her toes. \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous.\u201d</p><p>His hands moved up her body, following the curves of her waist to cup her breasts, thumbs rubbing the tips of her them through her shirt until her nipples tightened. \u201cShow me why I shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Taking one of his hands, she led him to the chair by the window. She slid off her glasses and placed it on the windowsill. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving orders to a Lieutenant in the Army, Mrs. Morales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer Lieutenant, Mr. Morales. Now strip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Grinning big, he took of his pants, socks, and blue thermal shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my salute?\u201d she asked before pulling her sweater over her head. Her jeans and panties hit the floor next.</p><p>He nodded at his erection. \u201cI\u2019m standing at attention right now.\u201d</p><p>As she bent down to tug off her non-cooperating socks, she nipped the head and stood up. \u201cThat you are.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Joaquin whirled her around and bent her over the side of the chair. \u201cI know you were trying to teach me something, but I\u2019m no good at learning when all I can see is naked breasts.\u201d He parted her, finding her shamelessly wet. \u201cSo I\u2019ll show you why some pansy-ass foreigner will never be a threat to me.\u201d</p><p>He drove into her with a hard thrust, his hands coming around to massage her breasts and tease her nipples. She gasped and shoved back against him, wanting him deeper. Wanting him to never leave her again.</p><p>She moaned her approval of his methods.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re letting do this, right here in front of the window where anyone could see you.\u201d He kissed her back and bit her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t...many people on the road...today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s that coming up your driveway?\u201d</p><p>She heard the unmistakable and slightly muted sound of a car engine and tires crunching gravel.\u201cWhat?\u201d She tried to rise, but he placed a large hand on back and pushed her down, then smacked her butt. She shot him a dirty look over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah. You wanted to make me jealous. Mission accomplished, baby.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she felt her cheeks flush. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m sorry. Can we stop?\u201d Yet even as she said those words, she arched her hips to take him deeper.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to stop, baby.\u201d He slid halfway out of her and coasted a hand around her thigh, finding her swollen clit. Brushing it lightly, he resumed his pace, keeping her on edge. A knock sounded on the door. \u201cShould I tell them to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your eyes closed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had squeezed them shut at the first knock.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He lifted her to a semi-standing position, his forearm across her chest, the pace of his thrusts maddeningly slow and steady.</p><p>Another knock on the door had her face heating.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call persistent.\u201d Once more, Joaquin teased her swollen flesh and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cPeeking in your windows is going to give Hank Cutter quite a show.\u201d He nibbled on her ear and adjusted her position. Sunlight hit her eyelids and she knew they were in full view of the bay window. \u201cHe\u2019s watching us now. Watching me touch your breasts and between your thighs.\u201d Joaquin\u2019s hands roamed her body doing everything he described to her in detail. \u201cJesus, Sage, you just got wetter. Put one of your arms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>Lifting an arm, she placed them behind his neck and he gripped her hips. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. Show me...him, how beautiful you are when you come.\u201d Of its own accord, her free hand slipped down to do just that. \u201cOh fuck...Sage,\u201d he groaned as she orgasmed. As she shook and cried out her release.</p><p>He pushed her down and over the side of the chair again, pounding into her so hard that she gripped the other side and chanted his name. One last hard thrust and he cursed in English and Spanish, then rested on top of her. Their skin was slick between them. Against her back she could feel his heart beat in time with hers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. All\u2019s clear now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open as she stood. Joaquin slid her glasses into place and stepped back. She gasped. There was no one at the window or even a car in her driveway. Mouth gaping and heart beating frantically she said, \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knocked on the door and took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A wicked grin kicked up the corners of his sexy mouth. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d let anyone watch us? Especially that horn-dog Hank Cutter. Back in the day, he couldn\u2019t stop talking about you in the locker room. Dumbass tried to tell everyone you\u2019d been screwing him in his brand new truck. He hasn\u2019t changed one bit. According to Roberto, Hank\u2019s been going around and saying that y\u2019all are becoming...how did he put it\u2014oh yeah, reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d This was the man her mother had been trying to push on her and their family business? \u201cI guess you found out the truth when we had sex the first time. Although now you\u2019ll just have to take my word that Hank and I haven\u2019t been getting reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess Hank couldn\u2019t see out of one eye for days after he said that shit in high school. Coach hadn\u2019t been too happy about his star pitcher not being able to throw the ball right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that for me? Before we were together?\u201d Her heart swelled. She loved him so much, but she couldn\u2019t make bring herself the words.</p><p>\u201cReal men don\u2019t need to brag.\u201d Joaquin pulled his shirt over his head and snapped his jeans. \u201cI believed you when you said you\u2019d been faithful. No need to defend yourself to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for the other, I\u2019m honored as hell I was your first, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he added, tugging her closer. \u201cI was in love and I\u2019m still in love.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him tight, not letting go even as the phone rang. She should just woman-up and admit that she loved him. \u201cJoaquin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The answering machine kicked on, her mother\u2019s voice ringing loud and clear. \u201cSage, this is your momma. We\u2019ll be eating at two tomorrow, on account that your Uncle Joe will be joining us. You can sign the divorce papers while you\u2019re here and he\u2019ll file first thing Tuesday morning.\u201d</p><p>Sage began to shake as Joaquin stiffen in her arms. Then his stance relaxed and he began to stroke her back.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ve gotten that boy out of your system and come to your senses, Sage Charles Caswell. Cold feet are not what a Caswell is about.\u201d Virginia\u2019s voice sweetened to honey. \u201cSee you tomorrow at two, sugar. Unless you\u2019ve decided to betray your family and stay married to him.\u201d The answering machine clicked off.</p><p>\u201cStill going for the drama, I see,\u201d Joaquin said, his hands still gliding up and down her back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not signing those papers. I didn\u2019t hire Uncle Joe. She did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first got here you told me that we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had planned on divorcing you...so I could be with Gage.\u201d Unbidden, tears slipped down her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019d hired a local guy to re-file the papers. All I had to do was sign, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBecause I had to know that Gage was worth it, in person and not just in his letters. That what I would be giving up, my last tie to you, didn\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. I thought it didn\u2019t, but your last couple of letters were different. It was like you were trying to get me to figure it out. Then Roberto just happened to mention that one of the guys in your unit took home a dog named Gage with him,\u201d she said, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cI tore up the papers and told Sam Vance I didn\u2019t need his services anymore. You were coming home to me, you were safe and alive and-and I couldn\u2019t not give us another chance. Then I saw you at the parade...I was so angry and confused and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lifting her chin with the crook of his finger, he smiled down at her. \u201cStop beating yourself up. We\u2019re done with that part of our life. You saved my ass in Afghanistan, with your letters, and with that fugly bear I won for you. Guys kept calling me Huggy Bear when they found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have sent that to anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What matters the most is that we\u2019re together. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Cold dread sliced through her happiness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop you or give you a hard time for going to spend Christmas Day with your parents. They\u2019re family, my family too.\u201d He let go of her, walked to the kitchen counter and grabbed the phone. Holding it out, he said, \u201cCall them and say you\u2019ll be there for Christmas. I\u2019ll spend it with my parents. I\u2019m not going to make you choose between us.\u201d</p><p>Hand trembling, she took the phone. \u201cLet me shower and change first.\u201d</p><p>Joaquin took a deep breath as she punched in the number on the phone. This was it. His last Plan. He\u2019d had so many in the past week that by now he was probably up to letter X.</p><p>Though he meant what he\u2019d said to Sage, a small part of him wanted to be chosen over them. She picked them over him before, always the good daughter, dutiful and loyal to her parents. So easily made to feel guilty about the smallest of things.</p><p>God he nearly hated them right now.</p><p>\u201cMomma,\u201d Sage said, breaking though his thoughts. \u201cNo...No! Let me speak, then you say what you want or hang up.\u201d</p><p>Raising his brows, he leaned against the wall and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cNumber one: I\u2019m not signing any papers. So you can tell Uncle Joe to put them through the shredder in Daddy\u2019s office. Number Two and most important: I\u2019d be happy to come over on Christmas Day with my husband. We\u2019re a package deal.\u201d</p><p>Astounded, he had to make himself stay right where he was and not take the phone from her, throw it across the room and march her into their bedroom.</p><p>He watched as his wife\u2019s lower lip trembled and her shoulder shook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but...\u201d Suddenly, Sage\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cStop it. I refuse to be a part of your drama.\u201d</p><p>Would it be too much to start clapping for Sage? He winked at her in encouragement.</p><p>\u201cHowever, if you and Daddy would like to come over to our house tomorrow, y\u2019all are more than welcome.\u201d Then Sage hung up the phone and gave him a shaky smile.</p><p>He went to her then, arms wide open. She snuggled right up against him, her slender arms holding on tight. \u201cProud of you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever fussed at my momma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good.\u201d Actually, she was spectacular, but didn\u2019t think she\u2019d want him crowing over her putting Virginia in her place. \u201cReady to make some of our own Christmas memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re off to a pretty good start.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her hair. \u201cYou know when I was in the \u2018Stan, I saw a falling star one night, then about a dozen more right after it. One of the prettiest things I\u2019d ever seen in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make lots of wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one.\u201d He dipped his head, his lips inches from hers.</p><p>\u201cDid it come true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see in a minute.\u201d Smiling, he fished her engagement ring out of his pocket and slipped on her finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never taking this off again.\u201d She smiled at him, her lips trembling. \u201cI love you, Joaquin, with everything inside of me.\u201d</p><p>His heart felt near to bursting right about now. Words he\u2019d longed to hear from her, in person, had finally been said and she meant it. He blew out a steadying breath. \u201cLooks like my wish came true.\u201d He captured her mouth with his and kissed her.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Christmas Day, One Year Later</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re under the mistletoe,\u201d Joaquin said to his wife as she passed him in the living room. He grabbed her, rubbing a hand over her belly and bending to press a kiss to it. A swift kick had him stumbling back and laughing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s too happy with you getting in the way of his dinner,\u201d Sage laughed.</p><p>\u201cA Morales though and through,\u201d Juan said, raising his glass.</p><p>Joaquin shook his head. \u201cI think she is happy to hear her daddy.\u201d</p><p>After the first miracle Joaquin had received, he hadn\u2019t expected to be blessed with more. But last year, after a bittersweet Christmas due to Sage\u2019s parents not joining them, Charles had shown up on New Year\u2019s Eve, with Virginia and an apology. Since then, some things had remained the same, while others had gotten better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhile I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to know the sex,\u201d Virginia said with a sniff. \u201cThe nursery needs to be finished and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I agree, Virginia,\u201d Mariela said, placing a hand on the other woman\u2019s. \u201cThese two want it to be a surprise. How much more surprised can you get?\u201d</p><p>Sage\u2019s best friend, Mandy, waddled around the room, stopping by her husband and giving him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cTry finding out you\u2019re having twins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKevin almost fainted, you said.\u201d Sage winked at Mandy and her husband.</p><p>Kevin grinned like a happy fool and shook his head. Joaquin recognized that smile, because he sported it himself twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>\u201cHave y\u2019all picked out any names?\u201d Charles asked, grabbing a gingerbread man from the tray on the table. \u201cMy grandfather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this again,\u201d Juan said with a roll of his eyes. \u201cThe baby will be named after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew, after both great-grandfathers,\u201d Sage said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be Mateo when he is with me,\u201d Juan muttered, then his eyes widened. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy?\u201d</p><p>Joaquin put his arms around Sage as their parents and friends rushed to them, hugging and laughing.</p><p>\u201cFinally, this stupid feud can be put to rest,\u201d Mariela said, wiping her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause joining our businesses together wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d Joaquin asked. It had been his idea to merge. Both companies had what the other wanted. Except his dad had room to spare while Charles\u2019 dealership was slowly being zoned into residential and small shops, with the city\u2019s downtown revitalization plan that it didn\u2019t fit in.</p><p>Charles gave Joaquin a hearty clap on the back. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re in charge, son.\u201d</p><p>Sage snorted. \u201cSo why do you and Juan keep going to the office?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone has to make sure he doesn\u2019t run us into the ground,\u201d Juan said and Charles nodded.</p><p>\u201cGive my son-in-law some credit,\u201d Virginia suddenly said, shocking everyone into silence. \u201cWhat...a zebra can change its stripes. Besides, it\u2019s all about tiger prints this year.\u201d</p><p>Joaquin grabbed Sage\u2019s hand and led her to the nursery. Soft yellows, greens and blues greeted them. A crib made of natural wood still in its box sat in the corner.</p><p>\u201cOne more month, and then it\u2019s not just us,\u201d Sage said, her red hair brushing his shoulder as she passed by him. She picked up a stuffed giraffe and tossed it to him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was getting kinda of tired talking to you anyway. We need some excitement around here.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she moved to him and kissed his cheek. \u201cMerry Christmas, Mr. Morales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mrs. Morales.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
