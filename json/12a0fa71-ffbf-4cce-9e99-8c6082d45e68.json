The very, very best. Which is why I don't understand all the literature, how the vampires are usually these moody fellows who rue the day they ever got bitten, who pray for some illiterate European to plant a stake through their ribs. Rue the day? If the mob hadn't torched my killer the next night, I'd have kissed his feet. I'd even have kissed his behind!</p><p>\"After all, what else was there for me? Take over the farm when my father died?</p><p>No, thank you. Farming is back-breaking work for very little reward, and even less respect. And I could hardly endure being in the same room with my father, much less work for him the rest of my life. (Punch first and punch second, that was my dear departed papa's motto.)</p><p>\"Lie about my age to join the army, and get my head blown off? (All so sixty years later we can ignore the Holocaust and pretend the Germans are good guys?) But back then, if you didn't fight you were a coward. Of course, two wars later the young men were encouraged to go to Canada, to avoid responsibilities to their country. If they fought, and lived, their reward was to be spit upon at the airport. It just goes to prove, nothing changes faster than the mind of an American.</p><p>\"No, life wasn't exactly a bowl of fresh peaches. I was in a box, and each side of the box was equally insurmountable. I wasn't the only one, but I was the only one who noticed the shape and size of the prison. I was always different from my chums. At least, I think I was...it was a long time ago, and don't we always think we're different?</p> <p>\"So when Darak-that was his name, or at least the name he gave me-bought me a drink, then two, then ten, I didn't turn him down. What did I care if a stranger wanted to help me forget about the box? I was big-twenty-three years working on a farm made for a big boy-and if he wanted to get inappropriate, I was sure I could handle it.</p><p>\"Yes, there was homosexuality in the forties. People like to pretend it's a modern invention, which always makes me laugh. Anyway, I figured Darak wanted to see what I had inside my drawers, but I had no intention of showing him-what men did with other men was none of my concern. Of course, my drawers weren't what held his interest at all.</p><p>\"I'd been supremely confident I could toss Darak through a window if I needed to, which just goes to show I was something of a na?ve moron when I was a boy. Darak took what he needed from me, and never mind pretty words or even asking permission.</p><p>He stopped my heart and left me on a filthy floor to breathe my last. The last thing I remember was a rat scampering across my face, how the tail felt, dragging across my mouth.</p><p>\"I woke up two nights later. It was dark and close, but in a stroke of luck I hadn't been buried yet. I didn't know it then, but the town's only mill had blown up, and there were forty bodies to be interred. Plus they'd cornered Darak and set him on fire. Yes, things had been positively hopping in the small town of Millidgeville, pop. 232 (actually 191 now). They were in no rush to get me in the ground. They had more important things to worry about.</p><p>\"I was thirstier than I had ever been in my life. And strong...I meant only to pop open the door to the coffin, and ended up ripping it off the hinges. I lurched out of the coffin and realized instantly where I was. And I knew what Darak was...I'd read Bram Stoker as a teenager. But even through the mad haze of my unnatural-or so it seemed to me then-thirst and the disbelief of my death, the main thing I remember is the relief. I was dead. I was free. I silently blessed Darak, and went to find someone to eat.</p> <p>\"Being a vampire is wonderful. The strength, the speed, the liquid diet...all solidly in the plus column. The minuses-no sunbathing (so?), sensitivity to light (sunglasses fixed that nicely), no real relationships other than those of a transitory nature (callgirls!)-are bearable.</p><p>\"I miss women, though. That's probably the worst of it. No more sunsets? Phaugh. I saw plenty of them on the farm. But I haven't had a girlfriend since...er...what year is it? Never mind.</p><p>\"I can't be with a mortal woman, for obvious reasons. She'd never understand what I was, what I needed. I'd constantly fear hurting her-I can lift a car over my head, so being with a mortal woman is not unlike being with a china doll. And being dead hasn't affected my sex drive one bit. I was a young man of lusty appetite, and while I still look young, my appetite has increased exponentially with my age.</p><p>\"I've only met six other vampires in my life. Of the six, four were women, and let me tell you, they were complete and unrepentant monsters. They ate children. Children!</p><p>I killed two, but the other two got away. I could have gone after them, but I had to get the child to a hospital and-well, I wouldn't have wished their company on my fiercest enemy, much less welcomed them to the marriage bed.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm lonely. Another price to pay for the eternal life and the liquid diet. But I'm young for a vampire-not even close to a hundred yet. Things are bound to look up.</p><p>And even if they don't, my patience-like my thirst-is infinite.\"</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>A monkey. A fucking monkey!</p><p>Janet Lupo practically threw her invitation at the goon guarding the doors to the reception hall. Bad enough that one of the most eligible werewolves in the packthe world!-was now off the market, but he'd taken a pure human to mate. Not that there was anything wrong with that. Humans were okay. If you liked sloths.</p><p>She stomped toward her table, noticing with bitter satisfaction the way people jumped out of her path. Pack members walked clear when she was in a good mood.</p><p>Which, at the moment, she was not.</p><p>Bad enough to be outnumbered a thousand to one by the humans, but to marry one? And fuck one and get it pregnant and join the PTA and...</p><p>The mind reeled.</p><p>Janet had nothing against humans as a species. In fact, she greatly admired their rapaciousness. Homo sapiens never passed up prey, not even if they were stuffed-not even if they didn't eat meat! They'd kill each other over shoes, for God's sake. They had fought wars over shiny metals and rocks. Janet had never understood why a diamond was worth killing over, but a pink topaz was hardly worth sweating about. Humans had fought wars over the possession of gold, but iron ferrite, which looked exactly the same, was worthless.</p><p>And when humans started killing, watch out. Whether it was \"Free the Holy Land from the infidels!\" or \"Cotton and Slave's Rights!\" or \"Down with Capitalism!\" or whatever was worth mass genocide, when humans went to war, your only chance was to get out of the way and keep your head down.</p><p>But marry one? Marry someone slower and weaker? Much, much weaker?</p><p>Someone with no pack instincts, someone who only lived for themself? It'd be-it'd be like a human marrying a bear. A small, sleepy bear who hardly ever moved. Fucking creepy, is what it was.</p><p>And there was Alec, sitting at the head table and smirking like he'd won the lottery!</p><p>And his mate-uh, wife-sitting next to him. She was cute enough if you liked chubby, which the boys in the pack did. A bony wife wasn't such a great mother when food was scarce. Not that food was scarce these days, but thousands of years of genetic conditioning died hard. Besides, who wanted to squash their body down onto a bundle of sticks?</p><p>Okay, there wasn't anything wrong with her looks. Her looks were fine. So was her smell-like peaches packed in fresh snow. And the bimbo knew what she was getting into-her old lady had worked for Old Man Wyndham, way back in the day-so the whole family had experience keeping secrets. But to call a sloth a sloth, the new Mrs.</p><p>Kilcurt was not pack. Wasn't family. And would never be, no matter how many cubs Alec got on her.</p><p>Jesus! First the pack leader-Michael-knocked up a human, and now Alec Kilcurt.</p><p>Didn't any of her fellow werewolves marry werewolves anymore?</p><p>\"Dance, Jane?\"</p><p>\"I'd rather eat my own eyeballs,\" she said moodily, not even looking to see who asked. Why was she going to her table, anyway? The reception wasn't mandatory.</p><p>Neither was the wedding. She'd just gone to be polite. And the time for that was done.</p><p>She turned on her heel and marched out. The goon at the door obligingly held it open. Which was just as well, 'cuz otherwise she'd have kicked it down.</p><p>Janet vastly preferred Boston in the spring, and as cities went, Boston was not awful. Parts of it-the harbor, the aquarium-were actually kind of cool.</p><p>Thinking of the New England Aquarium-all those fish, lobsters, squid, and sharks-made her stomach growl. She'd been too annoyed to eat lunch, and when she had walked out of the reception, she had also walked out on her supper.</p><p>She turned onto a side street, taking a short-cut to Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant that did not suck. She'd have a big bowl of clam chowder, and some raw oysters, and a steak, and a lobster. And maybe something for dessert. And a drink. Maybe three.</p><p>A scent caught her attention, forcing a split-second decision. She turned onto another street, one much less crowded, curious to see if the men were going to keep following her.</p><p>They were. She hadn't seen their faces, just caught their scents as they swung around to follow her on Park Street. They smelled like desperation and stale coffee grounds. She was well dressed, and probably looked prosperous to them. Prime pickings.</p><p>She turned again, this time down a deserted alley. If the two would-be robbers thought they were keeping her from supper, they were out of their teeny, tiny minds.</p><p>She could easily outrun them, but that would mean kicking off her high heels. The stupid pinchy shoes cost almost thirty bucks! She wasn't leaving them in a Boston alley.</p><p>If push came to shove, she'd bounce her stalkers off the bricks. Possibly more than once, the mood she was in.</p><p>\"Halt, gentlemen.\"</p><p>Janet jumped. There was a man standing at the end of the alley, and she hadn't known he was there until he spoke up. She hadn't smelled him, even though he was upwind. When was the last time that had happened?</p><p>He was tall-over six feet-and well built, for someone who wasn't pack. His shoulders were broad and he definitely had the look of a man used to working with his hands. He had blond hair the color of wheat, and his eyes-even from fifteen feet away she could see their vivid color-were Mediterranean blue. He was wearing all blackdress slacks, a shirt open at the throat, a duster that went almost all the way to his heels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And-what's this now? He was squinting in the poor light of the alley, and slipping on a pair of sunglasses. Sunglasses-how weird was that, at ten-thirty at night?</p><p>\"I have business with the young lady,\" Weirdo continued, walking toward them. His hands were open, relaxed. She knew he wasn't carrying a weapon. He moved with the grace of a dancer; if she hadn't been so fucking hungry she might have liked to watch him prance around. \"Much kinder business, I think, than you two. So be on your way, all right?\" Then, in a lower voice, \"Don't be afraid, miss. I won't hurt you. Hardly at all.\"</p><p>\"Stand aside, four eyes,\" she snapped, and with barely a glance, she stiff-armed him into the side of the building and hurried past. She had no time for would-be muggers, and less for Mr. Sunglasses-At-Night. Let the three of them fight it out. She had a date with a dead lobster.</p> <p>Behind her, Sunglasses yelped in surprise. There was a flat smack as he hit the wall, then slid down. She'd tossed him a little harder than she meant-oopsie-and then the other two jumped him, and she was out of the alley.</p><p>She could see the restaurant up ahead. Just a few more steps and she could order. Just a few more...</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>Don't you dare!</p><p>Turned.</p> <p>C'mon, enough already! They're human...it's none of your business.</p><p>She started back toward the alley. Sunglasses was a weirdo, but he was vulnerable to attack because of what she had done. Yeah, they were human, but it was one thing to mind your own business, and another to turn your back on a mess you helped make.</p><p>You moron! Who knows when you'll get to eat now?</p><p>\"Fuck off, inner voice,\" she said aloud. People thought the outer Janet was a bitch; God forbid they should ever meet the inner Janet.</p><p>She stepped into the alley to help, and was just in time to see the second mugger crumple to the filthy street. The first was half in and half out of the dumpster.</p><p>And Sunglasses was hurrying, hurrying toward her, licking the blood off his knuckles.</p> <p>\"As I was saying before you tossed me against the wall, I have business with you, miss. And where on earth do you work out?\"</p><p>She was so surprised she let him put his hands on her shoulders, let him draw her close. He smiled at her and even in the poorly lit alley she could see the light gleaming on his teeth. His very long canines. His fangs, to be perfectly blunt. He had fangs, and it wasn't even close to the full moon.</p><p>\"What the hell are you?\" She put a hand to his chest to keep him from pulling her closer. His heart beat once. Then nothing.</p><p>He blinked at her. \"What? Usually the lady in question is halfway to fainting by now. To answer your question, I'm the son of a farmer. That's all.\"</p><p>\"My ass,\" she said rudely. \"I came back to give you a hand-\"</p><p>\"How sweet.\"</p><p>\"-but you're fine, and I'm hungry.\"</p><p>\"What a coincidence,\" he murmured. He tapped a sharp canine with his tongue.</p> <p>Beneath her palm, his heart beat again. \"My, you're exceedingly beautiful. I suppose your beaux tell you that all the time.\"</p><p>\"Beaux? Who the hell talks like that? And you're full of shit,\" she informed him.</p><p>Beautiful? Shyeah. She wasn't petite and she wasn't tall-just somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Average height, average weight, average hair color-not quite blonde and not quite brown-average nose, mouth, chin. She could see her average eyes reflected in his sunglasses. \"And you'd better let go before I hit you so hard, you'll spend the rest of the night throwing up your teeth.\"</p><p>He blinked again, then smiled. \"Forgive the obvious question, but aren't you a little nervous? It's dark...and you're quite alone with me. Why, I might do anything to you.\" He licked his lower lip thoughtfully. \"Anything at all.\"</p><p>\"This is really, really boring, fuck-o,\" she informed him. \"Leggo.\"</p><p>\"I decline.\"</p><p>She brought her foot down on his, felt his toes squish through the dress shoe.</p><p>Then she knocked him away from her with a right cross. This time, when he went down, he stayed down.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she was happily slurping the first of a dozen oysters on ice.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>He knew he was lurking like a villain in a bad melodrama, but he couldn't help it. He had to catch her when she came out of the restaurant. So he was reduced to watching her through the restaurant window from across the street.</p><p>Richard rubbed his jaw thoughtfully. It didn't hurt anymore, but if he'd been mortal, it likely would have shattered from the force of the woman's punch. She hit like a Teamster. And swore like one, too.</p><p>She was stunning, really very stunning with those cider-colored eyes and that unique hair. Her crowning glory was shoulder length and wavy, and made up of several colors: gold, auburn, chestnut...even a few strands of silver. The silky strands gleamed beneath the streetlight and made him itch to touch them, to see if they were as soft as they looked.</p><p>She had been fearless in the near dark of the alley, and he'd become utterly besotted. He had to see her again, take her in his arms again, hear her say \"fuck\" again.</p><p>Ah! After a five-course meal, here she came. And look! She had spotted him instantly, and was now stomping across the street toward him. Her small hands were balled into fists and her lush mouth was curled in a snarl.</p><p>\"Fuck-o, you don't learn too quick, do you?\"</p><p>\"You're marvelous,\" he said, smiling at her. There were few people on the street at this hour, but the ones who were around caught the tension in the air, and did a quick fade. Most mortals had zero protective coloring, but something about the proximity of a vampire put their wind up, even if they weren't consciously aware of it. \"Just charming, really.\"</p><p>She snorted delicately. \"I see you're heavily medicated, on top of everything else.</p><p>Get lost, before I belt you in the chops again.\"</p><p>\"You came all the way over here to tell me to go away?\"</p><p>A frown wrinkle appeared on her perfect, creamy forehead. \"Yeah, I did. Don't read anything into it. So blow, okay?\"</p><p>\"Richard Will.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"My name is Richard Will.\" He held out his hand, hoping she wouldn't be startled by his long fingers. Most people-women-were.</p><p>\"Yeah? Well, Dick, I don't trust people with two first names.\" She stared at his outstretched hand, then crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>He let his hand drop. \"And you are...?\"</p><p>\"Tired of this conversation.\"</p><p>\"Is that your first name or your last?\"</p><p>Her lips curled into an unwitting smile. \"Very funny. You never answered my question.\"</p><p>\"Which one?\"</p><p>\"What are you? Your heart...\" She started to reach for him, then let her hand drop.</p><p>\"Let's just say you should get your ass to a doctor, pronto.\"</p><p>\"You know what I am.\" He bent toward her, and was thrilled when she didn't back off. \"In your heart, you know.\"</p><p>\"Dick, as my family will tell you, I don't have a heart.\"</p><p>He rested his palm against her chest, feeling the rapid beat. \"Such a lie, dearest.\"</p><p>She knocked his hand away, and sounded gratifyingly breathless when she said,</p><p>\"Don't call me that.\"</p><p>\"I have no choice, dearest, as you never told me your name.\"</p><p>\"It's Janet.\"</p><p>\"Janet...?\"</p><p>\"Smith,\" she said rudely, and he chuckled. Then laughed, a full-blown guffaw that sent more stragglers hurrying away. \"What the hell's so funny?\"</p><p>\"Don't you see? We simply must get married. Richard and Janet...Dick and Jane!\"</p><p>She gaped at him for a long moment and then, reluctantly, joined him in laughter.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>\"So you don't like the new wife?\"</p><p>Janet moodily stirred her coffee. It was after midnight, and they were the only couple in the coffee shop. \"It's not that I have a personal problem with her, she's just...not our kind, is all.\"</p><p>\"She's Polish?\"</p><p>She snorted a laugh through her nose. \"Nothing like that...I'm not that big a bitch. It's hard to explain. And you wouldn't believe me anyway.\"</p><p>He grinned, flashing his fangs. \"Try me.\"</p><p>\"No way, Jos\u00e9. I want to hear about you. I didn't know there were such things as vampires. Assuming you're not some pathetic schmuck who filed his teeth to get the girls.\"</p><p>He considered lifting her, in her chair, over his head, but decided against it.</p><p>Among other things, it was unnecessary. She knew what he was, oh yes. She had felt his heart. And he had felt hers. \"I didn't know there were such things either, until I woke up dead.\"</p><p>She leaned forward, which gave him an excellent view of creamy cleavage in her wine-colored dress. \"How old are you?\"</p><p>\"Not so old, for a vampire. Not even a hundred yet. And as it's not polite to ask a lady her age-\"</p><p>\"Thirty-six.\"</p><p>Perfect. Giggling girlhood was left behind, she was closing in on her sexual peak, and the best was still ahead. He tried very hard not to drool.</p><p>\"I'm the old maid of the family,\" she was saying. \"Most of my friends have teenagers already.\"</p><p>\"You have plenty of time.\"</p><p>She brightened. \"See, that's what I always say! Just because we're trapped in this damned youth-obsessed society doesn't mean we have to do everything in our twenties. What's the fucking rush?\"</p><p>\"Exactly. That's what I-\"</p><p>\"Except my family thinks totally differently,\" she said, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>\"They're very in-the-now, if you know what I mean. Sometimes there's...there's fights and stuff and you never know if today's your last day on earth. There's lots of pressure to make every single day count, to cram everything you can, as often as you can. Nobody really stops and smells the fuckin' roses where I come from, you know?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"That's fairly typical of...of people.\" He'd almost said 'of mortals', but no need to push things. As it was, he had a hard time believing this conversation was taking place. She'd insulted him, pounded him, knew what he was, and was now having coffee with him. Amazing! \"If your life span is so brief-what? Seventy years or so? Well, of course you want to make every minute count.\"</p><p>\"My family's lifespan is even shorter,\" she said moodily.</p><p>\"Ah. Dangerous neighborhood?\"</p> <p>\"To put it mildly. Although it's better since...well, it's better now, and I just hope it lasts.\"</p><p>\"Which is why you can take care of yourself so well.\"</p><p>She cracked her knuckles, which made the lone counterman cringe. \"Bet your ass.\"</p><p>\"Indeed I would not.\" He stirred his coffee. He could drink it, though all it would do was make him thirstier. Instead he played with it; he enjoyed the ritual of cream and sugar. \"How long are you in town?\"</p><p>She shrugged. \"Long as I want. The wedding's over, so we'll probably hang out for a couple days, then head back to our homes.\"</p> <p>\"And home for you is...?\"</p><p>\"None of your fucking business. Don't get me wrong, Dick, you seem pleasant enough for a blood-sucking fiend of the undead...\"</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"...but I'm not opening up to you with all my vitals, no matter how goodlooking and charming you are.\"</p><p>\"So my powers of attraction aren't completely lost on you,\" he teased.</p><p>She ignored the interruption. \"And if you don't like it, you can stop dicking around with your coffee and get the hell gone.\"</p> <p>\"I cannot decide,\" he said after a long pause, during which he guiltily put his spoon down, \"if you're the most refreshing person I've ever met, or the most irritating.\"</p><p>\"Go with irritating,\" she suggested. \"That's what my family does.\" She glanced at her watch, a cheap thing that probably told time about as well as a carrot. \"I gotta go.</p><p>It's really late, even for me.\" She laughed at that, for some reason.</p><p>He leaned forward and picked up her warm little hand. The palm was chubby, with a strong life line. Her nails were brutally short, and unpolished. \"I must see youagain. Actually, I would prefer to spirit you away to my-\"</p><p>\"Creaky, musty, damp castle?\"</p><p>\"-condo on Beacon Hill, but you're quite a strong young lady and I seriously doubt I could do so without attracting attention. So I must persuade you.\"</p><p>\"Damned right, chum.\" She jerked her hand out of his grasp. \"Try anything, and-\"</p><p>\"I'll vomit my teeth, or be split down the middle, or my head will be twisted around so far I'll be able to see my own backside-\" She giggled. \"-yes, yes, I quite understand. Have dinner with me tomorrow night.\"</p> <p>\"Don't you mean 'let me watch you eat while I play with my drink'?\"</p><p>\"Something like that, yes.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"Because,\" he said simply, \"I've decided. You're refreshing because you're irritating. Do you know how long it's been since I've had a nice conversation with a lady?\"</p><p>She stared at him. \"You think this has been a nice conversation?\"</p><p>\"Nicer than 'Help, eeeeeek, stay away you horrible thing, no, no, noooooooooo, oh, God, please don't kill me!' I can't tell you how many times I've had that conversation.\"</p><p>\"Serves you right for being a walking wood tick,\" she said. \"Dinner, huh? On you?\"</p><p>\"Of course.\" Possibly on you, he thought, suddenly dizzy with a vision of licking red wine off her stomach.</p><p>\"Mmmm. All right. I'll admit, it's nice to be myself with a guy and not have him be such a fucking Nancy boy whenever I say something the least bit-\"</p><p>\"Fucking obscene?\"</p><p>She giggled again. \"But you gotta tell me all about waking up dead, and what it's like to be on a liquid diet. And how come my family didn't know about you and your kind?\"</p><p>\"Why would your family know about my kind?\"</p><p>\"We're pretty far-flung. There's not much going on the planet we don't know. So you'll feed me, and we'll talk. Deal, Dick?\"</p><p>\"Deal...Jane.\"</p><p>\"I find out you've got a dog named Spot, dinner's off,\" she warned.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The phone rang, that shrill \"pay attention to me!\" sound she hated. She groaned, rolled over, groped for the phone, and knocked it off the hook. She relaxed into the blessed silence, which was broken by a tinny sound.</p><p>\"Hello? Jane?\"</p><p>She burrowed under the covers.</p><p>\"Jane? Are you there? Janet. Hello??\"</p><p>She cursed her werewolf hearing. Tinny and faint the voice might be, but it was also unmistakable. \"What.\"</p><p>\"Pick up the phone,\" the telephone receiver squawked. \"I want to make sure you're getting all this.\"</p><p>\"Can't. Too tired.\"</p><p>\"It's six o'clock at night, for God's sake. Pick up the phone!\"</p><p>She muttered something foul, and obeyed the caller. \"Whoever the hell this is, you'd better be on fire.\"</p><p>\"It's Moira, and I practically am...the high today was eighty-two. In May!\"</p><p>\"Moira.\"</p><p>\"You should see what the humidity did to my hair.\"</p><p>\"Moira.\"</p><p>\"I look like a blonde cotton swab.\"</p><p>\"Moira! This is fascinating, but you sure as shit better not be calling me to babble about your for-Christ's-sake hair. What do you want?\"</p><p>\"It's not what I want,\" Moira went on in her irritatingly cheerful voice. \"It's Michael. The big boss wants to see you on the Cape, pronto.\"</p><p>Finally, the silly bitch had Jane's attention. Her eyes opened wide and she sat straight up in bed. \"Michael Wyndham? Wants to see me? How come?\" And on the heels of that, a panicked thought: What'd I do? And resentment. Come, girl, good dog, here's a treat for the good doggie.</p><p>\"Mine is not to reason why, girly...and neither is yours. I suggest you get your ass out here yesterday.\"</p><p>Jane groaned. \"Aw, fuck a duck!\"</p><p>\"I'll pass.\"</p><p>\"I've got a date. Today.\" She squinted at her watch. \"Tonight, I mean.\"</p><p>\"You do?\" Moira sounded-rightfully so-completely astonished. She modified her tone, too late. \"I mean, of course you do. Sure. It's only natural, a...a lively and...er...opinionated young lady like yourself. With a date on a Saturday night. Yep.\"</p><p>\"Cut the shit, you're embarrassing both of us.\" Young lady. Right. Moira was at least ten years younger. Half Jane's size (and weight). Twice the brains. Calling Moira a silly bitch was only half right. \"Fuck! I don't need this now. You don't have any idea what it's about?\"</p><p>\"Um...\"</p><p>\"Come on, Moira, you and the boss are practically litter-mates. Spill.\"</p><p>\"Let's just say that in his newfound happiness with mate and cub, our fearless leader thinks it's high time you settled down-\"</p><p>\"No, no, no!\"</p><p>\"-and he's met just the right fella for you,\" she continued brightly. \"He's sure you'll hit it off.\"</p><p>\"Doesn't the head of the pack have anything better to do than fix me up on yet another stupid blind date?\" She could hear plastic cracking, and forced her fingers to loosen around the receiver.</p><p>\"Apparently not. Now tell the truth; the last one wasn't so bad.\"</p><p>\"He cried like a third grade girl when I beat him to the kill.\"</p><p>\"Well, you did hog all the rabbits yourself. Tsk, tsk.\"</p><p>\"Figures,\" Jane grumbled, swinging her legs over and resting her feet on the floor. \"The first halfway decent guy I meet in forever, and the boss wants me to blow him off to meet some new dildo.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Moira said, sounding anything but. \"I'll leave the dildo part out when I tell Michael you're on the way. And now, having imparted my message, I'd say something like 'have a nice day', except I know you-\"</p><p>\"Hate that shit. Bye.\" She hung up and resisted the urge to throw the phone against the wall. Fuck. Fuck fuck!</p><p>She'd been so excited about dinner with Dick, she'd had a hard time getting to sleep. She'd finally dozed off near dawn...and slept the entire day away. Now she had to beat feet for the Cape, of all places...fuck!</p><p>She did throw the phone. But it didn't make her feel any better, not even when it shattered spectacularly against the wall.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>She was tapping her foot on the curb, waiting for the sloth-like doorman to hail her a cab. She could hail her own damned cab, thanks very much, but when in Rome, do what the sheep do. Or something like that.</p><p>She'd packed like a madwoman and it showed-she could see the corner of her dress sticking out of the suitcase. Aarrggh! Fifty-nine ninety-nine at Sears, and she'd probably never get to wear it again. Like clothes shopping wasn't an unending horror anyway-now she'd have to go again.</p><p>And Dick. She felt really bad about up and leaving town. He'd think she stood him up. Like that would happen. He was ridiculously good-looking but, even more important, she could talk to him. Not be herself-not completely-but close.</p><p>Shit, she couldn't even be herself with the pack; they'd written her off as an old maid a decade ago. Pack members mated young, dropped kids young, and died young.</p><p>And she didn't want kids, which, among her people, made her El Freako Supremo.</p><p>Getting knocked up-assuming your mate could get you pregnant without getting his bad self hurt-was one thing, but then you were a slumlord to a fetus for ten endless months. At least the humans only had to suffer for nine. Even worse, you puffed up like a blowfish and ate everything in sight, then squeezed out a kid during hours of blood and pain...blurgh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And afterwards! Just the thought of having to tote around a l'il nose-miner who cried and screamed and puked and shit-and that was just the first week!-was enough to curl her hair. She hadn't liked kids even when she was one. The feeling had been mutually-and heartily-returned. She'd felt that way at eighteen, twenty-three, thirty, thirty-four. Sure, kids were necessary-for other people. Janet preferred to sleep late, and wear clothes that hadn't been puked on, and not watch her language.</p><p>\"Where to, ma'am?\" the doorman asked, breaking her anti-infant reverie. He was ineffectually flapping a hand at the occasional cab. She could have hailed four on her own by now. Shit, she could have jogged to the airport by now.</p><p>\"Logan,\" she practically snapped. It wasn't Door Boy's fault she'd been ordered to leave town, but the big boss wasn't here for her to take her anger out on him. \"Quick as you can.\"</p> <p>She thought about leaving a note for Dick, and reluctantly decided against it...better find out what Boss Man Michael wanted, first. And if it wasn't life and death, she'd let him have it, and who gave a rat's ass if he was the pack leader? She had a life.</p><p>Well, before yesterday she really hadn't, but he didn't know that. It was his privilege to snap his fingers and have any one of them come at a dead run, but it was hers not to like it. observed the doorman shivering and realized the sun had nearly set, and the temperature had dropped a good ten degrees. Still, it wasn't that cold. And why did the kid look like he was ready to drop a steaming load into his trousers? She was irritated, but not at him...surely he knew that.</p><p>God, the reek the kid was giving off! Like mothballs dipped in gasoline. His fearhis terror-burned her nose. It put her wind up and she cupped her elbows, shivering.</p><p>From grumpy to edgy in less than five seconds...a new record!</p><p>The ball dropped and she understood a half second too late. She was spun around and had time to take in burning blue eyes before there was a walloping pain in her jaw and Dick turned off the lights. And everything else.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>He didn't care. He really didn't. She was fine, and if she wasn't, who cared? He hadn't hurt her. Not really.</p><p>He checked on her for the eleventh time in sixty minutes, and was relieved to see the bruise on the underside of her jaw had faded to a mere shadow. Guilt rolled off his shoulders like a boulder.</p><p>To save time and steps-if he left he'd just be in here five minutes later-he sat down in the chair beside the bed. He cupped his chin in his hand, leaned forward, and watched her sleep.</p><p>Jane scowled, even in the throes of unconsciousness. It would have made him smile, if he hadn't felt so angry and betrayed.</p><p>Betrayed? All right, tell the truth and shame the devil...yes. Betrayed! And angry and sick at heart and furious with the little twit tied to his bed. Most of his anger was directed at himself, it was true, but he had a nice helping saved for Miss Jane.</p> <p>She'd fooled him; that was all. A simple thing, but unforgivable. She made him believe she accepted the monster, when in fact she most assuredly had not. The duplicitous wretch agreed to join him for dinner to placate him, then made arrangements to slink out of town like a thief. If he hadn't shown up early to escort her to dinner, she would have disappeared and he might never have known what had become of her. Would have wasted years of his life worrying about her fate.</p><p>Instead, he'd taken in the situation at a glance, and acted accordingly. Well, all right, that was a rather large lie. He had panicked-all he could think of was to get her home, stop her from leaving him. Leaving town, rather. And in his panic, he'd smacked her when he only meant to tap her. The one bit of luck was that it had happened too quickly for the lone witness-the doorman-to see much more than a swirl of cloth.</p><p>Dusk and speed were his friends, even if Jane was not.</p><p>And that was the rub of it. He'd allowed himself to forget, for one evening, that he was the monster in the fairy tales. He had forgotten there could be no relationship with a woman other than the most carnal type. He wouldn't have vampire women, and mortal women wouldn't have him. Well, that was fine. That was just fine.</p><p>He was a monster, and was done pretending otherwise.</p><p>But Jane would pay for making him forget. She'd pay for making him think, however briefly, that he was a man first and a beast second.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jane groaned and tried to roll over. The phone was ringing. It would be Moira, telling her to get her ass to the Cape. She couldn't see Dick tonight. She had to answer the phone and tell Moira to go fuck herself, and then-</p> <p>Wait.</p><p>That had already happened. So why was she still in bed?</p><p>She opened her eyes and tried to sit up. Three alarming facts registered immediately on her brain: a) she couldn't sit up, and b) she was tied to a bed. She was, in fact, c) tied down in the same room with an annoyed vampire. And not a prayer of room service.</p><p>\"Ohhhhhh, you idiot!\" she howled. If she could have slapped her hand over her eyes, she would have. If she could have slapped him, she would have. As it was, her ankles and arms were spread wide and tied to each poster of the bed. \"Do you have any idea of the trouble you've landed me in, numb nuts?\"</p><p>Dick, sitting in the chair next to the bed, blinked at her. He did that a lot...a long, slow, thoughtful blink when he was taken by surprise. It was like a stall for time, or something. She used to think it was kind of cute. \"I shouldn't have expected maidenly protestations,\" he said after a long pause.</p><p>\"You should expect a fractured skull, you undead idiot! What the fuck am I doing tied to your bed? Is it your bed? It damn well better be your bed! If I'm in some strange dead guy's bed your ass is grass!\"</p><p>He brought a hand up to his chin...then got up and abruptly left. She used the chance to yank at her bonds-no good. They were soft, like cloth, but amazingly strong.</p><p>Were her bonds lined with bubble gum, or what?</p><p>She strained to hear, and, very faintly, could hear muffled laughter coming from about thirty feet away. Dick had trotted out to the hall to have a giggle at her expense-fucking great.</p><p>The door was thrown open a moment later, and when Dick returned, he was stone-faced. \"Sorry about that. I thought I left something on the stove. Now where were we?\"</p><p>She kicked out at him. The bonds let her leg leave the bed, but not by much.</p><p>\"We were talking about how you're going to die a painful and horrible death-again!</p><p>What the hell have you trussed me up with?\"</p><p>The left side of his mouth twitched. \"It's elastic lined with titanium wire. It won't hurt you if you pull on it, but it's impossible to break. Even I have trouble breaking it, and I'm quite a bit stronger than you are.\"</p><p>Wanna bet, Dead Man Walking? \"Do you have any idea-aarrgh! I'm supposed to be meeting my boss right this minute! What time is it?\"</p><p>\"About two a.m.\"</p><p>\"Aaaarrrgggghhh! Jerk! I'm five hours late!\"</p><p>\"Another date?\" he asked silkily.</p><p>\"No, Deaf and Undead, I told you. My boss called-well, he didn't call, one of his lackeys did-and told me to get to the office, pronto. And when he says jump, we leap, dude. I didn't have time to leave you a note, but I would have come back!\"</p><p>\"Sure you would have.\"</p><p>Jane was so annoyed, she felt like biting herself. Instead, she yanked impotently on her bonds again. \"Yes I would have, dill-hole!\"</p><p>\"Your boss calls you on a weekend, and you must drop everything and race to his side? Really, Janet. I was expecting a better story than that.\"</p><p>She snarled at him. If he made her much madder, she'd start barking at the goddamned ceiling. \"Jesus, to think I was actually looking forward to seeing you! And this is how you take rejection...pervert!\"</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes then. Way down deep. She was suddenly reminded of the lake back home she used to do laps in. The blue water was pretty and inviting, but the lake was spring-fed, and freezing cold, even in July. You didn't know how cold it was until you committed yourself and jumped. Then you were stuck, and you got moving or you froze.</p><p>\"So you admit you rejected me?\"</p><p>\"No, doorknob! I told you the truth. You can believe it or you can go fuck yourself.\"</p><p>\"Is there a third choice?\"</p><p>\"Yes...untie me so I can make a phone call!\"</p><p>\"I decline.\"</p><p>\"You can't just keep me here like a...a...\" She practically spat the word. \"...pet or something.\"</p><p>\"Can't I?\"</p><p>Suddenly he was standing over her, casually unbuttoning his shirt and sliding it off his shoulders. Her eyes widened until they felt like they were practically bulging. \"What the hell are you doing?\"</p><p>\"You're a bright girl. You'll figure it out in a minute.\"</p><p>\"Don't you dare!\"</p><p>\"I dare much, now that my heart-\" He cut himself off abruptly, and she heard the click of his teeth coming together. What the hell was going on with this guy?</p><p>Off came the trousers, the socks, the underwear. Nude, Dick was exceedingly yummy...long legs, broad shoulders, and a tasty flat stomach that made her think about hot fudge sauce and whipped cream. His chest was lightly furred with blond hair two shades darker than the hair on his head. His muscle definition was excellent and she had a sudden, maddening urge to touch him, see if his skin was as smooth as it looked.</p><p>It would be, she thought, like velvet encased in steel. Or marble...he was quite pale.</p><p>He reached out and flipped off the light...click. She consciously dilated her pupils and could see him again, a pale blur in the dark. A blur with glittering blue eyes.</p><p>She felt his cool hand on her thigh, then his fingers were nimbly unbuttoning her dress. She kicked out again, to no avail. He popped open the clasp on her bra-stupid front clasps!-and with odd care, gently tore her panties down the middle. She hissed at him. Twelve bucks at Victoria's Secret! The bitch's secret was that she marked up her underwear by 600%!</p><p>\"You are an asshole,\" she said clearly.</p><p>\"True enough.\" He pulled her panties free and spread her dress wide, then pushed her bra out of the way. \"Umm. Very nice.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Go fuck yourself, perv.\"</p><p>\"I'd rather not...besides, you're here, so why should I have to? We have hours until sunrise.\" He chuckled. It sounded like cold water flowing over black rocks. \"And Jane...I'm sooooo hungry. I've been waiting and waiting for you to wake up.\"</p><p>\"I hope I poison you. I hope you choke until your lungs explode. I hope my blood burns your windpipe. I hope-\"</p> <p>\"I get the gist. I hope that the next time you agree to spend the evening with me, you keep your word.\" Then he was on her so suddenly she didn't have time to pull in air for a gasp. She braced herself as best she could for his brutal entry, for teeth and blood and pain. Oh, when I get out of here I'm going to use your vertebrae for dice. See if I don't. And I won't cry, either. So there.</p><p>His mouth skimmed her jaw, and she felt him lick her jugular and nibble gently at the tender flesh. His cool hand closed over her breast, pressed against her warm flesh, and she felt her nipple harden against his palm. Then he was kissing her throat, the middle of her chest, and her stomach. She felt his thumbs on her cunt, spreading her wide, and she felt his tongue snake inside her. The shock of it nearly bent her up off the bed. His mouth was cool, but quickly warmed, and she flinched back, thinking of his sharp canines.</p><p>But there was nothing to fear-or there was, but she quickly forgot it as waves of heat started from her crotch and radiated upward. His tongue was flicking in and out of her little tunnel, stabbing her clit, and then he pulled back and licked...excruciatingly slow licks that made her shake. She gritted her teeth as hard as she could and locked away the sounds she wanted to make. So he wasn't being a hard guy-fine. This still wasn't her idea. It still wasn't any different than smacking her around or shoving her up against a dirty alley wall or-or-</p><p>He stopped. He pulled back. She started to relax, then felt the sharp sting as he teeth broke the skin over her femoral artery. She gasped-she couldn't help it-and tried to jerk away, but his hands held her fast.</p><p>His fingers smoothed the soft pelt between her thighs, and then he was parting her lips again, and stroking her throbbing clit. One of his fingers dipped inside her while his thumb pressed gentle circles around her increasingly slick flesh. Meanwhile, his mouth was busy on her inner thigh, and she could hear soft sucking.</p> <p>This went on, and on...she quickly lost track of time. She was screaming inside.</p><p>Whenever she started to get close, he somehow knew, and his fingers would still, or pull away entirely. His mouth never stopped. Then he'd resume again, careful not to push her over the edge. After a while she still wasn't making any sounds, but the bed shook with her trembling.</p><p>At last he was sated. He pulled back, then bent to her and gave her a long, leisurely lick. \"Ummm. You're so wet. I love that. And you taste soooo good. Everywhere, it seems. Your blood is really rich. What on earth have you been eating?\"</p><p>She ground her teeth at him for answer. She felt his pelvis settle over hers, heard him chuckle. \"Your rage could set the room on fire-better than being cold, I think?\"</p><p>She didn't dignify that with an answer. Besides, if she opened her mouth-what might she say? She was horribly afraid she might ask-beg-to be fucked. Hard. For a long, long time. Her cunt throbbed. Her thigh throbbed. It wasn't pain, it was sheer yearning. She had never needed to come so badly.</p><p>When she felt him start to enter her, it took every ounce, every drop of her willpower not to strain to meet him. She resisted by listing his many odious offenses inside her head.</p> <p>That part of him was warm. And hard, and huge. His cock was parting her slowly and gently, and she had a quick thought: He has to be gentle...he wasn't, a few times before, and he hurt his partner. That's how he knows to tongue fuck, first. But that thought spiraled away into confusion as he shoved, and she felt him slam into her. She made a sound, some small sound, and his mouth was instantly on hers. She could taste her lust, and her blood, and then he was whispering into her mouth, \"I couldn't help that, I'm sorry-am I hurting you?\" His hands were fisting in her hair and now he was groaning and thrusting, and her breath was coming in harsh gasps.</p><p>\"Please,\" she groaned. \"Please-\" Don't stop. Don't ever stop. Harder. More. Faster.</p><p>Please. Please. Please.</p><p>He groaned, too. \"I wanted to hurt you but not like...I'll make it up to you, my own-\" She heard him grind his teeth...and then he stopped so suddenly he was rigid with the strain of it. She was afraid to move, to breathe, but it didn't matter, he did the unthinkable anyway-slowly pulled out of her. She closed her eyes and whimpered as he went, hating herself for it even as she knew she could have done nothing to quell the sound.</p><p>\"Jane. Tell the truth, love. Am I hurting you?\" She felt his hand caress her cheek and opened her eyes. His teeth were set so hard his jaw trembled. Here was a perfect opportunity for revenge. And she couldn't do it.</p><p>\"Twice,\" she whispered.</p><p>He bent closer, dropped a kiss to her shoulder. \"What?\"</p><p>\"Twice. This is my second time. Ever. In my life.\"</p> <p>\"You-what?\" She could have laughed at his horrified expression, if she hadn't been ready to claw his eyes out for not letting her come. \"Oh, Christ! I had no-I thought you-you seemed so tough I was sure-\"</p><p>Tough? Sure. Real tough. She'd grown a shell around her soul the night she lost her virginity. The night she, in her ardor, broke her lover's back. It had happened on the last day of her freshmen year in college, and her then-boyfriend, as far as she knew, was still in a wheelchair. It was the first and last time she'd chosen someone who wasn't pack. It was, in fact, the last time she'd chosen anyone, until tonight. And she hasn't exactly chosen this, had she?</p><p>\"You can't say Christ,\" she whispered. \"You're a vampire.\"</p><p>\"One of the many myths,\" he whispered back. He stroked her hair. She could feel his cock on her leg, throbbing impatiently. It didn't give a fuck if she was hurt or not. It had business to get back to. And so did she. \"Jane, why did you try to run away from me?\"</p><p>\"I didn't, dimwad. I told you the truth.\"</p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p>\"Now will you please finish and untie me?\"</p><p>\"Pick one.\"</p><p>She nearly screamed. \"What?\"</p><p>\"Pick one.\" He tapped her clit with a teasing finger. \"And I'll do it.\" He kissed her again. He ducked down and licked her nipple, then sucked, hard. In their bonds, her hands curled into fists. \"Whichever one. I'll do it. Thoroughly.\"</p><p>\"I hate you,\" she nearly sobbed.</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"Finish.\"</p><p>\"Oh, thank God.\" In an instant he was pushing his way inside her again, and for a half second she understood why he had been concerned-the friction was delightful, so delightful it was just this side of pain. Then he was pumping his hips against hers and it became more than delightful; it was exquisite.</p><p>\"Kiss me back,\" he said into her mouth. \"Give me your tongue.\"</p><p>Half-blind from the swamping pleasure, she did so. He sucked on it in time with his thrusts and she could hear someone making high, whimpering noises, and realized with amazement it was her making those silly bitch sounds. The bed thumped in time with their fucking, and then he tore his mouth from hers. \"Now,\" he hissed in her ear, \"come now.\" Then he pinched her nipple, hard, and that spun her into the most powerful orgasm of her life. She could actually feel the spasms ripple through her uterus, and the world got dark and fuzzy around the edges for a few moments. Above her he stiffened and for a moment his grip was painful. \"God, my God, Jane!\" Then he shuddered all over, and he relaxed as she felt him spurt deeply inside her.</p><p>She dozed for a few minutes-it had been a stressful few days. She came all the way awake when she realized he was stroking her lower lip with his thumb. \"Get the fuck off me now.\"</p><p>\"Ah, you're back. I thought you were being uncharacteristically quiet.\"</p><p>\"Off. Now. Hate you. Kill you.\"</p><p>He burst out laughing, which did nothing for her temper. She strained mightily and managed to roll him off her. \"I'm sorry, love, it's rude to laugh. But most women in your position would be fetal with shock, sobbing into the bedspread. All you can think about is how to get your teeth into me.\"</p><p>\"And how you might taste,\" she added silkily.</p><p>\"Umm...well, there are ways to answer that question...\"</p><p>\"Anything you put in my mouth, you're gonna lose.\"</p><p>He sighed. \"I suppose it was too good to last. Pity we're only compatible in bed.\"</p><p>\"Compatible in-you raped me, asswipe! Do you have any idea what my family is going to do to you? What I'm going to do to you?\"</p><p>\"I did rape you.\" He tweaked one of her nipples. \"At first.\"</p><p>She blushed with shame. He saw it, and it moved him whereas her death threats did not. \"No, you're right-I forced you. None of this was your idea. You're still tied up, for heaven's sake. You don't have anything to feel guilty about.\"</p><p>She was, absurdly, grateful for the lie. Not that she had any intention of showing it.</p><p>\"I feel very guilty that I didn't break your neck in that alley when I had the chance now let me go!\"</p><p>\"Sorry, Jane. You had your chance to be free, and you chose to stay.\"</p><p>\"I did not-\"</p><p>\"So stay you will, and just like this, until...\"</p><p>\"Oh, what, what? Christ, you're driving me crazy!\"</p><p>\"...until you agree to be my wife.\"</p><p>Long silence, broken by, \"You're on drugs.\"</p><p>\"Only if you are. Is that why your blood is so rich? God, it was like wine. I don't think I've ever felt better,\" he said giddily. \"I had planned to fuck you and eat you and turn you out into the street in the wee hours of the morning without so much as an 'I'll call you', but now I'll never, never let you go. You're a rare jewel, Jane. An emerald, a ruby.\"</p><p>\"I'm tied to the bed next to a crazy person,\" she mused aloud. Thinking, Never drank from a werewolf before, eh, buddy? Interesting. If you become addicted to me, that could be useful. \"And as far as being your wife-you've probably heard this from all your other rape victims, but I'd rather be dead.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Undead,\" he said brightly. \"Well, we've got time for that.

What's next, Frankenstein's Monster coming over for dinner?</p><p>\"You're out of your fucking mind.\"</p><p>\"Apparently so,\" he said cheerfully, and kissed her, and left her.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Richard knocked modestly-absurd, given what he had just done to her-and opened the door. She was staring at the ceiling, and didn't look at him when he came in.</p><p>He nibbled his lower lip and tried to distract himself from the sight of the lovely Janet, spread-eagled on his bed. It was amazing-he'd just spent over an hour with her, but he could have taken her right this minute. And again. And then again.</p><p>He was carrying a tray full of savories. She smelled it and sat up as much as her bonds would allow. \"Feeding time at the zoo,\" Jane said moodily. The spot on her thigh where he'd fed from her was purpling. He stifled an urge to kiss it, and beg her forgiveness. She lied, he reminded himself. And you're the monster.</p><p>\"Oh, hush. No one in a zoo eats so well. See? Lobster bisque and biscuits and a steak and milk and if you eat everything, chocolate ice cream.\"</p><p>\"That's a ridiculous amount of food,\" she said, staring at the tray.</p><p>\"I've seen you eat, my love. I'm going to let you out of your bonds, but before you hit me over the head with the tray and flee for the hills, I should explain that there are no fewer than three bolted doors-all English oak-between you and the street. You'd never get through them all before being caught. And you must be starving. Surely it's more prudent to eat and plot revenge, right?\"</p> <p>She drummed her fingers on the bedspread and stared up at him. Her eyes went narrow and flinty, but at last she said, \"I'm starving.\"</p><p>\"Eat, and then a hot bath...sound good?\"</p><p>\"And then what?\"</p><p>\"And then agree to be my wife.\"</p><p>\"Don't,\" she practically snarled, \"start with that again, dicklick.\"</p><p>\"Ah, a blushingly modest bride, how refreshing. I can see you're contemplating homicide-try not to spill the soup.\"</p><p>He set the tray down on the table, and unsnapped her ankle bonds. Then he seized the footboard and tugged the bed away from the wall. She could have done the same thing herself, but couldn't help but be impressed-not bad for an undead monkey. He walked to the headboard, reached behind it, and in a few seconds had her wrists freed.</p><p>She was off the bed in a bound, pulled the shreds of her clothes off and let them flutter to the floor, then made a beeline for the tray.</p> <p>\"I brought you a robe-\"</p><p>\"Who cares?\" she said with a mouthful of biscuit. \"You've already seen me naked.\"</p><p>\"Uh-\" You're gorgeous. You're distracting. If you prance around in that sweet little body you'll have your hands full. You have soup on your chin. \"As you wish.\"</p><p>He sat down across from her and watched her eat. She ate like a machine, seeming to take no enjoyment from the meal. Refueling, the better to kick my ass. Well, so be it. He deserved that, and more. And he was a fast healer. Let her do her worst. \"Why did you break our date?\" he asked abruptly, and surprised even himself-he had no idea he was going to say such a thing until it was done.</p><p>She grunted irritably. \"We've been over this.\"</p><p>\"Jane...\" Again, he had no idea what would come out of his mouth, but plunged ahead anyway. \"Jane, if you tell the truth, I'll unlock those three doors and will walk you back to your hotel. Just admit that you were afraid of me, that you were only pretending to accept what I am, and-\"</p><p>Her gaze locked on his like a laser. \"My name is Janet Lupo,\" she said coldly. \"I'm not afraid of any man. And. I. Don't. Lie.\"</p><p>He actually felt the chill coming off her. Absurd! She was half his size, even if she had twice the mouth. Her gaze was odd, almost hypnotic. With difficulty he broke her challenging stare. \"Well,\" he said at last, \"perhaps you can understand why I have difficulty believing that your 'boss' would insist on your free time, and why you would have to drop everything and rush to meet him at a moment's notice.\"</p><p>\"Pack rules.\"</p><p>\"Beg pardon?\"</p><p>\"Pack...rules...dumb...fuck. Am I stuttering? I'm a werewolf. My boss is the head werewolf.\"</p><p>He laughed, then ducked as her soup bowl sailed over his head. \"Oh, come now, Janet! Because you know I am a vampire, you've decided I'll believe that you're a werewolf? I'm that gullible? There's no such thing, and you know it well.\"</p><p>\"Says the bloodsucker!\"</p><p>He was still chuckling. \"Nice try.\"</p><p>\"If you could think about something besides your dick for five seconds, you'd see it makes sense. My strength, my speed...\"</p><p>\"All well within the range for homo sapien...albeit the high end.\"</p><p>\"You've been dead too long, Dick. The average homo loser can barely lift the remote control. My rich blood? That's from a diet high in protein. Raw protein, during the full moon.\"</p><p>\"Ah, the full moon. It's a few days away, but I suppose I had better take care when-\"</p><p>She slammed her fork down; the table trembled, then was still. \"The full moon is eight days away. And when it comes, you're going to get a big fucking surprise. Your little oak doors won't hold me then. I'll be out of here-possibly eating your head on my way out the door-and you'll realize you fucked up, bad. You'll know I was telling the truth the whole time, but you couldn't see past your stupid injured male pride. I'll be gone forever, and you'll have the next hundred years to realize what an asshole you were.\"</p><p>This was so convincing, he actually panicked for a moment. To add drama to her little speech, she stopped eating, walked to the bed, got under the covers, and faced away from him the rest of the night. She never said another word, or looked at him, not even when he tempted her with a brimming bowl of frozen custard.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>He was right. The doors-this one, anyway-were oak. Thick and heavy, with the hinges on the outside where she couldn't get at them. She threw her shoulder a few times-okay, thirty-into the door, but it barely rocked in its frame. \"Fucking Brit wood,\" she mumbled, rubbing her aching shoulder.</p><p>She'd prowled around her cage for the last couple of hours. It was a gorgeous room with plush wine-colored carpet, a soft queen-sized bed with about a zillion pillows, and a truly glorious attached bathroom (free of all razors and other sharp things, she was sorry to note). But as far as Janet was concerned, if you couldn't leave, it might as well have a cement floor and bars on the window.</p><p>She went through the bureau and found several robes in her size, in various materials. No real clothes. No television, either, but several books. She saw some classics-Shakespeare, Mark Twain, and Tolstoy-as well as-too funny!-the entire collected works of Stephen King. She supposed she might stand half a chance if she threw Hamlet at Dick as hard as she could. She'd gotten the drop on him before, in the alley, but wondered if it was possible now. He didn't believe she was a werewolf, the stupid dickhead, but he'd be careful. He thought she was one of the monkeys, but he respected her anyway. If he wasn't such a fuckstick, she could have really liked him.</p><p>She wondered what the pack was thinking-what boss-man Michael was thinking. Probably that she'd been run over by a train or something. Death was about the only acceptable reason for skipping a meeting with the big dog. Interestingly, that thought-she'd unwillingly disobeyed a command from her pack leader-brought no anxiety. In fact, it was kind of nice, knowing Michael wanted her on the Cape, and here she was, still in Boston.</p><p>If only Dick hadn't been such a beast. If only he hadn't been so nice about being such a beast-he might have wanted to really hurt her, but he sucked at it. She remembered him pulling out of her when he thought he was too big for her...remembered the excellent food, and the large quantities of it. The absurd marriage proposal. Absurd because...well, just because.</p><p>If he wasn't such a dick, she could start to like him. But nobody-fucking nobody-snatched Janet Lupo from the street, tied her down like a dog, and did whatever he wanted. He'd pay. She would have to wait for her chance, but it would eventually present itself. And then he'd better watch out for his guts, because she meant to have them on the floor.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>The smell of eggs basted in butter woke her up. Before she could open her eyes, she realized Dick was under the blankets with her. Then she felt his mouth on her neck, felt brief pain as his fangs broke the skin. She tried to push him away, but he pinned her down and held her to the bed while he drank. She had no leverage and could only lie beneath him while he took from her.</p><p>\"You piece of shit,\" she said directly into his ear.</p><p>He laughed against her throat. \"That's the problem, Jane m'love. If you screamed or fainted or cried, I'd have no interest in you-I'd want to be rid of you as quickly as possible. But you're fearless, and furious, and it works on me like an aphrodisiac. Which is why you have to be my wife.\"</p><p>\"I'd rather eat my own heart.\"</p><p>He licked the bite mark on her neck, then nuzzled the tender spot. \"That's a rather disturbing visual. Did you sleep well? I admit I was astonished you weren't lying in wait ready to strangle me with the sash from one of your robes.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I'd rather wait until you dropped your guard. Then you'll be sorry.\" She said this with total confidence.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers. \"God, you're delightful.\"</p><p>\"I'm going to skin you alive, you fucking undead monkey. Then I'm going to set your skin on fire. Then I'm going to roast your skinless body over the fire I made with your skin.\"</p> <p>\"And so ladylike, too! Umm...\" His cool mouth closed over one of her nipples, and she brought her fist down on top of his head, hard. Then yelped when he bit her.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said, rubbing the top of his head. \"That was you, not me. You hit me so hard my teeth nearly clacked together.\"</p><p>\"Just you wait,\" she said ominously.</p><p>He kissed her wrist, her pulse point, and then the crook of her elbow. She balled a fist and got ready to sock him again.</p><p>\"Jane, as delightful as last night was-for me, anyway-I'd rather not tie you up again.\" She punched him square in the face, a poor blow with her lack of leverage, but his head rocked back, which was gratifying. He went on as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>\"So let's make a deal, you and I. I won't tie you up, and you won't fight me. As of now,\" he amended.</p><p>\"You won't tie me up?\" she asked suspiciously. \"But I have to let you fuck me?\"</p><p>He looked pained. \"Yes, you have to let me fuck you.\"</p><p>She pretended to think it over, but it was an easy decision. She could stand almost anything but being tied down. It went against her very nature, made her want to bite somebody. \"Okay. I won't punch, and you won't get out the elastic bubble gum.\"</p><p>\"And you'll kiss me back.\"</p><p>\"Forget it.\"</p> <p>\"All right, then, I will do all the kissing for both of us.\" He smiled at her, put a hand on the back of her neck, and pulled her to him.</p><p>\"What, I can't eat first? This deal blows.\"</p><p>\"Later, Jane. I'm begging you.\" His mouth was slightly warm, and his tongue slipped past her teeth to stroke her own tongue. She felt his hand cup one of her breasts, testing the weight of it, and then his thumb was rubbing her nipple.</p><p>She wriggled, pushing more of her breast into his palm. \"So, the quicker you get off, the quicker I can have eggs?\"</p><p>He sighed. \"You're really killing the mood here.\"</p><p>\"What mood? I'm a prisoner, for fuck's sake. And I'm hungry,\" she whined.</p><p>\"Oh, for-\" But he let go of her and she bounded off the bed. She wolfed down her breakfast-eggs, six strips of bacon, four pieces of toast, and two glasses of milk-in five minutes while he laid on the bed and watched her with his fingers laced behind his head and a mildly disbelieving look on his face. She got up, wiped her mouth with a napkin, tossed it over her shoulder, and climbed back into bed.</p><p>\"All right, then,\" she said, infinitely more cheerful.</p> <p>He smiled at her. \"All right, then.\" He reached out, took her hand, and led her to the bathroom.</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were in his giant bathtub and the floor was soaked. Her legs were spread wide and resting on each rim of the tub, and she was gripping the sides so tightly her knuckles ached. Richard was beneath the water, nuzzling and tonguing and fingering her cunt. He'd been down there for five minutes, and she was about ready to lose her fucking mind.</p><p>Now his tongue was inside her, and one of his fingers was worming into her ass.</p><p>She'd never been interested in assplay-the idea had always grossed her out-but the sensation of his long finger sliding up inside her while his tongue darted and stabbed and licked her cunt made her throb. She had no control over her reflexes, she simply started to thrust her hips at his face. Her muffled groans (for her teeth were tightly clenched) bounced off the bathroom tile.</p><p>He rose, water dripping down his marble-white skin, and grinned at her. He pulled her up to him and growled, \"Now you'll kiss me.\"</p><p>She did, without hesitation. He sucked her tongue into his mouth as he pushed her thighs wide, as he took himself in hand and rubbed his cock against her sopping cunt.</p><p>She moaned into his mouth and strained toward him. He tore his mouth from hers, sought her neck, and she felt him bite her just as his cock thrust inside. The combination of sensations-slight pain, swamping pleasure-made her come so hard she bucked against him, and another gallon of water sloshed over the side of the tub.</p><p>\"Ummmm,\" he said against her throat. \"Oh, that's very good. I could do this all day.\"</p><p>\"Better...not...\" she managed. \"It'll kill me.\"</p><p>He laughed and leaned back. She was still spread up against the sloping end of the tub; they were connected only by his cock. He ran his hands over her soapy breasts, smiling as she groaned again. \"Oh, you are going to marry me,\" he said huskily. \"Believe it.\"</p><p>\"Why don't you...stop talking...and finish fucking?\"</p><p>He grinned, flashing fangs, and obliged. When he finished she was indecently satisfied, and there was only a few inches of water left in the tub.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Later, he brought a second breakfast. \"After that half an hour,\" he explained,</p><p>\"even I could eat a few more eggs.\"</p><p>\"Not bad for a dead guy,\" she said casually, pretending she wasn't still throbbing. The man had a fiendish touch between the sheets-or in the tub-and that was a fact. \"I'm sure the ladies like you all right, when you're not being such a jerkoff.\"</p><p>He didn't answer, just sat down across from her and watched her eat. After a few minutes, he started drumming his fingers on the table.</p><p>\"Yeah, that's not gonna get annoying. The kidnapping and the fucking I can take, but not the nervous tics. Cut it out.\"</p><p>\"Why only twice?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>He was nibbling thoughtfully on his lower lip and watching her. \"Why was last night only your second time? You're in your thirties. You should have had hundreds of experiences by now. It can't be a dislike for the act itself-you're sexy, responsive, and open to new experiences. So what's the explanation?\"</p><p>Her mouth was suddenly dry-weird!-and she gulped some juice. \"None of your goddamned business.\"</p><p>\"Did he hurt you? Because if he did, I'd be delighted to track him down for you and teach him a richly deserved-\"</p><p>\"Am I speaking a language you don't know? I said it was none of your business.\" Her hand was shaking. She put the juice glass down with a bang and hid her hands under the table. \"And even if it was, I don't want to talk about it. Especially with you.\"</p><p>His eyes were narrow, thoughtful. \"Ah...you hurt him. And felt needless guilt ever since-Jane, for heaven's sake. Whatever you did, it was an accident. You didn't mean it.\"</p><p>\"Are you deaf? I said I don't want to talk about it!\" The glass zoomed at his head; he ducked and it slammed into the far wall. Orange juice and broken glass sprayed everywhere.</p><p>\"All right,\" he said calmly. \"We won't talk about it.\"</p><p>Her hands weren't the only thing shaking. She grabbed her elbows and squeezed; clenched her teeth to stop them from chattering. She was morbidly afraid she might puke, and soon.</p><p>He got up from his chair, came to her, and scooped her up as if she was a child.</p><p>For a wonder, she didn't try to pull his eyeballs out of his head. \"You're tired,\" he soothed. \"You've had a rotten week. Why don't you take a nap?\"</p><p>\"Why don't you go fuck yourself?\"</p><p>\"Can't we do both?\"</p><p>She chuckled unwillingly.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Two nights before the full moon, and she was actually torn.</p><p>Torn! It was almost like she was dreading her impending escape. Which only proved a steady diet of rich food and amazing sex lowered I.Q. points.</p><p>Every day, he asked her to tell him the truth, promising to let her go if she did.</p><p>And every day, she told him the truth...a lie would have choked her. She hadn't broken their date by choice. She had wanted to see him again. And she almost didn't hate him.</p><p>That one she kept to herself.</p><p>He hadn't tied her up since that first night. And she hadn't tried to attack him.</p><p>Another example of her quickly-lowering I.Q. When they were between the sheets (or in the bathtub, or on the floor in front of the fireplace), the last thing on her mind was leaving. But far more disturbing, when they weren't between the sheets, the last thing on her mind was leaving.</p><p>And it wasn't that she was thinking with her pussy instead of her brain. Well, it wasn't just that. Because to be perfectly honest, what, exactly, was she going back to? To be at Mikey's beck and call? To hang out with a group of people who disapproved of her, then go home to her lonely bed? The pack didn't much want her, and she sure as shit didn't want someone who wasn't pack, someone who was fragile-who would break if she really let loose.</p><p>Dick fit the bill admirably, and he approved of her-to the hilt! He thought everything she did and said was swell. She could have farted on him and he would have rhapsodized about it. In fact, she did...after a particularly strenuous sexual marathon and when she was relaxing in his embrace. Relaxing a little too well, in factshe really cut one. Quick as thought, she pulled the blankets over Dick's head, trapping him with the noxious odor. Cursing, he finally freed himself, and then they both laughed until they cried.</p><p>She rolled over on her back and stared at the ceiling. It was getting rapidly dark in the bedroom; the sun would be down in a few more minutes. She'd adjusted nicely to his schedule, and now slept her days away. Frankly, she preferred his schedule-she'd never been much of an early riser.</p><p>He'd be here any minute. Any minute. She felt a tightening in her stomach and was disgusted with herself. Just thinking about him-about his long fingers and his mouth and his tongue and his cock-was making her wet. Some prisoner. Now she had Stockholm Syndrome. Except it was more like Bimbo Hypnotized By Bad Guy's Huge Cock Syndrome. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then later he would bring amazing food, and they'd talk about everything and anything. And he'd read to her-they were halfway through Salem's Lot, which he seemed to think was a comedy-while she paced. She liked books but couldn't stand to sit still for the hours and hours required to read one. Or they'd wrestle, and once she'd thrown the leftover apple pie at him and they'd had a food fight that ruined the drapes.</p><p>Jane sighed. If it was just his dick, it wouldn't be so bad. She could always buy a vibrator. No, it was Dick. She really, really liked him. More than any guy she'd ever known, and she knew a lot of fellas. And she was having a helluva time remembering she was a prisoner. In fact, she didn't think Dick remembered much, either.</p><p>* * * *</p> <p>Her vision doubled, trebled...then her knees buckled. Luckily she was bent over the footboard, so she had some support.</p><p>Dick let go of her waist and pulled her back onto the bed. \"That was...sweaty.\"</p><p>Panting lightly, he flopped over on the pillows. \"Jane, your stamina knows no bounds.</p><p>Look at me; I'm actually out of breath. And I don't even need to breathe.\"</p><p>\"My stamina? Look who's talking. We've been at it since-holy shit, the sun's gonna be up in another hour. You'd better beat feet back to the coffin, old man.\"</p> <p>He snorted. \"It's a bed, not a coffin. It's one of the guest beds, in fact. You're in my coffin, so to speak.\"</p><p>\"So why don't you sleep here?\"</p><p>\"I've been thinking about it.\" He propped himself up on one elbow, bent to kiss her shoulder, then said, \"More and more, actually. In the beginning I dared not leave myself at your mercy, but now I wonder.\"</p><p>\"What the hell are you talking about? You take longer to say something than anyone I've ever met.\"</p><p>He didn't smile at her bitching, like he usually did. \"I'd be quite helpless, Janet. If you, ah, decided to be angry, there's nothing I could do until the sun went down. And the tables in here are all made out of wood...so are the chairs. It wouldn't be difficult for someone with your determination to fashion a rudimentary stake.\"</p><p>She'd never thought of that. She couldn't believe she'd never thought of that. \"Oh.\"</p> <p>She mulled it over for a minute, then said, \"Well, I don't especially want to stake you in the guts.\"</p><p>\"The guts I wouldn't mind so much. How about the heart?\"</p><p>She rolled over and rested her chin on his chest. \"There either. I dunno, you're okay.</p><p>When you're not being a total shit. Stay, go, I don't give a fuck.\"</p><p>\"Well, I can hardly turn down such a warm invitation.\" Still, he glanced nervously at the table in the corner before climbing under the covers. \"Ah, well, here goes nothing.</p><p>Climb in next to me.\"</p><p>\"I have chicken grease under my nails,\" she pointed out.</p><p>\"So, we'll take a nice hot shower together later tonight.\"</p> <p>\"Sounds like a date.\" She snuggled in next to him and rested her head on his shoulder. His body was still slightly warm from their earlier exertions and, as she pressed closer to him, remained that way.</p><p>\"Ahhhhh,\" he sighed. \"You're better than my electric blanket.\"</p><p>\"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. You should write for fuckin' soap operas,\" she grumbled, but inside she was glowing. He was trusting her with his life.</p><p>He knew he was easy prey, and he was going to sleep anyway. It spoke volumes about his true feelings for her...and her status as his \"prisoner\".</p><p>Well, shit, she thought, drifting into sleep. Her palm rested over his heart, which beat once or twice every minute. Maybe there's hope for us after all.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Richard woke, as he had for the last several decades, just as the sun slipped past the horizon line. He felt Jane's head resting on his shoulder and smiled. A wonderful way to start the evening. And he was warm, so delightfully warm. She was better than a hot tub. He'd have to do something really nice for her for not killing him. Like...let her go?</p><p>He couldn't. He knew it was the right thing to do, knew he had no business keeping her as a sort of mid-sized boy toy, but every time he thought of his condo emptied of her refreshing presence, he wanted to shiver. Hell, he wanted to go for a walk in the sunshine.</p><p>He couldn't even pretend it was about revenge anymore. Even if she had lied, they were square after that first night. No, he was keeping her because he was a selfish monster and he couldn't bear to let her go. To be brutally honest, he was thrilled she was sticking to her story, because it gave him the perfect excuse to keep her.</p><p>The fact that he wasn't pinned to the bed via a table leg through his rib cage spoke well of her feelings for him. He was as hopeful as he'd been in-what year was it? She had her chance for vengeance, and hadn't taken it. And he doubted his lovely Jane was in the habit of passing up a chance to avenge herself. Was it possible she'd forgiven him? That was too unrealistic to believe, but perhaps there was hope. Perhaps-</p><p>\"No! No, God, no...aw, jeez, Bobby!\"</p><p>She was screaming. Screaming in her sleep. He was so startled he nearly jumped off the bed. Never had he heard his Janet so terrified, and so young. She sounded like a teenager.</p><p>\"I didn't-Bobby, don't move, I'll get an ambulance, oh, God, don't die, please don't die!\"</p><p>She was clawing at him in her sleep. He caught her hands and squeezed. \"Jane, love. It's a dream. It's not real.\" Anymore, he added silently. His chest and throat felt tight. Whatever had happened, it had been horrible. Awful enough to scare her away from lovemaking for years and years.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. He was shocked to see them filling, and then her tears spilled over and ran down her cheeks. \"I didn't mean to,\" she sobbed.</p><p>\"Of course you didn't.\"</p><p>\"They told me it wasn't a good idea-that monkeys are fragile-I didn't listen.\" She made a small fist and thumped it against his chest. \"Why didn't I listen? Oh, we were having such fun-it didn't even hurt, and I thought it was supposed to hurt the first time. And then I started to come and I wrapped my legs around his waist and squeezed and-and-\"</p><p>\"Janet, it was an accident.\" Monkeys? Odd slang-he had never been able to keep up with it. Had she broken the boy's ribs? Had they been in a precarious position, and had fallen, and perhaps the boy had...? Well. Whatever had happened, he was thoroughly certain of one thing. \"You didn't mean to hurt him, Jane. You never would have hurt him. You've got to let this go.\" He was stroking her back while he soothed her and she finally relaxed against him. He added jokingly, hoping to see a scowl, \"Besides, you don't need to worry about such things with me. You could set me on fire while you were having your way with me, and I'd be fine the next day. Before you ask, though, I'm really not into that.\"</p><p>She jerked up on one elbow and stared at him. Her eyes were smudged with tears, bloodshot, and enormous. He thought she'd never looked so pretty. \"That's right,\" she said slowly. \"I was thinking about that last night and you...I can't hurt you. You can take whatever I dish out.\"</p><p>\"And have been,\" he added, \"for several days now. See, look!\" He showed her his arm where, in her agitation, she'd clawed off ribbons of skin. It was nearly healed.</p><p>Oddly, she was still staring at him as if she'd never seen him before. \"I don't know why I didn't think of it before, Dick.\"</p><p>\"You've had other things on your mind. Now, that's enough crying over a fifteen year-old accident you couldn't help,\" he said briskly, hoping she agreed. He couldn't bear to see her cry. He rolled out of bed and stood up, casting about for a way to distract her. \"How about sushi and maybe some vegetable tempura for breakfast?\"</p><p>She perked up immediately. \"I like raw fish,\" she said. \"I like steak tartare, too, but I like it better with steak, not hamburger.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like we have lunch figured out, too, m'love.\"</p><p>\"But first we have to shower,\" she said, almost shyly.</p><p>He laughed, bent to her, picked her up, and kissed her. \"Yes indeed. You are filthy.</p><p>And so am I. I foresee lots of scrubbing in our future.\"</p><p>\"Fucking pervert,\" she snorted, and he cheered inwardly, knowing she was back to herself.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>For the second night in a row, Richard woke up warm and content. He had made up his mind as dawn broke in the wee hours of the morning, as Janet cuddled up to him and snored softly in his ear. Today they would go out. He'd take her shopping and buy her a ridiculous amount of clothes. Clothes, lingerie, priceless paintings, pounds of steak tartare-whatever she wanted. He knew in his heart she wouldn't run away from him, and it was past time he let her out of his bedroom. She had been admirably patient, and it was time for a reward.</p><p>He stretched. He didn't really need to-he always woke energized and hungry and raring to go-but enjoyed the sensation. Yes, they would go shopping and she would bully the sales clerks and it would be delightful. Then back to his place for a light lunch and some energetic lovemaking, and possibly a nap, or more of Salem's Lot. Yes, it was all- </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where the hell was Janet?</p><p>He'd been groping absently for her while he'd been thinking, but she wasn't in his bed, and the bathroom light was off. He could hear her on the floor, gasping in-pain?</p><p>Was that pain?</p> <p>In the second before he looked, it seemed like every malady mortals were prone to raced through his brain. She had appendicitis. He'd knocked her up (it was supposed to be impossible, but who really knew?) and she was having a miscarriage. She was having a heart attack. A brain embolism. A kidney shutdown. God help him, he was as afraid to look as he was afraid not to.</p><p>He looked. Janet was on her knees beside the bed, panting harshly, and her back-it almost looked like the knobs of her spine were moving. Her hair was hanging in her face in sweaty tangles, and her nails were sunk into the carpet. His feet hit the floor with a double thud and he reached for her. \"Janet, I'm getting a doctor. I'll be right-\"</p><p>A low, ripping growl froze his hand in mid-reach. And then-so fast, it was so quick, he blinked and it was done-she sprouted hair and her nose turned into a long snout and her eyes went wild and she was leaping for the door.</p><p>She bounced off it, but he was alarmed to see it actually shudder in its frame. She coiled and leapt again. And again. He remained sitting on the bed-he was afraid if he stood he would fall-and stared at her. Janet was a dun-colored wolf with silver streaks running down her back. Her eyes were the same color as when she was a biped, but now they were glittery and homicidal. He remembered how she paced when he read, how she couldn't seem to sit still for long, and realized that in this form she was claustrophobic.</p><p>Chunks of the door were leaping off the frame and falling to the carpet each time her body hit the door, but at this rate it would take at least ten minutes and she was likely to damage herself. He got up and walked to the door on legs stiff with shock, fumbled with the lock, dropped his key twice (all the while dodging her small wolf's body-she never stopped, she completely ignored him, he doubted he was even a cipher to her now), and finally swung the door open.</p> <p>He ran after her to do it again, and again. Then she spotted the bank of windows facing west and lunged toward them. He dived, and managed to catch her back left leg just as she was coiling for a leap that would take her through the window. She spun and he had a dizzying glimpse of what looked like a thousand sharp teeth as she growled.</p><p>\"We're three stories up,\" he panted, clutching her while at the same time trying not to break her leg. \"You'll never survive the fall. Well, you might but-Janet, don't go!\"</p><p>She snapped at his fingers. Wrathful growls bubbled up out of her without pause, or breath.</p><p>\"Please don't leave! I was wrong and you were right-God, you were so right, I was a blind fool not to see it. Please don't leave me.\"</p><p>She snapped again, her jaws closing about a centimeter from his flesh. A warning.</p><p>Probably her last warning.</p> <p>\"I can't bear it without you. I swear I can't. I thought I was content before but it was a lie, everything was a lie, even why I was keeping you was a lie...\"</p><p>His grip was slipping. He talked faster.</p><p>\"...but you were right, and you never lied, not once, not even to get away, and Janet, I will spend the rest of your life making it up to you...\"</p><p>She was almost free, and he was afraid if he let go to get a better grip, he wouldn't be fast enough.</p><p>\"...but please...don't...go!\"</p><p>She went.</p><p>He lay on the floor in his study a very long time. It seemed too much work to get up, find the broom, and start sweeping up the broken glass. He owned the building anyway, so who cared? Who cared about anything?</p><p>He couldn't believe she was gone. He couldn't believe he-who prided himself on possessing at least a modicum of intelligence-had let this happen.</p> <p>My name is Janet Lupo.</p><p>Had done such things, and to such a woman.</p><p>I'm not afraid of any man, and I don't lie.</p><p>What had he been thinking?</p><p>My name is Janet Lupo.</p><p>How could he have been so blind?</p><p>My name is Janet Lupo.</p><p>So stupid and arrogant?</p><p>The full moon is eight days away. And when it comes, you're going to get a big fucking surprise.</p><p>Oh, if there was a God this was a fine joke indeed. He had finally found the one woman he could spend eternity with...</p><p>Your little oak doors won't hold me then.</p><p>...and he had kidnapped her and raped her and kept her and ignored her when she spoke the truth.</p><p>You'll realize you fucked up, bad.</p><p>He'd demanded she admit to being afraid of him, and when she wouldn't, he assumed it was a lie.</p><p>You'll know I was telling the truth the whole time, but you couldn't see past your stupid injured male pride.</p><p>His stupid injured male pride.</p><p>I'll be gone forever, and you'll have the next hundred years to realize what an asshole you were.</p><p>He would have cried, but he had no tears.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Three days later</p><p>Jane rolled over and stretched. Then shrieked in anger as she fell three feet and hit the cement with a smack. She'd curled up on the base of the statue in Park Square, promptly gone to sleep, then forgotten about the drop when she woke up. Why don't I ever remember this shit until it's too late? she thought, rubbing her skinned elbow.</p><p>She was pleasantly tired, and would be for the next couple of days. It was always like that when she chased the moon. She also felt very new, almost husked out.</p><p>Purified. Whatever.</p><p>She stood, and shivered. Step one: find clothes. Spring in Boston was like spring in Siberia.</p><p>She marched up to an early-morning commuter, a businessman obviously cutting through the park to get to the subway. He stared at her appreciatively as she approached, but she had eyes only for his cashmere topcoat. \"How-\" was all he had time for before she belted him in the jaw and mugged him.</p><p>She had made her choice as a wolf, and would carry it out as a woman. She didn't have to wake up in the park, naked and alone. Or yesterday, in an alley. Or the night before that, beneath the docks by the harbor-ugh. She didn't think she'd ever get the smell out of her hair.</p><p>There were only a hundred safe-houses in Boston, as well as acres and acres of woods owned by pack members. She could have romped there and woken to clean clothes and a hearty breakfast. But as a wolf she had avoided all those places and her kind. The beast knew what she wanted. Now it was time to get it.</p><p>Of course, she didn't know where Dick lived, exactly. It's not like she scribbled down the address with her paw on her way out the window. Luckily, there were ways and ways. She might not have a super nose like some of her kind, but the day she couldn't sniff up her own backtrail to a den was the day she'd jump off a fucking bridge.</p><p>It didn't take long, but her feet were freezing by the time she got there. Dick lived in a dignified brownstone condo that was probably built the year the Mayflower landed.</p><p>She shifted her weight back and forth, stuck her hands in her stolen pockets, and looked up at his window. The glass hadn't been replaced; there was a large piece of cardboard taped into the frame instead. Guess it took time to order that fancy old-fashioned stuff.</p><p>Except for the rumble of an early morning delivery truck, the street was quiet.</p><p>\"'Scuse me. D'you live here?\"</p><p>She looked. The delivery boy was holding three brimming grocery bags, and looking glum. \"Yeah. Why?\"</p><p>\"Well, thank God. 'Cause I've been making deliveries for two weeks, but the last couple days nobody ever takes the food in, and it goes bad or gets swiped, and it's just a waste, is all.\"</p><p>Ah, so that's where all the sumptuous feasts came from! Dick had the food delivered, and cooked the meals for her. Yum. \"I was gone for a while,\" she told him,</p><p>\"but now I'm back.\"</p><p>\"Who are you?\"</p><p>\"I'm the owner's fianc\u00e9e.\" She shook her head. It sounded just as weird out loud as it did in her head. \"Do I have to sign something?\"</p><p>\"No. He's got an account with us.\"</p><p>\"Then get lost.\"</p><p>\"Nice!\" But he set the bags down, slouched back to his truck, and pulled into traffic without looking, in typical Boston fashion. Which was good, because it wouldn't do for him to watch her break into the house.</p><p>\"Well, shit.\" That had been considerably easier said than done! Dick's front door wouldn't budge, and she was reluctant to break more of that expensive glass. He might not be so thrilled she came back. She had a vague memory of him grabbing her and begging her not to go, but it was more like a dream. She didn't trust her wolf-brain to factually interpret human emotions.</p><p>She smacked herself on the forehead. Dummy! Why was she trying to see him in the daytime? Even if she got in, he wouldn't exactly be a thrilling conversationalist. He'd be holed up in his bedroom, dead to the world-literally. Until then, she might as well chat with a rock. Still, it would have been nice to swipe some clothes.</p><p>Oh, well. The coat was plenty warm enough, and she didn't give a fuck how many people stared at her feet. At least she was in a big city, instead of some rinky-dinky small town...the yokels always loved something new to gawp at. She just had to kill another ten hours until the sun set. Thank God for the Barnes &amp; Noble caf\u00e9.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Richard slumped in the chair beside the fireplace. He'd been sitting in this room every evening since Jane had left. It had been the last place he'd seen her.</p><p>He was starving, and didn't care. He deserved to go hungry. And the thought of leaving-of perhaps missing her if she came back-was unbearable. What if she was hurt? What if she needed something and he was out assuaging his thirst?</p><p>Who are you kidding? She's gone, fool. You did everything but toss her out the window yourself.</p><p>True enough. Still, he waited. It was the only thing he could do. He'd never insult her by trying to find her and convince her to return. Return to what? An unnatural existence with a monster? And what in the world could he ever say to her? \"Janet, dear, sorry about kidnapping you and raping you and keeping you and all but calling you a liar to your face, kiss-kiss, let's go home.\" As the lady herself might say, \"In a fuckin' pig's eye.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Dick! Stop with the fucking sulking and open the front door!\"</p><p>Oh, Christ, now his inner voice sounded like her. Bad enough he was starving, but it appeared he was slowly going insane as well.</p><p>\"You son of a bitch! You piece of shit! I trot my ass all the way back down heretwice!-and you keep me standing out here on this freezing sidewalk?\"</p> <p>He buried his face in his hands. How he missed her!</p><p>\"I am going to rip your heart out and pin it to the bedroom wall with a swizzle stick! I'm going to yank the fixtures out of that stupid bathroom you're so proud of and shove them up your ass!\" Wham! Wham! Wham! \"Now let me in before I lose my temper!\"</p><p>That's no inner voice, Richard. I ought to know...I'm your inner voice.</p><p>He jumped up so quickly his head actually banged into the ceiling. He barely felt it.</p><p>He clawed for the doorway, raced through it and down the hall, down three flights of stairs, fumbled for the bolts and locks, and flung the door open.</p> <p>Janet stood on his front step, flushed and out of breath. Her little fists were red from the cold, and from banging his door. She was wearing a man's overcoat roughly six sizes too big for her, and three large grocery bags were at her feet. She was scowling.</p><p>\"Well, finally. Don't sulk on my time, all right, pal?\" She stomped past him.</p><p>Like a zombie, he picked up the groceries, then slowly turned and followed her. She shrugged out of the coat and headed straight for their-for his room. He watched her naked form sway back and forth as she went up the stairs like she owned them. \"Food,\" she said over her shoulder on her way up. \"I could eat a cow. In fact, I think I did, night before last.\"</p><p>By the time he brought her tray to the bedroom, she had showered and toweled off.</p><p>She strolled out of the bathroom and sniffed appreciatively. \"Oooh, yeah, that's the stuff. I could eat two steaks.\"</p><p>\"They're both for you,\" he said automatically. \"Why...how...why...?\"</p> <p>\"You sounded a lot brighter when you thought I was a liar.\" She brushed past him and jumped for the bed, landing in the middle, lolling like a queen, and favoring him with a smirk. \"Ah, the mileage I'm gonna get out of this. Let's start with your whole smug speech about how just because you're a vampire, there's no such thing as werewolves. That sound like a good place to you?\"</p><p>\"Janet-\"</p><p>\"Or we could touch on why it's not a good idea to kidnap people when they're on their way to an important meeting.\"</p><p>\"Janet-\"</p><p>\"Or we could go into all the times you asked me to tell the truth, and I did, and then you didn't believe me, and then you-\"</p><p>He fell to his knees beside the bed. He had to grit his teeth for a few seconds to keep his jaw from trembling. \"Janet, why are you here? Why aren't you with your family?\"</p><p>His voice was rising, but he was helpless to stop it. \"Why didn't you head for the road and keep going? Why are you back?\"</p><p>She frowned. \"You're taking the fun all out of this. I've been looking forward to it for days. I need to see some major-ass groveling, pal.\"</p> <p>He didn't speak.</p><p>She sighed. \"What, I gotta get out the hand puppets? You haven't figured it out?</p><p>Dick, you're my family now. I never want to go back there. Cape Cod in the summeryech! Tourists cluttering up the roads, the beaches, and the mall-and you get in trouble if you eat them. Can't even take a little bite to discourage them from coming back...\"</p><p>\"Janet.\"</p><p>\"I'm serious! Anyway, if I stay with you, I don't have to go back. I didn't realize how unhappy I was with them until I fell in with you. I'm not pack anymore, I'm yours. I mean-if you want.\"</p><p>\"Is this a joke?\" he almost whispered. \"Is it a trick to get even? Because while I wouldn't blame you-\"</p><p>\"Oh, hey, I'm a bitch, but I'm not, like, a sociopath! That'd be a rotten thing to do. I love you, you stupid fuck. I'm not going anywhere. Except, of course, for a few days a month. Think you can put up with that, you undead dope?\"</p><p>\"I've been waiting almost a hundred years to hear those words. Well, not those exact words.\" He reached out and pulled her down onto his lap. They sat on the floor while she cuddled into him like a bad-tempered doll. \"Oh, Janet. I missed you so much.</p><p>And I was such a fool.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, a real arrogant asshole.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Completely unreasonable and jerkish.\"</p><p>\"And then some.\"</p><p>\"And you're really, really sorry.\"</p><p>\"So unbelievably sorry.\"</p><p>\"And totally unworthy of me.\"</p><p>\"In a thousand ways.\"</p><p>\"And you're gonna buy lots of food and get a house in the country so I don't have to hunt in the city.\"</p><p>\"The refrigerator is full and I already have a house in the Berkshires.\"</p><p>\"Then that's all right,\" she said, sounding quite satisfied. She stretched her legs out and wiggled her toes. \"Um...the steaks are getting cold.\"</p><p>\"So am I.\"</p><p>She giggled and turned so she was straddling him, then hooked her ankles behind his waist and kissed him on the mouth. Slowly, she cupped the back of his neck and brought his mouth to her throat. \"Hungry?\" she purred.</p><p>He thought he would have a seizure. She had come back-she loved him-she would stay-and now she was freely offering him blood. Soon the Palestinians and the Israelis would make peace, and Janet would willingly enroll in charm school.</p><p>He sank his fangs into her throat without hesitation-he couldn't have held back if he tried. He could feel her breasts pressing against his chest while her blood warmed him from the inside out. She was wriggling against him-now her fingers were at his zipper-now her warm little hand was inside his trousers, clasping him, stroking him.</p><p>He groaned against her throat.</p><p>\"You did miss me!\" She shoved him back and he was happy enough to lie down for her. He stopped feeding and licked the bite mark. Her glorious breasts were jiggling in his face and he couldn't recall ever being happier, not once in his long, long life.</p><p>She seized his cock with delightful firmness and raised herself above him. His arms went around her waist as he guided her to him.</p><p>Entering her was like slipping into luxurious oil. Her head tipped back and she said</p><p>\"Ummmmm...that's good, I missed that,\" to the ceiling.</p><p>He stroked her breasts, running his fingers over her firm nipples, marveling at the softness of her skin in contrast with her strength and stamina. She'd jumped three stories and there wasn't a mark on her-and he was certainly looking! Not a bruise, not a scratch. She healed almost as quickly as he did.</p><p>\"You're gorgeous,\" he said.</p><p>\"You're just saying that to get laid,\" she teased.</p><p>\"In case you haven't noticed, I am getting laid.\"</p><p>She snorted, then began to rock back and forth. He noticed an odd, sudden reticence about her and wondered about it-then suddenly realized she had likely been on top when she crippled her first lover.</p><p>\"For heaven's sakes,\" he said with mock disgust, \"can't you go any faster than that?</p><p>Any harder? I'm about to fall asleep down here.\"</p><p>She was so astonished she nearly fell off him. Then she made the connection and smirked. \"Okey-dokey, dead guy. Here we go.\"</p><p>They ruined the carpet. They didn't care. Toward the end, she was screaming at the ceiling and he could feel his spine cracking-and didn't care. Her legs were around his waist in a crushing grip, her arms around his neck, cutting off his air-and he wanted more. He told her so, insisted on it, demanded it, then bit her ear. He could actually feel the temperature change within her as she reached orgasm, felt her uterus tightening around his shaft. That was enough to tip him dizzily over the edge.</p><p>They weren't able to speak for several minutes, until Janet finally managed, \"Oh, cripes, I think that should be against the law.\"</p><p>\"It probably is, in at least three states.\"</p><p>\"My supper's cold,\" she complained, making no move to stand up and get the tray.</p><p>\"So, I've got a microwave. Why did I even cook it? I doubt you'd have minded it raw. A werewolf,\" he mused, stroking her thigh. \"Even after I saw the truth with my own eyes, I could hardly believe it.\"</p><p>\"That's because you're kind of a dumb-ass sometimes.\"</p><p>\"I have to take this from a foul-mouthed tart like you?\"</p><p>She pounced on him, nibbled his throat. \"I'm your foul-mouthed tart, so there.\"</p><p>\"Excellent.\" He kissed her nose. \"So...how do you feel about being an undead werewolf?\"</p><p>She groaned. \"Let's talk about it in ten years, all right? Let me get used to the idea of not being pack anymore first.\"</p><p>\"It's a date. Will they come after you?\"</p><p>\"I have no idea. No one's ever voluntarily left before. I doubt the boss would really mind-he's softened up since he got hitched-but I s'pose I should tell them I'm not dead.\"</p><p>\"Tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"We've made our own pack, Jane. We're two monsters who do as they like, when they like. Everyone else had best stay out of our way.\"</p><p>\"Ooooh, God, I love it when you talk like that...\"</p><p>\"How about when I do this?\" He leaned down and nibbled on her impudent nipple, running his tongue over the velvety bumps of her areola.</p><p>\"Oh, God.\"</p><p>\"Or this?\" He sucked hard, and nipped her very, very lightly.</p><p>\"Ummmmm...\"</p><p>\"I love you.\"</p><p>\"Ummmm. Me too. Don't stop.\"</p><p>He laughed and bent to her warm, lush flesh. \"Not for a hundred years, at least.\"</p><p>\"We'll figure something out.\"</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>From the private papers of Richard Will, Ten Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>\"I'm in love!

And as any blind werewolf knows\u2014not that there were any besides him, to the best of his knowledge\u2014you could take those smells, emotions, and conversations and do a pretty good job of seeing. Not a great job, comparably speaking, but enough to get around. Enough to have a solid sense of the world.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t be pregnant,\u201d Mrs. Dane was saying. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s at least one way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m infertile! The clinic said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidents happen,\u201d he said cheerfully. He knew she was stunned, but pleased. And as soon as the shock wore off, she\u2019d be ecstatic. He could have told her that her fallopian tubes had managed to unblock themselves over the years, but that would raise awkward questions. After all, he was just her G.P. He wasn\u2019t treating her for infertility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re...\u201d Thirty-nine and a half days along \u201c...about six weeks pregnant. I\u2019m going to write you a scrip for some pre-natal vitamins, and I want you to take two a day. And the usual blandishments, of course, ease off on alcohol, don\u2019t smoke, blah-blah-blah. You know all this.\u201d Mrs. Dane was an OB nurse.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...I never thought I\u2019d need it.\u201d</p><p>He heard her weight shift as she slid off the table, and thus was ready for it when she flung her chubby arms around him in a strangler\u2019s grip. \u201cThanks so much!\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Dane, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He gently extricated himself from her grip. \u201cGo home and thank your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Now she was brighter in his mind\u2019s eye, glowing with embarrassment. \u201cI read somewhere that blind people don\u2019t like it when their balance is thrown off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You couldn\u2019t throw off my balance.\u201d Not without a truck. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to fill this on the way home,\u201d he added. He could write perfectly well, which was to say his prescriptions didn\u2019t look any less legible than a seeing doctor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRight. Right!\u201d She darted around him, nearly careened into the closed door, and left without her clothes. The gown flapped once as the door closed behind her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let you in the pharmacy dressed like that,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying you should think about it,\u201d his nurse, Barb Robinson, argued. \u201cI hate the thought of you going home to an empty house every night. And it would\u2014you know. Be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut a harness around a dog and expect it to lead me around all day?\u201d He tried not to sound as aghast as he felt. \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake, be reasonable. You get around fine, but you\u2019re not a kid anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning, since I\u2019m looking at the big four-oh, it\u2019s time to check out nursing home brochures?\u201d</p><p>Barb\u2019s scent shifted\u2014it had been lemony and intense before, because while she was embarrassed to broach the subject, she was also determined. Now, as she got annoyed, it intensified until she damned near smelled like mouthwash.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d she snapped. \u201cPride\u2019s one thing. Your safety is another. For crying out loud, you don\u2019t even use your cane most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it get you off my back if I start lugging the stick around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said promptly.</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake . \u201cFine. You may now refer to me as Dr. Stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, is all,\u201d she persisted. \u201cYou bugged me about moving to a safer neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeatedly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush up. And you\u2019d better get going\u2014isn\u2019t tonight another one of your big nights out?\u201d</p><p>You could say that. \u201cIt is indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...maybe you should take it easy. You look kind of worn out today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was up late,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cGive me the damned cane.\u201d</p><p>He heard her rummaging around beneath the counter, and then she tapped the floor in front of him. He snatched it out of her hand. \u201cThere, satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time.\u201d He obediently started tapping his way to the front door, though he knew perfectly well it was eight feet, nine inches away. \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd think about the dog!\u201d she yelled after him.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>The small gang\u2014two boys and one girl, not one of them out of their teens\u2014 followed him off the subway. Typical thugs; they needed reinforcements to rob a blind man. He led them down Milk Street and let them get close.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d he said, turning, \u201cin about half an hour the moon will be up. So this is a very, very bad idea. I mean\u2014\u201d They rushed him, and his stick caught the first one in the throat. \u201c\u2014it\u2019s a bad idea in general. There are only about a thousand\u2014\u201d His elbow clocked down on the skull of the second. \u201c\u2014 more respectable ways to make a living.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated with the girl, and nearly got his cheek sliced open for his trouble. He pulled his head back, heard the whisper of steel slide past his face, then grabbed her wrist and pulled, checking his force at the last moment. She flew past him and smacked into the brick wall, then flopped to the ground like a puppet with her strings cut. \u201cSeriously,\u201d he told the dazed, semi-conscious youths. \u201cYou should think about it. And what are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d the other werewolf said cheerfully. \u201cJust came down to see if you needed a hand. Christ, when was the last time these three had a bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going like it always does,\u201d he said carefully. He had known Wade when they were younger, but it paid to be careful around Pack.</p><p>He held out his hand and felt it engulfed by the younger man, who smelled like wood smoke and fried trout. Drake was a large man, but Wade had three inches and twenty pounds on him. If he wasn\u2019t such a pussycat, he\u2019d be terrifying. \u201cStill keeping to your place in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. This city is fucking rank, man. I only came in to stock up. The day got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to eat any of the populace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck! Have you seen what they eat? I wouldn\u2019t chew a monkey on a bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nice,\u201d Drake said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, pardon my un-fucking PC behavior. Humans, okay, and never mind what they originated from. No, really! They should be proud to be shaved apes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m glad I ran into you. You should head out to the Cape, say hi to the boss and Moira and those guys. Did you hear Moira got hitched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes. To a monkey, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...\u201d Wade stretched; Drake could hear his tendons creaking and lengthening. Their change was very close. Luckily, adolescence was far behind them both; they would stay well in control. \u201cThe new alpha gal, Jeannie, she heard about...uh...she noticed that none of the Pack...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas cursed with a devastating handicap?\u201d he asked pleasantly. He tapped his cane for emphasis.</p><p>Wade coughed. \u201cAnyway, she hit the fucking roof when Michael told her the score, and they pissed and moaned about it for, like, a damn month, during which time our fearless leader was so not getting laid, and finally Michael said it wasn\u2019t an automatic, it would be up to the parents, and they both had to agree.\u201d</p><p>Drake was silent. For the Pack, this was forward thinking indeed. Handicaps were so rare they were nearly unheard of, and when a Pack member was born blind, or deaf, or whatever, it had been tradition since time out of mind that the sire killed the cub. The dam was usually too weak from whelping, but was almost always in agreement.</p><p>His</p><p>sire, however, had died in Challenge before his birth, and his mother had wanted him. Had hidden him away at the time so the well-meaning Pack leader, Michael\u2019s father, couldn\u2019t find him and kill him. Had raised him defiantly and heartlessly\u2014absolutely no quarter given, or asked.</p><p>Drake had eventually left the Pack on his own, made his way to Boston, made a life among humans. Here, at least, he could hold his own. Humans didn\u2019t care about Challenges. They didn\u2019t even know about them.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I will pay them a visit,\u201d he lied. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Michael hadn\u2019t even been pack leader when he\u2019d left...Moira had been a precocious brat, one of the few who\u2019d tried to talk him out of leaving.</p><p>No. Done was done.</p><p>\u201cA long time?\u201d Wade was saying. \u201cYeah, like about twenty years. It\u2019s a little different now. Michael\u2019s a modern dude. No one will fuck with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for passing on the news. But I didn\u2019t leave because I was afraid of</p><p>being fucked with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did win all your Challenges,\u201d Wade admitted.</p><p>\u201cI left because I was never allowed to be myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re allowed that here? In Monkey Central?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Loneliness was such a central factor of his life, he barely </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>recognized it anymore. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, think it over.

She lives for that shit.\u201d This was said in a tone of grudging admiration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>Drake heard Wade inhale, and stretch again. \u201cFine, be a stubborn ass, I don\u2019t care. Better beat feet out of here. Gonna be a long one. Last night of the full</p><p>moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy trails,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAgain, try not to eat anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d the larger man said, loping off, \u201cdon\u2019t make me puke. Company</p><p>coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d He nearly fell down, right there in the alley. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d the girl said, coming closer. She glanced over her shoulder at the rapidly retreating Wade, then turned and glared at the unconscious gang. \u201cYou gigantic losers!\u201d</p><p>Everything was suddenly very bright, very sharp. The exhalations of the would-be attackers, Wade\u2019s retreating footsteps, the girl\u2019s perfume\u2014L\u2019Occitane Green Tea.</p><p>He could see her.</p><p>Not sense her, not get an idea of where she was and how she felt by her voice. See her. Everything around her was shades of gray, but she stood out like a beacon.</p><p>She was short\u2014her head stopped right around the middle of his chest. And her hair was that light, sunny color he assumed people meant when they said blonde. Her eyes were an odd color...not blue like ice was blue, and not purple like people had described irises...somewhere in between.</p> <p>Her hair was brutally short and so were her nails. She was wearing six earrings in her left ear, and eight in her right. She had a nose ring, a hoop through her left eyebrow, and her shirt was short enough to show off the bellybutton ring. Her stomach was sweetly rounded, and she was wearing shorts so brief they were practically denim panties. Her black tights were strategically ripped, showing flashes of creamy skin. Her tennis shoes (what color was that? Red? Orange?) were loosely tied with laces that weren\u2019t any color at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, guy? I\u2019m really sorry if they tried anything. I told them to cut the shit. I didn\u2019t think they, y\u2019know, meant it.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, glancing at the cane. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize. Do you need me</p><p>to walk you somewhere? Did they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooookey-dokey.\u201d She took a cautious step backward. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got</p><p>stuff to do tonight\u2014last chance. D\u2019you need me to call you a cab or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly Mary Mother of God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, no. Well, \u2018bye.\u201d She turned, and, frozen, he watched her walk away. Her butt was flat, and she hitched up her shorts, which gaped around her waist. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine her age\u2014twenty-two? Twenty-five? He had at least fifteen years on her.</p><p>He heard a crack, and dropped the cane\u2014he\u2019d been gripping it too hard, and it had split down the middle. Why could he see her? Why now? Was it a function of the full moon? If so, why hadn\u2019t it ever happened before? Who was she? And where was she going in such a hurry?</p><p>The clouds scudded past the moon, and suddenly he had twice as many teeth.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Crescent stood on the rooftop and stared down at the street. It wasn\u2019t so far. One measly story. Shoot, people fell that far all the time and survived...mostly...and besides, she wasn\u2019t a regular person. Probably.</p><p>If she was ever going to fly, now was the time.</p><p>She put her hands on the ledge and started to boost herself up, when she felt a sharp tug on the seat of her shorts and went flying backward. She hit the gravel rooftop and all the breath whooshed out of her lungs. So she lay there and gasped like a fish out of water, and when she was able, rolled over on her knees.</p><p>The largest wolf she had ever seen was sitting three feet away. She was too startled to be frightened. And he wasn\u2019t growling or biting, just staring at her in the moonlight.</p><p>A dog she could almost understand, even here, in the middle of the city. But a wolf? Where had it come from? Did it escape from a zoo? And how did it get up on the roof? Could wolves climb fire escapes? Was there a fire escape?</p><p>If she spread her fingers as wide as she could, its paws were just about that size. And its head was almost twice as wide as hers, with deep, almost intelligent brown eyes. His fur was a rich, chocolate brown shot with silver strands, and when the breeze ruffled its pelt, the wolf looked noble...almost kingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for?\u201d she asked the wolf. \u201cIf I want an animal biting my butt, I\u2019ll start dating again.\u201d</p><p>It stared at her. She supposed she should have been scared, but had no sense of menace from it.</p><p>\u201cAll the better to see you with, my dear,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow you stay here. I have to do something.\u201d She got up, brushed the dust off her knees, and started for the ledge. She got about a step and a half when she heard a warning growl behind her. She threw up her hands and spun around. \u201cJeez, what are you? Why are you picking on me? And why do you care? Look, I won\u2019t get hurt. I can fly. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure. And if I\u2019m wrong\u2014but I don\u2019t think I am\u2014it\u2019s only one</p><p>story.\u201d</p><p>Nope. The wolf wasn\u2019t buying it.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d she said, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>It had been a long day, and a longer night. Almost before she knew it, she</p><p>was tipping sideways. The gravel was probably cutting her cheek, but it felt like the softest of down pillows.</p><p>She slept.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>She was stiff, and freezing, and someone was shaking her by the shoulder. What the hell had happened to her cot?</p><p>She opened her eyes to see a man down on one knee beside her. And, hello! Not bad for an old guy. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, and had great dark eyes, brown hair touched with gray, and smile lines bracketing his mouth. His shoulders, in the dark suit and greatcoat he wore, were impossibly broad. His thighs were almost as big around as her waist, and he was crouching over her like a dark angel. It was a little disturbing, but kind of cool.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d His voice was deep, pleasant. He probably worked in radio. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, but she groaned when she sat up. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I fell asleep up here.\u201d She brushed gravel off her cheek and looked around. The wolf was gone, thank goodness. \u201cOh, shit! I never got to\u2014never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own beeswax,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem suicidal,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you up on a roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you up here by yourself. So you might as well tell me.\u201d \u201cDammit!\u201d What was going on? First the gang decided to be dumb (dumber than usual, anyway,) then a weird-ass giant wolf tormented her, and now this guy. God hated her is what it was. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell. I\u2019m pretty sure I can fly. I\u2019ve felt I could all my life. It sort of\u2014runs in my family. Except my family\u2019s all dead, so I never really knew for sure for sure, y\u2019know? So, anyway, last night I finally screwed up the courage to try, but I couldn\u2019t because\u2014never mind, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m a nut-job. More so than now, I mean. Anyway, that\u2019s why I\u2019m up here. Not to die. To fly.\u201d \u201cMmmm.\u201d He put a big hand on her face and peered at her pupils. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not on drugs. That\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit doing drugs when I was seventeen,\u201d she snapped, and batted his hand away. \u201cI\u2019ve been clean for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not terminally ill,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor, it\u2019s my job to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, did you do a blood test in my sleep?\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her soberly. \u201cI care.\u201d</p><p>Weird. But cool. Okay, fine. \u201cIt\u2019s Crescent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have a last name, but I\u2019m not telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you a fugitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. It\u2019s just that everybody laughs. You\u2019ll laugh.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand, palm out. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Muhn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrescent Moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe h,\u201d she said with as much dignity as she could, \u201cis silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he told her. \u201cMy last name is Dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Drake Dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d She giggled. \u201cWe\u2019re both cartoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize, of course, that we must get married.\u201d He said this with a perfectly straight face, which made her laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just too good a story to tell our grandchildren,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut first I have to do this. So, good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome down and have breakfast with me instead,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>Interestingly, she was tempted. He really was a stone fox. And she hadn\u2019t been on a date in... Let\u2019s see, she had been able to legally drink for three years, and there was that guy who took her to the rave right after...</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d God, she was slow this morning. \u201cYou\u2019re the blind guy from the alley!\u201d Except he didn\u2019t seem blind. He\u2019d checked her pupils, for crying</p><p>out loud.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem very blind.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then said again, \u201cHave breakfast with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well.

Lead on, MacDuff.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>He offered her his arm when they were at street level, and her smell shifted to amusement\u2014ripe oranges. After a moment, she grasped it.</p><p>\u201cCripes, I can\u2019t even get my fingers around your bicep. D\u2019you work out, like, nine times a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I like to keep in shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, we don\u2019t have to go anywhere fancy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could just get a cup of coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re underweight for your height. We\u2019ll get a proper meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy,\u201d she coughed into her fist.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d It was all he could do not to gape at her like a schoolboy. He had no idea why he could see her, but the effect hadn\u2019t worn off with daylight...she was like a flame in a street of shadows. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it runs in my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something? How come you don\u2019t use a dog? And where\u2019s your cane? Didn\u2019t you have one last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get around pretty well,\u201d he said, avoiding her question. \u201cI\u2019ve been blind all my life. It\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, like I said, you don\u2019t seem blind.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. Humans always told him that.</p><p>Over a breakfast of three pancakes, six pieces of toast, and two cups of coffee (hers), and a bowl of oatmeal (his), they talked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want some ham or bacon? Please, order whatever you like. I can assure you I\u2019m good for it.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hmm. That could be interesting. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s really not the best diet for an omnivore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m not chomping on dead flesh, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>She mopped up syrup with the last pancake. \u201cYeah, whatever. Can I get more coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He signaled the waitress, then asked, \u201cWhy are you so thin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask so many questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in you,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Dude, you\u2019re, like, twice my age.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was annoying. But it couldn\u2019t be helped . \u201cStop calling me dude. And it\u2019s probably not twice. I\u2019ll be forty this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed surprised. \u201cYou look younger. I\u2019m twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look younger, too. If I may ask, where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shelter on Beacon Street,\u201d she said without a trace of</p><p>embarrassment. \u201cI lost my job\u2014the economy, you know\u2014and couldn\u2019t make rent, so I\u2019ve been bouncing around a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you fell in with the little gang who attacked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they were going to do that,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI thought it was just talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you. What about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I never really knew them. Like you\u2014I guess\u2014being by myself, it\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with me for a while? I have a big house in Cambridge, and there\u2019s plenty of room for a guest.\u201d</p><p>She snorted into her coffee cup. \u201cRight. Go home with the strange guy who showed up out of nowhere, who says he\u2019s blind but doesn\u2019t trip over anything. Not too creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to show offense. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. In your sleep? I would never.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cOh, okay, so, we\u2019ve established you won\u2019t kill me in</p><p>my sleep. That\u2019s promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe homeless shelter is preferable to my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no offense, dude...Drake, I mean...but put yourself in my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But consider this, you could have pancakes every morning,\u201d</p><p>he coaxed, \u201cand all the coffee you could drink. Until you get back on your feet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but looked tempted. \u201cJeez, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even considering this. If this was a horror movie, I\u2019d be yelling at the screen. \u2018Don\u2019t do it, you dumb bitch!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. I would really enjoy your company. I live a...solitary life. It would be nice to have a...a friend over.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment. \u201cWell. I have to admit it\u2019s the nicest offer I\u2019ve gotten all year. But here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m getting these \u2018take-the-poor-waif-home-and- take-care-of-her\u2019 vibes from you, but I\u2019m not sure you get it. My family died when I was a toddler, and I left the foster home when I was ten. I\u2019ve been on my own a long time. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the thing is, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ll...uh...do for you. You know. In order to stay at your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to.\u201d And, fortunately, she was a good two weeks from ovulation. He\u2019d be nowhere near his change then. It could be problematic when a roommate\u2019s cycle coincided with a male werewolf\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t have to worry about that, at least. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any strings, Crescent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She finished her coffee. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this. But we\u2019ll try it. For a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He smiled at her, and she smiled back. He\u2019d never seen a smile before. Hers made him dizzy.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>They walked in and she was instantly dazzled. Like the big colonial house hadn\u2019t been impressive enough on the outside. \u201cWow! How many windows do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry. It\u2019s so bright in here!\u201d She was staring; she couldn\u2019t help it. Her first, jumbled impression was lots of light, a soaring living room ceiling, a loft, and lots of hardwood flooring. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to turn any lights on during the day. Not that you would.\u201d</p><p>He was hanging his greatcoat in the closet. \u201cI like to feel the sun on my face,\u201d</p><p>he said simply.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone ever tell you, you live in a pink house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few have mentioned it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWhat do I care?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI s\u2019pose. It\u2019s just sort of funny. I mean, you\u2019re this big, supermasculine guy, and your house is the color of a faded pink sweatshirt. It\u2019s a little weird.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was disconcerting\u2014like he was looking right at her. But of course he wasn\u2019t. He probably knew she was standing by the door because of her voice. \u201cSuper masculine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re about the biggest, boldest guy I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. And stop calling me dude.\u201d</p><p>He was the sharpest \u201chandicapped\u201d person she\u2019d ever seen. He paid for breakfast with cash...and she noticed the twenty-dollar bills were folded into triangles, and the ten was a rectangle. Of course...it made perfect sense. He couldn\u2019t see the denominations, and the bills would all feel the same. Did he get them that way from the bank? Or did he have a helper to fold his money? Maybe she could fold his dough, earn her keep...</p><p>But it was just so weird, because he always seemed to know where she was\u2014he caught her before she started to trip on the curb, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you to your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, kicking off her sneakers and following him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She expected a simple guest room with a utilitarian twin bed and an empty bureau. Instead, he escorted her to paradise. The bed, a mahogany four-poster, was against the window, and sunlight was splashed all over the Shaker quilt.</p><p>Through the open door on the opposite side of the room she could see a gleaming bathroom with tiles the color of the sea, and the bureau beside her was almost as tall as she was.</p><p>\u201cUh...you sure you don\u2019t have a cot in the basement or something?\u201d she asked nervously. The room was so clean, so beautiful, she was afraid to move, lest she destroy it all. \u201cOr maybe a blanket I could spread out on the kitchen floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. This is your room now, for as long as you like. I\u2019ll leave you to get settled.\u201d And, abruptly, he was gone.</p><p>\u201cGet settled?\u201d she asked the empty room. \u201cHow?\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted him to see the shelter, so she had no extra clothes. Well, she\u2019d sneak out tonight and go get them. And she\u2019d find Moran and his little gang of retards, and give them a piece of her mind. Imagine, trying to rob a blind guy.</p><p>She wandered back out to the living room and eyed the loft.</p><p>Hmmm...</p><p>She noiselessly climbed the stairs, and had time to notice the loft was actually an office\u2014desk, computer with big-ass speakers, bookshelves\u2014before she clambered up onto the railing. This would be even easier\u2014this was only one story. Less, actually. Just a few feet. Piece of cake. If she couldn\u2019t fly here, she couldn\u2019t fly anywhere.</p><p>\u201cSomething for lunch?\u201d Drake called from the kitchen. Good, he was a couple of rooms away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still stuffed from breakfast,\u201d she called back, and dived off the railing.</p><p>She flopped over in mid-air, and had time to notice the living room doing a one-eighty around her, and then she fell into Drake\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d she gasped. \u201cHow\u2019d you do that? You were, like, fifty feet away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d he snapped. \u201cStop climbing things and leaping off of them, before you give me a heart attack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut how\u2019d you know I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise, Crescent. As long as you\u2019re in this house, no more crazy jumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t be hurt,\u201d she explained earnestly, resisting the urge to snuggle into his arms. He was holding her like she weighed as much as a bag of feathers, like it was nothing. And the way he was scowling down at her\u2014it should have been scary, but instead, she wanted to smooth out the frown lines with her fingertips. \u201cReally! I\u2019m sure I can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot in my house,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNow promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d She wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. She was curious.</p><p>\u201cOr I won\u2019t put you down.\u201d</p><p>Now she did smooth out the frown line over his eyebrow. Weirdly\u2014but nicely\u2014he leaned down and nuzzled her nose. She felt her nipples tighten and fought the urge to squirm in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to carry me around all day?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>He smiled down at her. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be much of a hardship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I promise. No more jumping off stuff in your house.\u201d But I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t jump anywhere else...</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He set her on her feet, gave her a warning smack on the ass which stung like hell\u2014 \u201cHey!\u201d \u2014and walked back to the kitchen.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>He heard her as she tiptoed past his room. Actually, he heard her when she opened her eyes and sat up in bed. He knew from her smell she hadn\u2019t slept, and made sure he didn\u2019t either.</p><p>When she stole out of his house like a thief in reverse, he was right behind her.</p> <p>Bags were always in short supply at the shelter, so she just gathered a few changes of clothes to her chest and stole back outside. Unfortunately, she caught Maria\u2019s eye on the way out. Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped. The woman gobbled speed like it was Tic-Tacs, and she never slept.</p><p>Crescent crept down the alley behind the shelter, thinking she still had time to catch the Red Line back to the bus stop near Drake\u2019s house, when she heard running footsteps and turned to see the Asshole Brigade.</p><p>\u201cNew crib?\u201d Maria asked. She was one of those women who always smiled\u2014who smiled when you knew they were screaming inside. \u201cNew man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and no, and mind your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up, Cress.\u201d That was Nick Moran, the leader of the incredibly lame group. \u201cYou got something for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cress-ent, and no, I sure don\u2019t. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d She shifted her weight and clutched her clothes a little tighter. She did not want to let these three put her in the middle of their nasty little circle. Her gut almost always led her right\u2014why else was she staying with a stranger?\u2014and maybe it did this time, too. Maybe when she fell in with these idiots, they didn\u2019t really know how bad it could get. Her gut was good, but it couldn\u2019t foresee the future. \u201cRobbing a blind guy? Trying to, anyway. You couldn\u2019t even pull that off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Nick said roughly. He was a tall, cadaverously thin man with the bare beginnings of a mustache, and a scar that bisected his left cheek. \u201cWe had it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did. \u2018Bye.\u201d</p> <p>Jimmy, the other schmuck, clawed at her elbow and managed to grab it. \u201cWhyn\u2019t you take us to his place?\u201d he asked. His tone was reasonable, but she wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cCute piece of ass like you, bet you\u2019ve already got a key.\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact, she did. As a further matter of fact, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to let them have it. \u201cForget it,\u201d she said, trying to pull away. \u201cFuck off, you three, before I lose my temper. I can\u2019t believe I ever felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for us?\u201d Nick echoed, expression darkening. \u201cBe sorry for you. Because when we get done, you won\u2019t be so pretty no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s any more. For God\u2019s sake, Nick, you went to private school before your folks kicked you out.\u201d</p><p>Nick blushed\u2014he hated being reminded he hadn\u2019t been born to the streets\u2014 but Marie\u2019s smile widened, if that was possible. Crescent observed that the woman had a nodding acquaintance at best with toothpaste. \u201cWe can do this the easy way\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cOh, spare me your thug clich\u00e9s.\u201d Crescent was more annoyed than frightened, which she supposed was something. She\u2019d been a moron to come back here by herself\u2014and for what? So Drake wouldn\u2019t see the shelter? Who cared what he thought? Big overprotective dope. And she wasn\u2019t going to be winning any College Bowls, either, unless she starting relying a little more heavily on instinct and less on pride.</p><p>Jimmy\u2019s other hand\u2014the one not squeezing her elbow\u2014darted forward like a pale spider and grabbed her nipple. Then he started to pinch. Hard. Crescent could drop her clothes all over the filthy alley floor, or she could stand there.</p><p>She stood there. Never in a thousand years would she show these three how much he was hurting her. \u201cCut the shit,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cYou think acting like bullying assholes is going to change my mind about you?\u201d She looked at Nick, waiting for him to call off his dog.</p><p>Jimmy was giggling and Maria was grinning, and Crescent\u2019s eyes were watering, and she had just decided to drop her clothes and kick Jim in the \u2018nads when Jim was flying away from her, literally flying. He sailed through the air and crumpled to the street a good ten feet away.</p><p>She had a glimpse of big hands cupping the curve of Maria\u2019s skull, and Nick\u2019s, and then there was a klonk as their heads banged together. It sounded awfully like the time she dropped a cantaloupe on the floor.</p><p>And then Drake was towering over her. Scowling, as usual.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned,\u201d she said, gaping up at him, \u201cthat for a blind guy, you get around pretty good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d He pushed her crossed arms down, and carefully raised her T-shirt, then eased her bra cup down so he could examine her nipple. This was startling, and quite nice. She reminded herself that he was a doctor, and hers was probably one of about six thousand nipples he saw in a year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty red,\u201d he said after a long moment. He was leaning so close, she could feel his breath on the swollen peak, and shifted her weight again.</p><p>Suddenly her shorts felt too tight, in a pleasantly irritating way. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d Her mouth was suddenly very dry, and she coughed. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s red?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Instead, he smoothed her hair away from her eyes. \u201cIf you steal out of my house in the middle of the night again,\u201d he said, quite pleasantly, \u201cI\u2019ll beat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake, seriously. Why d\u2019you care?\u201d</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cI care.\u201d Then he pulled her up on her tiptoes and kissed her with bruising strength.</p><p>She dropped her clothes. Fuckit.</p><p>Kissing Drake\u2014well, being kissed by Drake\u2014was an entirely novel experience. For one thing, the man didn\u2019t have an ounce of flab anywhere. For another, she had the distinct impression he could snap her spine like kindling. But this thought was as exciting as it was slightly scary.</p><p>He pulled away and she stumbled forward. \u201cOh, no, don\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped. \u201cKiss me some more\u2014I\u2019m not dizzy enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, and she was delighted to see his breaths, too, were coming hard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take you in the alley like a\u2014come on.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand, hauled her out until they were under the streetlights, and flagged a cab. He practically threw her inside, then slammed the door and tersely told the driver his address.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes,\u201d she said, staring out the back window. \u201cAnd after all the stupid trouble I went to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a Gap store,\u201d he replied, and didn\u2019t let go of her hand until the cab pulled into his driveway.</p><p>Drake fumbled for his wallet, then grabbed a bunch of cash and threw it at the driver, dragging her out in the same instant. She heard the driver\u2019s gasp of surprise and appreciation, and then he was pulling out of the driveway and, in typical Boston driver fashion, pulling into traffic without looking.</p><p>She jumped into Drake\u2019s arms. He held her easily, his hands cupping her bottom, and she nibbled his lower lip. \u201cI think you tipped him \u2018bout a thousand percent,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cAsk me if I give a fuck,\u201d he growled back. He shifted his grip, reached, and tore her shirt from the neck down.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>They didn\u2019t make it to the bedroom. They didn\u2019t even make it to the front steps. Instead, he took her in the lilac bushes, and to the end of her days she would associate that scent with Drake\u2019s urgency.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d she panted, helping him tear out of his coat, his shirt, his pants. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s what they all say.\u201d Except she felt as if she knew him, too. Independent and proud and kind and gentle, but a hard man when he had to be. A velvet fist when circumstances demanded it.</p><p>He tore her panties off and then gently parted her. She was slippery and he groaned when his fingers slid through her, into her, and while his fingers were busy stroking and parting the slick folds between her legs, his thumb was on her clit, gently rubbing, and his lips were on her sore nipple, licking and kissing.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she groaned. Oh, Christ, had she ever wanted anyone this badly? Had anyone? \u201cLater for that stuff. Fuck me, before I go out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>He left her nipple after one last kiss, then caught her hand, brought it between them, and let her fingers curl around his enormous length. He throbbed beneath her touch and she could feel his slippery tip. She ran her thumb over it and he shuddered in her arms.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so small, I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wriggled beneath him and licked her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m small and you\u2019re big, and it\u2019s going to hurt just right. Now stop talking and...fuck...me.\u201d</p> <p>He obliged, parting her and surging forward, filling her up, forcing her to open for him, and still he came forward, pushing, thrusting, until she thought she would soon feel him in the back of her throat.</p><p>He withdrew, and in the waning light of the moon she could see the sweat on his brow, the way his eyes were shining, almost glinting, and then he surged forward, shoved forward, and she wrapped her legs around his waist and shrieked into the night air.</p><p>They rocked together in the grass, and when she put her hands on his taut butt, she could feel the muscles flexing as he worked over her, as he thrust and withdrew and pushed and surged. She opened her mouth for another yell\u2014it</p><p>was too sweetly divine to keep quiet\u2014when his hand clamped over her mouth. She writhed in silence beneath him and, several seconds later, heard the couple walk by on the sidewalk a bare ten yards away.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hear you,\u201d he murmured in her ear, his voice so thick it was nearly unrecognizable. \u201cThey\u2019ll come over her and see me fucking you in my side yard.\u201d</p> <p>The thought was so blatantly exciting she came at once, actually felt herself get wetter. He groaned in her ear, then bit her earlobe.</p><p>It went on like that for some time\u2014she would never be able to guess how long they went at each other in the lilac bushes. Every once in a while his phenomenal hearing would pick up something and he\u2019d cover her mouth again, without missing a stroke. But when he finally came, his shout was a roar that made her ears ring.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he gasped, collapsing over her.</p><p>\u201cIf anybody heard that, you\u2019ll have some explaining to do, Doctor.\u201d She tried to sound saucy, but mostly, she just wheezed.</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d He was kissing the side of her neck, wet snuffly kisses that made her shiver and press closer to him. \u201cDon\u2019t leave in the middle of the night anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Think we can make it inside without showing the neighbors our bare butts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to find out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cI think I got something caught on your bellybutton ring,\u201d he said later, simply because it was much too soon to ask her to be his mate, and he had to say something.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? Life with me is a constant adventure.\u201d She yawned and flopped over on her back. \u201cAnd, may I add, not bad for an old guy. Seriously. You must take, like, super Geritol, because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d he said wryly. They were in his bed, watching the stars through the skylight. \u201cI was just about to compliment you on being adequate in bed despite an obvious lack of experience.\u201d</p><p>She smacked him on the bicep. \u201cHey! And...ow...that was like slapping a rock. FYI, dude, I\u2019ve got gobs of experience. There was that time in the movie theater...um...and once during a snowball fight a boy fell down on top of me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, you\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake, what is it with you?\u201d she asked abruptly. Her scent shift warned him\u2014from playful soap bubbles to fresh green leaves\u2014even if her tone hadn\u2019t. \u201cSeriously. I mean, you swoop down on me all Knight in Shining Armani, which is nice, if weird, and you don\u2019t ask for anything at all, and you\u2019re super nice, but</p> <p>you must want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, sliding his hand up her thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, spare me. Like you were going to kick me out for not putting</p><p>out...don\u2019t think so. I mean, here we are, and frankly, most men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me your knowledge of most men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. But seriously. What\u2019s your deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a double deal,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cAnd either one will, as you might say, freak you out in the extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dude, I\u2019d never say anything so lame...well, why don\u2019t you try one, see how that goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on! Then I\u2019ll tell you something about me. Something</p><p>nobody else knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides the fact that you have smelly feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraaaaaaaaaaaake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, don\u2019t yowl. Okay. Well. Here it is, then.\u201d</p><p>She propped her chin up on her fist and waited.</p><p>He coughed.</p><p>She kept waiting.</p><p>\u201cWell. Ah. You see, it\u2019s difficult to just\u2014you know\u2014blurt it out like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hoping I\u2019ll die of old age so you won\u2019t have to say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d he practically snapped. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he continued, emboldened when she didn\u2019t run screaming from the room. He patted her thigh tentatively. \u201cIt\u2019s startling, but you don\u2019t have to be afraid, because I\u2019d never hurt you or eat you\u2014ah, that is to say, outside the bedroom I would never eat you, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ! That!\u201d She batted his hand away. \u201cI knew about that! You were supposed to tell me something I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He actually shook his head to check his hearing. No, there was her heartbeat, lub-dub, lub-dub, and her breaths, and the hum of electricity, and the cool clink of the freezer making an ice cube...everything was working fine. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She lunged upward, hopped off the bed, and started pacing back and forth. Moonlight splashed her as she stomped; an enraged goddess etched in cream. \u201cWell, what else would it be? You\u2019re super-strong, super-fast, you\u2019re blind but you get around better than I do...plus, you\u2019re a doctor, for God\u2019s sake. How could you be such a good doctor without, I dunno, super everything else? It was either that or I figured you were an alien. But after just now\u2014the bushes, you know\u2014I figured you probably weren\u2019t an alien. Besides, this wolf stops me from throwing myself off the roof, and then you just happen to show up a few hours later?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cOh. I must say this is very anticlimactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServes you right for assuming I was a dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not! No one\u2019s ever guessed before. And I\u2019ve had...ah...lady friends who have hung around quite a bit longer than you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She waved \u2018lady friends who have hung around\u2019 away. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing about me\u2014the secret thing\u2014I was gonna tell you. I can tell things about people. That\u2019s why I came home with you. I didn\u2019t just think you wouldn\u2019t hurt me, I knew you wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s like I can get into a person\u2019s head and tell exactly what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpathic, hmm? That\u2019s interesting. Well, Crescent, for heaven\u2019s sakes, why do you keep giving that gang of yours a second chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they might be a little crazy,\u201d she replied matter-of-factly. \u201cWhen we meet up, they never feel like they\u2019re going to hurt me. Then they get mad, and...anyway, obviously my radar isn\u2019t 100% right all the time. Close enough for jazz, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this fixation with flying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I totally can! I know it! You just have to stop getting in the way when I jump off of things.\u201d</p><p>Empathy...flight fixation...and her build, small and speedy...but surprisingly heavy for her height...could it be? He had assumed they were legend. Rather like werewolves.</p><p>\u201cCrescent,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201chave you ever had an X-ray?\u201d</p><p>Startled by the abrupt subject change, she blinked at him like a blonde doe. \u201cUh...not in the last few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never knew your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned you\u2019re sexy when you go all \u2018pondering physicianesque\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pouncing on her and bearing her back on the bed like a cat with a new toy. \u201cYou haven\u2019t. Please elaborate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah...I\u2019ve had enough of talking.\u201d She grabbed his ears and pulled him down for a kiss. He could feel her tongue dancing in his mouth and suddenly everything was much louder, much clearer. It was amazing to make love with a woman and be able to see her, really see her. He couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>He broke the kiss, having forgotten about her origins and regained new interest in her breasts, which were small, like winter apples. He sucked a nipple into his mouth and tongued it gently. She squirmed beside him and wriggled closer. He slipped his hand between her thighs and slid his fingers through her curls, still damp from their lovemaking. In fact, she was deliciously hot and sticky down there.</p><p>He slid his fingers through her slick folds, found her clit, pressed lightly, then rubbed the tender area around it, and dipped a finger inside her. He licked her cleavage, tasting her sweat and trying to resist the urge to give her a good nip, a mark that would last for days. His mark.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHow do you do that? I thought we were done, but I could fuck you to death right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are worse ways to go,\u201d he teased, but his tongue felt too thick in his mouth, and now there were two fingers inside her.</p><p>Quick as a fish, she slid away from him, shoved him over on his back, and straddled him. \u201cStop me if you\u2019ve heard this, like, a hundred times before, but you\u2019re really good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it be\u2014ouch!\u201d She\u2019d reached back to cup his testicles, and her grip had tightened. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood dog.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think you should mock my origins,\u201d he said, but talking was getting much harder, as she had wrapped her fingers around his cock and was squeezing, then releasing, then squeezing. \u201cAfter all, you\u2014uh\u2014what were we talking about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now her hand was sliding up and down with delicious, if agonizing, slowness. \u201cOrigins,\u201d she prompted helpfully.</p><p>\u201cRight. You descended from apes. And that\u2019s\u2014actually\u2014that\u2019s quite fine\u2014 really\u2014ah\u2014you\u2019re not going to stop, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Fraid so, big guy.\u201d She must have taken pity at his horrified expression, because she shifted her hips and then he was sliding up inside her. \u201cWhy should you have all the\u2014all the\u2014fun?\u201d She\u2019d been riding him while talking, lifting up and then slamming back down. Now she was just as breathless as he, thank goodness, and oh Christ, she was so sweet and it felt so good, it felt amazing. Her hands were clutching his shoulders as she pumped and pumped, and he grabbed her knees and spread her thighs wider on the down stroke. Her eyes rolled up in her head and he felt her uterus contracting around his cock as she came.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d she cried at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he panted. He grabbed her hips and lifted, released, lifted, released. She shuddered all over and he felt her clench again. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a while for me, dear. That whole middle-aged thing, you know. Hope you\u2019ve buckled in for a long ride.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled, trying to lift herself off him, but he held on because he needed her right where she was, and because he knew she wasn\u2019t truly worried. He used her roughly, because he knew she wanted him to do so, but also because he needed to be a little rough\u2014needed to make an impression on her mind, if not her body. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was a werewolf thing, or strictly a male prerogative.</p><p>When she was clawing at his shoulders and begging him, when she was very nearly sore from coming, he finally let himself go. Shooting off inside her was like a dream, the best he ever had.</p><p>She collapsed over him, panting. He stroked her back, savoring the fine sheen of sweat he found there.</p> <p>\u201cOh, dude,\u201d she said at last. \u201cA girl could fall in love.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, and then they laughed together, like mates.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cDrake. Seriously. How many T-shirts do you think I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re so versatile,\u201d the Gap saleswoman piped up.</p><p>\u201cNot to mention fragile,\u201d Drake whispered in her ear, and was gratified to see her blush.</p> <p>\u201cYou go away,\u201d she ordered the woman, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re helping him spend way too much money as it is. And you\u2014put that down. Khaki\u2014yech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is the Gap,\u201d the saleswoman said (\u201cAsk me how to save 15%\u201d was</p><p>emblazoned in hysterical red ink on her lapel button), obediently retreating.</p><p>\u201cWhat, so I have to wear the uniform, too? Keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering you any woman\u2019s dream,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019re still making</p><p>mischief.\u201d \u201cA) Chauvinist much? Any woman\u2019s dream? Shopping at Faneuil Hall? And</p><p>B) put those down. I already picked out pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need more than two pairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot according to some,\u201d she said, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, advancing on her, momentarily slowed by a whirl of khaki</p><p>as she threw the pants at him.</p><p>\u201cForget it, pal. Neither the time nor the place. Excuse me,\u201d she added, bumping into a silver, headless mannequin. \u201cOh, gross! I hate when I think</p><p>they\u2019re people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some empathy you\u2019ve got at work there,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cOff my case, Dr. Furball. What, you never ever made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>He thought hard. \u201cNothing springs to mind.\u201d</p><p>She let out a yelp of anger and he could tell she was sorry she had nothing in her arms to toss at him any longer. \u201cDude, I hate to point this out, but you can\u2019t see. You must have screwed up something. Clashing tie, maybe?\u201d</p><p>He tossed her a blouse the color of her eyes and said in a low voice, although the saleswoman was across the store, \u201cHomo saps are more handicapped than I, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, the one-eyed man in the country of the blind, and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEssentially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not that bad.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can smell an iron deficiency. I can hear a heart murmur without a stethoscope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can tell this blouse doesn\u2019t go with those pants, so put it right back on the rack, pal. God, aren\u2019t you bored? These are all for me and I\u2019m just about bored out of my tits.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThanks for the visual. I\u2019ll make a note to catalog order for you from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. Not that you need to keep buying me clothes.\u201d</p><p>Want to bet ? \u201cI suppose taking you to Anne Klein to look at dresses would be a complete waste of time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarf out! Jeez, look how late it\u2019s getting! The sun\u2019s actually gone down. God, how long have we been doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince supper. Stop complaining, we\u2019re almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to see you make me,\u201d she said pertly.</p><p>\u201cDone and done. If you\u2019re quite\u2014\u201d He paused suddenly. Was that a whiff of Pack? It sure was. Hmm, two in one week. It wasn\u2019t often he ran into one a year. That was interesting. Now what to do about it?</p><p>\u201cDick, I swear to fucking God, if you don\u2019t stop bitching I\u2019m going to pull out your eyeballs and shove them down your pants.\u201d The voice was strident, loud, and female.</p><p>\u201cThat could be fun,\u201d a low-pitched male voice he didn\u2019t recognize said cheerfully. \u201cAnd who\u2019s bitching? I just got up. What are we doing here? I didn\u2019t know you liked the Gap, m\u2019dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking well hate it and you damn know it. But they\u2019re having a sale and I can stock up. I fucking hate shopping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman after my own heart,\u201d Crescent muttered, holding up a sleeveless sweater. It was touching her, so he could see it was the color of mucous. Everything else was the usual gray blur...but that scent...he knew that scent...</p><p>Drake moved to get a closer look. It couldn\u2019t be. And with a man? No. It had been too many years; he was mistaken. Still, no one else he knew packed that many \u2018fucks\u2019 into everyday language.</p><p>He stepped around the stack of red miniskirts, nostrils flared. Yes. It was she. \u201cJanet Lupo?\u201d</p><p>He heard her drop the pile of clothing, and could smell her shock. Despite her completely flabbergasted expression, he could tell by her scent that she was looking good\u2014great, in fact. Very healthy, with a vitality about her that had been lacking in the girl he\u2019d once known.</p><p>Interestingly, he had no sense of the man with her except as a bundle of formidable power. No real scent at all, but tall. Very strange.</p><p>\u201cFuck a duck,\u201d Janet said.</p><p>\u201cHello, Janet. It\u2019s nice to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake had an impression of blurred motion, and then he went sailing through the window front and bounced onto the cobblestones. Broken glass rained down everywhere.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Crescent worked very hard on not shrieking. It wasn\u2019t easy. There they\u2019d been, minding their own business, when this bitch came out of nowhere and threw Drake through a window\u2014through the damn window!\u2014and now the two of them were rolling in the street like a couple of alley cats\u2014or wolves, probably; wolves would be more accurate, and the place was emptying pretty quick as the stampede started, and Drake was down, was on his back, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cGet off!\u201d Crescent leapt forward, but a brick fell on her shoulder and yanked her back.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d the blonde hottie said mildly. He was a yummy one, all right, and towered over her almost as much as Drake did. Skinny drink of water, though. She observed that the brick was his hand. Strong drink of water, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s a family thing. Better let them\u2014ow.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never hit anyone in the face before, and was disappointed. Blondie just sort of shook it off and rubbed his jaw. \u201cNow don\u2019t you start. There\u2019s only one woman permitted to smack me around, and she\u2019s currently rolling in a mud puddle with your friend.\u201d</p><p>Show him your necklace.</p><p>Obeying the inner voice that was never, ever wrong\u2014but which didn\u2019t speak up nearly often enough\u2014she fumbled for one of the three necklaces around her neck, broke the chain, and thrust it at him. To her amazement, he stumbled backward and threw a hand over his face. Just like in the movies!</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being mean,\u201d he said reprovingly, groping for her. \u201cPut that cross away before you hurt someone. Like me!\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, turned her back, stuffed the cross in her pocket, grabbed the cow around the waist, and pulled. \u201cGet off,\u201d she huffed. Grabbing her lover\u2019s attacker was not unlike trying to stop an army tank\u2014the woman absolutely did not budge. But she shrugged\u2014nearly dislodging Crescent\u2014and punched Drake</p><p>in the eye for good measure.</p><p>\u201cYour monkey\u2019s bothering me,\u201d she told him, and punched him again.</p><p>\u201cCrescent, don\u2019t,\u201d Drake said sharply. There was a rill of blood trickling down his chin, but other than that he looked unharmed. Anybody else would be spurting blood from about six different arteries after sailing through a plate glass window\u2014thank goodness for werewolf constitution! \u201cGet back. Get out of the way. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, short stuff.\u201d Bam! Another punch. \u201cHe\u2019ll be just fine. Why don\u2019t you go get a Frappuccino?\u201d</p><p>She ignored them, and stubbornly tugged again.</p><p>\u201cCrescent, get away from here. In a minute I\u2019m going to forget to be a gentlemen\u2014Goddammit, Janet, if you hit my jaw again I\u2019ll put you over my knee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d Crescent tried a new grip and pulled harder. \u201cNobody\u2019s getting spanked but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hottie said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI said get off him!\u201d She suddenly felt her forearm clutched in an unbelievably strong grip, and then she was sailing over the woman\u2019s head, only to hit the sidewalk ass-first. The shock went all the way up her spine and she yelped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUnwise,\u201d Drake said, shrugging out of his coat.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Nothing personal, Blind Man\u2019s Bluff, but you\u2019re fucked. Can\u2019t have anybody ratting me out to Mikey Boss Man, so sorry, sit still and die now,</p><p>okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass. And I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Janet. Can\u2019t you two solve this a little more amicably than</p><p>introducing death into the equation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPipe down, Dick, no one hit your buzzer.\u201d</p><p>Crescent bounced up from the pavement. All three of them looked surprised to see her still in the game. \u201cI said,\u201d she growled, \u201ckeep your hands off my man, bitch!\u201d Then she punched the cow in the jaw.</p> <p>This was infinitely more gratifying than when she\u2019d hit El Hottie. The woman rolled away from Drake like a bowling ball and slammed up against the Gap\u2019s front door, cupping her hands beneath her chin to catch the blood, and Crescent felt the shock of the blow race all the way up to her shoulder.</p><p>The woman spit a tooth into her palm. \u201cHey, that actually hurt, you little cunt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s interesting,\u201d El Hottie said approvingly. He was the most detached man she\u2019d ever met. What a weirdo! \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like a meateater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrescent!\u201d Drake was utterly shocked. It was almost worth getting jumped, just to see the look on his face. \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to talk about it now? Or do I have to keep kicking the shit out of what\u2019s-her-cow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d what\u2019s-her-cow said warningly. \u201cWatch the language.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have a problem with cow? You put your hands on him again, I\u2019ll kick your ass up so high people will think you have a second head. Cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the midget.\u201d But the woman\u2019s lips were twitching\u2014like Drake\u2019s did when he was amused, and trying not to show it.</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say. All cow and no cow makes cow a cow-cow.\u201d</p><p>The woman reddened...then laughed reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Janet,\u201d Drake was saying, limping over to her and helping her out of the dirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? I haven\u2019t seen you in\u2014what? Fifteen years? And you attack me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we could talk about this over a drink,\u201d Hottie commented. He grinned, and Crescent nearly screamed. He had about a thousand teeth, and they all looked very sharp. \u201cSo to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014so now we\u2019re sort of...uh...in love and stuff. And I\u2019m not going back,\u201d Janet added defiantly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sell me on the advantages of going rogue,\u201d Drake said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, so, you\u2019d get in trouble with your boss? The\u2014what d\u2019you call him? Pack Leader?\u201d Crescent dumped a third packet of sugar into her coffee. \u201cWhat\u2019s he care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Janet replied after a long pause. \u201cBut it\u2019s not worth it to me. The risk, I mean. He could order me to stay on the Cape and I\u2014I would have to obey, or disobey.\u201d</p><p>They were sitting in the corner of the Starbuck\u2019s on Park Street, speaking in low voices. Although Crescent wasn\u2019t sure why they bothered. This was Boston, after all. Nobody gave a shit.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about me. You\u2019re only the second Pack member I\u2019ve run into in the last year,\u201d Drake said. \u201cAnd even if I were to run into Michael\u2014which isn\u2019t likely\u2014I certainly wouldn\u2019t mention you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have... Uh.\u201d Janet coughed. \u201cYou know. Kicked the shit out of you without asking questions first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said kindly, ignoring Crescent and Richard\u2019s snickers.</p><p>\u201cYou might think about moving,\u201d Crescent suggested. \u201cIf your boss and all his lackey werewolves live on the Cape. I mean, you\u2019re only ninety miles away. If you lived in\u2014I dunno, Argentina? That would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur home is here,\u201d Janet said stubbornly. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re all over the world. Might as well stake out a small claim and defend it here as well as anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Crescent noticed the hottie\u2014Richard\u2014hadn\u2019t touched his frozen coffee. \u201cAren\u2019t you thirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your story, blondie?\u201d Janet asked. \u201cGetting smacked by you was like getting smacked by a two-by-four. What do you have for bone marrow, steel ball bearings?\u201d</p><p>Crescent blinked at the interruption. \u201cWell, I think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014might be part fey.\u201d Drake finished for her.</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyebrows arched. \u201cReally? I thought your kind died out years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairy, not fey, and most of us have\u2014at least, I\u2019ve never been able to find anybody else like me. And Drake, how the hell did you know that? I never got around to telling you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed yesterday,\u201d he explained, \u201cand when you smacked Janet I knew for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, back up.\u201d Janet put her palms out like a traffic cop. \u201cYou\u2019re a fairy?</p><p>Like Tinkerbelle? With wings and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see any wings?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cJeez, nobody told me fairies had such rotten tempers,\u201d Janet muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just mad because I figured it out,\u201d Drake said with annoying</p><p>smugness. \u201cShe was saving it for a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so insufferable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt runs in the family,\u201d Janet added with a grin. \u201cThe men especially. So</p><p>annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Richard said. \u201cMale werewolves are the annoying ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut up. Listen, I always heard fairies were these little delicate things.</p><p>You hit like a bulldozer. I\u2019m gonna have to wait for that tooth to grow back, which sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDense bones,\u201d Drake said.</p><p>\u201cDifficult to break,\u201d Richard added. \u201cI ran into one of your kind about seventy years ago, and he nearly killed me. He was quite old even then, dear, so don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s dust by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Crescent said faintly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so disappointed. He was a nasty old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis explains your fixation with flying,\u201d Drake said, thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cDense bones, and she can fly?\u201d Janet snorted into her Caramel Mocha Frappucchino. \u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever see an airplane take off?\u201d Crescent asked. \u201cYou look at it and wonder how something that heavy can ever get off the earth...and then it goes...and you\u2019re left on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you can\u2019t fly with all those accessories.\u201d Whip-quick, Richard flicked his spoon at his whipped cream, and a dollop appeared as if by magic on the end of Janet\u2019s nose. \u201cBut you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dick! Quit throwing whipped cream on me; you know I hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Crescent nearly yelled.</p><p>Richard looked startled. \u201cAll your piercings. You probably set off metal</p><p>detectors in airports. And of course your kind can\u2019t tolerate certain metals.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s eyes nearly bulged out of his head. Crescent knew exactly how he felt. How had she never thought of this before?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Janet had finally gotten the last of the</p><p>whipped cream off her nose. \u201cDrake, you look like you just crapped your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014um\u2014I want to fly, but I can\u2019t. But I never made the connection\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Janet practically yelled.</p><p>\u201cFairies have a legendary fear of metal, especially iron,\u201d Richard explained.</p><p>\u201cIn Crescent\u2019s case, I would guess that translates into being unable to get off the\u2014what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Tearing out all her goddamned earrings and rings, that\u2019s what she was doing. Between her ears, nose, and belly button, she had over a dozen.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re done talking,\u201d Janet commented when Crescent stood up so quickly, her chair fell over.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a back door behind the second coffee machine,\u201d Drake said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure now is the appropriate\u2014Crescent?\u201d</p><p>She ran for the door and it was right where he told her it would be. She was through it in a flash and bounding up one, two, three flights of stairs, and praise all the gods, the door to the roof was propped open and then she was out in the open.</p><p>She dove off the roof. At the last moment, she closed her eyes\u2014she\u2019d been disappointed too many times not to feel a twinge of anxiety. She knew she wouldn\u2019t break any bones, but landing hurt, all the same.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t landing.</p><p>She cracked open one eye and saw Janet, Richard, and Drake standing on the roof, looking at her. Except they were upside down.</p><p>Correction: she was upside down. In mid-air.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Richard said cheerfully. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d She could feel the grin split her face. \u201cCan somebody reach my foot? I have no idea how to get down.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cNow, it\u2019s none of my business,\u201d Janet began with, for her, heartening tentativeness.</p><p>\u201cOh, here we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a little young for you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to take relationship advice from a woman who hangs out with a dead guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured it out, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook me a while. He doesn\u2019t really have a scent, you know? In fact, he smells more like you than anything else.\u201d</p><p>They were back at Drake\u2019s house, and the sun would be up soon. Crescent\u2019s feet hadn\u2019t touched the ground in three hours. Richard was amusing himself by bouncing her off the roof, seeing how high she would go. His personal best was sixteen feet. Drake and Janet were sitting cross-legged near the edge of the roof, watching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.

Anyway, you\u2019re a pretty good guy. I mean, I always liked you.</p><p>It\u2019d be nice if you could finally settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Janet, I never dreamed this tender side of you existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of you not to mention my grossly debilitating handicap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, that. I\u2019m not being nice. I just keep forgetting. I mean, you don\u2019t</p> <p>act like a blind guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly does a blind guy act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell should I know? So anyway, back to Blondie. You just, like,</p><p>saw her and knew? Well, I know you didn\u2019t see her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said suddenly, \u201cI did. See her, I mean. I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real? Not just make a picture from how she smells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real. I can see her perfectly. But only her. Everything else is the same. For example, I know your height and weight from your voice, and how you sound when you walk, but I don\u2019t know what color your eyes are. Hers are beautiful,\u201d he added dreamily.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s the weirdest shit I ever heard. And I live with a vampire.\u201d Janet rested her chin on her knees for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know dick about fairies. Except I remember this story from when I was a kid\u2014you remember Sarah Storyteller? Michael\u2019s grandma?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. She used to read to all of us on the grounds, under those trees by the pond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, there was this one story\u2014about fairies? They were little and invisible. They\u2019d only appear if you caught them. And if you caught them, they\u2019d grant wishes. So maybe Crescent appeared to you. You know, maybe that\u2019s why you can see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cshe granted my wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wished you could see? Not that I could blame you, you poor handicapped freak of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quit that. No, I never really minded not seeing, but I always wondered what my mate\u2019s face would look like. What her hair would look like, the color of her eyes...like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum. Well. You can see her. Only her. So...maybe she is in it for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that tender side again. My, Richard has been quite the good</p><p>influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. So, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shifted his weight. \u201cHope she flies back to me, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked your ass all over Faneuil Hall, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen my girl kicked your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>Janet and Richard left, but Crescent refused. He\u2019d tried to explain why she should go, but she wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cWhat, is this that dumb \u2018if-you-love-something-let-it-go-if-it-comes-back-blah-blah-blah\u2019 thing? Because that sucks. You said I could stay as long as I wanted, you welsher.\u201d</p><p>He tried to disguise his joy. \u201cCrescent, there\u2019s something you should know\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. God, I\u2019m starving. Listen, I\u2019m going to run up ahead and see if those guys are serving breakfast yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why I want to check. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as she hurried away, then realized they were quite close to the shelter where she\u2019d been living. Foolish to be concerned\u2014she was a tough one to hurt, after all\u2014but he decided to catch up with her anyway.</p><p>That was the last rational thought he had for a while. Stupid, really\u2014the punk shaking Crescent like a maraca looked far worse for the wear. An obvious beta type\u2014he needed to be led. And, in abandonment, couldn\u2019t take care of himself. He certainly wasn\u2019t worth getting worked up over. He supposed Nick and what\u2019s-her-name had gone on to greener pastures...or easier marks.</p><p>\u201cJimmy, you idiot,\u201d Crescent was saying, prying his fingers off her arm, \u201cwill you give it up? Grabbing me is not going to fix your life. Now buzz off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault,\u201d Jimmy was insisting. \u201cNick and Maria took off because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass! They took off because you can\u2019t walk ten feet down here anymore without tripping over a cop. Too bad they didn\u2019t bring you with, huh, Jimbo?\u201d</p><p>Jimmy\u2019s eyes flashed murky murder and Drake moved quickly, spinning him away from Crescent. \u201cJust once I\u2019d like to take a walk with you without your being assaulted,\u201d he muttered, carefully examining her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019ve got a dark past. He\u2019s harmless. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. Then he whirled and grabbed Jimmy by the throat, lifting him in the air as easily as a mother picked up her toddler.</p><p>\u201cDid you really,\u201d he began. He was so angry it was hard to talk. He wanted to growl and bite. \u201cDid you really think you could put your hands on my mate and live to see the sun come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Crescent said, tugging on his arm. Before them, the punk squeaked and kicked, his face turning an interesting shade of purple. \u201cLet go, Drake. He\u2019s just an asshole.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking the man\u2014really just an overgrown boy, but surely old enough to know better\u2014like a dog shakes a rag doll. \u201cDid you really?\u201d he said</p><p>again. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake! You are freaking me out, dude!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re a doctor.</p><p>She\u2019ll have bruises. He actually marked her\u2014marked her with his filthy</p><p>hands!</p><p>But you\u2019re a doctor. \u201cDrake, will you put him down already? He\u2019s passed out, for Christ\u2019s sake. And I really don\u2019t want to finish the day at the Cop Shop.\u201d He growled, then flung the man away. They both watched the unconscious tough sail through the air and then hit the street like a sack of sand. Jimmy groaned, but didn\u2019t regain consciousness. \u201cJeez, overprotective much?\u201d But she was smiling. \u201cRemind me to never tell</p><p>you about my years on the streets.\u201d \u201cYou will tell me.\u201d \u201cLater. When that vein in your forehead isn\u2019t throbbing. Yuck, by the way.\u201d \u201cHe touched you. He should never have done that.\u201d \u201cYes, and I think he gets that now! Your mate?\u201d she added, teasing. \u201cIs that</p><p>what I am?\u201d He put his arms around her. \u201cYes. That\u2019s what you are.\u201d \u201cWell, all right. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d \u201cIf I have to look at another pancake, I may well vomit.\u201d \u201cDude, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll get waffles,\u201d she added with a wicked grin, and stretched</p><p>up, and kissed him. \u201cI have to tell you something. No waffles. I\u2019ve put this off long enough\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat, no waffles, like, ever?\u201d \u201cCrescent...this may be hard to believe...\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cYour intolerance of starchy foods?\u201d \u201cBe serious. I\u2019m talking about\u2014\u201d \u201cThe fact that you can see me?\u201d He blinked. \u201cWell...yes. You\u2019re not surprised.\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d She smiled at him and he swore he could almost see her</p><p>glowing. \u201cI granted your wish. Apparently it\u2019s what we do.\u201d \u201cNews to me! What exactly did I wish for? To have you in my life, or to see</p><p>you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s kind of nice that you got it all in one package, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He supposed it was.</p><p>THE END</p><p>A Fiend in Need</p><p>Author\u2019s Note</p><p>The events of this story take place in February of 2006, following the events of Undead and Unreturnable.</p><p>Also, I have changed Chicago\u2019s Chinatown to suit my needs.

Let\u2019s just go walking in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Billie Holiday</p><p>Prologue</p><p>Bev Jones took a deep breath and stepped out onto the roof. She\u2019d snuck to Chicago\u2019s Chinatown on her lunch break because she wanted to die with the smell of fresh potstickers in her nose.</p><p>She walked slowly to the edge of the roof and peeked over. The winter wind ruffled her short, dark hair, but for a miracle, it was almost a nice day\u2014nice for Chicago, anyway.</p><p>It was a typically busy Friday afternoon... the Friday before Valentine\u2019s Day, in fact. And if she had to spend one more Valentine\u2019s Day alone\u2014or worse, with only the company of her psychiatrist\u2014she would kill herself.</p><p>People said that a lot, but Bev never said anything she didn\u2019t mean. And so here she was.</p><p>She put her hands flat on the ledge and got ready to boost herself up. Given that she was wearing snow pants and a down-stuffed parka, it might take a while\u2014say, her entire lunch break. Ah, well. If nothing else, she was mildly curious to find out if there was an afterlife. Would there be potstickers and noodle nests in the afterlife? She didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cBev! Hey! Wait up!\u201d</p><p>She started\u2014the last thing she\u2019d expected on a rooftop was to hear someone calling her name\u2014and turned around. And instantly assumed she\u2019d gone crazy: there was a woman running toward her, a woman who\u2014whoop!\u2014just jumped over the Chinese arch separating the two buildings. And now\u2014was she?\u2014she was! She was hurrying right over to Bev. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for waiting,\u201d the strange woman who could jump like a grasshopper said. \u201cI was running a little behind this morning and was worried I\u2019d miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d Bev gasped. Holy crow, it was like Touched by an Angel! \u201cYou mean you\u2019re here to\u2014to save me?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2014a tall, lean brunette with striking dark eyes and the palest, softest-looking skin\u2014blinked in surprise. Bev had never seen such skin before; maybe the grasshopper/angel was also an Irish milkmaid.</p> <p>Then she laughed. It wasn\u2019t, Bev thought a little sullenly, a very nice laugh.</p><p>\u201cSave you? Save you?\u201d Again, the laugh. The woman actually leaned on the ledge so she wouldn\u2019t fall down. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re such a dope you actually showed up for work the day you planned to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, of all days to call in sick to your dreary, hated job, don\u2019t you think today\u2019s the day? And you know damn well the fall won\u2019t kill you. What is it, like two stories? If you really wanted to ice yourself, why not use the shotgun you keep in your closet? Or one of those Japanese sushi knifes you saved up six months for, really do the job right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you have this stupid idea in your head that swarms of people will gather on the street below, and some good-looking Chicago P.D. monkey will coax you down and fall in love with you. Among other things, you watch too much television.\u201d</p><p>Bev stared. She was mad, and getting madder, but the grasshopper/angel/demon had said nothing that wasn\u2019t true. Hearing it out loud made her feel like a real pigeon turd. It was more than attention, right? Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cSave you! You don\u2019t want to be saved! You want a date for next week! Ha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Bev snapped. \u201cI\u2019m jumping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it, you are not.\u201d The brunette pulled her away from the edge with a casual strength that nearly sent Bev sprawling onto the blacktop.</p><p>\u201cI am, too!\u201d She managed to wrench her arm free, nearly dislocated her own shoulder in the process. The stranger was fiendishly strong. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m clinically depressed, and I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad about not getting the promotion, not having a date, and your mom forgetting your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Antonia. And the reason I\u2019m here is to tell you the fall won\u2019t kill you. In fact, it\u2019ll break your neck and you\u2019ll be a quad in a monkey hospital for the rest of your life. It\u2019ll wreck your mom\u2014her insurance company won\u2019t cover you because you\u2019ve been out of the house too long, and your insurance sucks. She\u2019ll spend the rest of her life in debt and visiting you, and you think you\u2019ll be able to get a date from a Shriner\u2019s bed? Bottom line, you think your life is in the shitter now? Go ahead and jump. You\u2019ll see the shit fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do you know?\u201d Not, \u201cthat isn\u2019t true\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re on drugs.\u201d Antonia had the creepy ring of truth in everything she said. Even weirder, Bev had never met someone as obnoxious as she was beautiful. She was like the swimsuit ad model from the ninth gate of hell. \u201cHow did you know to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you keep saying \u2018monkey\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Antonia sniffed, \u201cyou\u2019re descended from apes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are, too!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m descended from canis lupus. A much more impressive mammal to have in your family tree, in case you didn\u2019t know. Which none of you seem to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not here to save me?\u201d Bev was having a little trouble following the conversation. She tried to give herself some credit; it had been a surreal five minutes.</p><p>\u201cShit, no! What do I care if another monkey offs herself? There\u2019s too many of you anyway. Go ahead and jump, ruin your mother\u2019s life, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you running across rooftops to stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damned business,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, are you going to jump or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends. Are you going to tell me why you came?\u201d</p><p>The brunette rubbed her temples. \u201cOkay, okay. Anything to shorten this conversation. I see the future, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a psychic?\u201d Bev gasped.</p><p>\u201cNothing that lame. I see what\u2019s going to happen. And, file this away, I\u2019m never wrong. But the thing is, when people don\u2019t do what I tell them, when they ignore my advice and sort of plunge ahead on their own, I get the worst migraines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here... to stop yourself from getting a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Antonia said defensively. \u201cThey\u2019re really bad headaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re descended from canis\u2014from wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh, yes! Do we have to have this talk all over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re, like\u2014\u201d It was stupid, but Bev made herself say it anyway. \u201cA werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard this before, right? \u201dDuh, yes.\u201c \u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but you just sort of blurted it out! You can\u2019t go around just telling monk\u2014people that you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014you just can\u2019t is why not.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWho are you going to tell? Who\u2019d even believe you?\u201d</p><p>Bev pictured herself explaining that she didn\u2019t jump because a woman claiming to be a werewolf told her the future (after jumping over a roof) and saw Antonia had a point.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019d believe me, either,\u201d she added, almost as if (ludicrous thought!) she was trying to make Bev feel better.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t Change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Bev groped in the air, trying to find the words. \u201cYou don\u2019t get furry and howl at the moon and steal babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies! Monkey babies? Ugh! Do you have any idea how awful you guys taste? I\u2019d rather eat shit than an omnivore.\u201d</p><p>Bev, stuck in a job she hated, was nevertheless finding her background in social work quite handy about now. There was a pattern to Antonia\u2019s outbursts. In fact, the snarkier and louder she got, the more painful the subject under discussion was.</p><p>She tried again. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, you never turn into a wolf. Never. But you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Antonia\u2019s lips nearly disappeared, she was pressing them together so tightly. \u201cYss,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cTht\u2019s trr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then... how do you know you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mom\u2019s a werewolf, okay? And her dam, and her dam, and her dam, going back about eighty generations, okay? I\u2019m a right line descendant of the She Wolf Rayet, and my dad being a monkey doesn\u2019t change that. I am so a werewolf, I am, I am, I am!\u201d She smacked her fist on the ledge for emphasis, and Bev was astounded to see a chunk of concrete fly off in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay,\u201d she said, trying to soothe the younger woman. \u201cNobody said you weren\u2019t, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just questioned the logic of running around blurting it out to monkeys. Dammit! Now you\u2019ve got me using that odious word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, but she seemed to be cheering up. \u201cIt\u2019s a sore spot, I admit. There are lots of hybrids in the pack\u2014my alpha sired one, for Rayet\u2019s sake. They can all Change. Everybody can Change but me. And monkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did they\u2014did your friends kick\u2014ask you to leave? Because you don\u2019t, uh, do the Change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, did my pack boot my ass because I\u2019m a freak?\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cNo. I came west because I\u2014I saw something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it me?\u201d Bev asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t you, greedy monkey. The whole world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Giving you the 4-1-1 was sort of a side trip. I\u2019m really on my way to Minneapolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Minneapolis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough sharing with strangers for one day,\u201d she said, kindly enough. \u201cBecause we both know you aren\u2019t going to jump, why don\u2019t you come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come down after you tell me why we\u2019re going to Minneapolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! I\u2019ll be your cool sidekick. We\u2019ll have adventures and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Go ahead and jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwwww, come on, Antonia,\u201d she whined. \u201cIt\u2019s just the thing I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I need. And I don\u2019t bargain with monkeys on Chicago rooftops, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, calm down. Just tell me why you\u2019re going and then I\u2019ll climb down. Otherwise, if you leave, you don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll jump or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think, you could be minding your own business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I should have done this morning, by Rayet!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014when bam! Giant killer migraine. All because you didn\u2019t hang around and finish a conversation.\u201d Bev slowly shook her head. \u201cTsk, tsk.\u201d</p><p>Antonia scowled down at her. Bev pushed her reddish blond bangs out of her eyes so she could see if the woman was going to dart off over the rooftops to avoid communicating.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m going and then you climb down and go back to your life and stop with the goofing around on rooftops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cSo why are you going to Minnesota?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... the pack lets me hang around because I\u2019m full of useful little tidbits, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Bev said, impressed.</p><p>\u201cBut the problem is, I think some of them are, um, scared of me. And the ones who aren\u2019t scared don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imag\u2014uh, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s the mate thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean, finding a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a real drive among us, because compared to you guys, there aren\u2019t hardly any of us. And the thing is, nobody wants to be my mate. They don\u2019t know if their children will, um, be like me. And it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t tried to be nice to guys, right? Even though, if I fooled a guy into mating with me I wouldn\u2019t have much respect for him. But still. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m nice or awful. Nobody wants to take a chance on a deformed cub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bev\u2019s heart broke a little for the beautiful woman leaning against the ledge. If someone that thin and that pretty can\u2019t get married, there\u2019s no hope for the rest of us, she thought grimly. \u201cSo maybe you\u2019ll meet someone in Minneapolis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all my\u2014my visions, I guess you\u2019d call them. All my pictures of the future\u2014and it really is like there\u2019s some sort of divine camera in my head, and the pictures she takes are never wrong\u2014anyway, they were always about somebody else. Michael, your future wife is going to be on the third floor of your building on such and such a day. Derik, you have to go save the world. Mom, if you go out driving in this weather you won\u2019t come back. But they\u2019re never about me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m twenty-five, right? That\u2019s old to be an unmated female. And there isn\u2019t a werewolf in Massachusetts\u2014maybe the whole world\u2014who wants me to bear his cubs. So I sat down last week and thought and thought. I was trying to make a vision happen, which I\u2019d never tried before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh, it worked. I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re back,\u201d Bev said. \u201cGood; it\u2019s harder when I feel sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your pity, monkey. Anyway, this thought pops into my head: If you help the queen, you\u2019ll get what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it. Well, almost it... an address popped into my head right after. So off I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help the queen and get what you need,\u201d Bev repeated thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you flying? Or is it so you can occasionally stop and help a monkey stop doing something silly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself. Fly? Stick myself in a tin can that hurtles through space at a zillion miles an hour, a thousand miles up on the air? Breathing recycled monkey farts and choking down peanuts?\u201d Antonia shuddered. \u201cNo no no no no no no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves are claustrophic?\u201d Bev guessed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the monkey gets a prize!\u201d Antonia patted her, mussing her short red curls. \u201cGood, good monkey!\u201d</p><p>Bev knocked her hand away. \u201cStop that. I can\u2019t help not being as evolved as you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Antonia said cheerfully. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your big problem with humans? We can\u2019t leap tall buildings in a single bound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly. Although, that\u2019s a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t part of our deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Bev smiled at her, and Antonia actually blanched. \u201cYou\u2019re dying to tell me. You can\u2019t wait to tell me. So... tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you asked for it. Not only are you not evolved\u2014 which, granted, you can\u2019t help\u2014but you\u2019re the most rapacious, bloodthirsty species the planet has ever seen. You go to war over money, religion, land, and drugs. If there isn\u2019t a war on, you make up a reason to have one. You kill when you\u2019re not hungry, and you kill when you\u2019re fat and don\u2019t need it. And you stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou reek. It\u2019s awful! You don\u2019t take enough showers, and when you do shower, you slop nine kinds of perfumed soap, body powders, scented shampoos, and aftershave or perfume all over yourselves. I had to take the subway once in Boston\u2014 never again! I had to get off after one stop\u2014after I threw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think all of us stink,\u201d Bev said carefully. \u201cI think your sense of smell is developed to such a high degree that it seems like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You all stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, sorry about that. Thanks for answering my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for not jumping\u2014I\u2019m almost out of Advil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d Bev stuck out her hand. After an awkward moment, Antonia shook it, and Bev tried not to wince at the bone-crushing power in the woman\u2019s grip. \u201cGood luck with the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with your life. You might try ratting your boss out to the IRS. He hasn\u2019t paid taxes in five years. That could put a little excitement in your life\u2014he\u2019s a big fish and the feds would love to get him on that, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Her boss? Which boss? She couldn\u2019t mean... not the big guy. He had fingers in too many pies for her to count. Besides, she was just a worker bee in one of many hives.</p><p>\u201cThis is Chicago,\u201d she explained to the werewolf. \u201cThings are different here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could change that,\u201d Antonia said, climbing up on the ledge. She balanced easily for a moment, her long coat flapping in the wind. \u201cAnd they have programs, the police do. They could give you a new name, a new life. Something more interesting than contemplating rooftops, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said dryly, \u201cbut there\u2019s always the chance that he could have me killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds exciting, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Antonia said, and jumped. She landed on her feet in a perfect little crouch; Bev was instantly jealous. More than jealous. Sure, it was easy for the gorgeous werewolf to give career advice. It was slightly more difficult for the little people, thanks very much.</p><p>But the niggling thought</p><p>(sounds exciting, doesn\u2019t it?)</p><p>wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Antonia paused and then knocked at the door of 607 Summit Avenue. Mansions, of course, were nothing she wasn\u2019t used to, but she had never seen an entire street of them. And this one\u2014across from the governor\u2019s mansion, no less\u2014was nearly the grandest of them all.</p><p>It was white, except for enormous black shutters. Three floors that she could see from the front. Wraparound porch deep enough for couches and several rocking chairs. A detached garage as big as most people\u2019s starter homes.</p><p>Well, a queen lives here, she reminded herself. Of course it\u2019s going to be grand. What did you expect, a tent?</p><p>Still, it was weird. She had no idea American monkeys had started electing royals.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to knock again; she could hear someone coming. The door was pulled open\u2014the small, skinny woman had to struggle with it\u2014and then Antonia was face-to-face with a beautiful woman (yawn... they were a dime a dozen on the Cape) with skin the color of good coffee. Her eyes were also dark and tip-tilted at the ends, giving her a regal (daresay queenlike?) air. She had cheekbones you could cut yourself on.</p><p>\u201cAre you the queen?\u201d Antonia asked. Dumb question; of course she was the queen, who else could be? The woman was born to be on the one dollar bill.</p><p>At least this one didn\u2019t stink too badly\u2014she\u2019d had a shower that night and, even better, hadn\u2019t drowned herself in nine kinds of powders, soaps, perfumes, and deodorants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you,\u201d she continued when the woman didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI\u2019m Antonia Wolfton, from the Cape Cod Pack.\u201d</p><p>The queen blinked at her, a slow-lidded, thoughtful blink, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019d better come with me.\u201d She turned, and Antonia followed her through an enormous entryway, down several hallways (the place smelled strongly of old wood, old wool, and Pledge), and into the largest kitchen she\u2019d ever seen. Several people were sitting on stools, which were grouped around a long, industrial counter, bar-style.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d the queen announced, \u201cthis is Antonia Wolfton, from the Cape Cod Pack. Hold onto your panties: She\u2019s here to help us.\u201d</p><p>One of them, a leggy blonde dressed in linen pants and a sleeveless white blouse, looked up from her tea. Actually, they all looked up. But it was the blonde Antonia couldn\u2019t look away from.</p><p>And there was something going on here, wasn\u2019t there? It wasn\u2019t just the group, almost unnaturally still. And it wasn\u2019t their smell\u2014though they\u2019d obviously gone easy on the fake scents and heavy on good, old-fashioned showers\u2014their scents, that was it, she almost had it, could almost taste the problem, the\u2014</p><p>She heard someone coming down the stairs and then the door about fifteen feet away swung open and a man walked in.</p><p>Well. Not walked. Loped, really. He was tall and lean, with a swimmer\u2019s build\u2014narrow hips and broad shoulders. Shirtless, with a fine fuzz of dark hair starting at the top of his ribs and disappearing into his jeans. He had shoulder-length, golden brown hair\u2014sunny hair, as her pack leader\u2019s daughter would have said\u2014and mud-colored eyes. When he looked at her with those eyes, she had the distinct sensation of falling.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she said faintly. Those eyes... they weren\u2019t intelligent. They were just this side of savage. Oh, she liked those eyes. She just needed to fatten him up some; he was far too thin. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the blonde said, spilling her tea. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett Shea, right?\u201d Antonia asked. \u201cI\u2014saw a picture of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d someone else said, someone with a profound bass voice, someone not to be ignored, but she couldn\u2019t stop looking at Garrett.</p><p>Which was a good thing, because Garrett Shea picked that moment to leap at her. Really leap, too. He covered the distance between them in half a heartbeat, tackling her so hard she slammed back into the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was sitting on her chest, ignoring the pandemonium that had just erupted. His long hair swung down into his face, almost touching hers. His hands were on her shoulders.</p><p>And... he didn\u2019t smell! He had no scent at all. Not \u201che recently showered and took it easy on the Mennen\u201d\u2014no scent. Zero scent. He smelled like a piece of paper. She had never, in her quarter-century of life, ever smelled a person who\u2014</p><p>That\u2019s how he got the drop on her! He could get the drop on any werewolf, and what the hell was he, anyway?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pack,\u201d she told him, trying to get a breath.</p><p>\u201cGarrett Shea?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she groaned. \u201cGet off.\u201d He was leaning in, his upper lip curling back from his teeth, and she didn\u2019t know whether to be alarmed, afraid, pissed, or aroused. It was so damned confusing she just laid on the tile like a squashed bug.</p><p>\u201cShea?\u201d he said again, almost into her neck.</p><p>\u201cNow. Get off now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d someone shrieked, a drilling sound like a bad visit to the dentist. \u201cGet the hell off her right this minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014swear I didn\u2019t know, she just said she was here to help and I thought you guys would get a kick out of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, if you\u2019ll grab a hand, and I\u2019ll grab a hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be too slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShea?\u201d Garrett asked her again. His befuddled expression had entirely disappeared, leaving a look of sharp concern in its place.</p><p>Too bad; she had her legs up now, her feet resting on his belly, and she kicked out, hard, and was extremely satisfied to see him sail over the counter and crash into the tiles behind it.</p> <p>She flipped to her feet, making the dark-skinned woman flinch, and grinned as Shea slowly pulled himself up behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to do this now, or should we put it on our schedules for later? Because either way works for me. Actually, right now works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d the blonde said, making everyone but the dark-skinned woman flinch. \u201cHow many teeth do you have?\u201d</p><p>Oh. Her smile. Monkey etiquette, monkey etiquette! Her palm shot up, covering her mouth. \u201cEnough to get the job done, I\u2019s\u2018pose. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroductions,\u201d the bass voice said, and it belonged to a terrifying-looking man, tall and dark, a man who did not suffer fools lightly, a man who would just as soon eat you as listen to you whine. Oh, she could like this man. \u201cThey are long overdue.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The tall dark man was the king of the vampires: Sinclair. The tall blond woman was the queen: Betsy (har!).

Garrett was a \u201cFiend\u201d named \u201cGeorge.\u201d The shorter brunette woman was an ordinary vampire, their servant, like a beta werewolf back home: Tina. They all lived together along with a monkey named Marc, who was currently \u201con shift.\u201d It made much sense to Antonia; Michael and Jean-nie, her alphas, surrounded themselves with betas. They lived together like a family.</p><p>One in which she had no part.</p> <p>She shoved that thought away and it went, as she was practiced at ridding herself of that particular thought. Instead, she pondered the most fascinating thing about these oddballs: The king, the queen, and Garrett had no scent at all.</p><p>She had heard of vampires, of course, but she had never seen one. Nor did she know anyone who had ever met one\u2014or, at least, who admitted to it. According to lore, vampires were territorial to a degree that they had convinced themselves werewolves didn\u2019t exist. Which was perfectly fine with the werewolves.</p><p>\u201cWell, here I am, then,\u201d Antonia said, feeling peevish that she\u2019d assumed the servant was the mistress. \u201cPut me to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll give us a moment, Antonia,\u201d the king said pleasantly, in the way leaders pretended like they were asking. \u201cWe need to \u2018catch up,\u201d as it were. You say you\u2019re a werewolf?\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm. And you left your pack to serve our queen? The queen of the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was the queen of the vampires,\u201d Antonia explained. \u201cThat part wasn\u2019t in the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you believe us? That we\u2019re vampires?\u201d the queen asked.</p><p>Antonia shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Sinclair continued. \u201cAnd you get these, ah, pictures of the future? Do you have a camera of sorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my brain,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhich is overtaxed right now having to go through this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not speak that way to the king,\u201d the tiny brunette, Tina, warned her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s not my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how you serve the queen?\u201d Sinclair asked silkily. Antonia, who hardly ever noticed such things, noticed his suit: black, immaculate, and obviously made for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help the queen, not kiss your ass. I think \u2018serve\u2019 might be an exaggeration. I\u2019m not a walking TGI Friday\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The queen burst into helpless laughter, which almost made Antonia smile. Certainly, everyone else in the room was looking sour.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d the queen said between giggles, \u201cbut I already have more help than I can shake a stick at. I mean... well, look.\u201d She gestured to the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get rid of some of these bums for almost a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us,\u201d Jessica piped up, \u201cher whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad. I have to help you to\u2014to get something I want, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>Tina leaned over and murmured something in the king\u2019s ear. Idiots. When she said she was a werewolf, did she say she was hard of hearing, too?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Dr. Spangler is, but don\u2019t call him. There\u2019s too many people for me to deal with as it is.\u201d</p><p>Tina looked startled, and Jessica, who had only seen Tina\u2019s lips move, jumped, and then said, \u201cWell, uh, I think\u2014we think\u2014you might be. Uh. Crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d Sinclair said smoothly. \u201cThat\u2019s a harsh word, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfused,\u201d Tina suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d the queen said. \u201cGive her a break. She came all the way from Maryland\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassachusetts.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014right. And she knew George\u2019s real name! I mean, hel-looooooo? Am I the only one who thinks that\u2019s a really good trick? So why can\u2019t you give her a break on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause werewolves don\u2019t exist,\u201d Sinclair explained.</p><p>A short silence followed that and then Jessica said cautiously, \u201cBut you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe existence of one does not ensure the existence of the other,\u201d the king almost snapped. \u201cAnd I can assure you, in all my long life, I\u2019ve never seen one.\u201d</p><p>Antonia snickered. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we don\u2019t exist? Because you\u2019ve never seen one? Too bad; I thought you were smart.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the queen said, and Antonia almost\u2014almost\u2014 liked her. The woman was obviously pulling for her. She must be used to strangers popping up out of nowhere and making declarations. \u201cWhen\u2019s the full moon? She can, you know, get furry and make believers out of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in six days,\u201d Antonia said with a sinking feeling. \u201cBut the thing is, I can\u2019t Change. Into a wolf, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sinclair asked with a truly diabolical smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know how it sounds. My father was a\u2014 anyway, the pack thinks that instead of Changing, I get visions. All the disadvantages of being a werewolf, and none of the advantages,\u201d she joked. \u201cI might as well be a m\u2014be a regular person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy oh boy, you\u2019re not making it easy for me to stick up for you,\u201d the queen commented.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Antonia said, and almost meant it.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t,\u201d Garrett said from his corner, and they all jumped.</p><p>\u201cCripes, George! I forgot you were there, you were so quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling him George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t\u2014uh, didn\u2019t\u2014talk, and \u2018hey you\u2019 got old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s really Garrett Shea?\u201d Jessica asked, leaning forward. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Antonia shrugged. She wasn\u2019t about to go into the whole \u201csometimes in addition to pictures, a whole fact will appear in my head, indistinguishable from something I read\u201d thing.</p><p>As it was, they were probably about ready to toss her on her finely toned ass. She was pretty sure. It was so hard to read them! Except for Jessica, who smelled hopeful and interested, an altogether pleasing scent. But the others... nothing. It was maddening, and cool.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Garrett said, nodding.</p><p>Tina and Sinclair looked at each other and then back at Antonia. \u201cWe really aren\u2019t in the habit of letting strangers just, ah, insinuate themselves into our lives...\u201d</p><p>The queen buried her face in her hands. She\u2019d painted her claws lavender, a monkey habit Antonia found completely ridiculous. At least she didn\u2019t bite them. \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve even got the nerve to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was entirely different, my love. As I was saying, this is not our normal habit, but you seem to possess information we can find useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Antonia said. \u201cStop it or I\u2019m gonna cry.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at Jessica, for some reason, who said, \u201cHey, there\u2019s plenty of room for her and then some. She\u2019s welcome to hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica owns the house,\u201d the queen explained.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Antonia replied, mystified.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, you probably said your name earlier, but I didn\u2019t catch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Antonia Wolfton.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, this made the queen blanch. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not really your name, is it? Antonia?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you? If possible, you just went pale.\u201d The woman did look ghastly... practically unattractive, which was a good trick for a good-looking, green-eyed leggy blonde.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Uh, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019re the queen, your name is Betsy, and you\u2019ve got a problem with my name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not at all, it\u2019s a great name. Um, can I call you Toni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Antonia said. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Okay, so here\u2019s your room while you want to stay with us, and the bathroom\u2019s right here...\u201c The queen stepped back out through the doorway, pointed to her left, and then stepped back into the room, a largish bedroom with green and gold-flecked wallpaper. Antonia liked it at once; the walls were the color of the forest in mid-afternoon. \u201dSorry it\u2019s not attached, but it\u2019s your own private bathroom so you won\u2019t have to share it with anybody. And, uh, I guess that\u2019s it. Agh!\u201c</p><p>Antonia spun around. Garrett had followed them up. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get real fucking annoying,\u201d she warned him.</p> <p>He smiled at her in response.</p><p>\u201cBad George! How many times do I have to tell you not to creep around like that? You\u2019ll give everybody heart attacks. Bad, bad Fiend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you talking to him like a dog that pissed on the rug?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Betsy (the queen... har!) looked flustered. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re so used to him being more like an animal than a person. Up until a couple months ago, he never talked at all. Not a single word, nothing. Heck, he didn\u2019t even walk! Then he said something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Red, please.\u201d He\u2019s into crafts. Long story. Actually, it\u2019s a short story: He likes to knit and crochet, and he was out of yarn. So anyway, he says this, right, and we all freak out. Right? Then, nothing. Then you show up, and you\u2019re all, hidey ho, how\u2019s it hanging, Garrett? And he freaks out and jumps you! You gotta understand, in addition to not talking, he\u2019s never done that before, either, unless he was bringing down prey or protecting me. He\u2019s like a lion with a gazelle when it comes to rapists. I dunno, it\u2019s weird. Anyway\u2014\u201c</p> <p>\u201cNot having to take a breath,\u201d Antonia commented, \u201cmust come in really handy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. Anyway, you can understand why we\u2019re all a little freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I guess.\u201d She was still mystified. At home, when a stranger showed up, you let them stay as long as they liked, no questions asked. She reminded herself that vampires and monkeys were different. Duh. And Garrett, even for a vampire, was the most different of all. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cAntonia,\u201d Garrett said. They both waited, but that was apparently all he had on his mind. She took another look at him. Brought down rapists, did he? Not much of a talker?</p><p>Mmmmm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got great hair,\u201d she told him. \u201cA girl could fall in love.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her again.</p><p>\u201cAgh, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cI swear, his grin is as creepy as yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a nice smile,\u201d Antonia said defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s just right: friendly, but not aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, sure. Well, I\u2019ll let you get settled, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to get settled. I need to help you. What are you doing now?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked startled. \u201cNow now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now now. Because I\u2019m stuck to you like a squashed bug until\u2014until whenever.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou know, a year ago, this would have seemed incredibly bizarre to me, but no longer. Now I take it all in stride, bay-bee! You want to help? Come on. Not you, Geor\u2014Garrett. You\u2019ll just make a mess of things.\u201d</p><p>Garrett ignored her, which Antonia thought was just adorable.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Oh no no no,\u201c Antonia groaned. \u201dIsn\u2019t there a bullet I can take for you or a knife in the ribs or something?\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, you wanted to help, so you\u2019re helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jessica said, looking her up and down critically. \u201cThe blue makes her look washed out. Which, we can all agree, is not a problem I myself have. But it\u2019s not so good on your model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back and change into the yellow one,\u201d Betsy said.</p><p>\u201cFuck this shit,\u201d Antonia snapped. \u201cI seriously doubt this is what the gods or whoever had in mind when they sent me a vision of helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSez you. Go change.\u201d</p><p>She stomped back into the small sitting room, ripped the ice blue bridesmaid gown off, and struggled into the piss-yellow one. This, this was her punishment for every bad thought, word, and deed she had ever thought, said, and committed. Fucking bridesmaid gowns!</p><p>She slouched out into the larger room, and both women immediately said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they even send that one over, anyway?\u201d Betsy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. Nobody can wear that color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they want a big fat commission, so better to send too many instead of not enough. Why don\u2019t you try the black one?\u201d Jessica suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I make a rope out of this one and hang myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bitching,\u201d the queen ordered, \u201cand go change. And hurry it up; we don\u2019t have all night.\u201d</p><p>Jessica laughed. \u201cActually, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but never mind. Change, please.\u201d At Antonia\u2019s poisonous glare, she added, \u201cI meant dresses. That wasn\u2019t some kind of werewolf put-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not have been,\u201d she muttered and stomped back to the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh.\u201d Jessica was speaking with forced casualness, which smelled like oranges on fire. \u201cWhen did you figure out that you weren\u2019t, uh, going to turn into a wolf ever? I mean, you\u2019re pretty young.\u201d</p><p>She had to laugh at that one. \u201cI\u2019m old for an unmated werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Because I was thinking, maybe you just haven\u2019t had a, uh, chance to, you know. Change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens with puberty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuberty?\u201d Betsy echoed.</p><p>Antonia was wrestling with the zipper. \u201cYeah, you know. Hair in new places, things get bigger, and suddenly you\u2019re thinking about boys. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll happen for you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, you don\u2019t have to be a jerk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes she does,\u201d Jessica whispered, having no idea that Antonia could hear her perfectly well.</p><p>\u201cSo you were a teenager and you never Changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once.\u201d At last! The thing was on. Hmm, not to bad. She studied herself in the mirror; she looked like one of those old pictures of a Greek stature. The dress was simple; no ruffles or fluffs. Straight across the boobs, falling to her hips, and then falling to the floor. And the deepest black, so black it made her skin glow.</p><p>\u201cThis one isn\u2019t horrible,\u201d she said, stepping out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Betsy cried. \u201cBlack bridesmaid dresses at a vampire wedding? How cliched can you get? I mean, it looks great on you, Toni\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying that, it won\u2019t work. An-TONE-ee-uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you even getting married? You\u2019re already the king and queen, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long, horrible story,\u201d Betsy said, \u201cand I don\u2019t have any alcohol, so I\u2019m not telling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that dress in a different color?\u201d Jessica suggested.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Betsy got up and started circling Antonia, which she thought (but didn\u2019t say) was extremely rude in her culture. \u201cIt does look great on her. And it helps, frankly, that all my bridesmaids are fabulous-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true,\u201d Jessica said modestly. \u201cBut Tina and I are short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea\u2019s tall, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but still. Tina and I won\u2019t look as, uh, what\u2019s the word? Stately. With this cut of gown, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Betsy said, prowling around Antonia like a panther. \u201cIt\u2019s a great dress. Good cut, good lines. Probably look good on everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed that no dress looks good on everybody. You\u2019ve got a short skinny black gal, a short brunette, and a tall blonde walking down the aisle in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are really thin,\u201d Antonia informed her. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, they\u2019d hunt for you and be sure you ate everything brought to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Jessica snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t help my metabolism any more than Oprah can help hers, so hush up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was being nice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice for you? Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat colors do you think we should try the dress in?\u201d Betsy said, jumping in. Too bad. Antonia was hungry for a fight, but a catfight would have been a fine substitute. \u201cEmerald green? Royal blue? Red? No, that\u2019s another cliche. I have to say, Antonia,\u201d she added, looking her up and down, \u201cyou\u2019re one of the most gorgeous women I\u2019ve ever seen. And that\u2019s saying something around here.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. This was nothing new, and it was inevitably followed by \u201ctoo bad you\u2019re such a grump\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s so unfortunate you\u2019re not a complete woman\u201d or \u201cat least you\u2019ve got your looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you\u2019re such a grouch,\u201d Jessica added.</p><p>Antonia rolled her eyes. \u201cCan I get dressed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat a baby!\u201d Jessica hooted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this barely two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve? You haven\u2019t done shit, just stood around running your gums. I\u2019ve been doing all the work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn return for free room and board, which is not such a bad deal, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Antonia snorted but had no comeback for that, so instead she said, \u201cWe\u2019re really done? You\u2019re not just yanking my chain?\u201d</p><p>The queen looked shocked. \u201cNot about wedding matters. Never!\u201d</p> <p>When she went back to the sitting room, Garrett was waiting for her.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>She blinked at him. There was one door to the sitting d^^?i^ room, and he would have had to get past the three of them to get in. She had no idea how he\u2019d slipped by. That lack of scent was maddening, not to mention a real asset.</p><p>\u201cAntonia,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d she said, jerking a thumb over her shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re right in the next room, I\u2019m sorry to say.\u201d She started wriggling out of the dress. \u201cThis is so completely not what I had in mind by helping the queen, I can tell you that right fucking now. I assumed she\u2019d be attacked and I\u2019d save her with my superior\u2014\u201d She realized she was standing in her underwear and he was staring at her.</p> <p>Stupid monkey customs! Apparently it even bothered dead monkeys, the whole no-clothes thing. Although, strange, she hadn\u2019t thought of Garrett as a monkey before. But of course he was. Right? A dead monkey was still\u2014</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t true at all, and she knew it well. He was stronger, faster, quicker. He didn\u2019t babble until she felt like ripping out her own throat, he didn\u2019t fret, he didn\u2019t want to talk about her feelings, he didn\u2019t make war to get more money and then pretend it was to help people. He was just... Garrett.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, reaching for her shirt. \u201cI forgot that\u2014look, where I come from\u2014which admittedly isn\u2019t here\u2014 nobody really cares about nudity. But I\u2019ll try to remember in the future\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d Garrett said and grabbed her arm, which startled her into dropping her shirt. She hadn\u2019t even seen him start to move. Now, why was that thrilling instead of frightening?</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, \u201cbut really, I get that all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he asked and pulled again. Now she was in his arms, and his cool mouth was on hers, and his hands were moving in her hair, restlessly, almost tugging.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said into his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long in there?\u201d Betsy hollered.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re done kissing me,\u201d she said, pulling back and looking into his eyes, which struck her now as more chocolate-colored than mud-colored,\u201ccould you drive that hanger into my ear until I can\u2019t hear her anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said and kissed her again. Which she privately thought made the whole stupid trip worthwhile.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>There was a polite rap at the door; she could smell a</p><p>single youngish man, blood, and vomit. It was six</p><p>o\u2019clock in the morning; everyone had gone to bed (to coffin?)</p> <p>but her. Jessica, she had since learned, adjusted her sleeping</p><p>schedule to the vampires\u2018, and Betsy usually went to bed early.</p><p>With her charge out of commission until dawn, Antonia found herself putzing about in her room with absolutely nothing to do. She cursed herself for not stocking up on magazines before she came to the house.</p><p>There was another knock, interrupting her thoughts. \u201cCome,\u201d she called.</p><p>The door swung open, and a twenty-something dark-haired man of average height (wasn\u2019t Minnesota supposed to be the land of blondes? What was with all the brunettes?), wearing pea-green hospital scrubs and scuffed tennis shoes, stood framed in the doorway. Interestingly, his stethoscope was still around his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like puke,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Antonia,\u201d he replied, grinning. He held out his hand, and she reluctantly shook it. \u201cI\u2019m Marc Spangler. Dr. Spangler, which is why I reek. I swear, I thought the nurse was going to grab the emesis basin in time, but, as so often in my life, I was sadly wrong.\u201d</p><p>She laughed in spite of herself. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. So you spend your days getting puked on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd peed on, and shat on, and bled on,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cBut hey, the pay sucks and the hours are horrible, so it all works out. Luckily, my rent is low.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. \u201cWhat can I do for you, doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooh, almost polite and everything! That\u2019s funny, I was warned about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussies,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Well, today I gotta earn my keep\u2014Sinclair asked me to take a look at you. So if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He didn\u2019t trail off, as people usually did when they said such a thing. And she realized that, in his laid-back way, he wasn\u2019t really asking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not a shrink, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a garden-variety E.R. rez. But what the hell, it\u2019ll make the big guy feel better, right?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cRight. Get on with it.\u201d</p><p>He took her pulse and blood pressure and listened to her heart and lungs. He chatted with her about this and that, and she wasn\u2019t supposed to notice that he was checking for depression, schizophrenia, paranoia, or delusional thinking.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m flunking your little mental health checklist,\u201d she told him, rolling her sleeve back down, \u201cbecause I do believe things most people don\u2019t, I do think people are out to get me, and I\u2019m really bummed about my life, which is why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but on the bright side, your vitals are all textbook perfect. You\u2019ve got the heart and lungs of a track star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, shrugging modestly. \u201cSuperior life form and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescended from wolves, is that right?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But of all the werewolves\u2014and there aren\u2019t very many\u2014but of all of them, only you don\u2019t turn into a wolf during the full moon. Instead, you can see the future.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know how it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re loony tunes,\u201d he told her gleefully, \u201cbut who am I to judge? I live with vampires.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. She liked him, and on short acquaintance, too! Unheard of. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she replied. \u201cSo what are you telling the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re the picture of health, but I have no idea if you\u2019re crazy or not. For what it\u2019s worth, you don\u2019t seem like a drooling psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime will tell,\u201d he went on perkily. \u201cJust when I thought it was getting dull around here, too. I mean, how many times can Betsy obsess over her bouquet?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him; she was looking at the picture that had popped into her head. \u201cDr. Spangler,\u201d she said after a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cHon, call me Marc. Dr. Spangler is\u2014no one I know, actually, but it\u2019s weird, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and touched his arm, gently, she thought, but he ow\u2019ed and pulled away. \u201cYouch! Hon, you don\u2019t know your own strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall security before you treat your first patient. Have them check his coat pockets. Understand? Because if you don\u2019t...\u201d She was rubbing her temples in anticipation of the headache to follow if he ignored her, not to mention the aggravation of funeral arrangements and Betsy\u2019s hysterics. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, your first patient will be your last\u2014stop that!\u201d</p><p>He had whipped the stethoscope out and was listening to her heart. She pulled away. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Did you know your pulse goes way, way up when you\u2019re having one of those visions or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said and escorted him out. \u201cRemember what I said!\u201d she yelled at him and shut the door before he could bug her with more questions.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>And the guy had not one, ladies and gents, but two guns on him! And every other word was the \u2018MF\u2019 word. It was like a bad episode of Deadwood.\u201c</p><p>It was the wee hours of the next morning, an hour or so away from dawn. Jessica and Betsy were listening, slack-jawed. Tina and Sinclair were hiding their emotions a little better but couldn\u2019t conceal their interest. Antonia yawned, bored.</p><p>\u201cA thirty-eight and a forty-five, for the love of Pete! And I\u2019ll tell you what, the minute I\u2019dve tried to Foley him, he would have blown my brains all over the wall. Which would have improved the color scheme, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Antonia told you this would happen?\u201d Sinclair asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Antonia said. \u201cI told you to have security check your first patient\u2019s coat. That\u2019s what I saw: them checking his coat. For all I knew, they would have found a pack of Chiclets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved him,\u201d Betsy breathed.</p><p>\u201cThey were only guns.\u201d Oh, wait. Guns were taken a little more seriously by the regulars. \u201cHmm, maybe I did.\u201d She waited. They all waited. Finally, she said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel any better. I mean, I don\u2019t feel like I got what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it an instant kind of thing?\u201d Betsy wondered. \u201cBoom, you\u2019re satisfied and you go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tina asked.</p><p>She shrugged, partly because she wasn\u2019t one hundred percent certain, partly because it was nobody\u2019s damned business, and partly because the truth\u2014if it was the truth\u2014was embarrassing. How do you tell strangers you want to belong, you want friends and a family who weren\u2019t afraid of you?</p><p>\u201cWell, saving Marc certainly helped me out,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sinclair said.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Marc sniped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, Dr. Spangler, but I fail to see how saving your life directly helps Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot better,\u201d Antonia told her. \u201cYou should use that instead of Betsy. Betsy\u2019s lame.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Betsy told her. \u201cAnd Sinclair, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he\u2019s right,\u201d Marc said reluctantly. \u201cMe being dead might have bummed you out, but you would have gone on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on, and on, and on,\u201d Betsy said glumly.</p> <p>\u201cSo saving Marc was a bonus? You\u2019re really here to do something else?\u201d Jessica asked.</p><p>Antonia shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Sinclair commented.</p><p>\u201cHoney, as soon as the bars open tonight, I\u2019m buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d Antonia told him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re nuts if you do. You do know alcohol is a poison, right? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be a physician?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cA sanctimonious soothsayer. Those are the best kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if I ever warn you of mortal danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know I\u2019m the only thing between you and another gown fitting, right, Fuzzy?\u201d</p><p>She smiled; she couldn\u2019t help it. It was the first time she could recall joking about not warning someone about impending doom, and the someone in question taking it the way she meant it: as a joke.</p><p>The pack honestly worried she would see someone\u2019s death and not warn them out of spite. This both puzzled and upset her\u2014she might not be Little Miss Sunshine, but she would never, ever keep such an awful secret. How could her own pack so misunderstand her motives and actions? She\u2019d grown up with them. And what could she do about it? She was too old to</p><p>Change.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Marc was saying. \u201cVirgin daiquiris all around.\u201d \u201cStrawberry?\u201d Sinclair asked hopefully, and Betsy laughed</p><p>and got up and brought out multiple blenders.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>You make him sleep in the basement?\u201c Antonia practically roared.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t make him do anything,\u201d Betsy explained patiently. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely his own Fiend. Guy. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Slightly mollified, Antonia calmed down.</p><p>\u201cBesides, if he\u2019s out and about when the sun comes up... poof. At least in the basement, I don\u2019t have to worry that he\u2019s lost track of time. I mean, does he even tell time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry giving him a watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess. In the past, he\u2019d nibble on whatever we gave him... books, magazines, clothes. He\u2019s way ahead of the other Fiends now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Fiend?\u201d</p><p>They were strolling along Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis, as far away from the police station as they could get and still be in the neighborhood. Bait. The queen of the vampires, interestingly, had a thing about drinking blood: she only did it in response to attempted assault.</p><p>\u201cWell, the guy in charge before Sinclair and I took over was a real psycho.\u201d Betsy was tripping along daintily in ludicrous shoes for city-walking: buttercup yellow pumps with black stripes along the sides. \u201cAnd he was into experimenting on his subjects, like any psycho. And apparently how you make a Fiend is\u2014it\u2019s so awful that I know this\u2014you take a newly risen vampire, and you don\u2019t let them feed for a few years. And\u2014and they go crazy, I guess. They turn feral. Forget how to walk, forget how to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>Antonia wrinkled her nose; the three punks following them had too much garlic on their pizza. And their guns hadn\u2019t been cleaned in forever; they stank of old oil and powder. \u201cBut George can talk and walk. Well, he talks a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now. See, for whatever reason, George wouldn\u2019t stay with the other Fiends. We had them sort of penned up on Nostro\u2019s grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe agreed to this when you took over?\u201d she asked, startled. Vampires were weird!</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t agree to shit; he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Appeased, Antonia hurried her gait, pretending to be nervous. The jerks quickened their pace, whispering to each other. \u201cSo Garrett wouldn\u2019t stay with the other Fiends... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, he kept getting off the grounds. And one night he followed me home. And I let him feed off me\u2014yuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cAnd he started to get better. And then my sister Laura let him feed off her, and he got really better\u2014that\u2019s when he talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your sister\u2019s a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Betsy said shortly, and Antonia knew that was all to be said on that subject. \u201cAnyway, he was always different from the others. And now he\u2019s really really different. And then you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I came.\u201d She whirled, picked up one of the thugs, and tossed him. He skidded to an abrupt halt, courtesy of the unlit streetlight.</p><p>\u201cAntonia!\u201d Betsy shrilled. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wait until he attacks us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just about to,\u201d she said defensively. She smacked the gun out of the other\u2019s hand, almost smiling when she heard the metacarpals break.</p><p>The third, predictably, took to his heels.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d she said, gesturing to the two moaning, crying attackers. \u201cTake your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is how you\u2019re supposed to help me, either,\u201d Betsy snapped, mincing over to the one by the streetlight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, this was a freebie. Bon appetit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo over there,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou mean in the corner that smells like piss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it in front of you,\u201d the queen of the vampires whined.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d Antonia paused. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding.\u201d</p><p>Betsy pointed. \u201cThe quicker you go over there and don\u2019t look, the quicker we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say nobody\u2019s ever sent me to the corner before.\u201d</p><p>Betsy snickered. \u201cNobody puts Baby in a corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Monkey culture.\u201d</p><p>The guy by the streetlight groaned and flopped over like a landed trout. The one with the broken hand had passed out from the pain. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be in the corner, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is quite a life I\u2019ve made for myself,\u201d Betsy muttered and stomped over to the streetlight.</p><p>Antonia yawned and ignored the groans and slurping. When the queen was finished, Antonia walked back to her. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Interestingly, Betsy looked... what was it? Mortified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent me to the corner,\u201d she reminded her. \u201cI only heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but... it\u2019s gross. It\u2019s so, so gross.\u201d She covered her eyes for a moment and then looked up. \u201cExcept...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s with Sinclair,\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah! How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Antonia tapped the side of her nose.</p><p>\u201cYuck. I mean, great! Wait a minute. I thought you couldn\u2019t smell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just barely smell your blood. Which was on him, last night. Don\u2019t worry. What do I care? You\u2019re vampires, for crying out loud, why wouldn\u2019t you share blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about this,\u201d Betsy declared and went clicking off down the street in her silly shoes.</p><p>Antonia hurried to catch up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. It\u2019s your nature now. I mean, I like my steaks raw, and you don\u2019t see me apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd already, you\u2019ve been hanging around me too long. You said totally!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally did not.\u201d She reached out and touched Betsy\u2019s chin. \u201cYou missed a spot.\u201d</p><p>Betsy flinched back, newly self-conscious, and then forced a smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They walked in silence for a minute and then Betsy asked, \u201cYou really weren\u2019t grossed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? My high school graduation was gorier than that.\u201d</p><p>Antonia was amused to see Betsy could skip in high heels.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>They returned a couple hours before dawn, about the time Jessica brought out a large bag full of yarn skeins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them down,\u201d Antonia offered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She yanked the bag out of Jessica\u2019s hands, nearly sending the smaller woman sprawling. \u201cI insist. Besides, it\u2019s another way to earn my keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Jessica grumped, rubbing her elbow. \u201cI hope you trip on the stairs and die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that.\u201d</p><p>The funny thing was, she was in such a hurry to get to the basement and see Garrett, she almost did trip.</p><p>For nothing: He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She looked everywhere, listening as hard as she could, frustrated because her sense of smell was useless. It was a big basement\u2014it ran the length of the house and had lots of little rooms and nooks and crannies\u2014and searching it took a long time.</p><p>Finally, she gave up, left the yarn bag on one of the tables, and trudged up to her room.</p><p>To find Garrett crouched on her desk, his toes on the very edge, perfectly balanced like a vulture, his arms clasped across his knees, his gaze nailed to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said comfortably, as she shut the door and tried not to wet her pants in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you, dope! If they knew you were out of your little basement cell, they would fucking freak out, get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet you,\u201d he said and soared off the desk at her. She ducked, and he slammed into the door and slid to the carpet.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d she crowed, slipping out of her coat and dancing around his prone form. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of girl. Serves you right.\u201d</p><p>He bounded to his feet in one smooth motion and pounced on her again. Shrieking with laughter, she let herself be borne back on the bed. \u201cOh, what the hell,\u201d she said, putting her arms around him. \u201cI am that kind of girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nuzzled her neck and, though she was expecting it, she was still surprised when he bit her. She was also surprised at how terrific it felt. Always before she\u2019d had contempt for prey, for bottoms, for victims. But letting herself be taken, letting him get what he needed from her\u2014it was exciting in a completely different way. Always before she\u2019d been the wolf; now she was the rabbit, and it was very fine.</p><p>She buried her fingers in his long hair, marveling at the feel of it, the silky texture, and he snuggled her closer to him. His teeth were sharp, but his arms around her were gentle, almost careful.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, but he ignored her and kept drinking.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have a limited number of underpants, so don\u2019t\u2014shit!\u201d She heard the tell-tale rrrrrrip and, out of spite (and, okay, some lust... okay, a lot of lust) ripped through his blue jeans in exactly the same way. \u201cIf you have any money at all,\u201d she informed him, wriggling beneath him so they could match up, \u201cyou\u2019re buying me new clothes.\u201d</p><p>She reached down and felt him, cool and hard, which was startling and sexy at the same time. He hummed against her neck, and his grip shifted, from gentle to urgent, and then he was pushing against her, shoving, and she wrapped her legs around his waist to help him, to help herself. They groaned in unison and then she felt him slide all the way home, and that was worth the stupid trip, too.</p><p>He arched above her, her blood running down his chin, and she jerked his head down, licked it away, and met him thrust for thrust. He kissed her bite mark, and she heard him mutter, \u201cPretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack atcha,\u201d she gasped back, her orgasm very close, shockingly close, and then she was clutching at him so hard she heard something snap and realized with dim horror that she\u2019d dislocated his shoulder. Then she realized that he hadn\u2019t noticed, or cared, because his thrusts had sped up and his hands were hurting her, bruising her, and she didn\u2019t much care, either. Then they were arching together and shuddering at the same moment, and then they were done.</p><p>After a minute in which she caught her breath and he popped his shoulder back in without so much as a change of expression, she groaned, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. That badly, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, and he looked back at her, two night creatures who could see each other perfectly well in the dark.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBoy, you\u2019re just the perfect man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd so modest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet. Listen, Betsy said you followed her home... you saved her a couple times. It\u2019s no big deal, I\u2019m just curious...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t nag. Yes, it\u2019s a big deal. Do you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>So. That was that. The perfect man was in love with someone else. Of course. And the queen, of course, thought of him as a highly evolved dog. Of course. And she... she was fucked.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>They spent the night together, trying to hurt each other in various ways, to the extreme satisfaction of both. Antonia, who had been warned again and again</p><p>(never with monkeys; they\u2019re fragile)</p><p>found vampires to be fragile, but they healed so quickly it hardly mattered.</p><p>And just when she was wondering what to do about the filmy curtains on her east-facing windows, Garrett yawned, showing long, catlike fangs, and crawled beneath her bed.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s that,\u201d she said. \u201cHey\u2014there really is a monster under the bed!\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, so she got up, showered, dressed in her last outfit (she\u2019d have to shop today\u2014ugh\u2014or borrow something), and went downstairs.</p><p>Sinclair was still up, reading the Wall Street Journal of all the tremendously dull things. She\u2019d read a shampoo bottle before she\u2019d even look at that paper.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Antonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She fixed herself a glass of chocolate milk, stirred through the other papers on the counter, and finally picked the Minneapolis Star Tribune.</p><p>He said, without looking at her, \u201cThat\u2019s a nasty bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMYOB, king who isn\u2019t my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just an observation,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cBut you should know, Tina isn\u2019t in, ah, things for the, ah, long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a stunning woman, but the very fact that your presence here is a temporary one would be, ah, attractive to her. I hope my candor hasn\u2019t offended you.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her milk dispassionately and thought about what fun could be had if she let him keep his silly idea. Then she compared it to the fun of telling him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t spend the night with Tina, numb nuts. I spent it with Garrett. That\u2019s all so fascinating about Tina not being able to commit, Mr. Nosy, but I don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The paper rattled. Score! He hadn\u2019t seen that one coming at all. Har! \u201cWell. That\u2019s. Well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I\u2019m even telling you is because you were nice enough to give me some advice. Totally unasked for advice, but never mind.\u201d</p><p>He looked started. \u201cDid you just say totally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, Antonia wondering about blood sharing and the nature of Fiends. If Betsy\u2019s blood had helped him, and Laura\u2014whoever she was\u2014had helped him, what might werewolf blood do? Anything? Nothing?</p><p>She jumped when Sinclair broke the silence. \u201cTo answer your question\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d she said, startled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I have no idea what your blood would do to Garrett. Or not do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really annoying,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you. I was just sitting here minding my own business. Your problem is, everybody\u2019s so busy kissing your ass, they don\u2019t tell you to cut the shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, completely unruffled\u2014dammit! She was longing for a fight. \u201cMy charming bride-to-be tells me to cut the shit on a near-constant basis. My question for you, Antonia, is why you\u2019re even wondering about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She was startled and then angry she didn\u2019t see the question coming. \u201cWhy? Well, I don\u2019t know... as long as I\u2019m in town, you know. Couldn\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. It was a perfectly nice smile, not at all the rich promise of lust he\u2019d given Betsy the night before, but she still felt a stab. Lower. \u201cDo unto others, as we monkeys like to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not monkeys,\u201d she said, shocked. \u201cWell. Jessica and Marc\u2014I mean, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She was flustered, and even a little shamed... she had obviously been overusing the rude word. \u201cI don\u2019t even think of you as\u2014look, can we get off this? If I offended you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clueless,\u201d he said, picking up the paper with a rattle, \u201cnot sorry. You poor thing.\u201d</p><p>She fumed through the rest of her breakfast and bolted as soon as she could.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cStop staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jessica whined.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I heard you had a bite mark. But I don\u2019t see a thing.\u201d \u201cSuperior life form,\u201d she reminded them. \u201cIt\u2019s long gone.\u201d It was the next night, and they were going through Betsy\u2019s</p><p>closet, looking for clothes Antonia might borrow. It was all so</p><p>girlfriend-ish she thought she might puke. But the alternative\u2014</p><p>shopping\u2014was ever so much worse.</p><p>\u201cThis is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she said,</p><p>peering into Betsy\u2019s closet and counting at least a hundred pairs of shoes. \u201cThose look expensive. You walk through dog shit in those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she needs so many of them?\u201d Jess asked brightly. She put a rainbow-colored stack of T-shirts on the bed. \u201cThose should work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of leggings and stuff you can borrow, too,\u201d Betsy said, muffled from the closet, \u201cbut I draw the line at lending you my panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Wal-Mart or something later.\u201d</p><p>Jessica, who was both rich and a snob, was unable to conceal her shudder.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Jessica. You\u2019re in no position to look down on anybody. Not if you can\u2019t run a mile in less than a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could if I wanted,\u201d Betsy bragged from the closet. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do shit in those shoes,\u201d Antonia snapped back.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a perfectly nice Super 8 over on Grand, if ever you feel the need to, you know, get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that I could,\u201d she grumped, but she was secretly pleased. It was like\u2014like they were friends or something. They were grateful she\u2019d helped Marc. They didn\u2019t pry (much) into her sex life. Nobody was worried about her having a defective cub. Nobody cared that she was running out of clothes and needed to borrow. It was\u2014er, what was the word? Nice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to ask,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got this straight, calling one of us a \u2018monkey\u2019 is like using the \u2018N\u2019 word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Antonia said. \u201cAnother way to look at it is, if I\u2019m doing it, chances are, it\u2019s socially unacceptable. Seriously. I am not the role model for any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018N\u2019 word, huh?\u201d Jessica mused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be talking about this,\u201d Betsy said nervously, emerging from the closet with an armful of slacks on hangers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelax, white girl.

Interesting. \u201cWell... yeah. But, uh, we know you guys can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like being born blind?\u201d Jessica asked dryly. \u201cPoor things, blah-blah, better luck next life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where do you fit in? A werewolf who\u2019s never a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Antonia said and then shocked herself as much as anyone when she burst into tears.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Betsy almost screamed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! Don\u2019t cry. Please please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d Antonia sobbed. \u201cI never cry.\u201d</p><p>Jessica leaned across the bed and awkwardly patted her on the back. \u201cThere, there, honey. It\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally fine!\u201d Betsy endorsed. \u201cTotally, totally! Please don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said, crying harder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re not crying.\u201d Jessica held up a navy blue tank top. \u201cWhat do you think of this one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate it,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cNot into blue, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica, can\u2019t you see she\u2019s really upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he have to fall in love with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the women said in unison.</p><p>\u201cI said, why did you have to show me anything blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, jeez, we didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get so upset,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cA tough honey like you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid George hurt you? Is that why you\u2019re mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he hurt me. We hurt each other. That\u2019s what\u2014 never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Jessica looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s none of our business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have human hang-ups about fucking,\u201d she reminded them. \u201cI\u2019ll draw sketches, if you like. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Then they came back down to the kitchen, to her surprise, Garrett was sitting at the counter with a weirded-out Sinclair. Waiting.</p><p>For her, she was surprised to see. He came to her at once, nuzzled her neck, and then retreated to his stool.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your yarn,\u201d Jessica said after a long moment in which it appeared someone had to break the silence.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Betsy started poking through the mail, squealing with glee when she saw the red Netflix envelopes. She ripped them open, and Jessica groaned when she showed them the discs.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get Cone With the Wind again, dumb-ass? You own the damned movie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this is the new special edition with two new deleted scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one born every minute,\u201d Sinclair commented.</p><p>\u201cYou hush up. Where\u2019s Tina? She might want to watch it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to do some hunting, too?\u201d Antonia asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth is unique among us.\u201d Sinclair was giving the queen a look that was positively sappy. \u201cAmong other things, she doesn\u2019t have to feed as often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you,\u201d Betsy told her. \u201cUnique among the fuzzies.\u201d</p><p>Antonia groaned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call us that.\u201d</p><p>Jessica had been looking at Garrett during most of the conversation, then back at Antonia, then at Garrett. Antonia could smell the woman was stressed and waited for her to say something.</p><p>Finally: \u201cGarrett, do you remember, uh, how you became a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They all waited. Betsy, also obviously curious, asked, \u201cDo you mind telling us how?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shrugged.</p><p>Antonia said sharply, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he cares either way,\u201d Sinclair replied, looking Garrett up and down with a critical eye.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Garr. You don\u2019t have to say shit.\u201d</p><p>Sinclair raised a knowing eyebrow. \u201cProtective little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go, king of the dead guys? Because we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight,\u201d Betsy snapped. \u201cLet\u2019s just drop the whole\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was acting. An actor. For Tarzan.\u201d</p><p>An enthralled silence, broken by Jessica\u2019s breathless \u201c Annnnnnnd? \u201d</p><p>Garrett tugged his long hair. \u201cGrew it out. For Tarzan. Picture folded. Felt bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got fired, okay, and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProducer tried to cheer me up. Had to get haircut... couldn\u2019t walk around like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith long hair?\u201d Antonia asked, mystified.</p><p>\u201cTook me to barber. Late. After sets closed. Producer was Nostro. Had barber cut my throat and drank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Betsy practically screamed.</p><p>Antonia was on her feet. She didn\u2019t remember getting up from the stool, and who cared? \u201cWhere\u2019s the barber? Is he around here? I\u2019m going to pull his lungs out and eat them while he watches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was making the movie?\u201d Sinclair asked sharply.</p><p>Garrett pointed to the Gone With the Wind disc.</p><p>\u201cYou mean... Warner Brothers?\u201d</p><p>Antonia had an awful thought, so awful she could hardly get it out; it was clogging her throat like vomit. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s an old movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen thirty-nine,\u201d Betsy said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTarzan lost funding,\u201d Garrett confirmed. \u201cMade that movie instead.\u201d</p><p>Betsy shrieked again and kicked over her stool. The thing flew across the kitchen and crunched into the wall; plaster rained down on the (previously) spotless floor. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a vampire for almost seventy years?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity,\u201d Sinclair commented, \u201cthat we already killed Nostro.\u201d But he was looking at Garrett in a new way: intrigued and even a little alarmed. Antonia wondered how old Sinclair was.</p><p>\u201cSing it, sweetheart! God, what I wouldn\u2019t give to have him in this kitchen right now. Torturing poor George and the others for more than half a century, that piece of shit! That son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Garrett corrected her.</p><p>\u201cRight, right, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Of all of them, Antonia noticed, Garrett seemed the least upset. She asked him about it, and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLong time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it,\u201d she said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cThings are different now.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she thought bitterly. You\u2019ve been redeemed by love. Loving someone else, that is. Fuck.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t cut it,\u201c she said later, after making love. She stroked the long, silky strands. \u201dI like it long.\u201c</p><p>\u201cNow, yes. Then, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. That\u2019ll teach you to conform to society,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He made a sound like gravel rolling down a hill, and after a minute, she realized he was laughing.</p><p>She supposed she should tell him; he might wonder, tomorrow night, where she had gone. \u201cJust a heads up, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... because I haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to help the queen. And I can\u2019t stay here while you\u2014I can\u2019t stick around, let\u2019s just leave it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t help... you don\u2019t get what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t get what I want. My life will remain completely unchanged.\u201d She thought she said it with no bitterness. And dammit all, she was about to cry again. But not in front of Garrett. No way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Okay, now she was crying. \u201cWell, I am, so shut up about it. What do you care? You love Betsy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s all you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Why do you even care? You\u2019ve got everything you need right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Garrett. I guess... you don\u2019t really love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Outraged, she sat up. \u201cYou just said you loved Betsy.\u201d</p><p>He yanked her back down. \u201cLove Betsy... like the sun. Powerful, can\u2019t control it. Don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds about right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you like... air. Need it. Betsy is queen... belongs to everybody. Like money. You... belong to me. You\u2019re... only for me.\u201d</p><p>She went still as stone for a long time, wondering if her ears were defective, wondering if she dared believe what he\u2019d said. But why not believe him? When had he lied?</p><p>\u201cIf this is your way of trying out telling jokes,\u201d she said through a shuddering breath, \u201cI will dislocate both your shoulders, and your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoit, if you\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen okay,\u201d he said comfortably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in the basement, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can give us good curtains, or we can board up the windows in this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, jerk.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cOf course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She groaned and punched him, which led to other things. Nicer things.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving in?\u201d</p> <p>Antonia nodded with a mouthful of breakfast. \u201cAs of right now,\u201d she added, spraying the queen with scrambled eggs.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. You\u2019re moving in? Okay. I thought you were going to leave. We all\u2014I mean, we didn\u2019t want you to go but didn\u2019t feel like we could make you stay. Ugh, don\u2019t smile like that! Especially not with your mouth full.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed but couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cBetter get used to it.\u201d They had wanted her to stay? Had talked about convincing her? How charming!</p><p>She scooped more eggs onto her plate. Damn, that Sinclair could cook! Where\u2019d he gotten to, anyway? Oh, who cared?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to call your boss, or leader, or whatever?\u201d Betsy asked, sitting across from her and picking eggs out of her hair.</p> <p>\u201cDid it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm-hmm.\u201d Michael had sounded almost insultingly relieved at the news that she wasn\u2019t coming back. If she hadn\u2019t had Garrett, she might have been devastated. But as it was...</p><p>\u201cI have a new family now. Don\u2019t look scared, I\u2019m only going to get sentimental for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d Betsy said defensively. \u201cJust surprised, is all. You have to admit, you kind of pulled a one-eighty in the last twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, this is where I\u2019m supposed to be. My lover\u2019s here, he lets me be as rough as I want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Betsy put her hands over her ears. \u201cOvershare!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014you guys don\u2019t seem to care if I can see the future or shit nickels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I liked the gruff, unsentimental side of you a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. A werewolf who can see the future will probably come in handy.\u201d She gestured to the cavernous kitchen. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, having me around all the time will be a help, get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by hanging out here, I get what I want.\u201d Lover. Love. Family. Acceptance.</p> <p>\u201cOh! So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI switched it around by accident. Or maybe I just wasn\u2019t paying attention. Bottom line: I get what I want. Then I help you by moving in. Or I move in with you. Then I get what I want. Either way, I was right. Again. I just don\u2019t have enough faith in myself, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Betsy looked mystified. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were as smart as me,\u201d Antonia assured her, \u201cyou would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goody. Someone else who has zero respect for me. Because there aren\u2019t enough of them hanging out in this mausoleum.\u201d</p><p>Garrett picked that moment to bound in, give Antonia\u2019s hair a friendly yank, and bound back out.</p><p>Betsy watched him go. \u201cHow, uh, sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! I didn\u2019t even hear him come in that time! God, what a man.\u201d Antonia sighed and shoveled more eggs in her mouth. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just the sexiest, coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrn. Let me get you a napkin. Possibly five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>The queen laughed at her. \u201cSee you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
