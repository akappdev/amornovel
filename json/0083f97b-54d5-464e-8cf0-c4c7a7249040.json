Working hard to keep from fidgeting, I walk into the swank restaurant alone. Millie, my best friend, gave me some sob story this morning after we left the dorm room. Apparently, she met a hot new guy that wants to double-date tonight. My initial response was Hell no.</p><p>Last time she tried to set me up, I ended up on a date with a twitchy klepto. Let\u2019s just say things didn\u2019t go well. He picked up everything, except the check. The time before that was equally horrifying. I missed some verbal cue and my date ended the night with a face full of pepper spray.</p><p>Okay, maybe that was my fault. Maybe I\u2019m too jumpy, too untrusting. The thing is, once something bad happens, there\u2019s no way to undo it. There\u2019s no erase button on life. I can\u2019t just click the delete key and start over. No matter how many guys I date, my brain is stuck on that night from long ago. Most days, my past follows me around like a thousand pound-bear on a piece of pink string, looming close enough to cast a shadow over everything I touch. But, once in a while, that beast rears up and mauls me. He slams me back to that horrible night and it\u2019s all I can do to not scream.</p> <p>Dating provokes my past. It\u2019s almost as if I can hear the bear\u2019s claws clicking on the pavement behind me. My heart is beating too fast. My palms are damp with sweat. I want to get past this. I need to. It\u2019s been too long. My life is living me. I feel like I\u2019m the one with a pink string around my neck. One mistake brought me to my knees. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve shown up tonight. That\u2019s why I try. If I don\u2019t move forward, then I slide back, and I\u2019m sick of reliving the past. I\u2019m tired of the bear-sized baggage.</p><p>I want to move on with my life. I want to get over the fear that\u2019s choking me whenever I talk to a guy.</p><p>Determined to be different, I stand in front of the restaurant and try to work up more nerve and a fake smile along with it. The smile is lodged somewhere deep inside. I yank it out and plaster it across my face. It feels like plastic, stiff from misuse. I hate being fake. I hate this. My pulse pounds harder. I reach for the handle and finally look at the doors. They are made of hammered copper, with big wrought iron pulls. The metal feels cold in my hand. I yank the massive door open and step inside.</p><p>A wood carved hostess station is in front of me, with a beaming blonde behind it. She smiles at me. There are a few people waiting on padded benches, but it\u2019s not too busy right now.</p><p>I step forward and say, \u201cI\u2019m meeting up with someone. Can I see if they\u2019re already here?\u201d</p> <p>She nods and I walk past. The lighting is dim. The plaster walls are washed in rich warm colors. Dark drapes hang from oversized doorways, and a massive fireplace is in the center of the room. It has a stone chimney that stretches high into the copper ceiling.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been to this place before. Millie said she\u2019d get there after me, but that Brent\u2019s friend, Dustin\u2014my date\u2014would be here first. I look for a lone guy sitting at a table for four that\u2019s about my age. I walk slowly around the room and no one fits the bill. I stand there for a moment, not knowing if I\u2019ve been stood up, when I feel the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. Someone is looking at me. I feel their gaze on my back. I turn slowly and scan the room. A set of eyes, as blue as gemstones, gleam back at me. My stomach flutters. Oh, holy hell, he\u2019s hot. I walk slowly toward his table, barely breathing.</p><p>His eyes slowly slide over my body and he drinks me in. The way he does it is so sexual, so carnal, that my stomach twists. Butterflies fill me and careen inside my stomach, growing swiftly to bat-sized with every step I take. The closer I get, the more nervous I feel. Is it possible that Millie set me up with someone this hot? I can\u2019t believe it. A soft smile lines my lips. It\u2019s not fake anymore. Our eyes are locked and I can\u2019t look away. My heels click in time with my heartbeat and suddenly I\u2019m standing in front of him at the table.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I manage to say, still looking into his eyes. They\u2019re so vibrant. It\u2019s as if someone painted him. He\u2019s perfect. If his voice matches his looks, I\u2019ll melt into a puddle on the floor. Dustin\u2019s quite the looker.</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifts and I\u2019m treated to a swoon-worthy smile. \u201cHey, yourself.\u201d Oh, his voice. It\u2019s hotter than I thought. There\u2019s a richness to the tone. Add in the smirk and the dimple and it feels as though my knees are going to give out. I know I can\u2019t do anything with him\u2014maybe\u2014but he\u2019s the most delicious eye candy I\u2019ve had in a long time. The way he looks at me is making me hot. I place my hands on the chair opposite him and slide it out. His eyes remain on me, watching me as I sit down across from him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say, so I smile back at him and resort to clich\u00e9s. \u201cSo, you come here often?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d he says, still looking at me. It\u2019s as if he can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m sitting in front of him. The intense gaze makes my stomach twist. This guy is beyond beautiful. Dark locks of perfectly messy brown hair sweep across his face, with a few longer pieces by his eyes. An insane urge to lean forward and feel how smooth and silky his hair is between my fingers shoots through me. I shove the sensation back down. The man sitting in front of me isn\u2019t one of those Texas boys that\u2019s all talk. This guy has hardly said anything and I\u2019m enthralled.</p><p>The waiter comes and asks if I want to order. I ask for a glass of wine. When the waiter leaves, a moment passes in steamy silence. My eyes keep drifting to his broad chest and those full, beautiful, lips. It concerns me. I mean, this affect he has on me is like magic. I\u2019m turning into a hot mess and he\u2019s barely said two words. I break the silence and look up at him as I put my napkin on my lap. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re nothing like I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, now grinning at me.</p><p>I nod shyly, and the waiter returns with the glass of wine. I take a sip as he says, \u201cSo, tell me what you think now.\u201d</p><p>A coy smile lines my lips. I feel girlish, but the wine makes me brave. I shrug and look at him from under my lashes. \u201cI think tonight is going to be a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting, to say the least.\u201d He carries himself so differently than most of the guys around here. He\u2019s self-assured. There\u2019s a slant to his shoulders that tells me he\u2019s confident, erring on cocky. He leans back in his side of the booth, watching me. His dazzling eyes remain on my face, and his eyebrow twitches once in a while as I speak.</p><p>I\u2019m so nervous that I can\u2019t shut up. \u201cYeah, it is. This is the first time I\u2019ve been in here. I never come over to this side of town. Everything is so far away. There\u2019d be four towns crammed into this space back home, but I suppose that\u2019s what makes Texas, Texas\u2014the sprawling land.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cTexas can be like that. Do I detect a slight accent from you\u2014uh, I\u2019m sorry, what was your name?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. A slight accent is an understatement. I\u2019m all accent. \u201cSydney.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward with a quizzical look in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re from Australia? No way.\u201d A smile spreads across his face and I know he\u2019s teasing. \u201cI thought they only talked that way in Jersey.\u201d He winks and grins at me.</p><p>I laugh. He\u2019s caught me off guard. I expected my date tonight to be disastrous, but this guy seems perfect. In the back of my mind, I wonder where Millie is and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s late. I\u2019m having fun smiling and flirting with him. The tension eases out of me the longer I sit with him. It\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s peeling back the layers and drawing out the girl I used to be. \u201cMy name is Sydney. I\u2019m from Cherry Hill in New Jersey, wise ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, Sidney. You brightened an otherwise dreadfully dreary night.\u201d He raises his glass and nods before taking a drink. It\u2019s a flattering, here\u2019s-to-you movement that makes me want to know more about him. I mean, who does that? He\u2019s different and I admire that.</p><p>I glance at him for a second. I like the way he looks at me. I like the way he says my name. I like him. \u201cGlad I could be of service. I\u2019m all about the chivalry.\u201d My fingers pull my silverware toward me and I unfold it and put the napkin on my lap.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>Millie\u2019s voice rings out behind me. \u201cSidney? There you are! We\u2019re all sitting on the other side of the restaurant. I\u2019ve been calling you.\u201d Millie is wearing a cute little dress with a swishy skirt. She gives me a look and stands there with her hands on her hips, as if I\u2019ve been bad.</p><p>I smile at my date and then back at Millie, not getting it. I look up at her, wondering why she doesn\u2019t slip into the booth next to me. \u201cI turned my phone off when I came in. I couldn\u2019t have it ringing while I was talking to this fine man, could I? Come on, Millie. Sit down. I\u2019m sure Brent will be here any second.\u201d I look past her to see if he\u2019s here yet.</p><p>Mille shakes her head. She has a smile of disbelief on her face. She leans closer to me. \u201cBrent\u2019s already here, you lunatic. Now come away and leave this nice man alone.\u201d She looks up at him and then back at me.</p><p>The smile fades from my lips. I look at Millie, pulse pounding, and then back at the beautiful man across the booth. Horror slips over me like a cold sheet and I go rigid. I look at his shoulder. I can\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not my date, are you?\u201d He shakes his head, still smiling at me. My face flames red at the same time that my eyes elegantly bug out of my head. For some reason, he offends me. I mean, I was sitting here with him for how long and he didn\u2019t bother to say that I had him mistaken for someone else?</p><p>I get louder and squeak as I scold him. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, seemingly amused, and rubs the dusting of stubble on his beautiful jaw. \u201cI thought you were trying to pick me up.\u201d My mouth forms an O and I stare at him for a second, unable to blink. My hands quickly cover my face and I chant, oh my god, oh my god, to myself under my breath. I hear his voice and see his smile when I look up. \u201cYou were doing a pretty good job. I would have been happy to buy you dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That doesn\u2019t make things better.</p><p>Millie\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m nuts. I feel her hand around my wrist, pulling me up. I stand and follow her away from the table. I can\u2019t stop blushing. I can\u2019t get rid of the stupid feeling that\u2019s choking me. I want to crawl under a table and hide. I feel Hot Guy\u2019s eyes on me as I walk away. I don\u2019t look over my shoulder. I can\u2019t, but God, I want to. He\u2019s so perfect. Why does this stuff happen to me?</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>I\u2019ve never been in this restaurant before. When I came in, I thought I\u2019d circled the entire floor, and seen every table, but I hadn\u2019t. This section is behind the wall that connects to the bar. I didn\u2019t realize there were tables over here, and apparently this is where Mille and the guys have been sitting.</p><p>Millie has been talking, but I\u2019m so mortified that I\u2019m not really listening. She finally stops at a booth on the other side of the fireplace and scoots in next to Brent. My date pats the spot beside him. Oh God. He looks like my ex. My nerves are frayed as it is, and the similarities between the two men are so striking that I flinch. Old memories flash behind my eyes. The memories feel fresh, as though they just happened. I don\u2019t want to sit down. I want to run. My fingers graze the scar hidden under my necklace. I\u2019m frantic, and maybe a little terrified.</p><p>Stop it! I scold myself. This guy didn\u2019t hurt you. Sit down. I chant sit down over and over again inside my head. I can\u2019t let fear rule my life. It\u2019s held me back long enough. I\u2019m getting over it\u2014tonight. There have been too many times that I\u2019ve let my past crush me. I managed talking to hot guy a few moments ago. I can figure this out. I can be the girl I was before. I swallow hard and sit down. Millie spares me and doesn\u2019t mention that she found me at a random table, chatting up a hot guy.</p><p>I try to shake off what just happened so I can focus on my real date. When I see him, dread tries to crawl up my throat.</p><p>Millie introduces us after I sit down. \u201cSydney, this is Brent and his friend, Dusty.\u201d</p> <p>Dusty\u2019s a pretty cowboy. He\u2019s got his hair slicked back and parted on the side. He\u2019s wearing a starched white Western shirt. I bet he\u2019s got fancy cowboy boots under the table, too\u2014the kind that cost more than my car.</p><p>I sigh and say, \u201cHello.\u201d I try not to think that tonight just got a million times worse, but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve been on this date before \u2013 at least I think I have. The choking sensation returns. My spine stiffens. Being this close to him has me on edge. Mentally, I scold myself to calm down, but it doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t. Every muscle in my arms and legs is corded tight, ready to run.</p><p>Nervously, I smile at him again and take my napkin off the table. I spread it across my lap. The little black dress I\u2019m wearing has a scoop neck that dips low in front. The bodice clings to my curves and the skirt flares at the waist. I feel pretty, but the way his eyes rove over me makes me feel nervous.</p><p>I shift in my seat and glance at Millie. She\u2019s already gushing, batting her eyelashes at Brent. It\u2019s amazing that she can sit so close to me and be in her own little world. Brent is wrapped up in her, too.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dusty says\u2014his eyes overtly drifting to my breasts before reluctantly returning to my face\u2014like I\u2019m good enough, \u201cit\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s not raining tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>He grins at me and says, \u201cBecause sugar melts in the rain.\u201d Dusty pours on the country accent and smiles at me with a wolfish grin.</p><p>My eyebrows lift. I feel them inch up my face until they disappear under my bangs. I smile and laugh, nervously, not able to say anything that Millie won\u2019t kill me over later. A sudden urge to run screaming from the table shoots through my body. Maybe the kitchen will catch fire and I can leave. I glance in that direction, hopeful.</p><p>Millie and Brent are talking. They\u2019re both leaning into one another, as if they can\u2019t get enough of each other. Millie giggles at something Brent says, and then looks at me. I smile at her for a second, before her attention returns to Brent.</p><p>I press my back into the seat, wishing I was somewhere else. But I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here for Millie. I\u2019m here for me. Taking a deep breath, I try to reign in my nerves before they get the better of me.</p><p>I feel Dusty\u2019s eyes on the side of my face. They dip too low and I know he\u2019s looking at my chest, again. I wiggle in my seat, scooting away from him and closer to the edge of the booth.</p><p>Dusty leans back in the seat and asks, \u201cSo, what\u2019s your major?\u201d</p><p>Nerves are flopping through my stomach like drunken bats. I\u2019d give anything to trade them for butterflies right now. I\u2019m so nervous. I feel so sick, but I refuse to leave. I have to do this. I have to have a normal date, get through a normal night. If I can do that, I can get on with my life. Just eat dinner, kiss the guy, have sex, and go home. That\u2019s what my friends do. I can do that. I can. The bear raises his head and gives me a look. Fucking bear.</p><p>I take too long to answer. Dusty lightly touches the back of my hand. He traces his finger in a circle and says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re undecided. I was just starting with the basics.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t yank your hand away. My heart pounds harder. My ribs are going to crack. I find my fake smile and giggle nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not undecided. I\u2019m an English major. What\u2019s your major?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness.\u201d Dusty tries to gaze into my eyes, but whenever I look at him, the pit of my stomach turns to ice. God, I\u2019m a wreck. It was easier to talk to that other guy.</p><p>I force my gaze up and smile at him again, even though I\u2019d rather bang my head on a rock. \u201cSo, do you want to start a business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Maybe open a shop or manage one of my dad\u2019s stores. I don\u2019t really know yet. After I finish this, I have to do graduate work, so it\u2019s still a \u2018ways off.\u201d He lifts his arms and slips it behind me.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s as though he knocked me in the back with a two-by-four. When his arm settles over me, it\u2019s even worse. Damn it. Why can\u2019t I sit here? Why does every touch have to make me so crazy? I\u2019m getting better, I swear to God I am.</p><p>Then why are you still acting like this? That little voice in the back of my head is a total bitch. She\u2019s in cahoots with the bear.</p><p>Brent nods, and continues talking to Millie about a class they had earlier today. Millie laughs.</p><p>Dusty rubs his fingers on the edge of my shoulder, touching my bare skin. The dress is sleeveless. Suddenly, I\u2019m somewhere else, lost in a memory. I feel my ex\u2019s hands on me. The past and the present crash together. I stiffen more. \u201cRelax. I won\u2019t bite. And Brent can vouch for me. I\u2019m not a total ass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis ass-o-meter rating is around a two. No worries there, Sidney.\u201d Brent smirks at me. His eyes slip over his friend\u2019s arm around my shoulders. \u201cMe, on the other hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>Millie slaps his chest and laughs, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d She leans in and kisses him. My face flushes and I look away. Mistake. When I do it, Dusty is watching. Our eyes lock, but it\u2019s not a good feeling. It evokes everything I want to forget.</p><p>The waiter saves me, and Millie stops sucking face long enough to order. We share an appetizer. Dusty talks more about his family and home. He pops a piece of shrimp into his mouth. \u201cWhat about you? Did your family support you coming down here?\u201d Somehow Dusty has closed the gap between us. We\u2019re shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip. There\u2019s no way to scoot away from him, either. One more wiggle and I\u2019ll fall on the floor.</p><p>When he mentions my family, I feel my hackles raise. It\u2019s a common enough question, so I try to sound normal. \u201cYeah, of course. Whose family wouldn\u2019t want them to go to college? And this school\u2019s great.\u201d I\u2019m distracted. I lie. My stupid family doesn\u2019t even know where I am.</p><p>Dusty leans in close to me. He takes a curl between his fingers. I glance at him and twist so the curl drops. \u201cYou look so hot tonight.\u201d My eyes instantly avert their gaze. Even though I\u2019m no longer looking at him, I can feel Dusty\u2019s eyes on my skin. The hairs on the back of my neck prickle. He leans in toward me and places his hand on my knee, slowly. Very slowly. I won\u2019t react. I can do this. I can. It\u2019s a normal touch.</p><p>It\u2019s normal. I want to be normal. I want it so badly, but my eyes sting. My pulse is pounding like someone is chasing me with an axe. I smile at him again, forcing myself to stay put. Dusty takes my smile the wrong way. His hand slips under the hem of my dress and halfway up my thigh\u2014skin to skin\u2014and squeezes. He grabs me and my world shifts. I\u2019m here, but my mind is lost in the past, reliving memories that I want to forget.</p><p>My muscles react without my consent. Shooting out of my seat, I jump up, banging into the table, shaking all the silverware. It makes a loud noise. I hold out my hands, ready to make up some excuse, when I whirl around and slam into a waiter. He\u2019s holding a tray of food\u2014our food\u2014high over his head. When I slap into him, the tray topples to the side. Every entr\u00e9e slips to the side in slow motion, and slides off the side of the tray. There\u2019s a loud crash when the plates hit the floor.</p><p>For a second, I stand there paralyzed. Dusty gives me a what the hell look. Millie and Brent follow suit. I feel their stares and can\u2019t explain. They don\u2019t know. My mouth dangles open, but I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>I bolt. Before the night can get any worse, before I can make a bigger an ass out of myself, I leave. I walk swiftly toward the exit, ready to scream or cry\u2014maybe both. What the hell is wrong with me? I wanted this. I\u2019m the one who let him do it. It\u2019s like last time. The images flash through my mind, but tears are blinding me. I push through the massive doors, and nearly trip over the curb.</p><p>When the night air hits my face, I slow down. No one is chasing me. None of them want me to come back. I inhale deeply. The last half an hour has been an emotional rollercoaster. First, I humiliate myself, and then I get grabbed. I cringe inwardly. I\u2019m so stupid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I dig through my purse for my keys, standing under the portico, I glance up and my heart lurches. It\u2019s the hot guy. He\u2019s in the parking lot with his hands on his hips, in front of a black car. The way he stands draws attention to his broad shoulders and trim waist. I drink him in before I notice that the hood is up. Why was I able to talk to him? That guy didn\u2019t make me panic at all. I felt like the old me and not the lunatic that I\u2019ve become. I miss who I was. I miss the old me. I know she\u2019s still inside somewhere, locked away.</p><p>He must sense eyes on him, because he turns and sees me. Raising his voice so that I can hear him, he says, \u201cI take it that neither of us is having a good night?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a moment. My heart is still pounding. I\u2019m in danger of stroking out. Before I can think about what I\u2019m doing, I nod and walk toward him. Stopping next to Hot Guy, I say, \u201cIt was total suckage.\u201d Some of the tension leaves my shoulders. This guy\u2014whoever he is\u2014has that old friend feeling. I don\u2019t understand it. It feels as if I\u2019ve known him for years even though I don\u2019t know his name. It\u2019s weird.</p> <p>I sigh and look at his engine. \u201cCar trouble?\u201d</p><p>Running his fingers through his hair, he says, \u201cIt appears that way. It won\u2019t start and it isn\u2019t from lack of trying.\u201d</p><p>Folding my arms across my chest, I watch the way he\u2019s looking at the car and can tell that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s looking at. Neither do I, really, but I know a little. I walk to the driver\u2019s side door, pull it open, and sit in the seat.</p><p>He watches me as I try to crank the engine. It doesn\u2019t start. I look at the little gauges and notice the battery. He\u2019s standing next to me now. \u201cSo, you\u2019re a mechanic?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cI just pretend to be. It makes for more interesting evenings.\u201d I grin at him, not sure what\u2019s come over me. I never talk random guys, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s random anymore, right? Hot Guy\u2019s face falls and I realize that he believes me. I laugh, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I know a little about cars. For instance, I know this one isn\u2019t going anywhere tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like your alternator\u2019s dead. Either that or you shoved a hamster up the tailpipe\u2014\u201d My face falls. I wonder if he did something stupid. College guys do all sorts of stupid things to talk to girls. I get out of his car and slam the door. Then, I tilt my head and cross my arms over my chest. \u201cTell me that that isn\u2019t the reason the car won\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and presses a hand to his chest, shocked that I\u2019d say such a thing. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do anything like that! And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you were the one who came onto me first. I didn\u2019t get here early and sabotage my own car, just so I could meet a girl I didn\u2019t know was coming.\u201d The way he smiles is contagious. He runs his hands through his dark hair, like he wishes he could say more, but he doesn\u2019t. The corners of his mouth curve and he gives me a look that makes tingles crawl across my skin.</p><p>I step toward him, smiling too wide. \u201cI did not come onto you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. Right back in there.\u201d He points toward the restaurant. His face is serious, all smooth features and big blue eyes. \u201cYou sat at my table and made me very uncomfortable. I haven\u2019t had such a beautiful woman overtly hit on me like that before. It was quite embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>My smile is making it hard for my mouth to hang open in shock. It keeps opening and then my grin snaps my lips shut. \u201cI did not!\u201d I know he\u2019s teasing me, but I can\u2019t stop. I don\u2019t want it to stop, and I realize that I\u2019m actually laughing.</p> <p>His arms are folded over his chest. He taps a finger to his lip, as if he\u2019s remembering. \u201cYou did. You ordered wine and just assumed that I\u2019d put out. Really, Sidney, you\u2019ll have to learn to control yourself a little better in the future.\u201d He looks at me from the corner of his eye, as he glances at his car.</p><p>I know he\u2019s baiting me, but I can\u2019t ignore him. I can\u2019t walk away and I don\u2019t want to. He smiles at me with those wicked lips. It makes me want to kiss him, hard. I change tactics. I want to throw him so far off balance that he falls over. I step in front of him and look up at him from under my lashes. \u201cOkay, you caught me. I like you. I want you. I can\u2019t keep my hands off of you. But tell me this, beautiful man; why should I bother controlling myself when I can tell that you want me just as much?\u201d Slowly, I step closer to him. Our bodies are a breath apart as I look up into his eyes.</p><p>Smiling, he manages to say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He watches me, waiting to see what I\u2019ll do. I feel my heart pounding. His eyes drift to my lips and back to my eyes. Every inch of my body flickers to life. I want to feel his hands on me. I want his lips on my mouth. From the look in his eye, I know he wants it too.</p><p>I lean in closer, teasing him. I feel his breath on my lips. His scent fills my head and I breath him in. \u201cAre you always this irresistible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this coy? Do you just flirt, leaving your lips way too close to a man that desperately wants to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>My hands drift to his hair as he speaks. I touch him gently and hear his breath hitch. It sends a thrill through me, making me brave. There\u2019s little space between us. The tension is so strong that I can\u2019t stand it another second. I lean in slowly and brush my lips to his. Beautiful Man stands there. He seems surprised. He doesn\u2019t move. He doesn\u2019t kiss me back. Disappointment floods me. I look down, breaking the kiss. I can\u2019t hide how hard I\u2019m breathing, how much he turns me on.</p><p>Rejection doesn\u2019t look good on me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I breathe. I\u2019m about to turn away when I feel his fingers tilt my chin up. I look him in the eye, and see something there that I didn\u2019t expect.</p><p>He\u2019s smiling softly. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I just like to be on a first name basis with the random girls that I suck face with in swank parking lots.\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the parking lot was swank, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And Miss Sidney, if you\u2019d be so kind as to divulge your last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho talks like that?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI believe that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidney Colleli.\u201d I bit my bottom lip and look up at him.</p><p>\u201cPeter Granz.\u201d His voice is deep and rich. The way he says his name makes my insides melt, and the way he kisses is even better. Gently, Peter pulls my lips back to his, and he kisses me lightly. It sends a charge through my body and makes my toes curl. I lean into him, loving the way he feels. Every part of me is tingling, wanting more. The kiss is so light, so brief. When Peter pulls away, I can barely breathe.</p><p>In a breathy voice, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I glance back at the restaurant, worried that my date will come through those doors at any second. Eager to leave, I glance at Peter and ask, \u201cWould you like a ride home?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and says, \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>I grin. A girlish giggle bubbles up inside me and I swallow it whole. I\u2019m going to be alone with a gorgeous guy in my car! I can\u2019t feel my brain. It left my body during that kiss.</p><p>Peter follows me across the parking lot and back to my car. We both slip inside and I start the engine. I navigate my way through the parking lot and when I pull out onto the road, I ask, \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me sheepishly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just got here.\u201d The smile on his face is stunning. He looks so boyish and perfect.</p><p>I laugh and glance at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where I live. I just don\u2019t know where it is in relation to here. I just moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how long have you been in town?\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles sheepishly. \u201cA few weeks, but this is my first time over here. The town is sprawling. I admit that I didn\u2019t pay attention on the way over, and my sense of direction is less than stellar. I\u2019ve been using the GPS in my car to get around. I start a new job tomorrow and ran out to grab something to eat. Fast food was getting old. I heard about this place and decided to try it. Then, I met you and the rest is history.\u201d Peter has an easy way about him. He leans back into the seat and looks out the window. He points east and says, \u201cI think I live that way.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop laughing. \u201cThe dump is that way. There\u2019s nothing else over there.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s dark brows pull together as he looks out the window and then back at me. \u201cAre you sure? I thought the apartment looked rather nice when I left.\u201d He leans forward and looks out the window. It\u2019s dark. The sky is inky with the normal spattering of white stars. The only d\u00e9cor on the sides of the road are mesquite trees that jut up from the ground like bony fingers and brittle, dried-out, grass.</p><p>Pulling out, I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your apartment complex?\u201d I try to drive slowly so I won\u2019t miss the on-ramp, if I need to hop on the highway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Ridgewood, or something like that. It\u2019s across the street from the college.\u201d Peter\u2019s looking at me. I can feel his eyes on the side of my face. I don\u2019t mean to, but I pull my bottom lip into my mouth again and nibble on it. The heat from his gaze makes me nervous. When he speaks, his voice is so deep that it sends ripples through me. \u201cKeep doing that and I\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re driving,\u201d I say, and look over at him, freeing my lip.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was smart. I just said I\u2019d have to do it. Your lips are amazing, and when you do that it makes me want to nibble them, too.\u201d Heat spreads across my cheeks, along with an insane smile. Peter grins at me. \u201cHow cute. You blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I laugh, waiting for my cherry red cheeks to go away.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s sweet. I like it.\u201d</p><p>He stops talking, as we pull into his parking lot. Peter lives about five minutes from the restaurant. It was probably the first thing he saw when he came into town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask, trying to decide which way to turn. The complex is huge. Some of my friends live over here since it has a volleyball court, a club house, and a pool. Me and Millie live in the dorms and can only dream of an apartment like these.</p><p>\u201cThat way.\u201d He points, and I drive around to the back of the complex. Peter presses his lips together into a thin line and then looks back at me. \u201cDo you want to come inside for a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a moment. Damn, he\u2019s so beautiful. I want to get to know him better, but I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s asking for and it\u2019s late. I\u2019m not into one-night stands, and I have enough issues when it comes to guys. Besides, I want someone to be mine when we go all the way. I sound like a high school student. Or a 50\u2019s remnant. Maybe we can go steady, too, and that would be groovy. My mind is all over the place.</p> <p>Mid-freakout, I glance at him. \u201cIs that code for sex or are we really having coffee?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughs and feigns shock, putting his hand over his chest. \u201cMy God! Is that why all those women at Starbucks keep trying to have coffee with me?\u201d</p><p>I slap his shoulder and shake my head. The smile on my face hasn\u2019t faded since we got in the car. I pull into a parking spot and we both get out. I follow him to the second floor because I can\u2019t let him think that I don\u2019t want his coffee, not after that whole Starbucks comment. We chat about nothing and he teases me more. I tease back. It feels natural. It\u2019s not fake and I\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m so sick of being alone all the time. One event set my life on a different course. I want to change it back. I want to pull out of this nose-dive and get on with things. I\u2019m damaged goods and I know it.</p><p>Peter reaches into his pocket and fishes out his keys. I watch him as he does it. His shoulders are strong and muscular. They lead into a hard torso with a trim waist. I think about running my fingers over his stomach, and feeling my fingertips trace the taut muscles.</p><p>Peter looks back at me as he opens the door. He smiles, like he knows what I was thinking about, and says, \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p> <p>I step inside his apartment and see boxes everywhere. Some are unpacked, but most have the tops torn open, as though he was looking for something before he ran out the door. \u201cWelcome to my shabby abode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shabby. And it\u2019s so much nicer than the dump. You just need to unpack.\u201d I glance around. There\u2019s a couch shoved against the wall. Peter walks into a little kitchen off the living area and starts the coffee.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he calls to me. \u201cDid you get to eat anything? You looked pissed when you walked out. I\u2019m guessing that you didn\u2019t get a chance.\u201d Peter\u2019s standing in the doorway. I turn toward him. He noticed a lot more than I thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The coffee\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, coffee,\u201d he says, and winks at me.</p><p>\u201cNot like that! Oh my God, you\u2019re so...\u201d I laugh and navigate my way through the boxes to the couch.</p> <p>Sticking his head out of the kitchen, he holds onto the wall and says, \u201cSo what? So lovable? So manly? So sexy? So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo irritating!\u201d Of course I don\u2019t mean it. Every time I stop smiling, he lights me up again like a Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cAh. I was hoping you were going to say \u2018so sexy\u2014totally beddable.\u2019 I could live with that.\u201d He winks and disappears back into the kitchen. Before I can reply, he tells me, \u201cWell, I have some cold cuts in here. I\u2019ll bring you a sandwich. Just give me a second.\u201d I hear him moving around and decide not to protest. I am hungry. I didn\u2019t get to eat anything except that wine, and wine as dinner usually isn\u2019t a good plan.</p><p>I make myself comfortable on his couch, kick off my heels, pull my feet under me, and curl into the arm of the couch. It smells like him. I rest my face against the soft suede and breathe the scent in. It\u2019s musky and masculine. God, he smells good. If couches were sexy, this one would be a cover model. Pressing my nose to the arm, I inhale deeply.</p><p>Peter chooses that moment to reappear, plate in hand, and stops. He\u2019s staring at me with an amusedly shocked expression on his face. \u201cAre you sniffing my couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sit up fast, too fast. I panic. He\u2019s staring at me like I\u2019m a freak. I probably am, I mean I was snorting the guy\u2019s couch. I need a diversion. Anything. I reach into my brain and pull out the only thing that\u2019s there.</p><p>Using my best bedroom voice, I wink at him and ask \u201cCan I distract you with some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face glows when he laughs. He takes the few steps forward and hands me the plate. I gratefully take it. For a brief moment, I consider pulling the sandwich apart and hiding behind the bread. The way Peter is looking at me doesn\u2019t help the rosy glow on my face. I got caught sniffing his couch. God, I can\u2019t think of anything worse than that. He probably thinks I escaped from the asylum.</p> <p>We stay quiet too long, which makes me nervous. Between bites, I ask him the basics. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t sound like a hick, but I can\u2019t tell where you\u2019re from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnecticut. Yankee-ville, same as you, little Miss Jersey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved down here for work?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods. \u201cYeah. It was time for a change of pace.\u201d He looks away from me when he says it, his eyes dropping to the floor. There\u2019s more there, something heavy, but I don\u2019t press him. \u201cThis place came up on the grid, and I thought Texas would be different, so I went for it and managed to piss off my entire family. That was a bonus.\u201d He tilts his head at me before sitting down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my family was mad when I came down here, too. They gave me the old Italian guilt about abandoning my family... Like they can\u2019t function without me?\u201d I bite my sandwich and shake my head. \u201cMy family is so tight that none of us can breathe without someone else knowing about it. I was glad to get out of there. I needed space.\u201d I finish the sandwich and look for a spot to put the plate.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Peter smiles at me and takes the plate from my hand. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve spoken to down here that I get along with. Everyone else seems as if they escaped from a movie set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I said that to Millie when I first moved down here. Actually, I said it to a group of people. Millie was the only one who laughed, which made her quality friend material. The rest of the people scowled at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillie is the girl that came to get you from my table?\u201d Peter asks, before he goes into the kitchen to grab the coffee.</p><p>I nod. When he walks back out of the kitchen, I ask, \u201cHey, what were you planning on doing when I figured out that you weren\u2019t my blind date?\u201d</p><p>Peter brings me a cup of coffee and sits down next to me again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought you were on a blind date. I figured it out when you did, maybe a second sooner. The look on your face was so adorable. I\u2019m glad you stopped and said something when you came outside.\u201d Peter looks at me over the top of his mug as he sips his coffee. Those blue eyes are intoxicating. I can\u2019t stop staring at him.</p><p>We talk about nothing for a while longer, until I put my cup down on a box next to me. The entire time we chat, I feel pulled to him. There\u2019s something there, something about him that holds onto me and connects deeper than I\u2019ve connected with anyone\u2014and for some reason I\u2019m not afraid. I don\u2019t know what it is, exactly.</p><p>Peter has an easy way about him. That smile lights up his entire face when he flashes it at me. Yet, there\u2019s a haunted look behind his eyes, like his life has been harder than he lets on. I sense it in him. Like calls to like and my life has been anything but easy. When I find another person who has that fragile, battered, spirit, I instantly relate. The thing is, there aren\u2019t that many of them. I don\u2019t know if other people lay down and die when things go wrong or they harden so much they\u2019re no longer alive. I refuse to bend, refuse to turn to stone. The pain in my life won\u2019t destroy me. I won\u2019t let it. I see the same conviction in his eyes and hear it in his voice. There\u2019s something he left behind, someone who scarred him. The pleasantries, that cocky grin and those dazzling eyes, try to hide it from me, but I know it\u2019s there. He\u2019s damaged like me. It pulls me to him in a way that\u2019s too powerful to ignore.</p><p>Peter reaches past me and sets his empty cup on the same box. His arm brushes against mine as he does. I breathe him in. God, he smells good. That pull between us gets even stronger. When he straightens, we\u2019re sitting very close. Peter\u2019s sapphire eyes lock with mine and my stomach goes into a free fall. This is it. I can feel it. I can sleep with this guy and erase the last one. I\u2019ve already come this far. It\u2019s a few more steps, a few more minutes. I can do this. I can.</p><p>Besides, the guy makes me feel as though I can actually be with him. I want to touch him, which is so strange. I haven\u2019t felt like this in a really long time. It\u2019s as if he brought me back to life. And right now, it\u2019s all I can do to sit here and not thrust my fingers into his hair. I want to feel him against me. I want that kiss on his lips, the one that he\u2019s been teasing me with all night. Peter\u2019s breath crosses my cheek when he exhales. It\u2019s warm and perfect. My heart races faster as he moves closer to me. His eyes study my face, taking in every detail. Nerves twist my stomach in giddy anticipation.</p><p>Peter lifts his hands and strokes his fingers along one side of my face, gently caressing my cheek. My eyes close in response, and I lean into his hand. Every part of me flutters to life. My voice is caught in my throat. I can\u2019t speak. I feel the tension building between us and I\u2019m going to melt. I want to melt. I want to stop thinking for a while, I want to move on with my life and lose myself in his kiss. This is so weird for me, but I don\u2019t pull away. I force myself forward.</p><p>Heat shoots through my body and I feel myself inching toward him, wanting to taste his kiss, wanting to hold him against me. Peter\u2019s fingers brush my hair away from my face, and he dips his head and covers my lips with his. I suck in a jagged breath, unable to hide how much he affects me. Peter\u2019s bottom lip brushes against mine. He kisses me softly, hesitantly at first. Each kiss is slow and tentative, wanting to know if I want more. Nipping my bottom lip with his teeth, Peter kisses me and I respond. I lean into him and press my mouth roughly against his. I feel his tongue brush the seam of my lips, asking for them to part. He sweeps against them lightly once, twice, and I open my mouth. Brushing his tongue along the curves of my mouth, Peter kisses me deeper. I moan, leaning into him, not wanting it to stop. Every part of my body is burning up. Every bit of me is hyper-sensitive to his touch. As his hands touch my skin, I feel lighter, like I\u2019m floating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I press myself closer to Peter, and trail my fingers up his back, feeling the curves of his toned body. Peter\u2019s hands respond by drifting lower to my waist and slipping under the hem of my shirt. When he touches me, it feels good. My pulse races. I can\u2019t slow it. I can\u2019t hide my rapid breaths or what he\u2019s doing to me. Peter\u2019s touch sets me on fire. I pull him down on top of me, and we lay back on his couch. His lips don\u2019t stop and neither do mine.</p><p>I\u2019ve never responded this way before. I\u2019ve had hot kisses before, but this isn\u2019t the same. This is a connection that runs deeper. His kiss shoots through me like an arrow, catching on the anchor that weighs down my soul. There are few times that I\u2019m certain of anything, and now is one of them. Peter Granz is different. Everything from his touch to his voice draws me to him.</p><p>My fingers work at the buttons on his shirt. When I push back the fabric, it falls to the floor to reveal a chiseled chest and rock hard abs. I gasp, and run my fingers over the contours of his body. Peter watches me as I slide my hand across his chest and trail my fingers down to his stomach. When I hit his waistband, I slow my hand and glance at his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he breathes. Lowering his head, Peter dips and presses a slow kiss to my neck. I close my eyes and enjoy the sensations shooting through my body. His hands move over the bodice of my dress, slowly testing how far he can go. When his palm brushes over my breast, I moan into his ear. My hips push into his and I can feel how hard he is, how much he wants me.</p><p>Peter\u2019s kisses trail down my neck, leaving a hot wake behind. His mouth is so hot. Every time he presses a kiss to my skin, my back lifts off the couch. I can\u2019t stay still. Everything he does makes me respond. My hands find his back and sweep over his muscles. They\u2019re so tense, so hard. Peter shifts his weight, moving one leg to the side. Watching me, he touches the neckline of my dress, slowly pushing the shoulder strap down. Breathing slow and deep, I watch him. His eyes darken as he looks at me. His fingers gently pull the other strap until it comes loose. I feel his eyes on me. I know that I want this. Peter slips down the top of my dress.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing a sheer black bra. He can see everything. Peter\u2019s eyes drink me in as though he could never get enough, before lowering his head to my breast. His lips move over the fabric at first, teasing me, making my nipples so hard that they ache. Rational thought has left my body. I\u2019m moaning beneath him, pressing myself against him. This feels right and I want this. I want to feel his lips on me. I want to feel his tongue flick against me. I moan and tangle my hands in his dark hair. My back arches and thrusts me harder against his mouth. Peter\u2019s hands move to my straps. He slips off one strap and exposes the soft skin beneath.</p><p>Peter kisses my bare shoulder. His mouth drifts lower, burning a path of hot kisses to my breast. I feel his hand, hot and heavy, pass over the curves. He holds me for a moment, feeling me against his hand. Peter\u2019s thumb brushes my nipple making my hips move on their own. Breathing hard, I say his name, begging him to kiss me, to touch me there. His lips brush against my skin and I melt. My entire body responds to him. Every inch of me is on fire, hot, wanting\u2014no needing\u2014him. Peter kisses and nips me until I\u2019m lost in a thick haze of lust. My hips rock against his, wanting more.</p><p>That\u2019s when he lowers a hand to my leg and traces his finger slowly up my inner thigh. My legs fall open. I suck in a breath, wanting his hand to slip under my dress, to that hot spot between my legs. Peter moves slowly, watching me. His hand brushes over the outside of my panties, touching me lightly. The movement makes me crazy. I can\u2019t stand the way Peter teases me, how he watches me like he knows what he\u2019s doing to me. My nails find his forearms and scratch. It\u2019s as if that action breaks what\u2019s left of Peter\u2019s self-control, and in seconds he\u2019s on top of me, pressing me harder into the couch. His hand is between my legs and his lips are on my breast. I writhe against his hand, with a thousand different sensations shooting through my body.</p> <p>Everything is perfect until a startlingly loud sound breaks the spell. The phone in the kitchen rings, echoing in the empty apartment. Peter stops moving. The jarring noise won\u2019t end. It keeps ringing and ringing. Peter sighs into my shoulder. We\u2019re both still for a moment, until he pushes up.</p><p>Peter sits on the end of the couch, ignoring the phone, and rubs his face in his hands. Breathing hard, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sidney, but I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Something inside me shatters when he says it. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Instead of explaining, Peter stands and turns away from me. I can\u2019t see his face. His bare back faces me with every muscle tense. Peter puts his hands on top of his head and sighs loudly, looking up at the ceiling before turning back to me. My heart stops when he looks at me. If I thought he was hot before, he is so much hotter now. Every curve of his chest is chiseled like a piece of art. But those eyes, those haunted blue eyes, make me transfixed. I stare at him, not knowing what he\u2019s thinking or why.</p><p>The phone stops ringing. The silence is thick. It floods the apartment in a wave. I can\u2019t breathe. Peter picks up his shirt and slips it back on. As he does that, I fix my bra strap and my dress, concealing myself.</p><p>I feel so hot, and so nervous. I want to know why he pushed me away. I\u2019ve never had a guy do this before. I feel foolish to have done so much with him and then have him react like this. I wonder if I did something wrong. I glance at his back. He\u2019s standing across from me, out of arm\u2019s reach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter. I didn\u2019t think things would go that way. I really came up here to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I mean every word I say. I had no intention of sleeping with him, but once his lips were on me, I wanted to feel something for a while, something besides the normal unending pain and remorse that flows through my veins. It would have been a moment to lose myself and forget everything, a chance to move on.</p> <p>I\u2019m greedy. I took too much. I should have said no. I should have responded like a normal girl and been shy about it. The thing is, I\u2019m not normal. Too many things have happened. Knots twist me up inside. I can\u2019t look at him.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes search my face. I feel his gaze on me but I don\u2019t look up. Shoving his hands into his pockets, Peter\u2019s gaze falls to the floor. \u201cI know. Coffee...\u201d It seems as though he\u2019s going to say more, but he doesn\u2019t. Peter glances up at me from under his brow for a second.</p><p>My stomach sinks into my shoes. Panic, guilt, and fury are mixing together, making me feel sick. Peter doesn\u2019t look up. He doesn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>The silence between us is clanging furiously. I have to leave. Every part of me wants to run. Humiliation doesn\u2019t look good on me. I try to smile, but it feels wrong. My jaw is stiff.</p><p>I can\u2019t think of anything else to tell him\u2014anything to make it better\u2014so I grab my purse and say, \u201cThanks for the sandwich.\u201d The last word comes out dripping with innuendo that I didn\u2019t mean. My voice caught in my throat at the wrong time. Horrified, I look up at him.</p><p>A bashful look slips across Peter\u2019s face. Oh my god. I didn\u2019t see it before, but he\u2019s shy. There\u2019s a trace of a wary boy left in this man. I think I may die. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s perfect and he\u2019s pushing me away.</p><p>Peter regains his confident composure and locks the shy part away. He leans in and kisses my cheek. \u201cThanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>We say a few other things, but the feeling to hold onto him doesn\u2019t subside. It\u2019s hard to leave. I feel as though I hurt him somehow, but I can\u2019t stay. Not after this. It\u2019s not the kind of thing I can recover from. And if I see him again, we won\u2019t be friends. There won\u2019t be a second chance after this. He\u2019s seen too much of me, and his tossing my ass out isn\u2019t something I want to repeat. I follow Peter to the door. He doesn\u2019t say anything else. I turn toward him, look up at his face with my lips parted. My question is all over my face even though I don\u2019t ask.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s gaze cuts to the side. Fine. He won\u2019t even look at me. Whatever. I resist the urge to chew him out and stomp down the stairs like a mad elephant. Peter walks out and stands on the landing until I\u2019m safe inside my car. I drive away without looking back.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>When I get back to the dorm room, I\u2019m in a foul mood. I met the perfect man and screwed it up. I don\u2019t even know what I did! Was it raking my nails on his arm? Did I remind him of his dead cat or something? I walk down the hallway. The doors are all open. I live in an all-girls dorm. Some are in their PJs while others are still wearing their clothes from the day.</p><p>I pass a few doors and wave to the girls inside. Someone whistles at me as I walk by. \u201cHot mama!\u201d a blonde girl shouts. I don\u2019t know her very well. We wave coming and going to class every day and that\u2019s about it. I look at her and she waggles her eyebrows at me, assuming that I got some.</p><p>Yeah, I got nothing.</p><p>I round the corner and see my door open at the end of the hall. Dread fills my throat with worry. I don\u2019t want to discuss Peter with Millie. Plus, she\u2019s going to be pissed that I ditched her at dinner. That was a crappy thing to do, but Dusty\u2014oh my God. Could she possibly pick someone more inappropriate? The only thing worse would have been a grizzly old biker with a toe fetish. Damn.</p><p>I stare at the door and feel the decision wash through me. What happened with Peter is best forgotten. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Getting rejected is bad enough, but the fact that I just met him and let him do so much, and then got rejected\u2014well, that\u2019s worse. It\u2019s like rejection a la mode. As if regular blow offs weren\u2019t cool enough. I shake out my worries and try to put on my game face. Nothing\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Our room is the social hub of the floor tonight. I walk inside and step over six girls doing crunches on the floor. I look at Millie and give her a what-the-fuck face.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting on her chair by our shared desk. It\u2019s built into the wall. From the lack of sweat and general lack of agony, I assume that she\u2019s waiting her turn. There\u2019s no more room on the floor. \u201cWe found an old Abs of Steel tape. Megan said she could do the entire workout. We all took bets on who\u2019s going to die first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod and sit down on my bed, tossing my purse on the nightstand. Millie watches me for a second. I can tell she wants to talk, but she won\u2019t say anything, yet. Good. I kick off my heels and grab my stuff and head to the showers.</p><p>Today sucked. I want to wash it all away. The entire day.</p><p>As I stand in the shower, I let the hot water blast me, but no matter how long I stand there, I can\u2019t get the memory of Peter\u2019s hands on my body to go away. It\u2019s as if he tattooed his touch on my mind. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I don\u2019t know if I would have had sex with Peter tonight\u2014going that far, that fast would have been unusual for me\u2014but I didn\u2019t think things would have ended so abruptly, either.</p> <p>I try to shake off the hot and bothered feeling that has me coiled so tight, and head back to my room. It\u2019s been about twenty minutes since I left. Six girls are lying on the floor, clutching their stomachs.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d Evie says, from her side. She\u2019s curled into a ball. Her dark hair spills around her head on the floor like a bottle of ink.</p><p>\u201cI told ya\u2019ll that it was hard! I told you, but no one ever listens to me!\u201d Millie\u2019s talking with her hands on her hips, giving everyone an I told you so.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I interrupt, \u201cwho won?\u201d</p><p>Mille looks at the sorry lot and shakes her head. \u201cTia lasted the longest. Nine minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Tia raises her arm in the air and sticks up her thumb.</p><p>I laugh, \u201cAwesome, Tia, and congrats to all of you. That workout is insane. You\u2019re all going to be hunched over like 90-year-olds tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Someone starts to laugh, but it\u2019s quickly followed by a moan of remorse.</p><p>Millie looks up at me from her bed. She\u2019s sitting with her legs folded, hands in her lap. \u201cSo, where\u2019d you disappear to all night? I thought you would\u2019ve wanted in on this?\u201d Millie has a head of soft blonde curls. She pulled them up into a high ponytail when she got home and is wearing a tank and boxers.</p><p>I shrug as if it doesn\u2019t matter, but the pressure inside my chest tells me that it does. \u201cNowhere, really. I\u2019m sorry I bailed on you.\u201d</p><p>Millie seems annoyed, but then her shoulders slump and I can tell she\u2019s forgiven me. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made you come.\u201d</p> <p>Tia blurts out, \u201cYou took her on another blind date? You must want your ass kicked, Millie.\u201d It\u2019s true. Everyone else knows better than to ask me by this point in the year.</p><p>\u201cJersey Girl won\u2019t kick my butt,\u201d Millie says, and makes a face at Tia. \u201cI\u2019ve got immunity.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, \u201cNot after tonight. No more blind dates. Please restrain yourself and don\u2019t set me up with anymore assholes, okay? I can find them all by myself and when I do, I need you to feed me ice cream until I puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream?\u201d Tia says from the floor. I glance down at her in time to see her sit up. Her face contorts in pain. \u201cWhat are you, twelve? Big girls get hammered after a shitty date.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t get hammered. Not anymore, but none of them know that. I laugh with them and agree to go to the bar tomorrow night. I have to work the following morning, so I can skip out early\u2014unhammered\u2014and no one will think anything of it.</p><p>The next morning I arrive at work early. I\u2019m a teacher\u2019s assistant, a TA. I work in the English department, since that\u2019s my major. The offices are upstairs, away from all the classrooms. Me and a few other student workers are milling about, wondering where the professors are since the offices are glaringly empty. At this time of day, the place is usually bustling with activity, phones ringing and copy machines humming. The profs are usually in a rush to make it to their 8:00am classes, but today isn\u2019t like that.</p><p>Today it\u2019s eerily silent.</p><p>I walk in and head back to Tadwick\u2019s office. There\u2019s no indication that he\u2019s here; no steaming coffee mug, no glowing computer screen. He must be running late.</p> <p>I put my purse in his desk drawer so no one swipes it, and look at the pictures on his desk. Tadwick\u2019s not that old for a professor, maybe forty-five, with thick brown hair and dark eyes. There are two little girls in one frame looking at Tadwick like he\u2019s the world\u2019s best dad. They seem happy, which is so different from my home life, I can\u2019t even imagine it.</p><p>I walk back out of his office and join the others. Someone calls \u2018five minute rule\u2019 and we all laugh. I hop onto an empty student worker desk that\u2019s located outside of Dr. Tadwick\u2019s office. The Graduate Assistant or GA, Marshal, is pacing, wearing a hole in the carpet. Being late is something he can\u2019t fathom. Add that to his slightly OCD personality and he looks like a caged lunatic. We\u2019re all going to be late, because something is obviously going on, so it\u2019s not as if this tardy will be his fault. Classes have already begun. It\u2019s 8:05am. All the TA\u2019s and GA\u2019s are supposed to sign in and then head to class, but no one is in the main office. The sign in sheet isn\u2019t out. Nothing\u2019s out. Everything is still locked up like it\u2019s the middle of the night.</p><p>All the teachers are gathered in a conference room at the end of the hall. One of the student\u2019s, Ryan, tried standing outside the door to listen, but eventually he came back saying that he couldn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Marshal asks me in a panicky voice. He\u2019s a tall skinny blonde with a skater\u2019s body; meaning lots of tightly corded muscle, not too big, not too small. He\u2019s easy on the eyes. Unfortunately, he\u2019s way too crazy to consider. Take a high-maintenance girl that\u2019s a total control freak and socially oblivious, and that pretty much sums up Marshal\u2019s personality. Even though he\u2019s a bit hard to put up with, the teachers love him because of his impeccable work. Everything he does is perfect.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the conference room,\u201d I say, picking at my nail. An uneasy feeling is swimming in my gut. I can\u2019t imagine what would make them blow off the workers and their classes this way.</p><p>Marshal huffs, \u201cDiscussing what? Class already started. You know all the 101 classes are going to call five minutes and leave.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cTrue, but Tadwick\u2019s harsh. He\u2019s shown up twenty minutes late before and marked everyone absent.\u201d Since he only allows two misses, that screwed over half of the class. \u201cThe man\u2019s a legend, in terms of avoiding his wrath, anyway. I doubt they\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>Marshal and I are assigned to the same professor. He takes care of the upper-level classes and I do the 101 classes. Since the sound of my nervous nail picking is making Marshal glare at me, I switch and rub at a piece of lint on my sweater. He sighs and shakes his head. It\u2019s not my fault that I respond to tension by fidgeting. Besides, I didn\u2019t sleep too good last night, and I refuse to have two craptacular days in a row.</p><p>I fixed a smile on my face this morning, and it\u2019s not leaving my face, no matter what happens.</p><p>I swing my legs and lean forward on the desk, planting a hand on either side of my hips. A second later, Tia staggers in and flops onto a couch on the other side of the room. All of her things fall on the floor next to her and she moans.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Marshal asks, glancing back at Tia. \u201cI hope she\u2019s not sick. She can\u2019t be here if she\u2019s sick.\u201d His voice raises half an octave as he speaks.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, lunatic. She won the Abs of Steel workout last night.\u201d He blinks at me, not understanding.</p><p>Tia interjects, \u201cMy abs weren\u2019t up to it. Fucking Pilates class. It feels like someone used my guts for a punching bag.\u201d She groans and rolls onto her side.</p><p>Suddenly, Marshal turns toward me. \u201cI think that story about Tadwick failing half the class is just a rumor.\u201d He taps his fingers to his lips and says, \u201cBut still, a good rumor has been known to strike fear into freshmen. Maybe they\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll stay,\u201d Tia says, from across the room. I don\u2019t why she laid down. She won\u2019t be able to sit back up. Tia\u2019s hand waves in the air as she speaks. \u201cMy class, on the other hand, is probably already gone. They don\u2019t wait two seconds for Strictland.\u201d</p><p>Marshal glances at her and waves her off. \u201cThat\u2019s because Strictland\u2019s a pushover.\u201d</p><p>Someone clears her throat from the doorway behind Marshal. \u201cAm I? I wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d Dr. Strictland walks into the center of the room. It\u2019s the central space between all the offices. She glances at Marshal. \u201cI\u2019ll go harder on the class this semester and tell them to thank you for it, Marshal.\u201d</p><p>Marshal\u2019s eyeballs are going to pop out of his head. The corner of Strictland\u2019s mouth tugs up. She likes teasing him. Marshal has an issue with understanding sarcasm. Strictland gives him a look and says, \u201cAs if I\u2019d do such a thing? Really Marshal. Learn to tell when someone is pulling your leg.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Cyianna Strictland is the head of the department. She\u2019s an older woman, with copper-colored skin and streaks of gray peppered through her auburn hair. She usually wears a vivid pant suit, but today she\u2019s wearing solid black, which is very out of character. Strictland waves her hand to cut off Marshal\u2019s groveling pleas. The look in her eye makes my stomach drop. Something bad has happened.</p><p>Continuing, Strictland folds her hands in front of her and says, \u201cThere are more important things to discuss. I\u2019m afraid that I have some bad news. As you may know, Dr. Tadwick\u2019s classes have been twice a week since last year when he had a heart attack. He made a stunning recovery and was about to start back full time, however\u2014\u201d she presses her palms together and looks around the room at us, \u201cThings didn\u2019t go as planned. Dr. Tadwick passed away over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops open along with everyone else\u2019s. Tadwick joked about his heart attack when he came back to work. He was so full of life, so young compared to the other profs. He had a new outlook on life and was ready to make a dent in the world. Most of the professors here could pass for twice his age. In comparison, Tadwick\u2019s the young teacher. He was the teacher everyone hoped to get. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shocked gasps fill the room. I see my horror mirrored in the faces around me. We all liked him. Strictland gives us a moment and then speaks gently, \u201cI know, I know. It was sudden. Everyone thought he would...\u201d Strictland\u2019s voice is strained. She tries to keep the emotion off her face, but she can\u2019t. \u201cHe was a trusted colleague and a good friend.</p><p>\u201cIn light of what happened, we have had to find a quick replacement so that the students in Dr. Tadwick\u2019s classes could complete their courses. The university has hired a new teacher, one of my previous students, to temporarily to teach his classes.</p><p>\u201cSidney and Marshal, you can meet him in a moment. He\u2019s gone to the classroom to inform the students of the change. I\u2019m not certain if he plans to hold class today or let the students leave. We left that decision up to him.\u201d Marshal and I nod.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe Tadwick\u2019s dead. A wave of shock hits me and doesn\u2019t let go. His poor little girls. My heart clenches inside my chest. I met them a few times. The last time I saw them, they came up here with their mother to bring Tadwick dinner. It was a big surprise. Now he\u2019s gone. There\u2019ll be a hole in that family that won\u2019t mend. My eyes sting, but tears don\u2019t fall. I\u2019ve spent too much of my life crying. They won\u2019t fall unless I let them, and I can\u2019t. Not here. Not now.</p><p>Strictland eyes me, as though she can see my thoughts on my face. \u201cThe funeral is this afternoon, if you would like to attend and pay your respects.\u201d Strictland gives the location along with some other directions before turning to me and saying, \u201cPlease help the classes transition. Some of the students may be very upset. Dr. Tadwick was a promising young teacher. No one expected this.\u201d</p><p>I know the students will be upset, especially in Marshal\u2019s classes. The upper-level classes are small. Everyone knows everyone else. My 100 level classes are large with hundreds of students. Most of them didn\u2019t know Tadwick very well. I have no idea how they\u2019ll take it. Stunned, I nod and turn to leave. My class is downstairs right now and the new guy is probably being eaten alive.</p><p>I feel that hollow place at the center of my chest as I walk down the stairs and think about Tadwick. My emotions are such a jumbled mess. Add in the incident from last night and I can feel my grip on my emotions slipping away. I keep getting blindsided. Images flash through my mind, filled with Tadwick\u2019s smile, his voice, his lessons\u2014things he taught me that won\u2019t ever be forgotten. For the vibrancy of his life to be snuffed out, it just seems so pointless. It\u2019s not fair. I feel the weight inside my chest sink into my stomach and think I might puke. I can\u2019t do anything except think that Tadwick\u2019s still alive, wearing his patchwork coat with the big ugly buttons. I picture him at the lectern, and know that I won\u2019t see him there ever again.</p><p>There are some people who take the time to teach others. And, at the time, it seems silly. At the time, I thought I knew everything, but Tadwick had a gentle way about him. Life is a journey, he would say. No one knows everything, and the best part is that you don\u2019t have to. He meant that I didn\u2019t have to figure everything out to live my life.</p> <p>There\u2019s a difference between wisdom and knowledge. Tadwick was wise. My throat is in knots as I approach the classroom door. Normally, I would enter from the side and go sit in the first row, but not today.</p><p>The lump in my throat has grown so large, so impossible to swallow. I stand in front of the main doors to the classroom, and stare at the silver pulls without moving. I say a little prayer for Tadwick, inside my head, for his family, before I go inside. I don\u2019t really believe anything, but I can\u2019t help it. It seems like the right thing to do.</p><p>When I pull open the classroom door, I see the endless rows of seats. They are still full. I guess new guy is continuing class without a break. A student is talking, answering a question from Antigone, the assignment for today.</p><p>Glancing down to the front of the room, I see the new teacher\u2019s black suit and don\u2019t bother to look at his face. I walk down the stairs slowly. No one looks at me. They all know I\u2019m the TA. I stare at my feet as I walk down the staircase toward the front of the massive room. I feel as if I\u2019m in a bubble. The sounds around me blur, but about half way down the stairs my attention snaps to the front of the room. The hairs on my neck prickle and I feel eyes on me.</p><p>Slowly I lift my gaze to see who\u2019s looking at me. They lock on the man at the front of the room. He stares at me for a moment, and I shudder. Every inch of my body is in overload. I feel my brain breaking and falling apart inside my head.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening, not to me, not now.</p> <p>I stop and stare.</p><p>It\u2019s Peter.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Every inch of my skin is covered in goose bumps. A shiver of ice runs down my spine and mingles with the lust still brimming inside of me from last night. Standing frozen on the stairs, I gape at him. Peter looks up at me with those gorgeous eyes. His mouth is paused midsentence as he stares back with his head titled to the side. Peter blinks at me, as if I\u2019ll fade away\u2014like this is a bad dream and a single blink will set me free.</p><p>I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking. The expression on his face is so annoyingly neutral. Horror slowly drips through me like acid, burning away every other emotion. Although I can\u2019t feel them at the moment, I know they are still there, pushed back behind the floodgate that\u2019s ready to burst open.</p><p>Realization comes to me as I take in his clothing \u2013that polished suit that fits his beautiful body perfectly. He\u2019s standing in front of the lectern. He is (or was) answering the student. Awh, damn.</p><p>Peter\u2019s the replacement professor.</p><p>Peter\u2019s a teacher.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s my boss.</p><p>My heart feels brittle, like glass, like I\u2019ll shatter if I breathe. There\u2019s too much pressure even though nothing is touching me. I feel its force crushing against my body, against my battered soul. Too many things have gone wrong today. I feel the fracture lines splinter me into pieces.</p><p>I react. I don\u2019t mean to, but I do. Gasping, I cover my mouth and press my lips together so tightly that they hurt. Part of my mind is telling my legs to move, be quiet, and go sit down, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m frozen on the stairs and falling apart. Peter watches me with those striking eyes. He doesn\u2019t look away from me. He stands frozen, as if I\u2019m the biggest shock he could have expected.</p><p>The student who was talking before, Lily, speaks up. I see her hand go up out of the corner of my eye. She asks, \u201cExcuse me, Dr. Granz?\u201d</p><p>Peter flinches and his head turns back toward Lily. There\u2019s a full smile on his face, as if nothing\u2019s happened. Like I don\u2019t matter. The students around me glance at my frozen form, still standing on the stair case. Peter\u2019s rich voice fills the room. It echoes through the speaker so clearly that I can\u2019t stand it. My legs are telling me to haul ass out of there, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I drop my hand from my face and walk down to my normal seat at the front of the room. Peter doesn\u2019t look at me again. The rest of the class continues and I do my job, taking attendance and posting his questions to the interactive computer thingy the school purchased last year. The students use an iTouch to respond, and the teacher can see their answers. It helps the teacher and the students, but most of the teachers can\u2019t use it, which is why each class has a TA or GA to help.</p><p>Over the course of the hour, I\u2019ve gone numb. I can\u2019t handle this. Too much has happened too fast. It\u2019s bad enough being here, in Tadwick\u2019s room, knowing I\u2019ll never see him again. Add to that the Peter complication and I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t handle seeing him every day, having him tell me what to do, sitting with him for hours and grading papers. My stomach twists and turns, growing more acidic by the second. I feel so sick. By the end of class, I\u2019ve shrunk back into my chair so that my head barely hits the top of the seat.</p><p>Peter dismisses the class. He turns and looks at the lectern for a moment, while I gather my things to leave. As I stand and start walking up the stairs, I hear my name. \u201cSidney Colleli, please come see me before you go.\u201d I hear the rustling of paper behind me as Peter picks up his notes.</p><p>Turning slowly, I look back at him. The lump in my throat is now the size of my head. I can\u2019t swallow. I\u2019m coming apart at the seams. I can feel it. Talking to him is a very bad idea, but there are a few students lingering. I can\u2019t blow him off.</p><p>As it is, people noticed something was weird when I saw Peter. Dating a prof is against university policy, so is dating the boss. Peter is both. We\u2019ll both get fired if anyone knows what happened between us. There is no room for stuff of this sort in academia. The rules were made crystal clear when we signed on the line to be a TA. At the time, the thought of sleeping with a prof sounded gross, but now\u2014shit, shit, shit. My brain is in panic mode. I try to lock it down as I walk toward Peter.</p><p>I grin at him, as if he has no effect on me, and fold my arms over my chest. \u201cSo, Doctor Granz, is it?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at me from under his brow. He stacks papers and shoves them into his satchel. \u201cYes, I completed my doctoral work last semester. The title is new. It takes some getting used to.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMmm, I suppose that\u2019s why you forgot to mention it.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a look that says I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this now. His eyes burn a hole into mine, like he\u2019s daring me to blurt it out. I break the death-stare first and look away. I don\u2019t have it in me right now. Peter clears his throat and says, \u201cPlease meet me in my office at 3:00pm. There are some things we need to go over right away.\u201d He grabs another stack of papers from his bag as he speaks. He pulls them out and puts them on the podium.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer him at first. I just look at my shoes, my tired old All Stars. Then, my gaze drifts to his black dress shoe. It\u2019s a saddle shoe, vintage, and one of my favorite styles. It reminds me of dancing and laughing, things that seem so foreign at the moment.</p><p>I open my mouth as if I\u2019m going to say something and decide that it\u2019s not worth it. I need this job. I worked my ass off to get here and I\u2019m not letting Peter mess it up. I nod and turn away. I don\u2019t look back at him. I walk up the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A plan forms in my head. I need to put space between us. I need to get a different professor to work for. I need to find Strictland and ask her to assign me to someone else.</p><p>As I reach the upper landing, I see Marshal walk through the door. He gives me a look and tilts his head at Peter. \u201cSo, how is he?\u201d</p><p>I glance back, watching him write on the dry-erase board with his back to me. When I turn to Marshal, I snap, \u201cWhy would I know?\u201d</p> <p>Marshal gives me a weird look. I push past him, banging into his shoulder because he doesn\u2019t move and I don\u2019t want to stay around to chat.</p><p>I need to find Strictland. Now.</p><p>When I reach the offices, things appear to be back to normal. Student workers are at their desks, professors are hurrying through the space\u2014coffee in one hand, papers in the other\u2014on their way to teach.</p><p>I walk over to Tadwick\u2019s office and stand in the open door way. I spent hours in there. Leaning my head to the side, I rest it against the doorjamb. My eyes scan the room looking at all Tadwick\u2019s books, his favorite poems and literature. My gaze drifts to his pictures and some small clay thing that looks like a squashed cat. One of his girls made that for him. I remember him bringing it in and proudly showing off his future artist. He was beaming that day.</p><p>Blinking rapidly, I try to fight off the stinging that\u2019s building behind my eyes. Life is short. I know that, but I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t believe I won\u2019t see him again. It feels unreal. My mind wrestles with it and doesn\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s a fact\u2014Dr. Tadwick is dead.</p> <p>A hand lands on my shoulder and I nearly jump out of my skin. I round on the person swiftly, trying hard not to punch the crazy person. Sneaking up on me is normally a bad idea, but today, it\u2019s a super bad idea. I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m a million things and nothing. I want to hit something. The pain that would shoot through my hand would make it so I\u2019d feel something familiar, something I know how to handle.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to handle this.</p><p>Before I smash in her face, I see Dr. Strictland. She doesn\u2019t step back or lower her hand when I turn. She has that smile on her face, the one that isn\u2019t really a smile. It\u2019s a way to hide pain, a mask. \u201cAre you all right, Sidney? I know you and Marshal must be in shock as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say, trying to force my voice to sound normal.</p><p>That\u2019s my go-to response. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m okay. Everything\u2019s great. But nothing\u2019s great. Everything sucks. My fake smile slips from my face. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m lying. I\u2019m not okay. I didn\u2019t expect this. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d</p><p>Strictland looks at me with such compassion that it\u2019s hard to maintain her gaze and not cry. \u201cCome with me.\u201d Lowering her hand, she turns away, and I follow her back to her office.</p> <p>When I was first in here, I thought she was a deranged cat lady. There are kitty cat statues and pictures everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Little plastic kittens hang playfully from the lights, ceramic orange cats sit on her shelves, there are cross-stitched kitties on the chairs, and on her desk cat frames surround more pictures of real housecats. Seriously. It\u2019s scary. Eventually, I found out that she had been the victim of a prank and left the cat theme in place when she realized it scared the crap out of people. She has an interesting sense of humor.</p><p>I lower myself onto a stitched kitty and lean back into the chair. Strictland walks behind her desk and sits down. \u201cSidney, I know today was hard for you. Have you lost anyone before, dear?\u201d</p><p>I nod and keep my hands folded tightly in my lap. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly, waiting for me to elaborate, but I don\u2019t. There are things I won\u2019t say, secrets I won\u2019t tell. I can\u2019t talk about it. Not now, not ever. \u201cWell, you can talk to a counselor about it and work through the stages of grief. It\u2019s better that you\u2019re not alone in this. We\u2019re all going to miss him.\u201d I nod. \u201cHow was the freshmen class this morning?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at her. \u201cThey were all right. Dr. Granz continued with the lesson.\u201d I pause and decide to just blurt it out. \u201cIs there any way that I could get transferred to another professor?\u201d</p><p>Strictland looks surprised. She leans forward and places her hands on top of her desk. \u201cWhy? Is something wrong? Did Dr. Granz\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, quickly backtracking. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think that I can manage to sit in Tadwick\u2019s office every day. It\u2019d be so much better if I could work for someone else.\u201d I\u2019m lying. Sort of. I don\u2019t want to sit there with Peter every day. I don\u2019t want to look up at him and remember his hands on me, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to remember him throwing me out.</p><p>Dr. Tadwick shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sidney, but all the TA jobs have been assigned for months now. There are no other positions. You\u2019ll have to figure out how to deal with this loss, and I\u2019m sure Dr. Granz will be happy to help you, unless you\u2019re resigning?\u201d Her eyes widen as she looks at me. The last thing she wants to do is hire and train a new TA in the middle of the year.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not resigning. I need this job.\u201d I look at my hands, at the way the nail polish that was so neat last night has been chipped away. Images from the previous evening flash across my mind. I see Peter\u2019s eyes and hear his voice echo inside my head. The sensation of his hands searing my skin and his teasing kiss rushes back. I press my lips together and shut the memory out. I\u2019m going to have to suck it up. Peter is a part of my life now, whether I want him there or not.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>I\u2019m a nervous wreck by the time I get to lunch. Before finding my regular table with Millie and Tia, I walk into the cafeteria and grab some food. I navigate my way through hordes of students, and sit down next to Millie at a long table in front of the windows. This entire side of the cafeteria is windows. The school sunk a buttload of money into the view. There\u2019s a lot of brick work, flowers, and super green grass. Seriously, it\u2019s too green. I thought it was plastic at first. Everything around here is that sickly shade of yellow that comes from a general lack of water. There\u2019s been a drought here for the past three years, and it\u2019s easy to tell. That\u2019s why this little garden stands out. It\u2019s completely out of place, but it looks good when prospective students sit down.</p><p>When I sit down, Millie\u2019s picking at a salad as though one piece of lettuce might be tastier than another. There\u2019s no dressing on it. She eats it dry. My plate has a corndog and fries. Bad days call for foods that are bad for your butt. I dip my dog into ketchup and take a bite. I\u2019m not that hungry, but maybe eating something will help me feel better.</p><p>Tia looks at me like I\u2019m eating asphalt off the road with a side of squirrel. I snap, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tia responds, glancing down at her own plate.</p><p>Millie sighs and glances at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You seem off-balance.\u201d She stabs another piece of salad and turns the leaf over, examining it, before popping it in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Everything. \u201cToday is just turning into crap, that\u2019s all.\u201d My favorite teacher died. I nearly slept with a guy last night, but he blew me off. Oh, and he\u2019s my new boss. What a train wreck.</p><p>Tia choses that moment to say, \u201cI heard Tadwick\u2019s replacement already called you into his office. What\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to be tactless, Tia.\u201d Millie scolds, shaking her head and spearing more greens onto her fork.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d I ask, not caring that Tia\u2019s blunt.</p><p>\u201cMarshal. He was in a mood after class. He said something about how you pissed off Dr. Grant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranz,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cYeah, him, and how you pissed him off already. Seriously, Sidney, what\u2019d you do?\u201d Tia leans forward. She\u2019s sitting across from me and hasn\u2019t touched her food.</p><p>I shrug and paint my plate red with the half eaten corndog. Ketchup streaks across the white dish in wide arcs while I tell them, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Granz just seems mean. He probably wants to make a point with me or something stupid like that. You know how teachers are hard-asses on their first day.\u201d That\u2019s usually true. It sets the tone for the rest of the year. A professor who\u2019s a pushover on day one, is a doormat on day two.</p><p>Millie\u2019s eyes have been burning a hole in the side of my face. \u201cWell, in light of today sucking, I think we should end the night with some margaritas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always want to end the night with margaritas,\u201d I respond, still not looking at her. My ketchup resembles a disturbing Van Gogh painting. I could call it, The Missing Ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve needed one lately. Take a hint already.\u201d Millie\u2019s back straightens and she looks straight ahead. Tia ducks her head and eats her food, not looking at either of us.</p><p>\u201cTake a hint? What are you talking about?\u201d Millie says nothing. She just looks at me like I should know, but I don\u2019t get it. \u201cCome on Millie, if you\u2019ve got something to say, say it.\u201d I\u2019ve dropped my corndog, sensing a verbal bitch-slap coming on.</p><p>She looks as thought she\u2019s going to say something and then thinks better of it. Instead, Millie shakes her head and says, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come on\u2014tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d she shouts way too loud for her little body. Blonde curls bouncing, she grips the table and yells, \u201cNothing makes you happy. Everything I do is wrong. Every guy is wrong. Everyone is wrong. Jeeze, Sidney! You ever stop to wonder if it\u2019s you? I mean, when that many things are wrong, maybe you are the one who\u2019s wrong? Maybe you are the one that doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>I blink at her. This is as much of an argument as I\u2019ve ever gotten from Millie. On another day, I could have brushed it off. On another day, I might have laughed and agreed with her\u2014but not today.</p><p>I stand up and grab my tray. I walk away without speaking. Millie\u2019s words cut me to the core, because out of all the things that are wrong with me, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s been hanging around my neck like a noose. I don\u2019t fit anywhere. Maybe I pretend that\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not. The isolation makes me crazy. I feel as if I\u2019ve been drifting on a crappy little blow-up boat, and my best friend just popped it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Millie\u2019s voice rings out behind me, but I don\u2019t stop. I dump my tray with my half-eaten food and leave. Pushing through the doors to the campus center, I step outside into the warm afternoon air. I walk fast and hard, not thinking about where I\u2019m going. I just go.</p><p>When I stop, I\u2019m standing at the bottom of a grand staircase at the front of the oldest building on campus. No one uses the stairs. There are too many of them. Everyone enters the building through the back and takes the elevator. I climb the steps until I\u2019m close to the top and sit at the foot of a massive pillar. I pull my knees into my chest and wrap my arms around them.</p><p>There are no words sometimes. There\u2019s nothing to say to make things better.</p> <p>There\u2019s an hour to kill before class. Then, I have to haul myself back to the English building and face Peter. I lower my forehead to my knees.</p><p>Why do bad things always seem to happen in threes? Is there some cosmic law that I don\u2019t know about? First Peter, then Tadwick, and then what? There\u2019ll be a third thing, probably my job. Peter will most likely want to replace me with someone that he hasn\u2019t seen half-naked. My mind wanders. I think about his eyes, his face. I can\u2019t believe Peter has a doctorate. He doesn\u2019t look much older than me, but I guess he is.</p><p>My life is a mess. Whoever said college was easier than real life doesn\u2019t know crap.</p><p>Ever since I left New Jersey, things have been hard. It seems that I ran away from one problem and straight into another. Nothing\u2019s gone right for me. I\u2019m always in the wrong place at the wrong time. When God was dishing out luck, I didn\u2019t get any. Instead, I got a shitload of someone else\u2019s bad karma. Maybe I was a total ass in a past life and this life is payback. Too bad I don\u2019t believe in that stuff. At least that would make sense. The way things are now, nothing makes sense.</p><p>My family hates me. What I told Peter about them freaking out when I left, it was true, albeit a slightly subdued variation of the truth. They wanted me to stay and take a job at the bank. Family is everything. Blood is thicker than water, whatever that means. But, I had this chance and I took it. I applied at a school that had a scholarship within my reach. They gave it to me along with the TA job and I\u2019ve been able to support myself. I never thought I\u2019d be able to do that. I don\u2019t want to rely on anyone else. It hurts too badly when they let you down. I\u2019ve fallen on my face enough times to know that there\u2019s no one else who will take care of me as well as I can.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m broken. Maybe I am wrong and Millie is right. I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t have to know everything. I lift my head and look up, hearing Tadwick\u2019s advice inside my head, remembering his words. Some of the weight lifts from my shoulders. That\u2019s his legacy\u2014all the students he taught\u2014all the positive influences he left behind. That\u2019s his footprint. I wonder what mine will be.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>My stomach floods with dread as I walk toward the English building. I don\u2019t want to see Peter. I don\u2019t want to see his eyes. I don\u2019t want to hear him say whatever he\u2019s going to say. And I swear, if he makes up some lame excuse about last night, I\u2019ll lose it.</p><p>I manage to get to the offices and slowly move toward Tadwick\u2019s room. I wish I didn\u2019t care. I wish Peter didn\u2019t matter, but last night was so awesome and I thought we had something. I was wrong. I hate being wrong.</p><p>I drop my sociology books on the student desk since it\u2019s empty. The office door is closed. I step up and knock. My heart slaps into my ribs and my pulse shoots into dangerous territory. I wait, but no one answers. I knock again and feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. A slow sinking feeling fills my stomach and I turn slowly.</p><p>Peter is behind me with a stern look on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re over here,\u201d he says, and walks away expecting me to follow. We cross the hall and enter a different office. This one is barren. There are no books, cats, or picture frames to be found. I step into the office, past Peter, and he pushes the door closed behind me. Peter gestures for me to take a seat. I sit down in one of the chairs in front of his empty desk. Peter walks around me and sits behind the desk.</p> <p>His blue eyes search my face, but I stare at him blankly. I need to be numb. I tell myself, No matter what he says, no matter what happens, don\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asks. I arch an eyebrow at him, like it\u2019s a stupid question. \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>I tap my teeth together once and glare at him. \u201cEnough with the pleasantries, Dr. Granz. I want to know if you intend on replacing me as your TA, or if we\u2019re going to lie to everyone and pretend we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d I\u2019m as prickly like a withered rose, all thorns.</p><p>His jaw drops for a second. He leans forward, looking at me as though I shouldn\u2019t think poorly of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a student. I thought you were older. You seemed older when you sat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a teacher.\u201d My eyes slip over his face, and then slip down to his tie and perfectly pressed white shirt before returning to his face. \u201cI have trouble believing that you forgot you were a doctor. If you\u2019d mentioned it, we could have avoided last night all together. I would have asked what you were a doctor of, and you would have told me. We both would have realized the problem and gone our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened has happened. We can\u2019t change it\u2014\u201d</p><p>My temper is about to break free. I\u2019m trying so hard not to yell. I point my index finger at him and say in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t make me climb across this desk and slap you, because I will. Don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m a child and tell me shit I already know. I asked a question. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Peter presses his fingertips together as I speak. Those blue eyes search my face, looking for something. After everything that\u2019s happened, I can\u2019t believe that he can still look me in the eye, or that he\u2019d want to. He lets out a slow breath and drops his hands to the desk. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m not going to do anything. Last night was an accident. I wasn\u2019t employed here yet and you weren\u2019t my student or employee, not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a technicality, and they won\u2019t care. If someone finds out and we don\u2019t say something now, you\u2019ll ruin your reputation and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you want tell Dr. Strictland?\u201d He stands suddenly and walks to the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go tell her.\u201d Peter\u2019s hand is on the knob, twisting it when I bounce out of my seat and block the door with my body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare open that door.\u201d Peter towers above me and looks down into my face. He\u2019s too close, but I can\u2019t step out of the way. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell her. They\u2019ll fire me, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, what do you want me to do, Sidney?\u201d Peter closes his eyes for a second and runs his fingers through his hair. It\u2019s the only indication he\u2019s given that this is stressing him out too. \u201cI want to do what\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t want to hurt you more than I already have.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d I lie. \u201cAnd costing me my job isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Peter is silent. He steps away from the door. Our shoulders brush together as he turns away. It sends sparks through me, making my stomach twist. He doesn\u2019t seem to notice what he does to me. Peter sits behind the desk and leans back.</p><p>When I don\u2019t resume my place in the chair right away, he holds his palm out, indicating that I should sit. \u201cSpell it out, Sidney. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart between Peter and the floor. I don\u2019t want to lie to Strictland, but Peter\u2019s right. Technically we didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so there\u2019s nothing to tell. But it makes me uneasy. My world is turning into a house of cards. Throw another secret onto the pile. Sure. Why not?</p><p>\u201cNothing\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll do nothing. Nothing happened. It wasn\u2019t important and it\u2019s not as though it\u2019ll happen again, so I don\u2019t think we need to say anything.\u201d</p><p>As I speak, Peter\u2019s eyes slip away from mine. He gazes at the bookcase behind me, looking through me like I\u2019m not even there. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you think is best.\u201d I nod. He continues, \u201cVery well...\u201d Peter opens his mouth as if he\u2019s going to say something more, but he doesn\u2019t. I wish he would. I wish he\u2019d tell me what I did wrong last night, what made him push me away. Can he tell that I\u2019m fucked up? Can he tell that I\u2019ve been torn to pieces and put back together again?</p><p>I don\u2019t let anyone get close to me. I keep them at arm\u2019s length. The walls guarding my heart went up a long time ago. They don\u2019t have cracks or crevices where someone can slip in. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand my reaction today. I shouldn\u2019t care. I would have left at the end of the night and never called. I don\u2019t want to know him, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want him to know me. But...there\u2019s a chink in my armor. There has to be.</p><p>I nod again, taking Peter\u2019s silence as a cue to leave. I stand and walk to the door. Peter doesn\u2019t get up. He watches me as I reach for the knob and says, \u201cSidney.\u201d I turn to look at him. \u201cBe here early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow early? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it, okay. Meet me here at 7:00am.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>The next morning I show up at Peter\u2019s office a few minutes early. I\u2019m wearing a pair of jeans and a thick cream colored sweater. A steaming cup of coffee is in my hand. Trudging up the stairs to the second floor offices, I take a sip. The building is quiet this early. Hardly anyone is here. My pulse pounds harder with every step I take. I feel humiliated and it doesn\u2019t mesh well with my mood.</p><p>I\u2019m going to act like Peter doesn\u2019t affect me. That\u2019s the plan. It\u2019s not stellar, but it\u2019s the best I can manage on short notice and scrambled brains. I tossed and turned all night. Sleep finally came around time to get up. Nights are hard enough. Add Peter the next morning, Tadwick\u2019s empty office, and I might cry for no apparent reason. Awesome.</p><p>I push through the double doors to the offices and see Marshal sitting inside. I breathe a sigh of relief. Thank God. I won\u2019t be alone with Peter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marshal looks at me. He\u2019s dressed like Bert from Sesame Street, with a striped shirt and turtleneck. He tops the look off with a pair of jeans and white sneakers. He looks like a six-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he scolds me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even 7:00 yet, you neurotic bundle of nerves. Chill out.\u201d I sip my coffee and set my book bag down on a table before settling into a chair. I lean back and relax. As long as Marshal is here, I can handle this. Confidence washes over me and my rapid pulse slows to normal. \u201cWhere is the geezer anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind you,\u201d Peter says, walking by with his arms filled with papers and books. \u201cGet up, Colleli, and bring Marshal with you.\u201d He backs into his office door and tries to get a key into the lock while balancing everything in his arms. It doesn\u2019t work. Papers start to slide and a book falls to the floor.</p> <p>Marshal is oblivious. I wait for him to help with the door, but when he doesn\u2019t I get up and walk over to Peter. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d I take the keys from his hand and our fingers brush. A jolt of electricity shots through me and swirls in my stomach. Damn him.</p><p>Peter backs away, apparently unaffected. \u201cThanks, Sidney.\u201d</p><p>I hold the door open and gesture for him to enter. Peter manages to get to his desk before everything falls out of his arms. Papers and books go everywhere. I kneel and start picking them up and putting them on his desk. \u201cWhat is all this stuff?\u201d They\u2019re the papers that were due a few weeks ago.</p><p>Marshal enters and stands there watching us with my coffee in one hand and my book bag in the other. \u201cYou forgot this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marshal.\u201d He sets my bag down inside the door and puts the cup on an empty shelf. Then, he stands there and watches us stooping, but doesn\u2019t help. Marshal just watches with his hands clutched in front of him. I glance up at him. \u201cYou might want to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no, I think you\u2019ve got it.\u201d Marshal steps over us and sits in Peter\u2019s chair.</p><p>Peter gives me a look that says, Is he serious?</p><p>\u201cChoose your battles wisely is all I\u2019m going to say. If he wasn\u2019t an asset, they wouldn\u2019t have given him the job.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes meet mine and he nods. He holds my gaze a beat too long, and I glance away.</p><p>We finally get everything picked up and onto the table when Peter tells us what\u2019s going on. \u201cWhen Tadwick died, he had papers in his office and at his house. His wife gave these to me last night so the students wouldn\u2019t have to redo them. There are research papers, tests, and all sorts of things here that need to be graded and returned. Dr. Tadwick did some of them, but he didn\u2019t get a chance to finish. We need to figure out which papers go with which class and grade them. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marshal whines. \u201cWhy is this so last minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshal,\u201d I warn, but he doesn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not fair. Why should I spend my morning sorting this mess? I\u2019m not the one who dropped it, besides, it\u2019s not a part of my job description.\u201d He folds his arms over his chest.</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t react the way I expect him to. He walks over to Marshal, and turns the chair so that they face each other. Peter braces his arm on the back of the chair and lowers his face toward Marshal\u2019s. \u201cDo you like your job? Do you want to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do what I ask you to do. Take that stack to Tadwick\u2019s office and sort them. When you\u2019re done, take the graduate papers you find and grade them, then give them to me to look over. Understand?\u201d Peter speaks in a low stern voice. I can tell this isn\u2019t optional. Hell, even Marshal can tell he is getting scolded.</p><p>Marshal\u2019s eyes dart to the floor and he says, \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>Peter stands up and tosses a pile of papers in Marshal\u2019s lap. \u201cGet going. The door is open.\u201d Marshal takes the papers and leaves without looking back. Peter glances at me before sitting in his chair. \u201cIs he always like that? I thought he was just out of it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>A lopsided smile forms on my face. \u201cPretty much. They say he makes up for in brains what he lacks in tact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, his mother?\u201d Peter smiles and shakes his head. I didn\u2019t mean to be nice to him. I want to be cold and distant, but for some reason I can\u2019t. I glance at the doorway, wondering how difficult it is for Marshal. \u201cI\u2019m sure Marshal was shaken up yesterday. He\u2019s acting a little more nuts than usual.\u201d I sit down and start sorting the papers. Most of the class wrote their course number somewhere, so it isn\u2019t too hard, just time consuming.</p><p>Peter watches me for a second and nods before starting on the next pile. \u201cI thought that it would help everyone to have these back as soon as possible, in light of what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s good to move forward.\u201d</p><p>I nod, not saying anything. I wonder if that\u2019s what he thinks about us too. Don\u2019t look back.</p><p>We sit in silence, sorting and stacking. Peter glances up at me from time to time, but he doesn\u2019t say much. When the silence is deafeningly loud, I say, \u201cStart talking or I\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d</p><p>Peter glances at me from the corner of his eye. \u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, just say something. You\u2019ve been all tense and quiet since I saw you yesterday. I thought nothing happened. Let\u2019s act like it.\u201d I\u2019m such a liar. I just want something else to think about because right now my mind is filled with Peter\u2019s hands, Peter\u2019s eyes, Peter\u2019s breath.</p><p>He stills and looks at me as I speak. I don\u2019t look up. I keep sorting. He clears his throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t say nothing happened. I said we did nothing wrong.\u201d Peter goes back to his pile and moves the papers into the stacks on his desk.</p><p>\u201cSame difference.\u201d I take a deep breath and decide to just say it. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t really get along with that many people and I enjoyed talking to you the other day. Talking isn\u2019t against university policy, is it?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Peter gives me a hesitant smile. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Okay, tell me something about yourself. How\u2019d you end up here?\u201d</p><p>I pause. Damn it. Out of everything to ask, he asks that. I hedge. \u201cCollege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he says, looking up at me. \u201cI mean what made you chose this college? Why leave and come here. This town is a hell hole and the people are a little weird, in case you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d He smiles at me.</p><p>I keep working as I speak. I might as well tell him. It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll change anything. \u201cI traded one hell for another, I guess. I wanted to get as far away from my family as possible. Something happened during my senior year. They blamed me. I thought they should have defended me.\u201d I feel my heart pounding in my chest as the memory rushes forward in my mind. A chill wraps around my throat and chokes me. I swallow hard, forcing the feeling away. \u201cAnyway, I came here because the university offered me a way to pay for college by myself. I wanted to start over. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s not the normal why I went to college story. I don\u2019t care what he thinks of me; at least I don\u2019t want to. He finally asks, \u201cWas it worth it? I mean, cutting everyone off. Did it fix things?\u201d</p><p>I feel his eyes on my face. I don\u2019t look up. I can\u2019t meet his gaze. Why did I tell him this? This conversation feels too intimate to be having with him. I expected Peter to gloss over it, as if he stepped in something icky, but he didn\u2019t. I smile weakly, trying to hold my mask in place, trying to push away the memories that haunt me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s something that can be fixed. There are things like that, ya know? They change you and you can\u2019t be who you were before. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s fixed or not.\u201d</p><p>Peter surprises me and says, \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d He doesn\u2019t elaborate. His eyes have the same vacant stare from the other night, as though he\u2019s remembering something he wants to forget. He blinks and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t see you at Dr. Tadwick\u2019s funeral yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. What I meant was that I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m staring at the paper in my hands, not seeing the words on the page. I hold it too long. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to see his kids. I\u2019m weak.\u201d The thought of Tadwick\u2019s daughters gathered around his casket with tears in their eyes was too much. I feel like I\u2019m coming apart at the seams most days as it is. That would have unraveled me completely.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Peter puts another paper onto a pile.</p><p>Shaking my head, I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. How can you possibly say that?\u201d I stare at him, daring him to answer.</p><p>Peter lifts his head and our gazes lock. It\u2019s like the other night. The feelings rush back. Something inside me stirs. My body responds to him as if I\u2019m made for him. The hollow spot in my chest tingles and feels full. Something inside tugs me toward him and I can\u2019t escape. I lose myself in his eyes. The bookcases and papers fade from sight and the only thing that I can see is Peter. His beautiful pink lips part, like he\u2019s going to whisper something to me, but Marshal enters the room. Peter straightens and turns away from me.</p><p>Marshal is oblivious to relationship stuff. He never notices anything, otherwise it would worry me. He walks into the room and shoves two stacks of papers into the bookcase. \u201cThese are the two graduate classes that I teach. The rest are yours. I have to go get the other stacks. Be right back.\u201d Marshal turns and leaves, not realizing that he interrupted anything.</p><p>I glance at the clock. It\u2019s close to 8:00am. \u201cI better get downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Peter says, his voice too soft. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I nod and grab my bag. I leave the room as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t look back at Peter, but I feel his eyes on me as I walk away. Thoughts tumble through my brain like they\u2019re falling down a flight of stairs. They just keep coming and I can\u2019t make them stop. There\u2019s no way I can deny how I feel about Peter, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m ever going to say anything. Getting rejected once is enough for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk down to the classroom, and then turn on the computers and other technology that is needed for the lesson. Everything comes online and flares to life, except for the microphone at the podium. I tap it, but it\u2019s dead. Damn it. There\u2019s a wire that runs through the bottom of the wood and goes into a port in the floor. I lie on my side and try to tuck my head under the podium into the tiny space between the wood and the floor. I wiggle my head under and see the socket. Reaching underneath, I fish my hand through cobwebs and dust hoping to God that a mutant rat from the science lab doesn\u2019t suddenly appear and gnaw off my arm.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I hear Peter ask from above me. I didn\u2019t realize he was standing there.</p><p>I don\u2019t pull my head out to look at him. My fingers are so close to the wire. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The mic is out. I\u2019m fixing the wire. One second.\u201d I\u2019m at an award angle, but I manage to get my fingers on the plug and push it back into the socket. The speakers make a hideous, deafeningly loud noise, and I hear everyone in the room moan in response. When I wiggle back out, Peter is standing above me with his hands over his ears.</p> <p>\u201cWeenie,\u201d I say to him. I know he\u2019s too close to the mic to say anything back.</p><p>Peter offers his hand and pulls me up. I dust myself off, trying to ignore how much I like the feel of his hands. A nervous jolt of excitement fills my body. Peter\u2019s gaze rests on my figure as I walk back to my seat. I don\u2019t turn back. It\u2019s everything I can do to act as though I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care that he\u2019s looking.</p><p>It\u2019s then that one of the guys in the first row starts clapping. He woos! and says, \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for the techie TA!\u201d He claps loudly and everyone follows his lead. A crooked grin forms on my lips as I lean forward and look at him like he\u2019s crazy. The guy holds his hands up and claps louder and gestures for me to stand. Shaking my head, I stand and bow, smiling as I wave to the class.</p><p>The guy\u2014Mark\u2014watches me until I sit down. I nod at him and he smiles back, beaming. He\u2019s a year younger than me, and relationships are usually so far from my mind that I never noticed him before. Between the two, I suppose it was difficult for him to catch my attention. Mark\u2019s grin is contagious. I lean back in my seat, smiling, and look up at the podium, when I see Peter\u2019s face. His eyes are hard and the usual easy-going smile isn\u2019t visible. The look slips away before I can blink. Mark didn\u2019t notice. Hell, I\u2019m not sure if I noticed it. What the hell was that?</p><p>Peter starts his lesson, and by the end of it, everyone is back in the groove of things. I wonder how long it will take for them to transition from Dr. Tadwick to Peter. They have different styles of teaching. I know from not only sitting in here, but because Peter is the professor in my once a week night class. , The thought makes me feel all twisted inside. When I reign in my drifting mind, Peter is dismissing the class. I stand and gather my things.</p> <p>Peter walks over to me. \u201cThanks for taking care of the microphone. You saved me from a very sore throat. Talking loud enough for the entire room to hear all day would have severely sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to save the world from suckage.\u201d I give him a half smile and start to walk toward the side door.</p><p>\u201cCan you do 7:00am for one more day? After that, we should be caught up.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes slip over my face as he asks, more gently this time than yesterday.</p><p>I nod, acting as though I don\u2019t care, acting like it\u2019s a job and nothing more. \u201cSure. See you then.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Millie is sitting on her bed, sorting through photocopies of reference books from the library. She\u2019s been working on a term paper for the past few days. The abs of steel night was when she decided to take a break. You don\u2019t want to be around Millie when she takes a break.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, walking in and sitting on the bed opposite her after my classes are done. Our room is decorated with the things Millie enjoys. Since she has more money than me, and I had no intention of decorating it, I let her. Everything is yellow and blue.</p><p>After our fallout the other day, I felt bad. I\u2019m sure I was out of sorts. We patched things up later that night. My ego is still bruised, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not fighting anymore. She\u2019s my best friend.</p><p>\u201cHey Sid,\u201d she says back, not bothering to look up. Her fingers are racing across the paper, her eyes scanning the information. The bitch has a photographic memory. I\u2019m super jealous. When she finishes, she looks up at me and smiles.</p><p>It feels like I fell off a cliff. \u201cI know that look. What\u2019d you do?\u201d I ask her, as I yank my shoes off my feet.</p><p>\u201cNothing devious. Damn, Sidney. Can\u2019t a girl do something nice and smile about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but your little brain doesn\u2019t work that way. Besides, I\u2019ve seen that look enough times to know to run the other way when you give it to me, so let me make this easy on you. Whatever you did\u2014whatever you were going to ask\u2014the answer is no. Hell no. No way.\u201d I flop back on my bed and stare at the ceiling.</p><p>Today was long. The 7:00am start makes it feel later than it is. I still have homework and need to grab dinner. It\u2019s already getting late.</p><p>\u201cBut, Sidney, you didn\u2019t even hear what it is. I know you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just being polite.\u201d</p><p>Millie snort laughs, because that\u2019s a big fat lie. Polite comments and bluntness are two qualities that cannot coexist. I favor blunt. She knows. \u201cAs if that were possible.\u201d She throws her head back and makes a whiny sound. \u201cPlease, please, please, please...\u201d</p><p>I glance at her. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Millie clasps her hands together under her chin and is still chanting please, please, please. \u201cAre you going to stop?\u201d She shakes her head and continues pleading. \u201cAt least tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwing dance club. Please, please, please, please, please...\u201d and she keeps on begging me and batting her huge eyes. Maybe that works on Brent, but I could care less.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and pull my arm over my face. She doesn\u2019t stop. I laugh at her and say, \u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, please, please...\u201d</p><p>I love dancing, especially swing dancing. Between the music, the clothes, and the movement, I love it. There are few things that I can lose myself in. While I don\u2019t get modern club dances, which look like people spasming, I do enjoy the old dances. There are moves, steps, and rhythms to get lost in. It takes skill, and when you find the right partner, it\u2019s close to perfect. I haven\u2019t danced in a long time, not since I left New Jersey.</p><p>Millie is still pleading. I let her whine for a few more minutes and then cave. \u201cFine, but you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you owe me a ton.\u201d She laughs and bounces up and down on her bed. \u201cWhere the hell did you find a swing dance club down here? I thought just about everything was country.\u201d</p><p>Millie\u2019s eyes slowly drift to the side. I sit up and prop myself onto my elbows and stare her down. She explains, \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a club the school started. The student organization was trying to get it going last year, before the holidays, but we couldn\u2019t get a teacher to sponsor us. Well, they finally found someone. And it starts tonight!\u201d She claps her hands like she\u2019s three and beams at me.</p><p>Oh my God, this is going to be lame. \u201cA school club?\u201d She nods. \u201cLike chess team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the awesome new swing dance club!\u201d Millie is obviously excited.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry that I said yes. A class full of newbs means I won\u2019t get to dance much. We\u2019ll be lucky to get past the basics.</p><p>Millie jumps up and runs across the room. \u201cI found this dress at the mall. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d She grabs a red dress from her closet and pulls it out. The bodice is fitted and it has a full circle skirt. It is perfect. \u201cNow, I have to find saddle shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-straps would look cool with that too.\u201d I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m drooling. Millie hands me the dress, so I can admire it. Awh, crap. She\u2019s sucking me in and I\u2019m letting her. I glance up at her. \u201cYou\u2019re evil, you know that right?\u201d</p><p>Millie beams at me and nods, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to regret this, Sidney. It\u2019s going to be so much fun!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Millie is wearing her new dress with a pair of heels. I\u2019m wearing a black skirt and white blouse. It\u2019s boring, but it\u2019s the only thing I have that even comes close to swing clothes. The silky fabric swishes next to my thighs as we walk. The club was given use of the old gym. Old is literal. The gymnasium was constructed in 1919. It has no air conditioning, which is an issue in the heat. But Swing Dance Club is pretty low on the roster, in terms of getting a good room to use, so we were banished to sweat it out in the oldest building on campus. The fa\u00e7ade is all brick and the inside smells of moldy socks.</p><p>Millie pulls open the door, and we walk through the darkened halls and find the gym. It\u2019s much smaller than the new one. We go inside and see Brent. Millie runs over to him and throws her arms around his neck. He holds her tightly and spins her around. Her red skirt twirls as he does it and Millie laughs. I smile at them. She seems happy, which makes me happy. Despite Millie\u2019s shortcomings, she\u2019s a good friend.</p><p>I walk over when Brent puts her down. The club isn\u2019t very big. There are less than a dozen kids standing around. From the looks of it, most of them are girls that like the idea of dressing up and dancing. The guys tagged along hoping to get lucky for being such good sports. Guys can be so dumb. Dancing, especially this kind of dancing, is a chance to get close to a girl. He can feel her whole body against his and it\u2019s expected. Dancing is hot and heavy, all hands with racing hearts and ragged breathes.</p><p>As I\u2019m thinking these thoughts, I start to feel goose bumps come up on my arms. I ignore the sensation, thinking about being held in someone\u2019s arms and wish that I had someone that I wanted to hold...someone besides Peter. That\u2019s when things get interesting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor, a dark-haired, tall, thin student calls us to attention. I sit on the last row of bleachers so I don\u2019t have to climb in my skirt. He claps his oversized hands three times and everyone goes quiet. \u201cAs you know, we finally got the Swing Dance Club approved.\u201d Someone whoops, and Trevor continues. \u201cWe have a faculty sponsor, which was hard to find. No one dances like this anymore, so I can\u2019t tell you how lucky we are. So,\u201d Trevor presses his palms together. \u201cIs there anyone here that has a basic understanding of Swing? Maybe you know the steps well enough, but nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>I lift my hand along with a few others, most of whom are girls. We put our hands down as Trevor looks around and nods at each of us. \u201cOkay, great. I was hoping that would happen. It\u2019ll help us get started, which is always the hardest part of forming a club. Until we have the basics, we really can\u2019t get into advanced moves, and we sure can\u2019t do throws. I don\u2019t suppose anyone in here is up to that level?\u201d</p><p>I lift my hand, shyly, and wave my fingertips at him. He looks surprised.</p> <p>\u201cJersey girl can dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not alone. It\u2019s not like I can do anything more than the basic steps without an experienced partner.\u201d I rub my hands nervously in my lap. Everyone is looking at me. I squirm in my seat a little bit until a voice makes my heart skip a beat.</p><p>\u201cHow experienced are you, Colleli?\u201d Peter says, rounding the bleachers from the side.</p><p>My mouth falls open. I glance at him and then back at Trevor, who introduces him. \u201cThis is Dr. Granz, our sponsor. He\u2019s also very experienced. This is great! Maybe you guys could show us a thing or two?\u201d</p><p>Until then, I\u2019d been staring at Peter. It isn\u2019t until Trevor offers me up, that I come back to myself. I act shy, and shake my head, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure we should just start with the basics tonight anyway.\u201d My heart is thumping in my chest, flopping around like a fish out of water. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t dance with Peter. Every time he touches me, my brain melts. The night we were almost together will come rushing back. I can\u2019t do it.</p> <p>Peter cuts his gaze from Trevor and takes in my reaction. \u201cWe should stick to the basics. Advanced moves are very challenging. A novice would have issues and we don\u2019t want to single anyone out. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a novice.\u201d I interrupt, offended. Peter turns his face toward me and I realize that I\u2019ve been played. Bastard.</p><p>He\u2019s smirking. \u201cWould you like to prove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I would.\u201d I get up and smooth my skirt, annoyed with him. If the arrogant prick thinks he can do this better than I can, he\u2019s got another thing coming. Peter turns on the music. It\u2019s something newer, but it\u2019s still big band music\u2014it\u2019s still swing.</p><p>We walk up to each other and lock eyes. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m daring him to touch me. Peter\u2019s hands slip into place and we start. Our feet move in step with each other. I pull and move, trying to take the lead, testing him. Peter won\u2019t let me. He dances me across the gleaming wooden floor, snapping my wrist back every time I try to defy him and move in a way he doesn\u2019t want. Peter\u2019s grip on my hand tightens, before he launches me into a spin. I shoot out from his body and twirl on my foot, before he stops me. Our hands are connected. He waits a beat and then yanks me back to him, hard. I smirk and spin back.</p><p>Okay, so he doesn\u2019t suck. That\u2019s when he kicks things up a notch. Our bodies move closer together as the music slows for this middle section. He plays my body, moving his hands down my sides and dips me back slowly until my long hair dangles to the floor. The faster rhythm resumes and Peter surprises me. I\u2019m smiling now. I can\u2019t help it. We rock-step and twirl our way around the room. The students watching cheer and whistle. This is what they came here to learn.</p> <p>The next time Peter whirls me against his chest, he holds me tight. His muscular forearm is across my chest as he presses my back tightly to his body. I hear his voice in my ear, asking, \u201cYou up for throws?\u201d I nod, without hesitating. He releases me, spinning me out.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I say, breathless. The pounding inside my chest won\u2019t stop and I can\u2019t wipe the smile off my face. The song is almost over and I wonder what kind of move he\u2019s going to do. When he shifts his hands, I follow his lead and I know.</p><p>Peter swings me out and snaps me back. When I race toward his chest, his hands slide from my arms to my waist. I grab hold of his strong shoulders and feel the momentum. Peter guides me, leading the move. My legs kick straight back up behind me. I feel the air catch my skirt, forcing it up. Peter\u2019s hands hold me tight as I glide back down. Peter guides my body so that my legs wrap around his waist before he dips me back.</p><p>The music crescendos and ends with us in that pose\u2014eye to eye and breathing hard. A thin sheen of sweat covers my body. I\u2019m suddenly very aware of his hands and my thighs. It\u2019s the way we were the other day, right before he pushed me away. Peter seems to realize this, and sets me down. His hands slip off my body and he turns back toward the other students.</p><p>Breathing hard, he says, \u201cStart with the basics. No throws. You guys haven\u2019t signed the waivers yet.\u201d I watch him walk across the gym and grab water from a cooler.</p><p>Turning away, I wonder how bad that just looked. Everyone had to be able to tell how much I want him. I couldn\u2019t hide it, not with his body pressed against mine like that. I sit down on the bleachers and Millie slips next to me, overly excited.</p><p>\u201cThat was so awesome! Dude, you were like all,\u201d she makes a movement with her arm, \u201cand he was all...OH MY GOD! It was so cool! I would die if I could dance like that. Why didn\u2019t I know you could dance like that?\u201d Her eyes are bugging out of her head.</p><p>\u201cUhm, you did.\u201d I say, looking at her. \u201cYou dragged me here because I love swing dancing, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, so you were an unwilling participant this evening?\u201d Peter appears from over my shoulder. He holds out a bottle of water for me. I take it, crack open the cap and drink.</p><p>Millie answers for me. \u201cI dragged her here. It\u2019s for her own good. She\u2019s going to turn into an old maid if she doesn\u2019t find some guy to drool over soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter says nothing. His eyes are on my face, but I don\u2019t look up. Millie talks too much.</p><p>Trevor has taken lead of the class and Millie bounces off to rock step with Brent. They step on each other, a lot. Every time it happens, Millie stops and laughs.</p><p>Peter sits next to me. \u201cSo, old maid, I wouldn\u2019t have pegged you for a swing dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover and all that.\u201d I don\u2019t look at him. I drink my water and watch the newbies kick each other as they try to dance together. I lift my chin, tilting my head towards the couples dancing. \u201cThis club should have shin guards.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cYeah, right. We weren\u2019t even allotted a budget for water and I had to fight with them to get this lovely building.\u201d His eyes flick to my face. \u201cAs you can tell, when April comes around, we\u2019re all going to be sweating buckets.\u201d</p><p>A bead of sweat rolls down my neck and between my breasts. I\u2019m dripping way more than I\u2019d like already. April is going to suck. \u201cMaybe we can borrow a class room? There aren\u2019t that many kids here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor thinks that it\u2019ll grow pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d I ask, looking at the guy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he said there was a lot of interest, but no one comes in the beginning. It\u2019s the kind of thing people don\u2019t want to start, but they\u2019re happy to come once there are enough people to dance with.\u201d</p><p>I can barely understand what he\u2019s saying. All rational thought has left my brain. Damn, he smells so good, even covered in sweat. As Peter speaks, I act as though he has no effect on me, but he does. Every word he says pulls me to him. And it\u2019s the whole package, not just his looks. Why does he have to dance too? And he\u2019s good. I loved every second of it. If we practiced, I bet we could do more complicated moves and I\u2019d love every second of that too. How pathetic is this? I\u2019m crushing on my teacher.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d I nod before getting up, trying hard to make it look like I don\u2019t care what he does. \u201cWell, off to mingle with the masses.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m walking away, Peter calls my name. \u201cSidney.\u201d His smile fades, but there\u2019s still a sparkle in those beautiful blue eyes. I look at him, waiting for him to say something, but he just shakes his head and looks away, \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>I want to know what he was going to say, but I don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. Maybe if I say it enough times, I won\u2019t care about Peter Granz.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Millie is twirling down the hallway when we get back to the dorm. She spins in a circle with her arms out, laughing at the ceiling. Her hair flies out in a circle. She\u2019s smitten. \u201cThat was so much fun!\u201d Millie whirls into a girl walking out of a dorm room, nearly knocking her over. Millie makes an oof sound and then steadies the two of them, apologizing. I try not to laugh. The girl storms away irritated. It\u2019s late.</p><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d Millie says, catching up to me. I didn\u2019t stop during the ambush. \u201cI had no idea you could dance like that! You\u2019ve been holding out on me.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that, Little Miss Goodie Two-Shoes. You\u2019re always all pure and wholesome, and then you go and dance like that.\u201d</p><p>I stop and turn to her. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Dance like what?\u201d</p><p>Millie shimmies her chest and says, \u201cAll sexy, rubbing up against the hot teacher.\u201d She laughs hysterically, not knowing that I nearly slept with him.</p><p>I roll my eyes and keep walking. We round the corner and I pull out the key to our door. \u201cI was not.\u201d Twisting the key, we head in and I drop my stuff on my bed. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m protesting. Peter is hot and the dancing makes me smile if I think about it too long, which means I can\u2019t let myself think about it at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frickin\u2019 Millie and her observations. I glance at her. She points at me with a flick of her wrist. \u201cYou straddled the guy. Your thighs were around his hips.\u201d</p><p>She walks over to her bed, not paying attention to me. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that wasn\u2019t hot, because it was totally hot. Besides, he seemed to like it.\u201d I chuck a pillow at her. It hits Millie in the side of the head. She turns toward me. \u201cWell, he did!\u201d She throws it back.</p><p>The pillow hits the wall and falls on my head, knocking down a picture frame on my nightstand. I reach out and grab it before the frame bounces off the bed, and hits the floor. Setting it on the ledge next to me, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re impossible. Next time, I just won\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know you want to. And, I think that I\u2019ll ask you guys to show us more of that throw\u2014in slow motion.\u201d She winks at me with her mouth open. It\u2019s all innuendo.</p><p>Stupid Millie. I\u2019m close to laughing because her mouth hasn\u2019t shut yet and she keeps winking at me, waiting for me to giggle. I fold my arms over my chest. \u201cGo ahead. I won\u2019t be there anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You know you won\u2019t let me down.\u201d Millie shifts in her bed and sits on her knees. She looks at me funny for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her pretty face is all scrunched up. Millie holds a pillow to her chest and gives me a serious look. \u201cYou never let me down. I mean, you always try to do what I want.\u201d She picks at the corner of the pillow, not looking up at me.</p> <p>Something doesn\u2019t feel right. It doesn\u2019t sound like praise, like oh Sidney, you\u2019re the bestest friend I ever had! It sounds as though she\u2019s worried or something. It makes me nervous. I have no idea where this conversation is going. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I have a question for you.\u201d She takes a deep breath and jumps in. \u201cWhy do you go on dates with me if you have no intention of dating? I mean, we\u2019ve been roommates since freshman year and you haven\u2019t hooked up with a guy once, but you always come out with us when I ask you.\u201d Her voice is too serious.</p><p>Worry pinches my throat, making it hard to swallow. My mouth goes dry. I wonder if she knows what happened. My ex wasn\u2019t stupid enough to post what he did to me on Facebook, but there were pictures. They were the type of pictures that look wrong.</p><p>I feel her gaze on my face. I don\u2019t look up.</p><p>Millie finally asks, \u201cSidney, do you have a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>Shock shoots across my face. I glance up at her and blink. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a half smirk on Millie\u2019s lips. Her eyebrows are doing this weird thing where one is up and the other is down. She looks right at me and adds, \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re into girls, that\u2019s okay. I mean, I\u2019m not\u2014not that I don\u2019t like you\u2014well, not like that. I was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>My eyes are too big for my head. She\u2019s rambling. Oh my God, this is so not what I thought she was going to say. My jaw drops open. I listen to her eat her foot and finally blurt out, \u201cI\u2019m not a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>Millie counters, \u201cBut it\u2019d be okay if you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>Mille presses her lips together and considers me for a moment. It\u2019s as if she can\u2019t figure me out. Damn, have I become so dysfunctional that she can\u2019t tell I\u2019m into guys?</p><p>She finally asks, \u201cThen, what\u2019s up with you? Did your parents send you down here with a chastity belt or something?\u201d She leans back against the wall and pulls her knees to her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t date, unless I drag you with me\u2014and honestly, straddling teacher-guy was the most action you\u2019ve gotten since we met.\u201d</p><p>My face flames red. \u201cThis conversation passed the acceptable limit before it started.\u201d I laugh nervously and stand. I walk over to my closet and fish through it, looking for PJs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Sidney. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t think you should be happy or something. There\u2019s always this massive weight on your shoulders. I used to think it was because you\u2019re from New Jersey and everyone there must be super pissed-off all the time, but that\u2019s not it. Is it? You lit up when you were dancing tonight. I saw another version of you that I haven\u2019t really seen before. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s another Sidney locked away somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her. This isn\u2019t something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I share. Not after what happened last time I told someone. Part of me wants to say it. I want to know if she thinks that it was my fault, but I couldn\u2019t bear that. Not again. Shaking my head, I look away. \u201cI just like dancing. It makes me forget to scowl all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, you\u2019ll tell me. And when you do, I\u2019ll be a good friend. You\u2019ve been a good friend to me. You deserve to have someone to tell your secrets to, no matter what they are.\u201d She smiles sadly at me.</p><p>I can\u2019t. I feel the words lodged in my throat. I feel the bear at my back, but it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I can\u2019t say it. I can\u2019t tell her what happened to me, what he did to me. There\u2019s a span of silence. Neither of us moves.</p><p>Finally, Millie\u2019s gaze drops to her bedspread. \u201cI think he might be the one.\u201d</p><p>Shocked by the abrupt conversation change, I don\u2019t follow at first. \u201cWho? Brent?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. We get along really well\u2014better than anyone else. I really love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you guys said that to each other, yet?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she says, \u201cNot yet. I nearly said it tonight. I\u2019m thinking about it. It\u2019s hard, you know. Being the first one to say I love you is rough. I mean, he might not say it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say it back.\u201d There\u2019s certainty in my voice. I smile at her and she looks less fragile.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over his face, Millie. He adores you, even if he can\u2019t say the L-bomb, yet.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. Hard. It lights up her face. Millie leans back into her pillows. I change and then grab my books and try to get some reading out of the way, but my mind is elsewhere. I wonder how long it will be until Millie figures out what happened to me. Maybe I should just tell her and get it over with. When I realize that I\u2019m no longer reading, I shut the light off and climb into bed.</p><p>This time when I close my eyes, I\u2019m granted a reprieve. Instead of reliving the same nightmare over again, I see Peter\u2019s easy smile. I fall asleep thinking about my body twirling and his strong hands guiding me.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>A few weeks roll by and the last of the winter weather is gone. Spring is here. Trees are budding and there are flowers everywhere. The campus is covered in bright, beautiful, colors. It seems to make everyone extra smitten. Couples walk around totally love-struck, not paying attention to anything but each other.</p><p>Working for Peter has gotten better, less uncomfortable. I hate to admit it, but I like him. He\u2019s a good teacher and laid-back most of the time. It works out well since I\u2019m usually as tense as a totem pole. Being around him soothes me. I don\u2019t feel as on edge as I usually do. I wonder if he notices things like that. Sometimes I think Peter doesn\u2019t notice much, but I think that\u2019s what he wants me think.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly dinner time. I\u2019m on my way to my night class, but stop to check my mail first. I wave at a few people as I walk into the campus center and find my mail box. I turn the little lockbox dial, pull open the door, and yank out the mail. I slap the door shut and walk over to the table to sort it and toss junk mail.</p><p>Dusty sees me. He walks over and stands at the table opposite me. \u201cHey, Sidney.\u201d</p><p>We haven\u2019t spoken since our ill-fated date, which has been hard to pull off since he\u2019s in one of my classes. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to apologize. I screwed up the night we met. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>I so don\u2019t want to talk about this. I wave my hands, motioning for him to stop. \u201cNo, it was my fault. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not your fault. Come on. Let me say this. I\u2019ve been trying to say it to you for way too long.\u201d I look at him and nod even though I want to bolt. \u201cI was an ass. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed anything, but I did. I\u2019m sorry, Sidney.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the mail in my hands as he speaks. Dusty\u2019s words are familiar. I\u2019ve heard them before from another set of lips, from someone equally sweet. Appearances can be deceiving. I look up at him and nod. \u201cOkay. Do me a favor though and let\u2019s just start over?\u201d I don\u2019t want to start over, but he\u2019s been following me around, trying to apologize for too long to blow him off.</p><p>Dusty smiles. \u201cSounds good.\u201d He looks at the mail in my hands and then back up at my face. \u201cYou headed to class?\u201d I nod. \u201cMe too. I\u2019ll walk over with you.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cUh, okay. Sure.\u201d As I wait for Dusty to check his mail, I look at the letters in my hands. I toss a bunch of junk mail and then freeze on the last envelope. I recognize the handwriting. I stare at it, unblinking. A wave of shock nearly knocks me over. He found me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dusty asks.</p><p>I stuff the letter into my book, and nod. As we walk to class, I don\u2019t say much. Dusty talks and I listen, or try to....but that letter. Oh my god. It\u2019s been over four years. Why would he send a letter? Why now? I\u2019m nervous, so tense that I don\u2019t realize that we\u2019ve entered the classroom and that Peter is talking to me.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand lands on my shoulder and I jump. My feet literally trip back and I gasp. Peter steps back and lifts his hands, showing me his palms. \u201cEasy, Sidney. Are you all right?\u201d He looks concerned.</p><p>The class is watching us. I feel eyes on me. Too many people are looking. I find my plastic smile and put it on. I nod and laugh about being spaced-out. Dusty laughs with me, but Peter doesn\u2019t buy it. He doesn\u2019t tell me, in fact, he says the opposite. Peter even smiles, but I can read him. He\u2019ll ask me about it later, after everyone leaves.</p><p>It feels like I\u2019m wearing a turtleneck made of thorns. I can\u2019t swallow. I can\u2019t breathe. Every time I touch my textbook, I feel the letter through the pages, burning a hole in my hand. I shouldn\u2019t read it. I shouldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what if it\u2019s important? What if\u2014?</p><p>Don\u2019t read it. It\u2019s not worth it.</p><p>The internal debate continues in my mind. I stare blankly. The lesson continues around me, but I don\u2019t notice. Students talk. Someone laughs. A girl\u2019s voice rings in my ears a few moments later, but I have no idea what she said or what Peter said. The letter consumes me.</p> <p>My palm is pressed to the pages. My fingers twitch. Halfway through class, Peter calls on me. I don\u2019t hear him. My gaze is on the floor and totally vacant. I don\u2019t realize he\u2019s standing in front of me until I see his shoes. I look up. \u201cSorry. What was that?\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me and points to my textbook, which is open to the wrong page. Peter gives me a look, but doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about poems. Dusty said they\u2019re emotional crap used to lure in women, that no guy in his right mind would ever write a poem on his own without an incentive.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cAn incentive?\u201d</p><p>Dusty is sitting two rows behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it nicely. What I said was that no guy would write a poem for no reason. The poet in this case obviously wanted to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery eloquent,\u201d Peter says, and shakes his head. Folding his arms across his chest, Peter looks down at me. \u201cAnd what do you say, Sidney?\u201d</p> <p>I make a face and look back at Dusty. \u201cNot that.\u201d I turn back to Peter. \u201cA poem is an expression of emotions. It\u2019s condensed language. At its core...\u201d My vision goes black at the edges. I wrote poems. I vividly remember what happened the day I wrote the last poem. The choking sensation doesn\u2019t stop. I can still feel his hands on me. I swallow my gasp and ignore the cold sweat on my back. Clearing my throat, I add, \u201cAt the core of poetry is purity\u2014pure emotion, pure desire, pure elation, pure\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dusty speaks out, \u201cSo a poem can\u2019t be filled with lies? What if the guy just wants to nail you? What if it\u2019s all pretty words? You really think that ancient guys didn\u2019t write this stuff to get a little action? Come on, Sidney, you\u2019re smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>Dusty\u2019s words echo in my mind, wakening memories long buried. I clutch the side of my face and sputter, \u201cOh, come on, yourself. Not every guy is a bastard, Dusty. Isn\u2019t it possible that some poems were written because they were cathartic and had nothing to do with panties?\u201d</p><p>He says something back. A few guys chuckle. I close my eyes hard, but the classroom tilts to the side. It doesn\u2019t stop. Dusty\u2019s words ring in my ear, as a buzzing sound grows louder. What the hell is the matter with me? It\u2019s just a letter. Dusty\u2019s just a dick. I already know that. Nothing is going to hurt me, but I feel so threatened. I chase away the panic that\u2019s consuming me and finally hear Dusty again. \u201c...they did it then and they do it now. Guys don\u2019t write poems for themselves. They do it to get laid. If they need an emotional outlet, they punch shit.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, this conversation dredges up everything. Before I know what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m gasping, clutching my desk so hard that my fingers turn white. Peter is watching me. He doesn\u2019t move. He doesn\u2019t silence Dusty. I stare at Peter\u2019s shoe and try to take long steady breaths. I\u2019m going to have an anxiety attack and freak out in class. My heart is pounding, beating way too fast. A bead of sweat drips next to my ear and rolls down my jaw.</p><p>Peter cuts off the conversation. \u201cSo all the men in this room feel that way?\u201d I hear movement, but don\u2019t look up. \u201cVery well. For the rest of this class period you are to go to the library and write a poem. It cannot be for a woman and it has to be an expression of emotion. It\u2019s due on my desk at the end of the period. Bring it back here. Got it?\u201d There\u2019s a lot of groaning, and then the sound of chairs moving.</p> <p>I try to push back and stand, but I barely move before Peter says, \u201cSidney, I need to speak with you. Stay put for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Peter follows the class out of the room, and answers a few questions, telling them to return at 9:20pm with the poem. He tells them if they put in the effort, they get credit. No, length doesn\u2019t matter. A few guys snigger about the size not mattering. Peter responds by telling them that they have to turn in two poems. I hear curses and then silence.</p><p>No one is in the room. At some point, I laid my head on the desk and closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSidney?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is gentle. When I open my eyes, he\u2019s kneeling in front of my desk. His eyes sweep over my face, worried. I feel like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I sit up and nod. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know what...\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s gaze is filled with concern. He reads me perfectly. He knows that I\u2019m lying. I see it in that sad crooked smile he gives me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. You\u2019re still pale. Sit for a while.\u201d Peter stands and walks over to his bag, and pulls out a Hershey bar. He walks back to me and holds it out. \u201cHere, eat this.\u201d</p><p>I take it and sit up straighter. I\u2019m hoping I can blame this on low blood sugar. \u201cYou carry around chocolate in your briefcase?\u201d</p><p>He smirks as I bite into it. \u201cMaybe. Truth is, that was going to be my dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I go to hand it back to him. There\u2019s a big bite mark in it. I have a huge mouth. Peter\u2019s hands brush against mine. Gently, he pushes the candy back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou finish it.\u201d His hands are still on mine. Peter looks into my face, trying to catch my gaze. \u201cWhat set you off? It was as if you were somewhere else for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him. Shoving the candy bar in my mouth, I bite down. The chocolate tastes like sand. I can\u2019t think about it. I try to push away the past, but I\u2019m caught in a bear hug. The beast has left the leash. I\u2019m speaking. I don\u2019t know why, but I nod. \u201cI was. I\u2019m sorry. It reminded me of something.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes my hands. I glance up at him and our eyes lock. My stomach flutters. He holds my gaze and doesn\u2019t look away. Peter breathes, and his voice is so soft. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d My gaze shifts back and forth between his blue eyes. I press my lips together and fight off the emotions he\u2019s making me feel. I can\u2019t feel them. Not now. Not ever. I shake my head so softly that I hardly move.</p><p>A sad smile moves across Peter\u2019s lips. \u201cI wish I could.\u201d I say nothing. I can\u2019t speak. I have no voice. I just stare at his dark blue eyes. It feels as though I let the lifeboat sail away. I\u2019m drowning in a sea of pain. He reached out, but I can\u2019t take his hand. I can\u2019t tell him what happened, and he can\u2019t fix it. Even if Peter knows, no one can change the past.</p><p>A girl walks in behind him. I barely notice her. \u201cDr. Granz?\u201d</p><p>Peter startles and turns around. The girl doesn\u2019t think his behavior is strange, but Peter is too nervous. I see it. I see the way his shoulders tense, the way he slips his hands into his pockets, and the way he steps between us. She\u2019s holding her text book, asking something about Iambic Pentameter and rhyme schemes. He tells her that neither is required for the assignment. The girl\u2019s head nearly blows up.</p><p>Peter answers her questions as I finish my candy bar. When I\u2019m done, I go to stand up. Peter points at me and says, \u201cI can\u2019t let you leave. Sit. Finish the assignment in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I protest, but my voice is wrong. It doesn\u2019t come out when I try to speak at a normal volume.</p><p>The girl looks back at me. \u201cYou look feverish. Do you need an aspirin or something? I have one in my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Aspirin won\u2019t fix what\u2019s wrong with me.</p><p>The girl nods and walks to the door. Before she leaves, she looks back. \u201cBetter do what he says or you\u2019ll end up in the nurse\u2019s office overnight. I\u2019ve done that before and it sucks. The cots are horrible.\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch her walk away. Glancing at Peter, I say, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a horrible liar. Just sit and write your poem. I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><p>I want to say that he always bothers me. I want to say that he\u2019s a huge distraction, but I don\u2019t. I roll my eyes and pull out a sheet of paper. I start writing without thinking. It isn\u2019t until I\u2019m done that I realize what I\u2019ve written.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the page when Peter looks up at me from his desk. \u201cDone already?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo. I\u2019m going to rewrite it.\u201d I crumple up the page and toss it. The paper sails through the air and bounces off the side of the trash can by the door, and falls on the floor. I jump out of my seat at the same time as Peter. We both head toward the paper, but Peter gets it first.</p><p>He smoothes it out. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. The purpose was to\u2014\u201d</p><p>My stomach is crawling up my throat, and ice is dripping down my spine. I\u2019m stupid. I\u2019m so stupid. I could act like it\u2019s nothing and maybe he won\u2019t even read it. But I know if I fight with him, if I try to take the paper back, he\u2019ll know how messed up I am\u2014he\u2019ll know the things on the paper are more than just a creative exercise. Why did I write that?</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile fades as his eyes fall to the page in his hands. He stills. His eyes don\u2019t move. It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s reading, but I know he sees it. Peter lifts his gaze slowly. I\u2019m holding one arm with my hand, digging my nails in so hard I\u2019ll draw blood. \u201cSidney\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t... \u201d my mouth is open, but the rest of the words won\u2019t come. Deny it. Say that it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Say it. But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t even look at him. I don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m trembling even though I try not to move. It\u2019s like a chill has swallowed me whole. I\u2019m frozen. Every muscle in my body is locked. I can\u2019t speak, I can\u2019t move. This shouldn\u2019t have happened. I can\u2019t handle it.</p><p>Peter is staring at me with his eyes so big and blue. If he didn\u2019t see straight through me before, he does now. Peter looks at the paper in his hands. His grip is loose, as if the poem might bite him. \u201cI had no idea...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d My voice shakes. I curse my body, curse the memories that never fade away. \u201cDon\u2019t, okay? It\u2019s nothing.\u201d I don\u2019t look at his eyes. My gaze is locked on Peter\u2019s chest. If I look into his face, I\u2019ll crumble. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just a bunch of words on a piece of paper.\u201d</p><p>I try to sound as though it\u2019s nothing, as if I write intense poems all the time. I pretend that I didn\u2019t just bleed my heart out onto a sheet of loose leaf. What the fuck is wrong with me? I pretend. I throw on my fake smile and stare at his shoes. I try to lift my gaze, but it feels like there\u2019s an elephant sitting on my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes are locked on my face. I\u2019m breathing too fast, but every time I try to slow it down, it just gets worse.</p> <p>\u201cHow would you know what it is or what it isn\u2019t?\u201d I look up at him. Mistake. His expression, those haunted blue eyes, the curve of his mouth, the way he looks at me\u2014it\u2019s like he knows. My fingers twitch by my sides. \u201cI\u2019m not standing here. I\u2019m not having this conversation with you. I don\u2019t have to listen to you pretend to care about me.\u201d I turn around to grab my books. I gather them into my arms and head toward the door.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to pull it open, Peter says, \u201cI\u2019m not pretending.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are on my back. My spine is so stiff and so brittle. There\u2019s too much pressure on me. I\u2019m cracking, splintering in a million different directions at once. There\u2019s not one weak spot anymore. Weakness consumes me whole. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter steps closer. I hear his steps traveling toward me. Slowly, he takes another step. His voice catches in his throat when he speaks. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you that night. I wasn\u2019t myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not.\u201d Peter\u2019s directly behind me. I won\u2019t turn. It doesn\u2019t matter what he says. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, then. I didn\u2019t know how smart you are. I didn\u2019t know you hide behind that sharp tongue. I didn\u2019t know why you were down here, and I had no idea why you sat down at my table, but I was glad you did. I\u2019ve thought about that night over and over again. I wonder what would have happened to us if the phone didn\u2019t ring. I wonder what it would feel like to hold you again. I think things that I shouldn\u2019t. I dream things that I shouldn\u2019t. I want things that I shouldn\u2019t and it\u2019s all because of one reason\u2014I do care about you.\u201d</p><p>I gasp as if someone punched me in the stomach. I hold onto the door to keep from falling over. I look over my shoulder at him. Peter means what he says. I see it in his eyes. Chills race over my skin. I stand there too long, staring at him in shock.</p><p>Peter taps the wrinkled paper in his hand. \u201cPlease tell me that this didn\u2019t happen in the last few weeks. Tell me that this isn\u2019t because of something that I did.\u201d</p><p>I stare at his face. I stare and drink him in like I\u2019m dying of thirst. Shock has rendered me silent. My hand drops from the door. My lungs heave in air as I turn to lean back against the door. I hit it too hard and my weight pushes the door open. I start to fall backward. Peter reaches for me. His hands slip around my waist and he pulls me toward him, pulling me upright. The door clicks shut. He doesn\u2019t let go. His eyes are locked with mine. His body is pressed tightly against mine. Our gazes meet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re all right. I know you aren\u2019t... There\u2019s something about you.\u201d Peter takes a deep breath and lowers his gaze. When he looks up again, he says, \u201cAnd I can tell.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitch like they want to spill my guts, so I lock my jaw. I shake my head and try to pull out of his arms. Peter doesn\u2019t allow me to step back. \u201cPart of the poem is about you. Part of it isn\u2019t.\u201d Part of it\u2019s about Peter, and part of it\u2019s about them.</p> <p>I\u2019m hyperaware of my body, of my breaths that seem too long, but not long enough. I can\u2019t breathe. I haven\u2019t spoken about that night since it happened.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes remain fixed on my face. \u201cThe part at the beginning of your poem\u2014the starting over, the tender kisses, the girlish giggles\u2014that part is about me?\u201d I nod. I hate myself, but I nod. \u201cThe part after that with the starving kisses, clawing hands, the taking without giving...\u201d he\u2019s breathing hard. Peter\u2019s lips mash together before he speaks again. \u201cThis is about rape. Sidney, if some guy did something to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I lean into him. I press my face against his chest. Peter\u2019s heart is beating so fast. \u201cThey\u2019re old wounds,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI wrote without thinking. It\u2019s what poured onto the paper.\u201d I take a deep breath and pull away. Peter releases me. \u201cThat part had nothing to do with you or your coffee from that night.\u201d The corner of my mouth tugs up into a lopsided smile. It\u2019s the saddest smile ever. Peter\u2019s expression says as much.</p><p>He searches my eyes for a long time. We\u2019re no longer touching. I wish we were. After a moment, Peter offers me the paper. \u201cI didn\u2019t read the whole thing. I don\u2019t think I was meant to see it. I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d he searches for the right word.</p><p>I take the paper and cut him off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d He gives me a look that says he doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cReally, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m over it. Almost. Well, most of the time. Today just threw me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and remember the letter in my textbook. \u201cRemember how I told you that my family was pissed when I left?\u201d He nods. \u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but it was more than that.\u201d I glance up at his face, debating whether or not to tell him. The way he looks at me makes the words dislodge from my throat. They\u2019ve been stuck there for years.</p><p>Before I realize it, I\u2019m telling him my story. \u201cI left. As soon as I got my scholarship down here, I packed a bag and drove away. I never went back. I didn\u2019t tell my family anything. I don\u2019t use Facebook or Twitter. I picked the worst place I could imagine to make sure they didn\u2019t find me. I did everything short of change my name. I thought it worked. No one found me. No one has called or said anything to me in four years...\u201d</p> <p>I slip the envelope out of my book and hold it between my fingers. \u201cUntil today. My brother sent me a letter. I got it right before class.\u201d I\u2019m saying too much. I shouldn\u2019t tell him this, but I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>Peter watches me as I speak. I haven\u2019t told anyone any of this. No one here knows I was raped. No one knows anything. Shame flushes my face red and I look away from him. I hand Peter the envelope and sit down on top of my desk. My legs dangle down in front of me.</p><p>Peter takes the envelope and flips it over in his hands, before looking up at me. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Throw it out. Change my name.\u201d I stare at my shoes.</p><p>\u201cWill he hurt you?\u201d Peter is looking at the envelope when I glance at him.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. Oh God, I don\u2019t...\u201d I stutter and rub my face with the heel of my hand. When I look up at Peter, I want to tell him. He makes me feel irrationally safe, as if nothing will hurt me.</p><p>\u201cI never told anyone, besides my family.\u201d I\u2019m quiet for a moment, remembering too many things that I want to forget. \u201cI knew him, the guy that...\u201d raped me. I still can\u2019t say it.</p><p>I suck in air as though there isn\u2019t enough and look away from Peter. \u201cWe were dating. I wasn\u2019t ready to have sex. He was. He took what he wanted. He said he\u2019d do it again\u2014that no one would believe me.</p><p>\u201cI found my mom after the first time it happened. I told her. She told my dad. They did nothing. They said it was a date, that maybe I misunderstood or mislead him. My brother found out\u2014I was dating his best friend\u2014and said his friend would never do anything like that. They blamed me. All of them. They said it was my fault.\u201d My gaze lifts and connects with Peter\u2019s. \u201cThat was my senior year of high school.\u201d I smile, but it\u2019s angry. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know the sickest part. My parents liked the guy that did this to me. After that, they tried to keep us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it didn\u2019t stop?\u201d Peter\u2019s arms fold over his chest. His muscles bulge under his shirtsleeves.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo,\u201d my voice is a whisper. Memories slam into me. I see a flash of silver as though it\u2019s really there. The story is so much darker. My fingers touch my throat, feeling the necklace that hides the scar. I can\u2019t tell him that part. I refuse to relive it. I push the thoughts back. My voice is soft. I twist my hands in my lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I couldn\u2019t get away from him. And I didn\u2019t tell anyone else. My parents didn\u2019t believe me, why would my friends?</p><p>\u201cSo I switched my college without telling anyone. I found this place and they gave me everything I needed. I ran away and haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d</p><p>Peter says nothing for a long time. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard life and I made it harder.\u201d His blue gaze pierces mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I swat away his apology. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to apologize for.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head as he wraps his arms around his middle. \u201cI led you on the night I first met you. I was going through some things, but I shouldn\u2019t have. And I sure as hell shouldn\u2019t have asked you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the equivalent of kicking your ass out.\u201d Peter sighs and runs his hands through his hair. \u201cListen, it\u2019s not an excuse, but you should know that it wasn\u2019t you. About a year ago, something happened. I lost someone. I\u2019m not over her.\u201d His voice catches. Peter doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI tried to move on and I wasn\u2019t\u2014I couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s what happened the night we met. I couldn\u2019t tell you, then. I\u2019m not sure I can tell the whole story now\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slip off my desk and walk over to Peter. Placing my hand on his, I say, \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d I hear the pain in his voice. \u201cYou have a friend here, you know. University guidelines be damned.\u201d</p><p>Peter smirks and looks down into my face. \u201cYou care about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. A little bit.\u201d I hold my fingers really close together and grin. He smiles. I love that smile. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not entirely true. I might like you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Peter cuts me off. \u201cYou like me?\u201d Now Peter\u2019s grinning so wide that his dimples show.</p><p>\u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said it. University be damned. You like me. You like me, like me.\u201d Peter waggles his eyebrows, smiling at full wattage.</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me whatever you want, beautiful, but I know you like me.\u201d Peter walks behind his desk, bouncing on the balls of his feet with his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so arrogant. What makes you think that I like you? Maybe I\u2019m just being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm hmmm,\u201d he says shuffling through some papers after he sits down. When Peter looks up at me, he adds, \u201cYou were very friendly, although I would have called being topless and in my lap something else.\u201d My jaw drops open. Peter grins. \u201cOh good. I was afraid that kind of friendliness was your typical MO. By the look on your face, I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Peter glances up at me. I sense the hesitancy in his voice. He wonders if he should tease me about it, but I\u2019m glad he is. It finally throws the whole damn situation out in the open.</p><p>\u201cI was trying something new that night. You seemed to enjoy it.\u201d Heat flushes my face and I can\u2019t hide my wicked grin.</p><p>He winks at me. \u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgh!\u201d I say, and stomp my foot.</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cTemper tantrum? Really, Miss Colleli?\u201d Peter cocks his head to the side and looks at me. He\u2019s jotting something on a piece of paper and stashing his lesson plans back in his satchel.</p><p>\u201cYou infuriate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you nowhere.\u201d Peter picks up his things and adds, \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I feel light and happy, like I might break my face if I keep smiling this much. Peter brings out the best in me. The teasing has been going on for a while, but there hasn\u2019t been any mention of our sort of naked night before today. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but Peter chased away my demons. I feel as though I can handle things again, and I\u2019m genuinely curious about where he wants to go.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me dinner and a glass of wine. I\u2019m driving.\u201d Peter walks toward the door and looks back at me. I want to go, but we shouldn\u2019t. I hesitate. Peter gives a wry smile. \u201cWhat happened to damning the university? Are you really all bark and no bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite you,\u201d I mutter under my breath and grab my stuff.</p><p>Peter grins. \u201cYou should. I\u2019m very sweet, or so I hear\u2014like candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably painted yourself in chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d work, but no. I\u2019ve got this naturally sweet thing going on.\u201d He grins at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this naturally annoying thing going on. Have you been holding back for the past few weeks or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely said two words to me since I took over for Tadwick. I thought you\u2019d castrate me with the letter opener.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my spit and hack up a lung, before saying, \u201cYou did not think that!\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugs and holds out his hand to the door, indicating that we should go. \u201cWhat about the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are directions on the desk. I\u2019ll come back later and pick up the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the University? Seriously, Peter, I don\u2019t want you to lose your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I can have dinner with my students. It\u2019s not forbidden.\u201d Peter\u2019s serious for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened the other night. I owe it to you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t owe me anything, but I want to hear his story. I want to know what\u2019s wrong with him. I want to know what kind of guy doesn\u2019t have sex with a girl that\u2019s already in his lap. There\u2019s something about Peter, something dark that\u2019s always just beneath the surface. Maybe that\u2019s why we get along so well. Maybe his life has sucked like mine.</p><p>Nodding slowly, I follow him out of the room.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>We go back to the same the restaurant as the night we met. It\u2019s fairly empty tonight. Between it being a weekday and the time, hardly anyone is here. The waiter seats us at the back of the room, on the far side of fireplace. I can\u2019t see the rest of the room from my seat. It helps me relax a little bit. Millie would never let me hear the end of it if she knew where I was.</p><p>Peter settles into his chair and we both order drinks. Peter sips some of the amber liquid from his glass, then says, \u201cAbout the night we met\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m mid sip when he speaks. I shake my head and swallow my wine. \u201cPeter, don\u2019t. Really. That\u2019s not why I came.\u201d I don\u2019t need to rehash that night.</p><p>\u201cThen, why did you come?\u201d Peter\u2019s serious, as if he doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry...and maybe because I like you. I thought we already established this?\u201d I smile at him, expecting Peter to go back to his light-hearted self.</p><p>Peter watches me as I raise the glass back to my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I grin at him. \u201cI can hold a wine glass. Wahoo!\u201d I hold up the glass by the stem and twirl it between my thumb and finger. The liquid inside swirls, but doesn\u2019t spill.</p><p>Peter smiles at me. The corners of his eyes crinkle when he does it, amused. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, but your glass holding technique is impeccable.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s something about Peter, something that puts me at ease. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve known him forever, as if I could say anything and he\u2019d understand. It makes no sense.</p><p>Our salads come out. The waiter puts them in front of us and then leaves. The food looks delicious.</p><p>Lifting my fork, I say, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to eat here last time. I sort of freaked out, and attacked the waiter.\u201d</p><p>Peter holds a piece of lettuce on his fork and pauses. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay. My date had happy hands. I was trying to tolerate it, but I freaked out. It resulted in me jumping out of the booth like the place was on fire. I collided with that guy over there.\u201d The same waiter is standing on the other side of the room at the bar. \u201cHis tray fell over in slow motion. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s spitting in my food as they make it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile fades. \u201cWhy were you trying to tolerate a guy touching you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and stab my salad. \u201cBecause I want to be normal. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m kind of messed up.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a somber look. \u201cActually, I did notice that you\u2019re kind of abnormal. For one, you have abnormally large eyes. They sparkle way too much. And that mouth of yours\u2014well, let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s obviously defective.\u201d Peter smirks and picks up his fork.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I smile at him and shake my head.</p><p>Peter grins at me and waves his fork around as he speaks. \u201cBeing normal is overrated. Normal gets you what\u2014the dolt husband with the 2.5 kids and the house with the dog? You seriously want that? I mean, one of those kids is going to be really funny looking, by the way, all cut in half like that. Who wants half a kid?\u201d</p><p>I smile, but it fades quickly. I\u2019m talking to Peter as if I know him, as if I\u2019ve always known him. I don\u2019t worry about what he\u2019ll think. He won my respect and most of my trust in the classroom earlier. He didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t blame me. I haven\u2019t had a friend like that before, well, not a guy. Most of the time, I keep my mouth shut around guys. I don\u2019t want them to know me or what happened. I don\u2019t want to deal with it. Somehow Peter has helped me deal with it, and the emotions that were crippling me earlier have vanished. I don\u2019t know how he does it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know what I want anymore. I used to. But that wasn\u2019t what I meant by normal. Ever since it happened,\u201d I swallow hard and pause way too long. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I have issues. I can\u2019t get close to anyone. I kind of thought that if I forced it, that things would get better.\u201d I don\u2019t look at him. I tried to force myself to have sex with him the night we met. He\u2019s hot and nice to touch, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face pinches together. He doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou thought if you slept with someone that you didn\u2019t really like that you\u2019d get over what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I flick my eyes up. \u201cWell, when you say it, it sounds stupid.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s staring at me with his mouth hanging open. \u201cIt is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that was blunt.\u201d I poke my salad and shove it into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSometimes blunt is better. So tell me, after you let this guy defile you, what happens next? You let him do it again?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Good question, although it makes me wiggle in my seat. I stare at my salad for too long, but I feel Peter\u2019s eyes on me. His gaze is so intense. I shake it off. Peter starts eating again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI thought it would help erase things. You know, push the memories that suck further back in my mind. There hasn\u2019t been anyone since him. I thought it would help.\u201d</p><p>Peter stops eating. His eyes are too wide. He looks at me strangely. His voice is low. \u201cIs that what you were doing with me?\u201d I don\u2019t answer. Peter smiles at me and shakes his head. He pushes the salad away and leans back in his chair. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to level with you.\u201d He presses his lips together into a thin line and then lets out a huff of air. His hands are on the table. His index finger is tapping the table top, nervously. \u201cI was doing the same thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tilt my head and say, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He smiles crookedly at me. \u201cI\u2019m not what they\u2019d call balanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cEveryone. My mom, dad, sister, cousins, and other people who know me. I accepted this job and took off. They think I\u2019m going to fall apart, especially after what happened.\u201d He lifts the amber liquid to his lips and drinks the rest in a single swig.</p><p>Peter sets the glass down. His eyes don\u2019t focus on me or anything else. It\u2019s like he\u2019s lost in a memory. \u201cWe\u2014me and Gina\u2014were in New York, seeing the stuff for Christmas. We went to Radio City and then to dinner. Afterward, it was late. She was ready to leave, but I wanted to go to Rockefeller Center. I wanted to get down on one knee under the tree and ask her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. It nearly breaks my heart. I know that smile. It\u2019s a memory that\u2019s tainted, something that should have been happy but didn\u2019t turn out that way. I feel the weight of his story, the way he can barely say the words. He coughs and his eyes flick to mine. \u201cI talked her into going. I was so excited. I couldn\u2019t wait to ask her. I didn\u2019t want to come back the next day. I wanted to do it at night, when the tree was lit. Gina loved Christmastime. I knew she\u2019d love it.</p><p>\u201cSo, we get there and the place is pretty empty. It\u2019s late. While Gina was looking at the tree, I pulled out the ring. There were some people on the other side of the tree, but they couldn\u2019t see us. I kneeled and held up the ring.\u201d He breathes hard. The lines in his forehead crease. I can see the pain of this memory playing out across his face as if it\u2019s happening now. I want him to stop. Saying the words sounds like it\u2019s breaking him. I want to reach out and take his hand, but I\u2019m frozen.</p><p>Peter looks up at me. His smile twists. \u201cYou\u2019re better at this than me. I\u2019ve had a year to deal with this, but I still can\u2019t even say it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeter...\u201d I say his name and touch his hand. I catch his eye. \u201cThis really hot guy just told me a great piece of advice\u2014it\u2019s stupid to rush things when you aren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once, hard. It makes his chest shake. Peter looks down at my hand. \u201cThat guy\u2019s usually an ass, or so I hear.\u201d He glances up at me from under dark lashes.</p><p>The corners of my mouth turn up slowly. \u201cYou heard right. He is an ass, a totally sweet, thoughtful ass. The best kind of ass really.\u201d I\u2019m laughing lightly as I say it.</p><p>\u201cAh, your attempt at flattery is wasted.\u201d</p><p>I take my wine glass in my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not flattery if it\u2019s true. You\u2019re a good man. Healing takes time. It\u2019s not the same for everyone. It doesn\u2019t happen at the same rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to my family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScrew your family. They don\u2019t understand this\u2014whatever happened to you guys. You do. You understand what happened and what it did to you. Talk about it when you\u2019re ready. Move on when you\u2019re ready.\u201d I finish my wine and put my glass down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to give advice than it is to take it, huh?\u201d Peter watches me for a moment. His eyes sweep over my face, and rest on our hands. Mine palm is still on his. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I look where he\u2019s gazing and flinch. \u201cSorry.\u201d I try to pull my hand away, but Peter takes it and holds on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Peter holds my hand to his lips and brushes a light kiss across my skin. It makes me shiver. He looks up and smiles at me. \u201cWe\u2019re trapped in the middle, you know. We\u2019re not in the friend zone, but we can\u2019t move forward.\u201d</p><p>I slip my hand away and nod. \u201cI know,\u201d I say softly. \u201cIt\u2019s a good spot to be. A better spot than I\u2019ve been in for a long time.\u201d I\u2019m not out trying to bed some guy that I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not out with someone, doing something I don\u2019t want to do. For the moment, I feel perfect, unmarred. I feel like I might survive this with my mind intact. Hope floods my chest, and all my smiles are real. For the first time, in a long time, I think I\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>At lunch a few days later, I grab a salad, some baked chicken, and sit down next to Tia. Millie hasn\u2019t come in yet. \u201cHey. How are your abs of steel?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a look. \u201cSoggy. I tried to do that video again last night. I\u2019m not as sore today, but it still sucks.\u201d She plays with her fruit plate, poking the cottage cheese. \u201cScrew this. I\u2019m starving and that chicken looks good. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Tia\u2019s face scrunches as she stands. Her hand flies to her stomach before she stomps away to get a plate of chicken.</p> <p>For a second, I\u2019m alone. I hear his voice before I see his face. \u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d Dusty says, and slides in next to me. \u201cI heard something, and thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d I glance at him, wondering what kind of crazy sauce he ate to sit down next to me in here. He leans in and lowers his voice. \u201cThere are some awfully dirty rumors floating around about you.\u201d He looks delighted. His eyes sweep over me, lingering on my chest way too long.</p><p>What the hell? He irritates me, like seriously annoys me. I don\u2019t hate him, but I don\u2019t like him either. Glancing at him, I snap, \u201cWho taught you manners? Give me your phone.\u201d I set down my fork and hold out my palm. I thrust it at him when he smiles at me. \u201cCome on. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Dusty grins and pulls out his phone. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the rumor. The way you turned green the other night has everyone thinking you\u2019re knocked up and that the pretty professor did it.\u201d</p><p>What a jackass. I flip through his contacts looking for one in particular. \u201cYou seriously know how to flatter a girl. You called me fat and slutty in the same sentence.\u201d I press my thumb to one of his contacts and his phone dials.</p><p>Dusty finally notices that I\u2019m not playing Angry Birds. \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I hold up my index finger and shush him. Someone answers after a few rings. \u201cHi, this is Sidney Colleli. I\u2019m sitting here with your son and I thought you\u2019d be horrified at his manners. He really needs a once over before I smack my tray over his head.\u201d I called his Mom\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>She seems nice, but Dusty is hyperventilating, watching me as his thin body folds in half. He hisses, \u201cYou called my mom!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, I nod and listen to his mother talk. \u201cYeah. Uh huh. He\u2019s right here.\u201d I look over at Dusty, widen my eyes, and smile.</p><p>\u201cHang up!\u201d Dusty paws at me, trying to take the phone away.</p><p>I slap his hands and twist out of reach. \u201cYou heard that? I know. And he said that nicely compared to what he just told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidney!\u201d Dusty yells, trying to take the phone, but I don\u2019t let him get it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I continue my conversation with his mom, \u201cI got sick in class last week. He implied it was morning sickness and blamed the professor. Uh huh. Please, that\u2019d be great. Oh, I will.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt was nice talking to you, too.\u201d I hand the phone to Dusty.</p><p>He looks at the iPhone like it\u2019s poison. \u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, tell it to your mom.\u201d I smirk and go back to my lunch. Dusty storms off, trying to tell his mom that it was a joke.</p><p>Tia sits down next to me with a plate of chicken and tacos. \u201cWhat\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing worth repeating.\u201d</p><p>Tia stares after Dusty. \u201cThat kid is an ass. I don\u2019t know why Millie set you up with him.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and chomp on my chicken. \u201cMillie\u2019s Millie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s talking about me!\u201d Millie sits down next to us with a huge smile on her face. That smile scares the crap out of me. \u201cGuess what night it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, damn it. Millie, I\u2019m not coming. I came the last four times.\u201d</p><p>She jumps up and down in her seat as if she\u2019s too excited to sit still. \u201cBut you have to! Swing Dance club wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a club without you,\u201d Tia nudges me with her shoulder and laughs while chewing on a chicken leg. Despite the predictions, the club is still pathetically small.</p><p>Millie glares at her. \u201cYou could come too, you know. It\u2019s hard to get a club started.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I needle Tia. \u201cYou should. You and Jack would make such a cute couple.\u201d</p><p>Tia tenses. \u201cJack Ewing? He\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>Millie smiles at me and nods. Her blonde curls sway back and forth. \u201cYup, and he needs a partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d Tia says, with a mouth full of food. \u201cI\u2019ll look retarded.\u201d</p><p>Millie grins and then throws her arms around me, hugging me way too hard. \u201cSidney can teach us!\u201d We nearly fall off the bench. I shake her off, and she laughs like a maniac.</p><p>Crap. I walked straight into that one. I sigh dramatically and narrow my eyes in her direction. \u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me.\u201d Millie squeals, smiling so wide that I can see all of her teeth. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll teach us a little before class tonight?\u201d</p><p>Millie has her hands pressed together under her chin. Tia is watching me with that hopeful look in her eye. She\u2019s had a thing for Jack Ewing since last year. My resolve falters. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>That letter is still in my English textbook. I haven\u2019t looked at the book since class, and now I\u2019m acting like it\u2019s been possessed by a poltergeist. I hid the textbook in my closet under all my clothes, trying to forget about it. I don\u2019t want the letter to touch anything else, but I can\u2019t bring myself to throw it away. My brother is a total ass, but he found me. It means something\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them. It still stings that they didn\u2019t take my side, that they didn\u2019t defend me, but I don\u2019t wish them harm.</p><p>But the thing is, if I open that letter and find out what\u2019s going on then I\u2019ll be starting over again. I don\u2019t think I can manage the pain that goes with it. I don\u2019t want to rehash things. I don\u2019t want to tell them why I ran. I just want that part of my life to be over, but it\u2019s not. It seems as though it\u2019ll never end because it keeps popping up unbidden and unwelcome. Plus, my asshole ex-boyfriend was my brother\u2019s best friend. I don\u2019t know if he still is, but I don\u2019t want to reestablish any connection with him at all. All of them are dead to me. That entire life was burned to ash when I walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My phone chirps, pulling me away from my thoughts. I look down at the screen. It\u2019s Peter.</p><p>Meet me at the gym at 6:15. I found a new move we can try.</p><p>I write back, We r talking about dancing, right?</p> <p>Lol. There is absolutely no coffee involved.</p><p>That makes me laugh. I punch in, Fine. I\u2019ll be there. C u later.</p><p>So much for some down time. It\u2019s already getting late. I told Millie that I\u2019d show her and Tia some basics before club. They\u2019re waiting for me downstairs. I\u2019m wearing yoga pants and my hair is pulled into a messy ponytail. I\u2019m not wearing make-up. In other words, I look as if I just rolled out of bed. I pad downstairs in my socks, with my dress shoes in hand.</p><p>Millie got the dorm director to give us the big living room so we won\u2019t kick each other quite so much. Based on last week\u2019s dancing, most of the club still needs shin guards.</p><p>I walk into the living room, not really paying attention. When I glance up, I stop in my tracks, and my eyes go wide. There are more than two girls standing waiting. There are more than twenty. \u201cMillie!\u201d I whip my head from side to side, looking for her.</p> <p>Millie appears in front of me. She\u2019s grinning like she won the Miss America pageant. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was just me, you, and Tia,\u201d I hiss at her.</p><p>She realizes I\u2019m upset. \u201cWhat? Bigger isn\u2019t better? I thought more girls meant the club would attract more guys. And that\u2019s not a bad thing, right? Maybe we can find some closet swing dancers so you don\u2019t have to dance with Dr. Granz all the time.\u201d She winks at me. I stare at her with my mouth hanging open. I wonder what she meant by that, but I don\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cYou still suck.\u201d Millie smiles. Somehow telling Millie that she sucks has become tantamount to telling her that I\u2019ll do something.</p><p>She hugs me. I stiffen in her arms. \u201cSorry! I forgot about the no hugging thing.\u201d She holds up her hand and fist bumps me. I roll my eyes as she skips across to the front of the room and introduces me.</p><p>When I met Millie, she was a hugger. She hugged over everything. I didn\u2019t. We came to an agreement that hugs are reserved for prolonged partings and death. That\u2019s it. At least, I thought that was our agreement. It seems like she\u2019s figured out how to steal hugs more frequently. Millie\u2019s turned into a hit and run hugger. I don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t just give up on me.</p> <p>Millie has gotten everyone\u2019s attention and is explaining the Swing Dance club, and how hard it is to get something new going. She tells them the basics and about the meeting later tonight, and then introduces me. \u201cSidney is so awesome at this. You\u2019ll have to come to club later and see her dance. I swear to God, you\u2019ll think she\u2019s amazing. So come on out! And I\u2019ll make sure we get enough guys there to make it worth dressing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dress up?\u201d someone asks. It\u2019s Jen. She\u2019s an Asian girl with tan skin and silky black hair.</p><p>Millie explains swing clothes, and tells them that they probably already have a lot of that stuff in their closet, while I put my shoes on. I look so stupid. I\u2019m wearing T-straps with yoga pants. I look really weird. At least there aren\u2019t any guys here. It\u2019s the only benefit of an all-girls dorm.</p><p>After Millie\u2019s done, she says, \u201cAll yours.\u201d</p><p>Nerves tickle up and down my arms. Hysterical laughter wants to burst from my mouth. I hate public speaking. Millie really sucks. My gaze shifts her way. Apparently Millie can read my mind, because she sticks out her tongue and then grins like a sadistic monkey.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you\u2019ve been brought here against your will, blink twice.\u201d I\u2019m joking, but a few girls blink. \u201cDamn, I was kidding.\u201d A few people laugh and I realize that they\u2019re nervous, too. \u201cI know how you feel, because I was under the impression that there\u2019d be less people here, but let\u2019s make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>Millie cuts in, \u201cYeah, I kinda said we\u2019d only have a few people, but when they found out it would just be a few girls, I ended up with more people than I thought. But I have to tell you\u2014swing dancing is really fun. It\u2019s a great way to exercise - thrilling and sexy all rolled into one. Dancing is a way to get to know a guy, and I mean really get to know a guy. Everything from the way he leads you around the floor to the way he spins you, says something about him. I learned a lot about Brent after we finally stopped kicking each other.\u201d She laughs. A few girls smile at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about throws?\u201d someone asks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen stuff where the girl gets tossed into the air.\u201d</p> <p>I answer, \u201cThe throws are like riding a roller coaster without a seatbelt. Once you get the basics down, the club will move into more advanced stuff. Pe... Dr. Granz and I usually show off some advanced moves at the beginning of club. It helps you see what you\u2019re aiming to do. If that kind of thing appeals to you, we can work up to it.\u201d</p><p>After that, we get into the basics. I have the girls line up and start showing them how to count off the steps. That\u2019s all we do. For about half an hour we count and rock-step our way around the room. Toward the end of the class\u2014or whatever it is I\u2019m doing\u2014girls pair off. They\u2019re pretty much kicking each other. They look up at me like I taught them wrong.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working!\u201d Tia says as she kicks Jen in the shin.</p><p>\u201cSuck!\u201d Jen curses and tries again.</p><p>Waving my hands at the front, I say loudly, \u201cYou\u2019ve been taught the girl part. The assumption is that you\u2019ll be dancing with a guy. The guy\u2019s part isn\u2019t the same as ours. That\u2019s why you\u2019re kicking the crap out of each other. Listen!\u201d I clap my hands and they all stop. \u201cLater at club, if you want to dance with your friend, one of you needs to reverse your moves. And, the guy always leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sexist!\u201d Someone calls out from the back of the room.</p><p>I smirk. \u201cYes, it is. And you need to make sure you dance with a guy later. The concept is one thing. Doing it in action is another.\u201d I\u2019m a control freak, but dancing is different. It\u2019s a place to let someone else lead for a while. I wave and tell them that I\u2019ll see them later.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>I have just enough time to go upstairs and change before I see Peter. I run up the staircase and grab my stuff. After showering quickly, I twist my hair up into a high, sleek ponytail. Then I grab a sundress I found in a thrift shop. It\u2019s dark blue with buttons down the front. The V-neckline makes me look stacked. I\u2019m not sure what I think about that part, but it fit so well and the skirt was perfect for this. I wonder if I should change\u2014my cleavage is a bit much\u2014but I\u2019m running late. Besides, it\u2019s nothing worse than what the other girls wear. I just don\u2019t usually wear stuff this revealing.</p><p>I pull on a pair of bike shorts under my dress, and then put the T-straps back on. After swiping some mascara on my eyelashes, I look in the mirror. My cheeks are rosy. I don\u2019t have that listlessness about me anymore. I\u2019m smiling. I don\u2019t even think about it, but I\u2019m grinning, and I know it\u2019s because of Peter. Part of me is glad that things never progressed the night we met. He\u2019s turned into a great friend. I\u2019m not sure if that would have happened if I slept with him. Well, okay, let\u2019s be honest. We wouldn\u2019t have been friends at all. Peter would have been an awkward acquaintance that I avoided like the plague.</p><p>As I leave my room, I bump into Tia. She\u2019s wearing a robe and her hair is wrapped in a towel. She\u2019s walking back to her room from the showers. \u201cHey, you heading over there already?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, Dr. Granz wanted to go over a move with me before you guys show up.\u201d</p><p>Tia\u2019s eyes dart to the side. She glances up and down the hallway and then leans in. \u201cIs there anything going on with you two?\u201d</p><p>I jerk away like she hit me with an iron. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sidney, but I had to ask. People have been saying how hot Dr. Granz is and how much time you guys spend together. Someone said they saw you guys at the library, and then eating at the swank place across town.\u201d She shrugs her shoulders. \u201cI told them they were crazy, that you wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you asked me anyway.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYou\u2019re going to meet him early, to practice a dance that you said is sexual.\u201d</p><p>I sigh way too loud. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was talking about you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s sexual for us and not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d I don\u2019t have time for this and I can\u2019t understand why people keep saying it. \u201cYou can dance with your brother, right? There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your brother, Sid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m not sleeping with him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d I\u2019m so irritated. I want to bite her head off. It\u2019s so hard not to. I keep locking my jaw as the conversation goes on and the weird thing is that I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so upset? So what if people think I have a crush on Peter?</p><p>But that isn\u2019t it. The crush isn\u2019t bothering me. It\u2019s innuendo, the broken propriety, and it\u2019ll get Peter in trouble. I don\u2019t want anyone questioning his morality. They can question mine. I\u2019d wave my hand in the air and say that I\u2019m a moral deviant to keep the attention off of Peter. Maybe I should do that.</p><p>My eyes flick up to Tia\u2019s face. I lean in, feeling the lie on my lips. Tia mirrors me and gets closer. \u201cI have a crush on him, okay. But he doesn\u2019t encourage it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re together a lot. I\u2019m stalking him.\u201d</p><p>She clasps her hands together under her chin and squeals. It sounds like someone stepped on a pig. The noise keeps going, getting higher and higher. I try to smile and bounce up and down the same way she is. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell a soul. But this is so exciting. He\u2019s so much older! Oh, and since it\u2019s totally forbidden, it\u2019s insanely hot. I can\u2019t wait to see what this guy looks like.\u201d</p><p>I shush her. \u201cKeep it down. I didn\u2019t even tell Millie. Don\u2019t say anything, okay. If things look weird, it\u2019s my fault. Listen, I have to run. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d I glance at my watch and then dart down the hallway before she can say anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Peter. Put the moves on me,\u201d I say as I walk across the old gym. I realize I\u2019m flirting and feel a bit silly for a second. I\u2019m not sure where it came from. When I saw him, I just wanted to tease him and have that banter I\u2019ve grown accustomed to when Peter is around.</p><p>Peter is sitting in the bleachers, watching something on his phone. He looks up when I speak. \u201cColleli. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to take care of something. I\u2019m here now. What\u2019s this new dance you wanted to show me?\u201d I sit next to him and look down at his phone. It\u2019s a couple dancing, doing the usual steps, twists, spins, and throws. It\u2019s a pretty good routine, actually.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the throw at the end. I can\u2019t figure it out and I haven\u2019t seen it before. Watch.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes slip over and rest on the side of my face for a moment before returning to the screen. My lips part as the couple gets to the end of the song. They\u2019re really good. I gasp when they perform a death spiral. The woman\u2019s head comes so close to the floor.</p><p>I start to ask if that\u2019s what he wanted to show me, but Peter says, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. Keep watching.\u201d</p><p>I watch. As the music crescendos, the dancers pull out all the stops. The last move is hypnotic. The woman is in the guy\u2019s arms and then he flings her out. It resembles a variation of the Hustle, but then they do something and she\u2019s suddenly airborne. The guy catches her as she twists in the air. They swoop down together and he holds her in a bow. Both dancers smile and the video stops.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d I blink like I didn\u2019t just see that.</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Peter says, looking baffled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell was that? I mean, I\u2019ve seen a lot of crazy dances, but that looked awesome. I\u2019m not even sure what they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I. That\u2019s why I wanted to show you. I\u2019ve seen plenty of moves, too. This one is a variation of other stuff, kind of mashed together. That dip at the end looked like a modified death spiral.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him. \u201cYou realize this could be fake, right? I mean, how did she get that kind of height? He didn\u2019t seem to throw her, and she didn\u2019t jump.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not. This is a dance studio in New York. It\u2019s the video to used attract new students, so it shouldn\u2019t be fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay the end again.\u201d Peter rewinds the dance and plays it again. We both stare at it, trying to figure out what they did. Part of the problem is that the camera is at a bad angle. I can\u2019t see their hands right before the lift. I shake my head and point at the screen, saying as much to Peter.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was hoping we could figure it out.\u201d I give him a look that says, hell no. \u201cWhat? No spirals?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything with you where my head gets that close to the floor, so no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I thought if you were okay with throws, you\u2019d be okay with this.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and glance at the yellow wooden floor and think about getting my face ripped off if he drops me mid-spin. \u201cNo. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way?\u201d he\u2019s smiling. \u201cWell, now we have to do it.\u201d Peter takes my hands and pulls me up off the bleachers.</p><p>I laugh and tug away from him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know how to do it. You can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like you\u2019re never serious.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYeah, that too.\u201d Peter folds his arms over his chest. He\u2019s wearing his white dress shirt, but removed the tie. Dark slacks cling to his narrow hips and those saddle shoes are on his feet. Dark hair hangs in his eyes. \u201cNo dips? No head dives?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I gave you a helmet?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes sparkle a little too much. He\u2019s teasing me.</p><p>\u201cThen I would definitely say no. The helmet means you expect my head to collide with the floor. Besides, it\u2019ll ruin my awesome outfit.\u201d I hold onto the hem of my dress and pull it out as if I\u2019m going to curtsey.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says, walking toward me. Peter slips his hands around my waist and music clicks on. He starts dancing, pulling me along with him. \u201cThen, there is a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of no is confusing you? I thought you were an English teacher. You seriously have issues with this?\u201d I\u2019m smiling. I love teasing him. Peter\u2019s face lights up and he teases right back.</p><p>\u201cFirst you said no, then you said defiantly no. So, I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s wiggle room.\u201d He grins and pulls my wrist. We both spin, and then I follow his lead and shoot out from him. Peter tugs me back and I twirl into his chest and the dance resumes.</p><p>My breathing is harder. The dance is getting faster. \u201cWe\u2019re not wiggling anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019d look cute in a helmet. I have a pink one with a red bow on top.\u201d I stop dancing and try to stand there and stare at him, but Peter doesn\u2019t let me. \u201cNo stopping, Colleli.\u201d He snaps my wrist and pulls me to his chest. Damn, he smells good.</p><p>We swirl around the gym, talking, teasing. The subject rolls over a million different topics. Then, he asks, \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>The smile slips off my face. My face is covered in a sweaty sheen and my dress is stuck to my body. I look into his eyes. They\u2019re locked on mine, waiting for an answer to a question that I thought he\u2019d never ask. \u201cI... don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and looks down at his feet. When he looks up again, I feel horrible. It\u2019s as though that was the worst thing I could have possibly said to him. \u201cThat\u2019s something I hope for.\u201d He rubs the toe of his shoe against the gym floor. His shirt is wrinkled, stuck to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I breathe. It seems so pointless. Why would it even matter?</p><p>He smiles sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I shouldn\u2019t have asked you something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything.\u201d I look down at my hands. They\u2019re together and I\u2019m twisting my index finger. \u201cI guess, I do trust you to some degree, probably more than I trust anyone else, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I was asking?\u201d He\u2019s so close. Peter stepped into the space between us. He\u2019s looking down into my face, watching me so closely. It makes me shiver.</p><p>\u201cI thought you meant, do I implicitly trust you with my life. With a throw like that. With anything and everything.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ll never trust anyone that way again.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re an enigma.\u201d</p><p>The corner of my mouth lifts. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust, but you don\u2019t. You let me in, but you keep me out.\u201d The way he\u2019s looking at me makes me nervous. Peter\u2019s gaze is so intense, so raw and vulnerable. Maybe I should have lied? No, he can see through me. He doesn\u2019t need dancing for that. Peter holds up his hands. I take them and he leads me across the room in a slower waltz so I can catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d I ask as Peter leads us across the room. He nods. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to dance?\u201d</p><p>A shadow creeps over his face and his smile disappears. \u201cGina. My girlfriend. I keep calling her my fianc\u00e9, but she wasn\u2019t.\u201d He swallows hard and lets out a rush of air. We turn around the floor as he speaks. \u201cShe liked to dance. I sucked at it. She taught me.\u201d He smiles sadly.</p><p>\u201cShe taught you well.\u201d</p><p>He nods and a fake smile lines his lips. I can tell that he\u2019s chasing away old memories with a broom. Peter\u2019s gone silent. We dance. He spins me slowly. My dress flares out around my knees. He watches the fabric flutter before pulling me back into position. \u201cWhat about you? Who taught you to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m self-taught for the most part. I don\u2019t really know what anything is called. We talked my gym teacher into doing a unit on dance in high school. Weird but true. Way better than volleyball again. I can only get hit in the face so many times a day.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cVolleyball\u2019s not your thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoordination\u2019s not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re dancing.\u201d</p><p>I smile up at him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re leading. It\u2019s different. For one, there are no balls.\u201d My face flames red when I realize what I just said.</p><p>Peter chuckles and shakes his head. \u201cWell, I might disagree, but since we\u2019re not playing with them, I\u2019ll just pretend you didn\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh, but I can\u2019t help it. I try to pull my hands away and slap him, but Peter grips me tighter. The playful smile slips off my face when he holds me that way. We stop moving and stare at each other. My lips are parted. There was something I was going to say.</p><p>Peter looks down at me, his face so close to mine. His breath tickles my lips as he breathes. I want to lean into him. I want his arms around me. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. When time stops like this, Peter looks lost. His entire body tenses and relaxes at the same time. I wish he\u2019d do something, say something.</p><p>All the air is being forced out of my lungs. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he breathes, still watching me. His eyes flick back and forth between mine. His gaze doesn\u2019t dip to my lips.</p><p>A slow smile spreads across my face. \u201cLiar.\u201d I lean in closer and press my forehead against his. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands find my cheeks and then slip back into my hair. He holds me for a second and breathes, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter...\u201d his gaze lifts. I feel like he punched me in the stomach. There\u2019s so much there, so much pain and affection and turmoil. It kills me. I can feel his agony when I look into his eyes. I take his hands and put one on my waist. \u201cDance with me. Stop thinking for a while.\u201d He nods, and says nothing.</p><p>Neither of us speaks again. Peter leads me around the floor, changing the dance as we go along. We lose track of time. It isn\u2019t until I hear Millie\u2019s loud whistle that we stop. Peter nods at me and heads to the cooler to grab a bottle of water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Millie walks over to me with her eyes bugging out of her head. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>I walk into the hallway to find the girl\u2019s room. I need to splash water on my face. \u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>Millie follows me. She grabs my arm before I can push through the bathroom door. I whirl around. \u201cYou like him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not. We were practicing something. You\u2019ll see it in a few minutes. Let me wash my face off. It\u2019s too damn hot in there.\u201d I try not to sound bitchy, but fail. I\u2019m too defensive, too fast to get out of there.</p><p>Millie opens her mouth to counter my claim and follows me into the bathroom. She looks under the stalls, and when she knows we\u2019re alone, she says, \u201cDo not do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidney, don\u2019t lie to me. Can you honestly tell me that there\u2019s nothing between you two?\u201d Her hands are on her hips. She\u2019s looking at me in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t know what you think you see, but maybe you should have your eyes checked.\u201d I splash water on my face. I have on waterproof mascara, but it\u2019ll run if I rub my eyes. I grab a paper towel and pat my face dry.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say it that way if I said you were sleeping with Dusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you\u2019re right, because I\u2019d choke on my vomit. What\u2019s with you?\u201d I turn around and lean back on the sinks. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted me to come and do this. Peter\u2019s my boss. I\u2019m his TA. And yes, I call him Peter the same way I called Dr. Tadwick, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called Dr. Anthony Tadwick, Tadwick. You never called him Tony, not to me.\u201d She looks concerned and she shouldn\u2019t be. Millie sighs and rubs the side of her head. \u201cJust don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, why do people keep saying that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidney, that\u2019s usually a pretty good sign that a big truck load of stupid is about to mow you down. Listen to your friends. Don\u2019t screw your prof. Sleep with guys your own age.\u201d She sounds like she knows everything, which pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cHow many guys have I slept with in the entire time I\u2019ve known you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know? You want an exact number?\u201d She\u2019s leaning toward the mirror, fixing her eye make-up.</p><p>\u201cJust guess. Best estimate, based on lingerie, dates, make-up, and whatever else you can think of. Tell me how many guys you think it\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment and then shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing you talk about anyone like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I talking about anyone like that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean what? Millie, what do you want from me? You set me up with guys, I tag along with you, I do every little thing you ask me to, and then I find some guy that I actually get along with and what? You\u2019re telling me to stay away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a professor, Sidney. You\u2019re going to get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? For being his friend? For not sleeping with him? For not fucking him the first day he was here? Exactly what did I do wrong, because I\u2019m not seeing it?\u201d I\u2019m yelling. I don\u2019t mean to, but I am. \u201cYou know what. Forget it. I\u2019m not talking about this with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou almost slept with him?\u201d I shake my head and put up my hands, as if it\u2019ll deaden my ears to her words. \u201cSidney, wait.\u201d She chases me out of the ladies room and down the hallway. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m leaving the gym. I feel bad about ditching Peter, but I can\u2019t do this. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall apart. I need to calm down. I slam open the doors to outside and go sit in the parking lot. I\u2019m leaning against a car, and tuck my head so no one can see my face. I breathe deeply, trying to calm down. I left my phone and everything inside.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me? Why did I flip out on her? Millie didn\u2019t say anything bad, not really. It wasn\u2019t like Dusty telling me the rumors. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me. I made the rumors worse. Damn it. I sit on the car for a while, wondering how stupid I am. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be hanging around Peter at all. It makes me sick to think about not seeing him every day, but maybe Millie\u2019s right. Maybe I should be going after guys my own age.</p><p>Am I really hung up on Peter? Is that why I haven\u2019t had a date since January? It can\u2019t be Peter. That\u2019s not it. There are plenty of guys that are hot. I should find one and start over. But why?</p><p>To be normal. To start over.</p><p>My life has been stuck on pause for way too long. No boyfriend, no dating, no swooning over some guy, wondering when I\u2019m going to see him again. Unless I count Peter.</p><p>Don\u2019t count Peter.</p><p>The night air is thick. My dress is clinging to me. I glance down and notice my cleavage is glistening. Damn it. I look all whorish. I fan myself, thinking I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s much more humid than usual, as though it might rain. Just when I think I\u2019m ready to go inside, I see someone walking toward me.</p><p>\u201cHey, if it\u2019s not the techie TA.\u201d Mark from Peter\u2019s morning English class drops a bunch of books on the hood and walks over to me. I avert my gaze. My face is on fire. I feel the blush down to my toes. Holy shit, did he see me fanning my boobs?</p><p>He scooches next to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He tries to get a glimpse of my face, but I don\u2019t let him.</p><p>I nod. \u201cFine.\u201d My voice squeaks.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAh, cuz it looks like you\u2019re not fine, all avoiding my gaze like that. And, not fine has some obligatory obligations that go with it.\u201d He\u2019s leaning on his hands, and not looking at me. The way he says it makes me smile, but I still feel stupid.</p><p>I glance up at him. \u201cObligatory obligations?\u201d</p><p>Mark nods, \u201cYeah, like tissues, totally. And maybe a ride home, \u2018cuz it would be lowly of me to make you walk.\u201d He ducks his head to the side and tries to catch my eye. I glance at him and give a weak smile. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Wait \u2018til you see the tissues. Prepare to have your mind blown.\u201d He moves around to the driver\u2019s side and comes back with a box. I thought he was kidding, but when he holds them out, I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>My jaw drops and I grab for one. \u201cWow. These are really tissues?\u201d I feel the soft tissue in my hand, but the thing is glowing. I dab my brow and my neck. My body is covered in little beads of sweat. It\u2019s so frickin\u2019 hot.</p><p>\u201cYup. I got \u2018em off the internet. The only horrible side effect is that your nose, or wherever, will glow green for a while when everyone shuts out the lights.\u201d</p><p>I stop and stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>There must be knifes shooting out of my eyeballs, because he holds up his hands and says, \u201cJust kidding, pretty lady. I just wanted to see you smile again.\u201d Mark bumps his shoulder into mine. I can\u2019t help it, I grin. \u201cThere it is. You made my night. Please sit on my car anytime you want. It\u2019s usually unlocked. Feel free to sit inside, if it\u2019s raining or what-have-you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThanks, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, babe. You want a ride somewhere?\u201d He\u2019s so sweet. The guy has been around me all semester, but this is the first time he\u2019s really talked to me. During class, I\u2019ve caught him looking my way, but I thought I imagined it. He\u2019s too cute and way too popular to be talking to me. I can see why there\u2019s always a group of people around him.</p><p>I look back at the gym. This guy is my age and he\u2019s really sweet, but...</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I need to head back in. But thanks for this.\u201d I hold up the tissues. \u201cBy the way, if my boobs glow green tonight, I\u2019m gonna hunt you down.\u201d</p><p>He laughs so hard he nearly falls off the car. \u201cTotally didn\u2019t expect that from you. But, feel free. Green boobs or not, you can hunt me down anytime.\u201d He smirks at me before ducking into his car. I watch him pull away, then head inside.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the bleachers when Peter sees me. He walks over and sits next to me. \u201cI thought you ditched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it, but I didn\u2019t want to make you look bad in front of all these kids. Millie pissed me off. Well, it\u2019s not Millie. It\u2019s everyone. They\u2019re talking.\u201d I\u2019m picking at my nails as I\u2019m speaking. When did I start telling him every little thing? I look at Peter out of the corner of my eye. He\u2019s your friend, stupid. Of course you tell him stuff.</p><p>Peter looks puzzled. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout us. I\u2019ve heard everything from you knocked me up, to you\u2019re doing me in your office, and that TA means something else entirely. Get it? T and A? Har har. It\u2019s hysterical.\u201d I make a face and watch a couple of kids trying to dance in front of us. Another couple bumps into them.</p><p>Peter gives me a strange look and then laughs. He runs his hands over his head, rumpling his hair. \u201cDamn. I finally have a platonic relationship with a woman and look where it gets me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know right? You scoundrel, you.\u201d I\u2019m leaning on my hands, with my elbows on my knees. There are more people here tonight. The music is blasting and the air is warm. Someone propped open the back door. The night air drifts in slowly and smells sweet, like honeysuckle.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019d you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told one person that I have a mad crush on you. I kind of freaked out on her a little bit when she told me what people were saying. I needed a diversion. And Millie, well, I just bit her head off. No explanation.\u201d I stare straight ahead.</p><p>Peter clears his throat. I look at him out of the corner of my eye. He\u2019s grinning. \u201cYou defended me? And what, my honor? I thought I was supposed to do that for you?\u201d</p><p>I smirk and turn toward him. Peter\u2019s face is glistening from dancing. Damn, it\u2019s hot in here. The no air conditioning thing is rough. My eyes drift to his shoulders and down his chest. Peter\u2019s shirt is sticking to his chest and is very wrinkled. He looks good. There\u2019s more color in his cheeks, more life in his eyes than when he first got here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bump him with my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a dork, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of the dancing?\u201d Peter asks, seriously, trying to figure out why people would say that about us. He looks baffled. Peter pushes his hair out of his face. It\u2019s damp and curling at the ends.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I ask and he shakes his head. I smirk at him. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re hot. There\u2019ll be rumors about anyone you talk to unless they see you dating someone, and even then... well, people are stupid. They talk even when there isn\u2019t anything to talk about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they say things like that about Tadwick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTadwick wasn\u2019t hot. You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose opinion is that?\u201d He\u2019s grinning at me. Peter bumps me with his knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the word on the street. Personally, I think you\u2019re a little too muscly and tan. I prefer my men frail and pasty. Sorry, Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter. My name is Peter. Damn, Sidney. You can\u2019t even remember my name.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile deepens and I can see a dimple on his cheek. They\u2019re so cute. He is pretty to look at. I glance at a flock of girls behind him on the bleachers. There\u2019s a pool of drool on the floor. They are all staring, their mouths gaping like Swedish Fish.</p> <p>I get up and smack Peter in the arm with the back of my hand. \u201cCome on, professor. I want to dance until I can\u2019t stand up.\u201d I bound across the room with Peter on my heels. I stop and turn suddenly. He nearly slams into me. Time freezes for a moment. The air feels hotter, the night feels electrified. Peter lifts his hand. I press my palm to his. The touch is charged. I feel it down to my toes. I grin broadly. I can\u2019t help it. And we dance.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands are always in modest places, but the way his hands slide over my skin and glide over my dress, well, it feels like he owns me\u2014like I\u2019m his to control. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve danced before, but this feeling never emerged. I danced to get away from my ex and my family. They weren\u2019t interested. It was a place to find my balance and learn to endure my life. But Peter changed that. I\u2019m no longer enduring. I\u2019m laughing, sweating, and spinning. I don\u2019t shirk away from his touch, either. That\u2019s new. When we first started dancing together, I enjoyed it\u2014I can admit that\u2014but his hands made me nervous. Now they make me comfortable. I feel stronger, better.</p><p>The music moves faster as the tempo changes. We\u2019re laughing and some of the students stop to watch us. Peter asks as we dance, \u201cReady?\u201d He wants to do a throw.</p><p>I nod. I expect him to lead into the steps, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead we step into each other and Peter spins me back and pulls me to him. I grin. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just wondering why you trust me with throws but not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath spins? I think it has something to do with the word death.\u201d I laugh. The music pulses through me. Peter winds me around him and under his arm, then he snaps me back to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI think I could convince you.\u201d He smiles down at me and twirls me across the floor. We separate for a few steps before he reaches for me again. I\u2019m back in his arms. There\u2019s a not much space between us. Peter holds me so close that we\u2019re nearly touching.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing a helmet.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so not going to throw my face at the floor.\u201d I grin at him. Peter holds up his palm and pushes on my back. I follow, moving under his arm. The music is in the right spot to lead into the aerial.</p><p>\u201cAre you holding out on me or are we doing this?\u201d</p><p>Peter yanks me close and my hips slam against his. My heart is pounding way too fast. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Peter leads me into the move, and I follow. A twist, a turn, and he pulls me hard. I roll over his back with my legs splayed. My skirt flares and I land on the floor. I duck, and Peter swings his leg over my head before he pulls me up into a twist. I slip up from between his legs, and he lifts me by the waist. I continue the move and kick. I feel the momentum as I swing upward. I\u2019m smiling way too big. My stomach has that free-fall feeling as I come rushing back down.</p><p>Peter executes the move perfectly and my legs fly around his waist. His hands cradle my back as dips me backward. The music stops. We\u2019re both breathing hard. The silence becomes more noticeable. Peter holds me for a moment. The club starts clapping and Peter sets me down. He nods at me, as if it was a demonstration. Then, he goes into safety issues with those kinds of moves and invites the more advanced dancers to learn some of the steps we just did.</p> <p>A girl walks up to Peter. He holds out his hand and dances with her. That\u2019s when I realize that sharing isn\u2019t my thing. Peter looks beautiful, all rumpled and smelling like heaven. Stuffing my nail-clawing instincts back into the crazy part of my brain, I grab a bottle of water from the cooler. I watch him show a few girls the moves in slow motion. There are some guys there, too. He shows them where to put their hands and how to lead the steps.</p><p>I guzzle my water and walk the perimeter of the room, trying to cool off. After a while, I head toward the open door. The night breeze feels good on my skin. I step outside. The sky is deep indigo, like a bottle of ink. There\u2019s a speckling of stars tonight. I lean against the cool brick wall, feeling the rough stones through the thin fabric of my dress.</p><p>A few moments later, Peter comes out. \u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nods and heads back inside.</p><p>I\u2019m standing there for a while, cooling off, when Tia strolls out. \u201cHey, that was so kick ass. Where the hell did you learn to dance like that?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If you want something bad enough, you learn how. I thought it\u2019d be fun, so I figured it out.\u201d I shrug and take a drink from the bottle. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as hard as it seems.\u201d</p><p>She nods and takes a drink from her own bottle. \u201cEvery time I think I\u2019m in shape, I find out that I\u2019m not. God, and no wonder why everyone is saying Granz is hot. He is a da-ahm fine piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s got a great ass.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t realize what time it is. I don\u2019t realize that anyone is behind me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Colleli,\u201d Peter says, tossing me my stuff. It smacks me in the stomach, but I catch it. \u201cAnd all this time I thought you were saying I was an ass. My mistake.\u201d</p><p>My face turns red and my eyes go wide. Peter doesn\u2019t stop walking. He keeps going, heading toward the parking lot. I shove Tia lightly. She\u2019s laughing at me. \u201cYou suck,\u201d I hiss. \u201cYou knew he was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. It was perfect. I had to.\u201d She\u2019s laughing, guzzling water from her bottle, nearly choking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you back. Just wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and try!\u201d Tia yells, as I sprint across the parking lot toward Peter\u2019s car.</p><p>I duck inside, out of breathe. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d I feel the need to clarify as I click my seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, I mean, besides the comment about my super-fine ass.\u201d He laughs and looks over at me. \u201cI can\u2019t figure you out. You act like we\u2019re friends, and that\u2019s it\u2014then, you go and do stuff like that. You\u2019re baffling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaffling? No, I think you\u2019ve got the wrong word. I\u2019m...\u201d my eyes cut to Peter, as he pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road. I slump back into my seat and let out a rush of air. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am. A train wreck. A mess. Damaged goods. Pick one. Or all three.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re a hot mess, an enigma, a poem\u2014all raw emotion with nothing held back.\u201d</p><p>I blurt out a laugh, because he couldn\u2019t be more wrong. \u201cWith nothing held back? I hold everything back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re clear as crystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I know that I\u2019m right. You do that a lot, you know?\u201d I look at him. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Apparently, he can tell that I don\u2019t follow. \u201cYou talk that way when I get too close to the truth. You get defensive and call me names. It means that I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could just mean that I think you\u2019re an ass, and nothing more.\u201d I\u2019m about to say I told you so when Peter glances at me. From the look on his face, I can tell he\u2019s not going to let it drop.</p><p>\u201cAre you attracted to me, Sidney?\u201d</p><p>The question makes my stomach jump up my throat. I can\u2019t look at him. I feel my face getting hot, along with the rest of me. I manage to blurt out, \u201cWhat the hell? Who asks that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, I did. Are you attracted to me? It\u2019s a simple question.\u201d Peter glances at me, and then back at the road.</p><p>Thank God it\u2019s dark. I\u2019m pretty sure my face has exploded into flames. I want to tell him that he\u2019s a bad, bad, man but that sounds too juvenile, so I say, \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk!\u201d I cover my face with my hand and look out the window. My pulse is roaring in my ears. I feel Peter\u2019s gaze slip over my neck for a moment. Why does he do this to me? So what if I think he\u2019s hot? It\u2019s not as though we can do anything. It doesn\u2019t matter. But still, I\u2019d rather not say it.</p><p>\u201cWell, that looks like a yes. Should I tell you what I think of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I mumble, still looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d He\u2019s grinning, driving into the darkness to the restaurant on the other side of town.</p><p>I expect him to continue teasing me, but he doesn\u2019t say anything else. The silence spans between us and my mind latches onto the last thing he said. Now, I really want to know what he thinks of me. I can\u2019t believe he can sit there quietly and not tell me. I flick my eyes toward him. Peter is still driving with that infuriatingly sexy grin on his face, as if he knows exactly what he did.</p><p>I stare at the night sky and wonder why that question bothered me so much. Of course I\u2019m attracted to him. Of course he already knows that. We nearly slept together. But that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s not what he knows that scares me. It\u2019s what he doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019m attached to him. Given the choice to hang out with Peter or Millie, I\u2019d choose Peter. He understands me better. He\u2019s become my best friend. It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s my boss or my teacher. I feel comfortable around him. I\u2019ve grown accustomed to his voice, his face. Every time Peter steps into the room, every time he swings me around in his arms, I feel peace\u2014no it\u2019s beyond that\u2014I feel happy. My stomach sinks as I wonder what that means. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think I know.</p><p>I glance at Peter. I\u2019m staring at the side of his face, drinking in the stubble along his jaw and the way his dark hair curls by his ears. His skin is so perfect, and his eyes\u2014oh God\u2014his eyes are like gemstones. When I look at them, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m lost in a beautiful blue cavern covered in sparkling sapphires. And for once in my life, I feel safe. I don\u2019t worry about him hurting me, or touching me, or forcing me.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize how long I\u2019m watching him until Peter turns and looks at me. He smiles softly and it feels like I\u2019m in a free-fall. My stomach floats up to my mouth and I can\u2019t speak.</p> <p>Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. My eyes are a little too wide when I look back out the windshield. My brain is chanting no, over and over again, as if it will erase the discovery my mind just made. My heart laughs. As if these things can be undone, as if it\u2019s possible to fall out of love as easily as it is to fall in love.</p><p>I love him? That can\u2019t be.</p><p>I deny it. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. It can\u2019t be. I don\u2019t love him. That\u2019s insane. I don\u2019t even know him.</p><p>But you do, that sweet reassuring voice says in the back of my head. I beat her with a broom and stuff her in a closet. She\u2019s usually the sane voice in my mind. I would have sworn that she is my reason, but that was not reasonable. I don\u2019t know Peter, not like that. I don\u2019t want to. I can\u2019t\u2014</p><p>My frantic thoughts get cut off when Peter pulls into the parking lot. I\u2019m panicking. Things aren\u2019t the same as they were two seconds ago. I realized that I have feelings for the guy sitting next to me. Maybe I\u2019m dense as a dinosaur for not noticing\u2014damn, everyone else noticed\u2014but I don\u2019t know what to do now. Act the same? Pretend the thought never crossed my mind?</p> <p>I take too long to get out of the car. Peter walks around to open my door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, as he offers his hand and pulls me up from my seat. Peter\u2019s looking down at me with those eyes. I forget to breathe.</p><p>He stands too close. I step away, and back into the car. Peter steps closer, closing the gap. He\u2019s close enough to touch me, but he doesn\u2019t. His eyes sweep over me before he asks, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I think?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head slowly, careful to avoid his gaze, and tuck a piece of hair behind my ear. \u201cNo.\u201d My voice is too soft. Damn it. It sounds like a yes. I clear my throat and try again. I have to look up. I know I have to do it. Just say it. Spit it out as if it doesn\u2019t matter, because once he tells me what he thinks, I won\u2019t be able to let it go. I don\u2019t want things to change. What we have is good.</p><p>Looking directly into his eyes, I smile and say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what you think. I don\u2019t feel that way about you.\u201d The lie burns my tongue.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t back away. Instead, Peter stays there, watching me. He leans close to my ear, and says, \u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful, and that sharp tongue of yours.... God, I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss a woman so much in my life. I will kiss you tonight. I won\u2019t be able to help myself.\u201d I shiver as he speaks. When Peter pulls away, my body is tense. My spine is stiff and my head is spinning like I\u2019m falling down a rabbit hole.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I\u2019m watching him, barely breathing. My eyes are locked on his lips, wondering if he\u2019ll really do it.</p><p>Peter runs his hand along my cheek; his eyes are on my mouth. \u201cThen, don\u2019t say anything.\u201d He turns and walks away. He\u2019s crossing the parking lot. I stand there, watching him head inside. When he pulls the door open, he looks back at me. \u201cComing, Colleli?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s screwing with me. He has to be messing with me. I blow off everything he just did and walk confidently across the parking lot. Screw him. Two can at play this game.</p><p>Peter\u2019s holding the door open. I turn to the side as I pass him, sucking in air. We\u2019re too close. I do it on purpose. My chest barely brushes against his as I pass. The sensation shoots way too many tingles through me, but I know he feels it, too. The way he stops breathing and looks up tells me that it was completely unexpected.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, way too breathily, before stepping away. Peter\u2019s lips are parted. His shoulders are back, rigid. I turn toward the hostess station with a wicked grin. Peter is still sucking in air like he\u2019s been kicked in the stomach. \u201cTable for two, please.\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly moves and steps toward me. I feel the heat from his body against my back. He whispers in my ear, \u201cThat was evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it,\u201d I say over my shoulder, smiling.</p><p>We follow the hostess to the same table we always sit at. It\u2019s our table. How did that happen? Peter steps in front of the girl and pulls out my chair and I sit down. The hostess stands there, waiting to hand us menus. Peter pushes me toward the table gently, and then takes his seat opposite me. His eyes glitter with mirth. He has a smug half grin on his face. For a brief second, his eyes drop to my lips. It makes me squirm in my chair. I can\u2019t believe he said that before. He was teasing me. He had to be.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d My voice catches in my throat.</p><p>The way he\u2019s looking at me, as if he wants to kiss me until my knees give out and I fall into his arms, makes me flustered. I don\u2019t understand him. We\u2019ve been hanging around each other since he arrived. Aside from the first night, Peter hasn\u2019t overtly done anything. Has he? I suddenly feel stupid. What if all the flirting was real? I assumed it wasn\u2019t. I thought he was teasing. Is Peter crazy enough to try and be with me, even if it costs him his job? He\u2019s a new teacher. That would be incredibly stupid, damning the rest of his career. So what is he thinking? I have no idea.</p><p>I start to open my mouth to tell him that we can\u2019t do anything like that\u2014no kissing, no nothing\u2014when I see her walk past the fireplace. Dr. Strictland\u2019s face lights up when she sees Peter. \u201cDr. Granz, Miss Colleli. What a pleasant surprise.\u201d She\u2019s wearing a rich crimson suit that makes her hair look Annie orange.</p><p>\u201cCyianna,\u201d Peter says, \u201chow nice to see you. Won\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, I came in here to grab a dinner and go over some papers for my graduate students.\u201d She smiles at us and then looks at me. \u201cI heard you were assisting the new dancing club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. We were just there. Dr. Granz is the sponsor.\u201d</p><p>She looks at both of us. \u201cI see.\u201d She says it as though she really sees something. Strictland looks back at Peter. \u201cYou know what; I think I will join you. I\u2019ve worked hard enough and it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d The hostess brings another chair and Dr. Strictland sits down next to me. She pats my knee and I nearly jump out of my seat. She gives me a funny look. \u201cSorry, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I lie. I hate being touched. My gaze lifts. There\u2019s an exception to that rule. Peter somehow got around it. I smile nervously, wondering if we\u2019re going to get in trouble, but Strictland doesn\u2019t say anything about us being here together.</p><p>The meal progresses normally. We all know each other. The subject matter flips between the university, the department, classes, and then to literature.</p><p>Just when I think Strictland\u2019s not going to mention it, she does. \u201cI hate to ruin a friendship or make things awkward between the two of you, but certain things have come to my attention.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles and shakes his head, \u201cCyianna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I know you well enough to realize that you won\u2019t do anything stupid. But you\u2019re young and Miss Colleli is younger. You both have roles to play, expectations to fulfill. Friendship is encouraged, but nothing more. I only see friendship here, and for both of your sakes, I hope it stays that way.</p><p>\u201cSidney, I don\u2019t need to remind you about your scholarship. The university will not pay you to retake classes due to sexual indiscretion.\u201d Oh my God. Did she just say that? My face burns. I manage to nod. \u201cAnd Peter, you already know the severity of this. I hope I won\u2019t have to mention it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to mention it now,\u201d Peter says evenly.</p><p>Strictland watches him for a moment. She pats her napkin to her lips and places it on her plate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through more than most people, Peter. I consider myself a fair person. Let me be blunt. This arrangement that you have with your student looks wrong. You were dancing with her and then took her for dinner at one of the nicest establishments in town. According the hostess, they have seen the two of you here before\u2014several times. Propriety has a look and this is not it. I don\u2019t want to see or hear about anything like this again. Consider this a polite warning, Dr. Granz. I apologize for ruining your evening, but it had to be stated.\u201d She stands, nods at us both, and then walks away.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>I glance at Peter, but he doesn\u2019t look back at me. The consequences have been spelled out. If we keep this up, we both lose everything. The lump in my throat feels like a sugar cube. It won\u2019t move. It\u2019s just stuck. I want to say something to Peter, make him smile again, but it\u2019s as though someone blew out the light in his eyes.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand the silence any more. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends, Peter. She knows that. So, we don\u2019t eat here anymore.\u201d I try to make light of it.</p><p>Peter looks up at me. His lips are parted, as though he can\u2019t believe what I just I said. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Sidney. I know you. This may be friendship, but there\u2019s more to it than that. Everyone can see it. I know you see it. I wish you\u2019d admit it. At least, then we could decide what to do together.\u201d He pauses and then shakes his head when I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cAre you so messed up that you don\u2019t even recognize your own feelings anymore?\u201d</p><p>His words feel like a slap. I stiffen and look away.</p><p>I love him. I know I love him. Those words pierce my heart. My jaw twitches. I want to say it. I want to tell him that it\u2019s so much more than he thinks, but I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019ll run. Maybe Peter\u2019s infatuated, but I\u2019m not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right that I didn\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t have a good handle on my feelings anymore. For all practical purposes, the only emotion I\u2019ve felt for the past four years has been pain. It never stops. Then, I met you.\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard. I feel my chest rise as I speak. I can\u2019t stop the torrent of words flowing out of my mouth. \u201cThings changed. Maybe I didn\u2019t recognize what I felt then, but I do now. I\u2019m a stupid girl who fell in love with her friend, and that\u2019s not even the worst part. The worst part is that I\u2019ll lose everything if I tell you. This little patch of happiness will wither and die, and it will be all my fault, because I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. I\u2019d rather have you as a friend than not at all.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s back is rigid, like someone replaced his spine with steel bar. Shocked, wide, eyes look back at me. He doesn\u2019t try to cut me off, and the more I talk, the worse he looks. By the time I finally shut up, Peter looks as if he\u2019s been hit on the side of the head with a board. The only response is a shocked blink.</p><p>Screw it. I\u2019m not sitting here waiting for him to reject me. I jump up from the table and walk toward the ladies room. I feel tears building behind my eyes. I barely make it up the staircase and push open the door before big wet tears roll down my cheeks. Clutching the counter, I look up into the mirror. Calm down. I hear that little voice speaking softly inside my head.</p> <p>\u201cI ruined everything.\u201d I clutch my face and sob into my hands. I don\u2019t want to be alone. I need him, and telling Peter how I feel was the stupidest thing I could have done. Strictland said our friendship was over the line, so I tell him that I love him. What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>I twist on the faucet and splash some water on my face. My crying slows, but my face still feels hot and puffy. When I go back downstairs, I need to act like I\u2019m fine no matter how I feel inside. I need some fresh air, just for a second.</p><p>I walk over to the small window and yank the string for the blinds. They pull up quickly and I tug on the window, opening it. My vision is blurry and it\u2019s dark, so I don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s a squirrel clinging to the outside of the window. When I throw it open, the little beast starts to slip. His nails are lodged into the wooden frame, but the rapid movement when I slide the window open knocks him loose. His nails screech as he slides down the glass.</p><p>I watch for a moment and realize that it can\u2019t get a grip. We\u2019re on the second floor. A strange impulse pounds through me. He\u2019s going to fall. It\u2019ll be my fault. I can\u2019t be a squirrel killer.</p><p>I shriek and stomp my feet\u2014as if that will help\u2014and shove my arms out the window to try and catch the little creature. The squirrel falls into my hands. My heart is about to explode. When the squirrel touches me, my brain shoots warning message and before I realize what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m yanking my hands back inside. The squirrel clings to my arm.</p> <p>I scream like someone is killing me and hop up and down, trying to get him to let go. When that doesn\u2019t work, I scream louder and spin in circles, whipping around as fast as I can, hoping the squirrel flies off. I only stop when he slides down my arm and his claws run out of skin to grab. I watch the animal sail across the room and smack into the wall.</p><p>At the same time that happens, the bathroom door flies open. Peter is standing there, ready to punch someone when a frightened squirrel darts between his legs. Peter glances down, surprised. He turns on his heel and watches it run down the hall. Screams erupt a moment later.</p><p>Peter looks up at me. I\u2019m holding my clawed arm with my hand. My bottom lip quivers and sobs bubble up from inside of me. I can\u2019t stop crying. I feel so stupid, so incredibly foolish. Peter walks to me, smiling and pulls me into his arms. For a moment, he just holds me. His fingers tangle in my hair and he keeps me tightly nuzzled to his chest.</p><p>When Peter lets go, he looks down at my arm. The scratches aren\u2019t deep. \u201cDid it bite you?\u201d I shake my head and wipe the tears away. Peter is trying so hard not to smile. \u201cWhat happened? Were you guys fighting over a stall?\u201d</p><p>Tears are still in my eyes, but the smile on his face makes me smile, too. I thump my fist into his chest. \u201cWe weren\u2019t fighting over a stall! I opened the window to get some air. There was a squirrel. When I pulled the window open, I thought he was going to die, so I caught him... and then I freaked out a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Peter tries not to smile. He tries to keep a straight face and not laugh, but he\u2019s doing a terrible job. He takes my head between his hands and looks me in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re all right? No rabies? No serial killer squirrels hiding in one of the stalls?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up. You would have screamed, too.\u201d I twist out of his grip and swipe at him.</p><p>Peter laughs, really laughs. It shakes his whole body and tears form in his eyes. He rubs the heel of his hand over his eyes and says, \u201cI would have. No doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you laughing?\u201d I\u2019m pouting. I don\u2019t mean to, but I\u2019m an emotional lunatic. We hear someone scream and then a crash. They still haven\u2019t caught the little beast. Damn squirrel.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is the kind of thing that would only happen to you. You\u2019re at the best restaurant in town and get attacked by a squirrel.\u201d He starts laughing again.</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest; the impulse to laugh with him is too strong. I smirk, saying, \u201cWhen we retell it, let\u2019s just say it was a bear.\u201d</p><p>That makes him laugh harder. The two of us stand in the ladies room way too long, leaning into each other and laughing. By the time we go to leave, my ribs hurt from giggling so much.</p><p>The restaurant apologizes over and over again. They hate that I was attacked by a rodent in their bathroom. They comp our meal, and give us a ton of gift cards so we\u2019ll come back. The manager is worried that we\u2019ll tell everyone that they have animal problems, even though I have no intention of mentioning this to anyone for as long as I live.</p><p>Peter and I return to his car. On the way back to the dorm, he asks me if I have stuff to take care of my cuts. I don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI have a first aid kit at my place. Let\u2019s patch you up and then I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour place?\u201d I ask, and glance over at him. He still hasn\u2019t said anything about my, I fell in love with my best friend thing. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll never mention it again. I feel stupid enough as it is. I tease, \u201cYou\u2019re not asking me up for coffee again, are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNo, but you can\u2019t leave that cut untreated. You\u2019ll grow a tail or something. Besides, it\u2019s on the way to your dorm.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I go to his place. I don\u2019t realize what will happen. I don\u2019t realize any of it.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cThe scrape looks superficial,\u201d Peter says, holding my arm and examining the cuts gently. There are nine angry red pin-sized scrapes down one arm. We are sitting in his bathroom. The medicine cabinet is open. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been in his house since the night I met him. Everything is put away now. Peter is very neat. I\u2019m shocked that he even has a kit like this.</p><p>I still feel silly. Who gets attacked by small wildlife creatures? I\u2019m the antithesis of Snow White. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if I didn\u2019t scream like a lunatic and launch the squirrel at the wall. I freaked out on his little ass.\u201d</p><p>Peter is grinning when looks up at me. \u201cYes, you did. I heard you yelling in the dining room. By the time I threw the door open, I was sure someone was killing you. Then, I see you launch a small animal across the room.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI have the shower scene from Psycho in my head, except Norman Bates is a squirrel. You better watch your step. When he gets out of that restaurant, he\u2019s gonna tell all his buddies.\u201d Peter\u2019s shoulders are shaking. He\u2019s trying so hard not to laugh.</p><p>I\u2019m grinning. Norman the Squirrel with his little knife is kind of funny. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still. Odds are this\u2019ll sting like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo bitches really stin\u2014\u201d I stop asking stupid questions and let out a slew of swear words. \u201cWhat the hell is that? Acid?\u201d I rip my arm away. My skin burns as if he set it on fire.</p><p>Peter reaches for my hand and yanks it back out. \u201cBaby.\u201d He holds a bottle of stuff over my arm again. There\u2019s a towel under my elbow. The liquid runs down my arm and onto the towel.</p><p>Peter pours it quickly, again. My body tenses and I grit my teeth. I\u2019m ready for it this time. My jaw locks, but I nearly fall over when Peter lowers his head and blows on the bubbling cuts. His pink lips are pursed and he blows on my skin. The gentle rush of air chases away the sharp burn and makes my skin cold. I forget to lock my jaw. I\u2019m still tense, but the reason has changed. Peter doesn\u2019t seem to realize what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s still grinning and looks up at me.</p><p>No, no, no. I have a deer in the headlights look on my face. I don\u2019t move. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t breathe. Peter\u2019s eyes darken. He doesn\u2019t look away. My heart pounds louder. I think he can hear it. Suddenly, I notice my breathing, the way I\u2019m taking shallow shaky breaths. Peter\u2019s fingers remain on my wrist, holding my arm out across my knee. I\u2019m lost in his gaze. I feel a magnetic pull toward him, towards his lips. My skin is charged from his touch. I can\u2019t stand it. Sucking in air, I turn my face.</p><p>I can\u2019t do it.</p><p>I can\u2019t kiss him.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t even be here.</p><p>Peter\u2019s voice is deeper than usual. \u201cThat should help. Let me get the antiseptic, and cover it up. Then, we can take you home.\u201d He drops my wrist and stands up. Peter is staring at the little bottle, but he doesn\u2019t take it in his hands. Instead, he stands there, unblinking. He breathes in deeply and lets the air rush out from between his lips. I feel like I\u2019m watching porn. My pulse is racing and I\u2019m too warm. I can\u2019t look away. I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>Peter runs his hands through his hair and grabs the ointment. \u201cHere, this should help it heal faster.\u201d He dabs it on my arm. My stomach curls at his light touch. I watch Peter as he presses his finger to the scrapes. It makes me shiver so badly that I yank my arm away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter looks up at me. My mouth is open, but I have no words. What am I supposed to say? Your touch makes me crazy? Every time you dab that stuff on me, I tingle in all the wrong places? What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>I jump off the little bench in the bathroom and try to push past him. Peter turns at the last second. Our bodies line up. Ice drips down my spine and I freeze. His pecs are lined up with mine. I can feel him. It sends shivers through me that turn into a throb. My lips part and I gasp, trying to say words that won\u2019t come. I try to move my feet. I try to do anything but stay there and look up into his eyes.</p><p>Peter lifts his hands slowly. I feel the heat from his palms just below my elbows. I know he wants to touch me. I know what he\u2019s debating, because the same thoughts are racing through my mind. I know I should I move, but I can\u2019t. My pulse pounds harder, roaring in my ears. I feel his hands nearly touch the bare skin on my arms. Peter\u2019s hands are so close, but they don\u2019t touch me.</p> <p>I don\u2019t lift my gaze, even though I feel Peter\u2019s eyes burning a path from my eyes to my lips. If I look up, I won\u2019t be able to leave. If I look up, I\u2019ll throw everything away. Throwing away college means going home. It means going back to the people I ran away from. It means seeing the man who used my body over and over again.</p><p>My voice is so strained when I speak. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face is so close. He\u2019s lowered his head. I can feel his breath on my lips. My fingers ball at my sides. I stretch my hands and then curl my fingers into fists.</p><p>Don\u2019t touch him. Don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter breathes. I close my eyes and feel the room tip to the side. It\u2019s so hot in here. He\u2019s so close to me. I peel my eyes open again, and stare at his chest. I won\u2019t look up. I can\u2019t look up. \u201cWe can\u2019t, but I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes flick up. Oh, God. Mistake. Sirens are ringing in my ears. I fall into those twin pools of pure blue and I can\u2019t climb out. I gasp. My lips are right by his. Peter\u2019s hands are still over my arms. Every few moments, his fingers clench shut, as though he\u2019s fighting the urge to touch me. I try to swallow. I try to look down, but I\u2019m so hopelessly tangled in his gaze. I want his hands on me. I want to feel his palms burning on my skin. I want things that I thought I\u2019d never want.</p><p>My lips are parted. I try to speak, but nothing comes out. Every breath I take swells inside me, forcing my chest out, making my breasts brush against his chest. I need to stop breathing. My head is swimming with lust. Part of me is begging to be touched, to be kissed. I can\u2019t stop it. I can\u2019t control it. I\u2019m trapped.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands unclench and he closes his eyes. When he opens them again, there\u2019s a hopeless smile on his face. He starts talking, pouring his heart out, every last damaged bit. \u201cI\u2019m never the lucky one. Every time I find someone, she gets ripped away. She\u2019s always out of reach and it\u2019s not like I can change that.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get her back. I can\u2019t change things. There are no second chances. I\u2019ve lost everything. I lost Gina.</p><p>\u201cI lost myself when she died. I haven\u2019t felt a goddamn thing since then. But then you came along... You\u2019re smart and beautiful. I thought I could move on, but I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t ready. You were the only person who understood that, and knew what it truly meant.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Peter laughs bitterly and presses his eyes closed. When he opens them again, he looks tormented. His voice becomes higher as he speaks. His words come faster, more pained, more panicked. \u201cNow that I\u2019m ready to move on, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t lose my job. I can\u2019t be with you, but I can\u2019t be without you. God, Sidney. Tonight was one of the best and worst moments of my life. You said you loved me. You love me...\u201d he smiles sadly and shakes his head. \u201cI love you, too. You brought me back to life. You gave me back my smile. You\u2019re everything to me, but I can\u2019t do this to you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him. My eyes are too wide and my mouth is hanging open. What did he say? He can\u2019t mean that. He can\u2019t, but he said it. Peter loves me. But I can\u2019t follow him. There\u2019s so much agony in his voice. I don\u2019t know what he means. \u201cDo what to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here on scholarship. I know what will happen to me if I go through with this, and I can\u2019t let you throw away your life\u2014\u201d</p><p>He loves me. I stare at his eyes, listening to him say it, listening to the reason why he\u2019s frozen, why he\u2019s not touching me. He loves me.</p><p>I\u2019m so afraid, so terrified that he\u2019ll push me away, but I do it anyway. For a split second, I\u2019m brave\u2014and stupid, and reckless and impulsive. I cut off his words by slipping my fingers over his stubbled cheeks. I lean in and brush my lips to his. His mouth is sweet and soft.</p><p>Peter freezes when I kiss him. His arms don\u2019t wrap around me. He doesn\u2019t kiss me back. My muscles are so tense, so ready to run. I thought he\u2019d hold me. I thought he\u2019d respond.</p><p>Shame floods my face. I break the tiny kiss and look down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say to the floor. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I shouldn\u2019t have...\u201d My lower lip is quivering. I try to hold it still, but it won\u2019t cooperate, so I suck my lip into my mouth and bite down.</p><p>Before I can say another word, Peter scoops me up into his arms. I yelp and hold on tight. He walks us to the front door and lowers me to the floor. My body slides against his. The hem of my dress slips up shamefully high as I get down and press my feet to the floor. He\u2019s going to throw me out again. My hands are on his chest.</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t step away. I feel his eyes on my face. I can\u2019t let go. He lets out a breath and leans into me. His hands are on my shoulders. He looks at my fingers on his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at that. \u201cYou make it sound easy. I can barely think with you touching me like that. You seriously think I have enough self-control not to sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. My fingers are splayed over his chest. I feel all of him, every curve, every muscle. \u201cYour headlights are on.\u201d My thumb rubs over his pec, feeling the taut nipple beneath.</p><p>He laughs, and says, \u201cSo are yours,\u201d right before my thumb moves over him. He moans and grabs my hand. \u201cSidney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too\u2014 You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re giving up.\u201d His voice is husky. The muscles in his neck are flexed tight. He keeps clenching his jaw and smashing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m giving up. I remember who\u2019s waiting for me at home.\u201d My hands slide down his chest. His abs are so ripped. My finger flicks a button on his shirt, just above his waist.</p><p>Peter\u2019s shoulders tense. He lets out a ragged breath. Peter\u2019s hand lifts and brushes my cheek. I lean into the touch and close my eyes. He pulls away from me like I burned him. \u201cSidney, I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t.\u201d Peter pulls at his hair and turns away from me. He paces the floor once, then twice.</p><p>When he looks up, I panic. I see it in his eyes. He\u2019s going to push me away. I don\u2019t move. I brace for impact, expecting him to open the door and throw me through it, but he doesn\u2019t. He rushes toward me and places hands on either side of my head. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s going to yell or\u2014</p><p>I don\u2019t get to finish the thought. Peter leans in. His lips are so close to mine. I feel him resist. That part of him is still fighting it, but he doesn\u2019t back away. Peter closes the space. His lips press lightly to mine. It\u2019s a whisper of a kiss. Peter\u2019s still holding back. His body is all taut muscle. When I lift my hands and try to touch him, Peter jumps and pulls away. His face is scrunched with indecision. His hands fist at his sides. He looks like he wants to hit the wall, and turns away from me.</p><p>I\u2019m insane. I walk over to him. I\u2019m behind him. I made up my mind. I can\u2019t do this to him. It\u2019s tearing him apart. I feel the strength I need to walk away. It\u2019s faint, but it\u2019s there. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do this to you.\u201d</p><p>His face is in his hand. Peter turns around slowly and looks down at me. \u201cI can\u2019t do this to you. I know what you went through to get here. I can\u2019t send you back to the people who did that to you... I can\u2019t let you do it. I love you, Sidney.\u201d His eyes search mine. It feels as though we\u2019re breaking up. Something tightens around my throat. I try to swallow, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Peter.\u201d I smile at him sadly and turn to leave.</p><p>My hand is twisting the knob when he says, \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay, just a little longer. I can\u2019t let you go, not yet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m near tears. After everything we\u2019ve been through, I can\u2019t believe I have to walk away from him. Life is so unfair, this is so wrong. I love him and he loves me. The odds are so slim, so miniscule, that a person will find their match. I know he was made for me, and I know I have to leave.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t. This is an all or nothing kind of deal. I can\u2019t stand being around you and not touching you. You asked me if I\u2019m attracted to you\u2014I am. A lot. Everything about you entices me. Peter, I need to go.\u201d Pressing my lips together, I walk out of his apartment and fly down the steps. I suck in the night air like I\u2019m suffocating. I walk the two blocks to my dorm, alone, thinking.</p><p>I\u2019d give up everything for him, but then what? He has no job, I have no money, and we both live in a box.</p><p>Love sucks.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>I feel hollowed out. Even my skin feels fragile. My fingers drift to my lips. The memory is still there. It\u2019s like I can still feel the pressure of Peter\u2019s mouth, the way he fit perfectly into the seam of my lips.</p><p>I can\u2019t see Peter again. That doesn\u2019t really sink in until I\u2019m walking down the street. There\u2019s a good chance that I won\u2019t even be his TA anymore. Strictland will separate us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think about how my days will be without Peter, having him so close but not being able to talk to him, or touch him. Oh God, it hurts. It feels like someone took a knife and carved out my heart. I want to double over and cry, but I don\u2019t. I keep walking.</p><p>A car full of guys slows as they drive by. They whistle and catcall me before zooming off. When I\u2019m finally on campus again, I\u2019m back in my element. I can handle this. I make a beeline for the dorm. When I get to my room, it\u2019s filled with girls. God, why can\u2019t I ever be alone? Millie looks at me over the tops of several ponytails. They\u2019ve got a vat of blue Kool-Aide and are dipping the ends of their hair into the tub. Tia is sitting by the door. Her arms are folded over her chest and she\u2019s leaning back in a chair.</p><p>\u201cNot into blue?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNah, I\u2019d love blue, but the only way it\u2019ll show up in my hair is if I bleach it first. I\u2019m not bleaching it. It\u2019d probably fall out or something.\u201d She glances up at me, and notices my puffy eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? Something happen?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, the normal shit. Got chewed out by Strictland for being Peter\u2019s friend, and got attacked by a squirrel. The damn thing ripped my arm off.\u201d Tia looks at my face to see if I\u2019m making stuff up and then back at my arm.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. You\u2019re serious?\u201d she asks, and sits up straight. I nod. Before I can say anything else, she\u2019s up and tugging me out of the room and down the hall. \u201cMillie\u2019s blonde and going to stick her whole head in that bucket. It\u2019s going to take her all night to get the color to show up. So talk. What\u2019s going on with you? Why\u2019d Strictland chew you out?\u201d She pauses and her eyes widen. \u201cShit, Peter? As in Dr. Peter Granz?\u201d I nod. She pulls me into her room and closes the door. \u201cMy roommate is down there with Millie. Spill. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>I flop down on her bed with my shoulders slumped forward. I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t even know. Peter is Dr. Granz. It\u2019s a long story, but I nearly slept with him before I realized who he was.\u201d</p><p>Tia\u2019s eyes bug out of her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMillie dragged me out on a blind date when she wanted to hook up with Brent. I was supposed to meet them there. Long story short, I sat down at the wrong table.\u201d I look up at her face. Tia is really nice. I\u2019ve said stupid crap to her before, but this makes me nervous. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, okay? I don\u2019t want him to get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling anyone, but you have to tell me what happened. How\u2019d you end up with him that night if you were on a date with another guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other guy had happy hands. I left early. When I went to the parking lot, Peter was standing there with his hood up. He was new here and alone. Plus he\u2019s hot and funny. I don\u2019t know. I ended up going home with him. We made out. A lot. Before things got out of hand, the phone rang and I left. I recognized him the next morning in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d she stomps her feet on the floor, way too excited. \u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe grabbed dinner after club. It was nothing, but Strictland showed up and ate with us. Then she kinda gave an ultimatum. Peter gets fired and trashes his career if he continues to see me, and I get flunked and can\u2019t graduate. I can\u2019t repeat classes because of the scholarship. And I have no money. She knows that.\u201d</p><p>Tia is at the edge of her seat with her fingers by her mouth. \u201cOh, my God. But wait, I thought you said nothing was going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing was going on. We were friends with an awkward start, but...\u201d I sigh and tug at my hair.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more than that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, way more. Holy fuck, Tia. Like holy frickin\u2019 fuck. I can\u2019t even tell you.\u201d My lips mash together. I want to punch something. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been cut off from my best friend, although he is and I have been\u2014it\u2019s worse than that. I feel like my heart got ripped out.</p><p>\u201cAnd Peter. We were at his apartment fixing this,\u201d I point to the claw marks, \u201cand I kissed him. He said he can\u2019t, but he loves me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tia gasps, \u201cOh, my God. Do you love him?\u201d I glance up at her. She tenses and shakes the bed with her hands and squeals when I don\u2019t answer. It must be written all over my face because she says, \u201cOh, my God! That\u2019s so romantic! You love him, but you can\u2019t be with him. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNothing. There\u2019s nothing to do. I can\u2019t let him risk his career for me, and I have to graduate. I can\u2019t fuck it up and go home.\u201d I bury my face in my hands and rub hard. Everything is falling apart. I feel so fractured, like I\u2019m crumbling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you curse like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not been much to curse about. I have no idea what to do. I have to stay away from him, but I can\u2019t.\u201d I laugh bitterly and wrap my arms around my waist. I can\u2019t chase away the sensations that are choking me. I\u2019m looking at her floor.</p> <p>Memories well up, uncalled. \u201cThat was my first I love you, well, the first one that was real, and then this happens. We aren\u2019t even friends anymore. We can\u2019t be. I have no idea how to deal with this.\u201d My hands are on the sides of my head, and I shove my fingers into my hair.</p><p>Tonight started out great. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. Yes, I should have known, but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know I was falling in love with Peter. I didn\u2019t even realize it until tonight. I\u2019m so damned stupid. How did I not see it? Especially when everyone has been less than tactful about it.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I groan into my hands. Looking up, I ask, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>Tia\u2019s face is full of sympathy. \u201cThe only thing you can do. Stay away from him and distract yourself with chocolate.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>The next few weeks pass painfully slow. At night I stare at the ceiling. I can\u2019t sleep. It feels like my arms have been chopped off. I have phantom pains. God, and the nightmares. My mind drifts and I see Peter getting hit by a car, falling off a cliff, or getting shot in the chest. Every time it\u2019s the same\u2014I see what\u2019s going to happen moments before it occurs. I run toward Peter, screaming at the top of my lungs, but he doesn\u2019t hear me. I\u2019m never fast enough, never loud enough, and I\u2019m always a second too late. There are never any good-byes; Peter\u2019s simply ripped away from me.</p><p>One night the dream is so vivid. Peter is smiling, saying something to me. He\u2019s stepping backward with that wry grin on his face. The ground is hard and dry. The clay cracks, but Peter doesn\u2019t look behind him. The parking lot turns into nothing but miles and miles of cracked red clay. It\u2019s like watching him walk onto thin ice. I\u2019m frantic, calling to him\u2014begging him to come back\u2014but he can\u2019t hear me. The ground under his feet suddenly cracks apart. Peter falls. I launch myself toward him, toward the massive chasm in the ground. I fall at the edge of the hole just in time to have Peter\u2019s fingers narrowly miss mine.</p><p>I scream.</p><p>I shriek so loudly that the nightmare becomes real. I yell in my bed and dart upright. My body is covered in cold sweat. The sheets are stuck to my body. I\u2019m tangled and thrashing, trying to get free. Millie jumps up and flips on the lights. My hand is on my chest. I\u2019m trying to tell myself that it wasn\u2019t real, that Peter is alive and well, but the dream feels so genuine that I\u2019m close to tears.</p><p>Millie\u2019s standing there with a broom in her fists, as though she\u2019s going to bludgeon an intruder. When she sees that no one is around, her arms drop to her sides. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d She rubs her eyes and takes a deep breath.</p><p>I nod, but it\u2019s shaky. I can\u2019t speak. What am I afraid of? The nightmare sounds so stupid. The ground doesn\u2019t just eat people, but the dream felt real. I can\u2019t shake the feeling. I yank my blankets off and head to my closet. I pull out sweats and put them on.</p><p>Millie is watching me. \u201cWhere are you going? It\u2019s 4:00am. You can\u2019t go running now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d It\u2019s all I can manage to huff out.</p><p>\u201cSidney, wait. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Millie\u2019s eyelids are about halfway open. She looks like she\u2019s falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m okay. Go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Something\u2019s bothering you and I\u2019ve turned into a shitty friend since Brent came along. Give me a second. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d She blinks slowly and turns toward her closet. I\u2019m already dressed and pulling on my sneakers.</p><p>When I tie the second shoe, I say, \u201cI\u2019d rather go alone. Seriously, go back to bed. I\u2019ll take your pepper spray if you\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>She yawns. Millie has one leg in her sweats and looks up at me. \u201cFine, but only if you use the student gym. Don\u2019t run outside. Go use the stair climber or elliptical or something. Promise?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m gone. I run down the stairs and outside into the cold air. It fills my lungs and reminds me what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. The dreams aren\u2019t real. Peter is alive. I know what the nightmares signify, I know what they mean. Peter was ripped away from me and there\u2019s nothing that I could have done about it. He\u2019s gone. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s dead, but I see his ghost haunting the English building every day.</p><p>Strictland removed me as his TA the day after she saw us at dinner. She swapped her TA with his. Now, I work with Strictland. The rumors have stopped. No one is saying anything anymore.</p><p>I pound my feet harder and run faster. My lungs burn like I can\u2019t get enough air. My hair swishes back and forth, tickling my neck. I want to run so hard that my body screams in pain. I want to feel something that I know how to deal with, because I don\u2019t know what to do with this.</p><p>It\u2019s not the same as the other nightmares. Those had me scared to death, because someone was trying to hurt me. These dreams are the opposite. No one is hurting me, but it feels like my guts are being ripped out. It\u2019s like losing Peter all over again, night after night. When will it stop? The man is still alive. Why is my brain mourning him as if he were dead? I can\u2019t stand it. I want to scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Digging in, I push off the ground harder and run faster. I lengthen my stride. My arms pump at my sides and I sprint as fast as I can across campus to the far side where the new gym is located. By the time I get there, I can\u2019t breathe and there\u2019s a stich running up both sides of my ribcage and across my hip.</p><p>I swipe my ID card and go inside. Holding my hands on my hips, I stop and suck in air. I stay like that for a few moments in the darkened hallway, just trying to catch my breath.</p><p>When the cramp subsides, I walk down to the exercise room. I don\u2019t expect anyone to be here. The halls are empty and the lights are off. I swipe my card and go inside. I find a treadmill and turn it on, increasing the speed up to a full run. I pound the crap out of the thing, sprinting as fast as I can.</p> <p>A few moments pass and I\u2019m in my own little world. Thoughts float away. The only thing in my head is the pounding of my heart and the rush of air filling my lungs. That\u2019s why he scares the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cSidney?\u201d Mark\u2019s voice comes from somewhere beside me. I yelp, lose my footing, and step on my sneaker. The result is instantaneous. I fall and get launched off the end of the treadmill. My back slams into the wall. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d Mark pulls out the emergency stop key and the treadmill turns off, before my feet get sucked under the thing. Then, he falls on his knees next to me. \u201cSidney, I\u2019m so sorry. Are you all right? Can you move?\u201d</p><p>I start laughing. It\u2019s the crazy kind of chuckling that makes people really uncomfortable, but I can\u2019t stop. Mark is still kneeling next to me. He glances around. \u201cAwh shit. I broke her.\u201d He runs his hand through his hair and pokes my shoulder. \u201cYou okay, there? You sound a little bit nuts.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and look over at him. \u201cI am a little bit nuts. Why else would I be here at four in the morning. I assume you\u2019re twisted too, since you were sitting in here in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Mark looks offended. \u201cI was not! I was back in the weight room when I heard someone. I came out to see who it was, said your name, made you fall on your ass, and then get battered by the wall.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh and realize that I do sound way past crazy\u2014and way past tired. I rub my hands over my face and sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not the weirdest thing that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d When I pull my hand away, there\u2019s a streak of blood. \u201cDamn it. I cut my face?\u201d</p><p>Mark stands and offers his hand. I put my clean hand in his palm and he pulls me up. \u201cNah, it\u2019s just a little scrape on your cheek.\u201d</p><p>I dab it again with my fingers and walk over the mirrors. It\u2019s not that bad, but I look like hell. My hair is a rat\u2019s nest pulled into a ponytail. It\u2019s all bushy. I didn\u2019t bother brushing it before I left. I just pulled it back and snapped the elastic ring around my hair. There are dark circles under my eyes and I look beat.</p><p>Mark hands me a hanky. I look over at him, surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s not used, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I take it and say, \u201cThanks, and that wasn\u2019t what I was thinking at all.\u201d I take the white cotton and run it under the water fountain, getting it damp, and then blot my cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what did this.\u201d</p><p>He points to my wrist. \u201cYour watch. Your hands tried to cover your face when you fell. The watch probably scratched you.\u201d I look at my wrist and then back up at him.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your story?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t want him staring at me, but he is. I glance at him. \u201cAre you always in here at four in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Mark puts his hands behind his back and shakes his head. \u201cNah, it\u2019s usually five by the time I get here. I was early today. As to the reason why, well, I\u2019m a bit of a freak. I only need four hours of sleep.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dabbing my cheek as he\u2019s talking. When says that, I look up at him, envious. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s some kind of genetic thing. My mom\u2019s like that. They thought it was ADHD for a long time, but that\u2019s not it. I just don\u2019t need to sleep eight hours to feel good. Four or five, max, and I\u2019m good to go. I can stay out all night and then wake up at the butt crack of dawn.</p><p>\u201cSince there\u2019s nothing to do at the dorm, and my roommate kills me if I wake him up, I usually head over here.\u201d He\u2019s leaning against the wall, watching me. Mark\u2019s closer to my age than Peter. This is the kind of guy I should be with. He\u2019s normal, nice, and my peer. He\u2019s not my teacher.</p><p>I watch Mark for too long, staring at his face, wondering what he would have done if I threw myself at him at the beginning of the semester\u2014if it was Mark at the table and not Peter. Would he have done as much? Would he have stopped? What would that have done to me? Sometimes I think sex will fix everything. It ruined everything, so it makes sense, sort of.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize how much time has passed.</p><p>Mark gets a nervous smile on his face and looks around, like I must be watching something else. \u201cUhm, Sidney? Did I accidentally put you to sleep with my overly boring story?\u201d</p> <p>I smirk and blink. I hurt so much and he\u2019s so sweet. \u201cNo. You\u2019re anything but boring.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI would have followed you around like a puppy if some other guy hadn\u2019t caught my attention first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory of my life.\u201d Mark\u2019s eyes search my face before he lifts his hand and lightly touches my arm. It\u2019s a reassuring touch. \u201cI\u2019m guessing said guy is the reason you\u2019re here at this ungodly hour?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. My thoughts are jumbled. I don\u2019t know what I want. I don\u2019t know how to make the agony inside of me stop. I\u2019m staring at Mark\u2019s lips. I\u2019m reverting. I can feel my old pre-Peter plan jumping around my ankles, nipping at me.</p><p>Mark is shirtless. His body is covered in a thin layer of sweat. His hair is damp and messy. I\u2019m aware of my breathing, aware of his mouth, and aware that I\u2019m standing too close to him. Mark\u2019s hand slips up my bare arm, over my shoulder, and touches my cheek.</p><p>He tucks a piece of my crazy hair behind my ear and smiles sadly at me. \u201cI\u2019m not a rebound guy, Sidney. I\u2019m a love-her-with-my-whole-heart kind of guy, and since I really like you, it\u2019s so damn hard not to kiss you right now. But, I can\u2019t...\u201d He breaks our gaze by looking down. Mark takes my hands and rubs his thumbs over my skin slowly. Breathing deeply, he adds, \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>Normally, I would have turned beat red, but today I just nod and look at our hands. \u201cThen, how do you get over a broken heart? Everyone says sex, but I just don\u2019t...\u201d I sigh deeply and look up at him.</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve had mine stomped on a few times, I can tell you the truth.\u201d He tilts his head to the side and smiles at me. His eyes don\u2019t meet mine again, not while he\u2019s talking. \u201cYou don\u2019t get over it. Nothing immediately heals the pain. It doesn\u2019t vanish because you\u2019re ready to get over him. It takes time. One day, things won\u2019t hurt so much. One day you\u2019ll notice someone else and not think about the last guy at all. You\u2019ll be ready to start over, and so will your heart. Give it time, Sidney.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he pulls his hands away. \u201cWhy are you so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re hot, like amazingly bodacious. I have a little crush on you.\u201d Mark looks sheepish when he says the last one.</p><p>I smile at him. My face feels funny and I realize that I haven\u2019t smiled in a while. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I tend to keep things low key.\u201d He gives me a lop-sided grin and bumps me with his shoulder. \u201cWant to race or something? I\u2019m guessing you came in here to run and I bet I can totally beat you.\u201d</p><p>I glance out the windows at the track and nod. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I spend the next hour running with Mark. We race until my muscles are twitching like I\u2019ve been electrocuted. I fall onto the mats and lay on my back. Mark sits next to me in a comfortable silence. It seems that I\u2019ve found another friend.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>I still have to see Peter once a week. I didn\u2019t get transferred out of his night class, although I wish I did. My only option would have been to drop it, and if I did that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to retake it because of my scholarship. It was too far into the semester by the time Strictland separated us. I\u2019m just glad she didn\u2019t force me to drop it.</p><p>Peter\u2019s at the front of the room. I don\u2019t look at him. Instead, I hear his voice and stare down at my notepad. I\u2019ve been up for a really long time. It seems like yesterday that I was sitting with Mark, but that was only this morning. I touch my face and feel the cut on my cheek. Yup, that was today. I can\u2019t believe I fell off a treadmill. Who does that?</p><p>\u201cMiss Colleli?\u201d Peter says. I get the feeling that it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s called on me.</p><p>I look up. Everyone is watching me. \u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes drift to the cut on my cheek. His brows pinch together. \u201cThe poem at the beginning of the book...\u201d When I don\u2019t answer, he adds, \u201cThe Man Who Was Thursday had a poem at the beginning. What did you think it was about? Did it fit the literature?\u201d Peter is standing in front of me for a moment. Then he crosses the room, leans back on his desk, and folds his arms across his perfect chest.</p><p>Why is he calling on me? I want to crawl into a hole and die. That\u2019s the one question that I can\u2019t answer at all. \u201cIt made me want buy a top hat,\u201d I say, and shrug. A few students giggle. One says freak. I turn and give that guy a thumbs-up. I\u2019m a proud freak. Deal with it.</p><p>Peter stares at me with a hopeless look on his face. He doesn\u2019t ask me to elaborate. Instead he calls on the smartass who says he\u2019s not gay enough to think the poem is about hats. Peter pinches the bridge of his nose and looks at the clock. It\u2019s almost nine.</p><p>\u201cSince no one knows what the hell the poem is about, you guys are going to hand in a research paper next week. I want three sources, four pages, double-spaced, and include your own understanding of the poem. If you agree with the research, state why. Class dismissed.\u201d They all groan and exit quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m moving at slug speed. I feel so tired. I can\u2019t remember if I ate today. I don\u2019t think I did. I consider getting some food as I gather my books. By the time I head for the door, the classroom is empty, save Peter, who\u2019s at his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face, Colleli?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow and look back at him. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly complimentary, Dr. Granz.\u201d I do the shame, shame, thing with my fingers, too, but it\u2019s sloppy.</p> <p>He gets up and walks toward me. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you? You realize that your grades are so borderline that you might fail, right? And, with Strictland breathing down my neck, I can\u2019t pass you if you don\u2019t earn it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize that. My spine stiffens. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to pass me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, what the hell are you doing? I don\u2019t understand you. You wanted to take this class, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take it when Tadwick was teaching it.\u201d Peter flinches. Maybe I said that a little too harshly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Peter puts up his hands, palms toward me, and backs away. \u201cI know what you meant. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He grips the back of his neck and sighs.</p> <p>I\u2019ve avoided looking at Peter\u2019s face, but when he\u2019s turned to the side\u2014away from me\u2014I chance it. His lashes are lowered, and his shoulders slumped like he\u2019s beaten, as if the weight was too much and it broke him. There are dark rings under his eyes that match mine. His lips no longer smile. Peter looks exhausted, with a sadness that penetrates every ounce of his being. He\u2019s drowning in melancholy.</p><p>Peter must feel my eyes on the side of his face, because he looks up. Our eyes meet and I wish they hadn\u2019t. My stomach drops to my feet. I\u2019m dying. There was air and now there is none. Weeks have passed, but I\u2019m not over him.</p><p>Peter breaks our gaze and looks down. \u201cI better get going.\u201d His voice is faint, weak.</p><p>Before I know what I\u2019m saying, the words are out of my mouth. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d Peter looks up at me. His eyes slip over my face until he finds my eyes. \u201cBecause I do. I regret it so badly. If I could go back and undo everything, I would. I can\u2019t stand seeing you like this, and I can\u2019t stand being like this. If I never sat at your table\u2014\u201d</p><p>Peter talks over me. \u201cIf you never sat at my table, I would have never known that I could be happy again. No, I don\u2019t regret it. I don\u2019t regret any of it.\u201d He works his jaw, as if he wants to say more, but decides against it.</p><p>I nod slowly and pick up my books, not planning on saying anything else. A letter falls out of the pages and lands at Peter\u2019s feet. He bends over and picks it up. His eyes lift to mine. \u201cIs this from your brother?\u201d I nod. \u201cI thought you were going to throw it out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did. He sent another and then another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened any of them?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo,\u201d my voice is barely there. \u201cHe\u2019s dead to me. Take it. Toss it. I don\u2019t want to see it again.\u201d</p><p>I head toward the door. I feel Peter\u2019s eyes on my back. I know he wants to say something, but I don\u2019t give him the chance. I walk out of the room and down the hall. I exit at the front staircase. No one uses the stairs. There are over a hundred steps to the lawn below. I press my back to a pillar and slip down to the floor.</p><p>For a long time, I sit there in darkness. The lights around me illuminate the steps, but I\u2019m in shadow. The people below can\u2019t see me.</p><p>I\u2019m worried that Sam keeps sending me letters. When we were children, he and I were best friends. He looked out for me, took care of me. Sam let me play with his friends. He punched anyone that messed with me. I was his little sister even though we\u2019re twins. You were born after me, he\u2019d say. That\u2019s why you\u2019re my little sister. I think he liked being the older brother. It made Sam feel important.</p><p>But all that changed when I cried to him about Dean. I expected him to defend me. He didn\u2019t. Sam said I was a tease, and that he\u2019d seen what I did, the way I acted around his friend. The memories bubble up one by one. Once they start, they don\u2019t stop.</p><p>Dean didn\u2019t hurt you, they said. Dean is a good young man. I swear, it\u2019s as though my parents and Sam are standing in front of me, saying the same things over and over again. I want to cry out, What about me? He held me down, he overpowered me. Dean wouldn\u2019t do that, they said. God, I\u2019d never felt so betrayed in my life.</p> <p>But it was worse, so much worse when I told Sam.</p><p>I never let these memories out their box. They\u2019re like demons and will strip away every ounce of joy I have until there\u2019s nothing left. But I let the memories out. I hear their voices. The old words reopen scars that never healed. My mind is reeling. I need to force the demons back, and make it stop. I pull my knees into my chest and lower my head. Wrapping my arms around my ankles, I pull myself into a ball. I close my eyes, hoping that it\u2019ll pass or swallow me whole.</p><p>The door behind me opens. I hear it, but I don\u2019t look up. Whoever it is will just go down the staircase without even seeing me. The sound of footfalls comes nearer and then stops. I glance around my arm and see leather saddle shoes. I glance up at Peter.</p><p>He sits next to me. I tuck my face into my knees again. I don\u2019t want to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cYou look miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am miserable.\u201d I talk into my knees.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Peter takes a deep breath and puts his hand on my back. Peter pulls me to him and I wrap my hands around his waist. I hold onto him tightly, knowing that I\u2019ll have to let go. When he pulls away it feels like someone is ripping off my skin, layer by layer.</p><p>I push up and turn toward the stairs. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Peter. I can\u2019t be around you like this. It\u2019s killing me. I have no idea how to get over you. I just can\u2019t...\u201d I step away, but he grabs my arm. I stiffen. I love it and I hate it. I want his arms around me. I want my friend back.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d He pulls me closer and takes my books away. He drops them on the ground next to his feet. His hands cup my cheeks. I feel Peter\u2019s breath on my face. It makes my head feel so light, dizzy almost. I want Peter\u2019s lips on mine. I miss him so badly that tears prick my eyes.</p><p>I take Peter\u2019s hands in mine and try to pull his hands down. \u201cDon\u2019t, Peter... I can\u2019t do this.\u201d I\u2019m barely in one piece. I feel the wave of regret growing bigger and bigger. It\u2019s going to crush me. His touch is going to destroy me. I panic. I pull at him but he doesn\u2019t let go. I\u2019m crying. I didn\u2019t realize it, but tears are streaking my cheeks.</p><p>Peter\u2019s thumbs swipe through the tears on my cheeks, wiping them away. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d He leans in and brushes his lips to my face, kissing away a tear. I still. My fingers are still clutching his hands, but I stop pulling. I take a ragged breath when he does it again, and again. Peter kisses my face lightly, brushing away every tear.</p><p>Then, he tilts my head back so that I can see his eyes. \u201cI hope you can forgive me, but I did something incredibly stupid.\u201d The corner of his mouth lifts. Uncertainty lines his gaze. \u201cI wrote a letter of resignation and put it on Strictland\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. Every time I see you, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve had my heart ripped out of my chest. I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s not a crush. It was never a crush. I love you, Sidney. I took too long to say it. I took too long to fix this, but I choose you.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. \u201cYou quit?\u201d He nods. My eyebrows creep up my face. Shocked silence encases me. When I finally try to speak, a loud sobbish-sounding laugh comes out of my mouth. I throw my arms around his neck and hold on tight. Peter presses his body against mine and lifts me off my feet. He swings me around once. I shriek and laugh. \u201cBut, you can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>When Peter puts me down, he\u2019s smiling. \u201cI already did. I wrote a letter of resignation and slipped it under her door.\u201d I turn to go inside. I have to get that letter back. I\u2019m so happy he chose me, but I can\u2019t let him do this.</p><p>When I try to go inside, Peter reaches for me. His fingers wrap around my arm. Ice shoots into my stomach. This is unreal. My pulse pounds harder. I can\u2019t let him do this. \u201cSidney, her office door is locked. I can\u2019t take it back and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment and his hands release me. I can still feel his palm against my arm. I can\u2019t swallow. The moment passes slowly, as if time isn\u2019t real. Peter opens his mouth to say something. I do the same. Neither of us speaks. My skin is covered in chills that won\u2019t go away. I rub my hands over my arms, trying to chase the panicked feeling away, but it won\u2019t abate.</p><p>I\u2019m scared out of my mind, and it\u2019s not the normal someone-is-hiding-under-the-bed scared, it\u2019s different. There are no hands strangling me, but I can\u2019t swallow. There is no tape over my mouth, but I can\u2019t breathe. There is no bullet in my heart, but I swear to God that it stops pounding. The weight of my gaze is pulled toward the ground. I can\u2019t lift my face. I can\u2019t look at him. Terror, fear, and joy all collide. I can\u2019t make my mouth form words. I\u2019m twisting my hands so hard that they burn.</p><p>Peter\u2019s head hangs forward. Instead of giving his hands rope burn, his are shoved into his pockets. He inhales deeply, but his breaths are shaky. I wonder if he\u2019s as nervous as I am. This feels like one of those moments when everything matters. It\u2019s a crossroads where taking the wrong path will be devastating. I chose the wrong path once. It nearly destroyed me.</p><p>I glance back at the doors behind Peter. I can\u2019t let him do this. There\u2019s an ache that grows larger and larger in the center of my chest, as I think about what he\u2019s done and what it means. He gave up everything for me. My lips part and I\u2019m about to speak, but he cuts me off.</p><p>His voice is so soft. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to take back your \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d When he lifts his blue gaze, my hands start to shake. I hold them tighter, twisting them harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looking straight into those haunted eyes, I say, \u201cI\u2019ll never take that back. I love you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I\u2019m sorry that I was so stupid. It took me way too long to do something.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>Peter places his hands on my shoulders and steps toward me. Looking down into my face, pressing his forehead against mine, he says, \u201cI had to. I couldn\u2019t lose you. Please tell me that I didn\u2019t lose you.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes are lowered to my lips. He watches me for a second and I feel it.</p><p>This is the moment that matters. What I say now will change everything. He quit so he could be with me. He resigned. I feel so guilty and so glad. I\u2019m an emotional train wreck. My engine is derailed and there\u2019s baggage everywhere\u2014nightmares, worries, and regrets litter my mind. I\u2019ve not felt like this about anyone. I never thought I\u2019d have this chance. It was taken from me by someone I trusted. I wonder if I can really do it, if I can move on. I want to. I want to take the chance so badly I can feel it burning inside of me. Flames lick from my toes to my fingertips, urging me to move, to throw my arms around Peter and tell him how much he means to me.</p><p>But, I can\u2019t. I gasp and my gaze falls to his chest. There are so many reasons why. Each one clangs loudly inside my mind, vying for attention, promising nothing but pain. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want him, I do. It\u2019s that I know what this means, what that letter of resignation did. I could go back to his place right now. I could fall into his arms and let him love me until morning. I could show him how I feel about him. It\u2019s those thoughts that scare me. The door was opened. There\u2019s nothing holding us back, nothing keeping us apart. That makes it so much easier to see the obstacle blocking my path. I feel the scars burn, as if they might start bleeding. I\u2019m not who I was. Pretending that I can be won\u2019t change things. I know now. I can\u2019t be with him, not that way. The thought terrifies me. Tears streak from the corners of my eyes. They sting and dampen my face. I open my mouth to say it, but Peter shakes his head. The look in his eyes rips me apart, but I have to say it. There\u2019s no future for us.</p><p>Peter steps back from me. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t say it. Sidney, give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d My voice is barely a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you. I can\u2019t move on. And I can\u2019t take you down with me. I\u2019m so sorry...So sorry.\u201d I grab my things and walk away with tears blurring my vision. Peter calls out, but he doesn\u2019t chase me down the steps. He watches me leave. He watches his biggest mistake walk away.</p> <p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>I haven\u2019t said his name in years, not even inside my mind. It\u2019s like summoning him, and every bad thing that happened to me while I was with him, with Dean. I wipe the tears from my eyes with the back of my hands.</p><p>As I ran down the front steps, I felt Peter\u2019s eyes on me, but I didn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t. I already ruined my life, I can\u2019t ruin his. By the time I get to the bottom of the massive staircase and turn back, Peter is gone. I never heard him leave, never heard the click of the doors. He left without a sound. It makes me want to cry more. My vision is blurry. I can\u2019t see a damn thing.</p><p>Yanking a tissue from my book bag, I fumble it and nearly drop everything on the ground. A few pens and Millie\u2019s pepper spray rolls out the side. I sweep them back in, not paying attention. I\u2019m shaking. Every ounce of me wants to fall down on the grass and cry\u2014cry because I\u2019m too afraid to move forward, cry because I can\u2019t get over my past. I swallow hard and glance back up at the steps. Peter was willing to try.</p><p>But his pain is different, I think. She didn\u2019t tie him to a seat and scratch his skin with his knife. She didn\u2019t press harder to see if he cried. She didn\u2019t use her strength to take what she wanted. She didn\u2019t do things like that. His pain is different. It has to be.</p><p>I can\u2019t relive those nightmares. That\u2019s what being with Peter will do. I take a few breaths and steady myself. I drove over to this side of campus and need to get back to the dorm. I don\u2019t want glassy red eyes when I walk inside. Everyone will want to know what happened.</p> <p>After wiping my face again, I start down the sidewalk. The sky is so dark that it\u2019s nearly black. There\u2019s no moon tonight. The few trees rustle in the breeze. There are some guys ahead, toward the opposite end of the street, next to the dorm. Most are moving toward the parking lot and getting into their cars. Some are in the field next to the building, playing football. A guy with no shirt on launches the ball. I watch it streak across the sky, and it isn\u2019t until my gaze follows the ball back down that I feel a prickling sensation on the back of my neck. I turn to see who\u2019s watching me, but there isn\u2019t anyone.</p><p>It seems as though I\u2019m overly paranoid lately. I glance around, and my eyes go through the faces, most of which don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m there. They\u2019re too far away, playing under the floodlights. I\u2019m on the sidewalk in the shadows between lamp posts, two parking lots away from any of them.</p><p>Rubbing the hand over the back of my neck, I keep walking. My car is across the street. When I arrived, the main lot was full. I glance behind me one more time. I wonder where Peter went. Regret washes over me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him. God, the look on his face when I said \u2018no\u2019 was too much. I reach into my bag, feeling around for my keys, as I cross the street. When I\u2019m out of the crosswalk, I hop onto the sidewalk and head into the parking lot. I\u2019m several rows back, but it\u2019s fairly empty tonight. Where are my keys? I pull my bag in front of me and shift things around, trying to find them. Everything is out of place from dropping the bag.</p><p>\u201cYou look as beautiful now as you did the day you ran away.\u201d</p><p>That voice. My spine straightens. Every little hair on my neck stands on end. I nearly drop my bag as I look around for him. My fight or flight kicks in and my feet want to run, but fear holds me in place. It can\u2019t be Dean. Why would he be here? But it is him. It\u2019s the same voice from my nightmares. It\u2019s a voice that I\u2019ll never forget.</p><p>I don\u2019t find my keys. I\u2019m suddenly aware of how much air I\u2019m breathing, and the way my skin is prickling. Little bumps form on my arms when I see Dean standing against the side of the building. My chest constricts. I have no words. I want to run, but for some reason I don\u2019t move.</p><p>He pushes off the wall and walks toward me. \u201cDamn fine way to say hello. Hello, Sidney,\u201d he says stopping in front of me. \u201cThen, you say \u2018hello, Dean.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I manage to find my voice. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d It\u2019s Texas. I\u2019m thousands of miles from home, hidden in a little town in a vast state.</p> <p>Dean gives me a smile that makes my blood run cold. It\u2019s the same look he had in his eye before he\u2014</p><p>I push away the memories, but they won\u2019t be tamed. I\u2019m suddenly there again. It\u2019s four years ago. Dean has a knife on my thigh. I can\u2019t make a sound or he\u2019ll cut me. I lay perfectly still, letting him use me however he wants. Another memory flies forward, from when the tiniest whimper left my lips. I feel the pain sear my neck like he just did it. There were too many times. I shiver and try to force them back, but I can\u2019t, not with Dean standing there.</p><p>\u201cNice way to say hello. You were always a bit of bitch, weren\u2019t you?\u201d His eyes drop to my breasts as he speaks. They linger there too long before returning to my face. \u201cJust the way I like it.\u201d He steps toward me. He touches my forearm, runs his finger along my skin. I choke, but it\u2019s silent. I make no sound because that\u2019s what he conditioned me to do.</p><p>We\u2019re standing a few spaces away from my car. My book bag is hanging off my shoulder. No one is nearby. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, is replaying over and over again in my mind, but I say nothing. I\u2019m frozen.</p><p>Dean\u2019s hands touch my skin lightly, trailing a sickening path up to my neck. He pushes my chin to the side and lifts the chain around my neck. He grins. \u201cIt scarred.\u201d He looks into my eyes and grins. \u201cFun times, huh, Colleli?\u201d He drops the chain and steps back.</p><p>Dean strokes his chin and shakes his head. \u201cDamn shame we don\u2019t have time right now. I\u2019d love to fuck the way we used to, but I promised your brother that we\u2019d meet up with him as soon as I found you.\u201d Dean grins at me. His eyes sweep over my body and it feels as if I\u2019ve been raped all over again. He pulls a phone from his pocket and texts someone.</p><p>I find my brain and what little sense of self-preservation I have left. \u201cMy brother\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Dean nods. \u201cYeah. Some family shit is going on. We\u2019re here to take you home.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opens and I\u2019m shaking my head. Why is that worse than seeing Dean? Having Dean and Sam drag me home is unthinkable. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I live here, asshole. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d I push past him, trying to get to my car.</p><p>Dean\u2019s hand shoots out. He grips my arm hard and jerks me back. I\u2019m standing right in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you don\u2019t have a say in the matter, but I like the spine you grew while you\u2019ve been down here.\u201d He yanks me, turning me around so my back is to him. \u201cIt looks great with that tight little ass.\u201d</p><p>I kick at him, and try to pull my arm back. \u201cLet go of me! I\u2019m not going with you.\u201d</p><p>Dean laughs. His grip on my arm tightens. \u201cHow sweet. You think you get a say in this. Well, you don\u2019t. Get in the fucking truck.\u201d I nearly fall over when I look up and see where he\u2019s leading me. It\u2019s the Explorer he used to drive, the same one where he did all those things to me. My knees go weak. I fall. My bag hits the ground next to me and the contents spill out. Pens, pencils, and papers go everywhere. The wind takes the pages and blows them down the street like they\u2019re snowflakes.</p><p>My eyes are too wide. My lips are parted. The voice in my head keeps telling me to scream, but I can\u2019t. I have no air. It\u2019s as if someone hit me in the back with a board.</p><p>\u201cGet up and get into the goddamn truck before I throw you in.\u201d Dean pulls at me, but I\u2019m dead weight slumped on the ground in a heap. He pulls harder, twisting my arm. I yelp and look up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll break it. I swear to God. Get up and get in the truck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t move.</p><p>Dean twists my arm behind my back, hard. A scream rips from my throat. The pain that is shooting through me and into my shoulder is blinding. My gaze falls to the ground. Dean is talking, saying things that I can\u2019t hear. He releases me, but the fire inside my bones doesn\u2019t stop burning.</p><p>Dean pushes me with his shoe, yells at me. \u201cShut the fuck up. People are going to get the wrong idea.\u201d Dean pulls me up by my other arm and drags me. When he\u2019s nearly there, he lifts me onto his shoulder like I\u2019m a child. He\u2019s going to throw me inside.</p> <p>I freak out. My brain snaps and goes Cujo on his ass. My teeth sink into his shoulder and I bite down. His shirt tastes of blood and I bite down harder. Dean screams, cursing, and throws me. My back hits the ground first. White spots form around the edges of my vision, making it hard to see. Unbelievable pain shoots up my arm and into my shoulder. It\u2019s a million times worse than before.</p><p>I\u2019m screaming. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying, but I start repeating, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d over and over again. When Dean tries to pick me up, I kick at him. My foot connects with his face.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking whore!\u201d Dean is holding his cheek, growling at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for that.\u201d He\u2019s coming at me again. I stay down and kick at him. Dean dodges my feet and manages to grab my ankle. He drags me toward his truck. I twist around and try to crawl away. The asphalt shreds my palms to bits.</p><p>\u201cStop! Let me go!\u201d I\u2019m screaming. I\u2019m trying to fight back. I am not getting in that truck. I manage to twist my hips quickly and roll onto my back again. I kick hard and my heel jabs him in the balls.</p><p>As soon as Dean\u2019s hand is off my ankle, I roll over and crawl back to my bag. I find my keys, but before I can get up and run to my car, he hits me. Dean\u2019s hand strikes the side of my face. The keys go flying. I\u2019m sobbing and screaming. Snot and blood are mixing together. Dean is holding my face so hard that I can\u2019t pull away. My teeth are biting into my cheek drawing blood. I taste it inside my mouth.</p> <p>Dean\u2019s brow is covered in sweat. He hisses in my face, \u201cGet into the truck and I\u2019ll make this easy on you. Keep fighting back and your ride home will be much less enjoyable. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d One hand is on my face, holding me tight. The other slips between my legs, over my jeans, and he grabs me.</p><p>Instinct takes over. I\u2019m not the same girl I was four years ago. I\u2019d rather die than let him touch me again. I slam my head into his nose and hear it crack. Blood gushes everywhere. Dean growls so deeply that he sounds more animal than human.</p><p>I\u2019m running. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do, but I run back toward the English building. Halfway down the sidewalk I run straight into Peter. My body slams into his. He steadies me, holding my shoulders and I cry out.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes narrow and a look of fury spreads across his face when he notices the blood. It\u2019s everywhere. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here. Behind me in the parking lot.\u201d I can barely breathe.</p><p>Peter drops his things and pulls out his cell, punches in a number, but the call doesn\u2019t connect fast enough. He\u2019s looking around. He doesn\u2019t see them, but I do. I stiffen in Peter\u2019s arms. Sam and Dean are walking towards us. Peter is dressed in his suit pants and white button down shirt. His jacket is draped over his bag. He doesn\u2019t look threatening.</p> <p>Sam and Dean grin at each other when they see me with him. Peter steps in front of me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Which one of you did this to her?\u201d</p><p>Sam throws my bag at my feet. \u201cCut it out, Sidney. It\u2019s time to go. Pick up your shit and get in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going with you.\u201d I wipe my face with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an option,\u201d Sam says, his eyes flashing a warning at me.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t going with you,\u201d Peter repeats.</p><p>Sam steps toward Peter. \u201cI\u2019m her brother. I drove down here to get her and bring her home. Our mom needs her. I guess she didn\u2019t recognize Dean.\u201d He looks over at his friend and laughs. \u201cShe must have thought you were a mugger or something. She beat the shit out of you, man. Sid didn\u2019t even recognize her old boyfriend.\u201d He turns back to Peter and acts like what just occurred is normal and could have happened to anyone. Sam holds out his hand, gesturing for me to come. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. It\u2019s a long drive back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her brother?\u201d Peter asks. Sam looks at me and then nods. \u201cAnd you\u2019re her ex?\u201d Dean is holding his shirt to his nose, trying to stop the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what he said, shithead.\u201d Dean says it to Peter, but he\u2019s staring at me like he intends to rip me apart once we\u2019re alone.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s voice is so deep that it rumbles. His shoulders tense. He only says two words. \u201cLeave. Now.\u201d</p><p>Dean laughs and looks at Sam, and then back at Peter. \u201cOr what?\u201d Dean steps in front of Sam and keeps talking. He\u2019s so close to Peter. \u201cYou\u2019ll write me up? Any chance you have a little crush on my girl? Because she is my girl, Sidney will always be mine.\u201d He grins at me and my insides go cold. \u201cDid she tell you that we used to be an item? Did she tell you that she likes some messed up shit?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t respond. His hands are at his sides. The only reason that I can tell that he\u2019s upset is the way his fingers twitch every few seconds, as if he\u2019s.</p><p>Dean gazes past Peter, and gives me a look that makes me sick inside. \u201cOr did you already do her?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Sam is annoyed, \u201cCut it out, Dean. I don\u2019t want to hear what shit my sister does in bed.\u201d He snaps his fingers at me like I\u2019m a dog. \u201cCome. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer me?\u201d Dean smirks and presses his finger tips to Peter\u2019s chest. \u201cOr are you just pissed because she won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d He pushes Peter again. Harder this time.</p><p>Peter moves. In two steps he\u2019s behind Dean with his arm around his throat. Peter\u2019s hissing in Dean\u2019s ear, saying things too low for me to hear. Dean claws at his throat. He swings his elbow back, but doesn\u2019t do it hard enough to make Peter let go.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Sam yells. He gives me a look that I recognize all too well\u2014this is your fault. Sam throws a punch and hits Peter in the side. Peter lets go of Dean. Sam and Dean go at him.</p><p>I scream, bellowing like a banshee. I can\u2019t stop. The players down field stop and look toward us.</p><p>The three guys are fighting, but it seems as though Peter is getting overpowered. I don\u2019t know what to do. There are a few guys from the field hurrying towards us. Peter lands a hit on Sam\u2019s face. Something cracks. Sam drops back, yelling. Dean doesn\u2019t stop. His knife, that fucking knife, is in his hand. Peter\u2019s eyes lock on the knife and he backs away. Sam moves and is telling Dean to put it away, but Dean doesn\u2019t. He jabs it forward, narrowly missing Peter.</p><p>No, no, no. My bag is on the sidewalk. I see it, that silver pen, the one Millie gave me this morning. I race toward it and pick it up. I\u2019m so nervous that I can barely line up the cap with the mark on the side. It isn\u2019t a pen. It\u2019s her pepper spray. I shake the thing as I rush back toward Dean and Peter.</p><p>Peter sees me coming. I spray my brother. He screams and rubs his eyes, cursing at me. When Dean turns to see what\u2019s happened, the stream of liquid hits him in the face. Dean yells, clawing at his face and doubles over, dropping the knife. I kick it into the drainage ditch and tug at Peter.</p><p>\u201cTake me home. Now.\u201d I grab my bag, Peter grabs his, and we\u2019re running toward his car. The field full of guys sees us run past. They don\u2019t say anything. I recognize Mark. He sees my face, the blood. His eyes widen before they narrow. He pulls out his phone. I see him talking as we pull away.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Peter is breathing hard, his hand clutching the wheel. We\u2019re driving away from the college. \u201cAre you hurt?\u2019</p><p>My head is against the seat. My eyes are pinched shut. I nod. \u201cMy shoulder. I think it\u2019s not in the socket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a few minutes more, okay? I can fix that. I\u2019ll get you some pain medicine and you can call the cops from my place.\u201d He pulls into the parking lot and he helps me up the stairs. Peter has a cut on his cheek, but he looks pretty good. Me on the other hand, I look like hell.</p><p>When he sees me in the light, Peter nearly has a coronary. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it is his, not mine. I think I broke his nose with my face.\u201d I rub my forehead. \u201cMy head hurts. It feels like my brain is in a vice.\u201d We\u2019re in his apartment. I\u2019m standing in his living room with panic dripping through me. The feelings are still raging through me even though I\u2019m safe.</p><p>Peter hands me Advil. I take them and swallow the pills down. Peter explains what he\u2019s going to do to my shoulder because that does seem to be the problem. I tell him to do it. I cry out when it pops back in. \u201cThat hurt just as much as pulling it out.\u201d I rub my arm. There are tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter\u2019s hands are on me, gently sliding down my face, my arms. He\u2019s so careful. \u201cWhat did he do to you? Did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathe. My pulse is finally slowing down. \u201cHe said stuff and grabbed me. He didn\u2019t do anything else, besides try and shove me in his truck. All this happened because I wouldn\u2019t just go with him.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s fingers touch the ends of my hair. \u201cYou fought back. Good girl.\u201d He takes a deep breath and reaches for the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll call it in.\u201d</p><p>I take his hands and stop him. \u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up at me. \u201cSidney, you need to report this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam didn\u2019t do anything. It was Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam chose to help the wrong person. You don\u2019t owe him anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother. Peter, please. Let me think about it. I can\u2019t decide right now. Please don\u2019t, not right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watches me for a moment and nods. \u201cLet me look you over.\u201d He takes my hands and looks at my nails. A few of them are ripped all the way into the nail bed. Peter turns my hands over and looks at my scraped palms. When he looks back up at me, his eyes are filled with remorse. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have...\u201d his voice drifts off. Peter shakes his head and turns away. I sit down on the couch. Exhaustion is creeping up on me. Peter goes to the bathroom and comes back with the first aid kit and towels. He\u2019s breathing too hard. Peter doesn\u2019t look at my face. He takes my hands and turns them so the palms are up. His touch makes me feel so much better.</p> <p>My vision is blurry, but I finally look at his face. The cut on his cheek is deep. It looks like a piece of metal tore the skin away. I look down. Peter\u2019s hands are roughed up, too. There are too many things to say. I want to explain why I said no before. Even if I never saw Dean again, I\u2019d be dealing with this for the rest of my life. \u201cPeter, about earlier...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say. I understand. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He pours peroxide over my cuts and I flinch. His voice is cold, like he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I don\u2019t. I nod. I\u2019m a coward. After a moment, he asks, \u201cWhy did they want to take you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t say anything except that Mom sent them.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly, tending to my other hand. \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>I look down at him as if that was the stupidest thing he could have asked. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if it was just your brother?\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. \u201cMy brother thinks I like rough sex and that I was asking for it. He doesn\u2019t think that Dean hurt me. He doesn\u2019t believe that his friend used me.\u201d My jaw locks. I\u2019m defensive and I don\u2019t know why. I feel like Peter is saying what Dean said. I can\u2019t handle it. \u201cIs that what you think? You think that I liked it, that I wanted it?\u201d My arms are so tense that they jerk out of Peter\u2019s grip. I stand up and walk down the hall, not knowing where I\u2019m going. I want to scream.</p><p>Peter\u2019s behind me. His voice is soft, soothing \u201cI know that isn\u2019t true, Sidney. I know. I wish I could change it. I wish I could take away some of your pain. Sometimes, family helps, that\u2019s all. I wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t throwing away your hand to spite your arm.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cFuck you.\u201d My entire body is shaking with rage. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how I feel about this? You think that I haven\u2019t laid there every night since it happened wondering if I did this to myself? If all that shit he said was true? I thought it was. For a long time, I thought I did it, that I led him on. That\u2019s why it kept happening and every time was worse than the last. I let him rape, cut, and burn me. I let him do it over and over again. My parents loved him. They didn\u2019t defend me. My brother didn\u2019t even believe me, so don\u2019t pretend that you know a damn thing about it because you don\u2019t. You have no fucking clue!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m screaming. My hands are clenching into balls at my sides and I can\u2019t stop. I want to stop. I don\u2019t want things to be like this, but my mouth keeps going. Peter\u2019s eyes fall to the floor. He can\u2019t even look at me. I try so hard to stop shaking. My muscles are so tense, so tight. I have to control this. I have to hold myself together, but I can\u2019t. I feel the patches unraveling. I feel the weight of my pain tearing me apart. My bottom lip quivers. I bite it, but it doesn\u2019t stop. A sob bubbles up my throat. I turn away from Peter. I can\u2019t stand this. I can\u2019t stand that he sees this version of me. That\u2019s why I said no. That\u2019s why I turned him away. No matter what I do, this part of me will always be there. I bury my face in my hands and push the tears away.</p><p>Peter walks up behind me. His hand touches my shoulder gently. He turns me toward him as he speaks. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been through. I don\u2019t have a clue. I don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t even pretend to...\u201d</p> <p>I stare at his chest, at his bloody shirt. My hand reaches for him before I realize what I\u2019m doing. It laces around his waist and I lean into his chest. Peter\u2019s arms fold around me. He holds me and lets me cry. He lets me mourn everything I\u2019ve lost without making offers to fix something that he can\u2019t. Peter lets me weep a river of tears and holds me close.</p><p>Eventually, I notice his heartbeat. I listen to it thumping in his chest. It stills me, steadies me. I press my lips together too many times before asking, \u201cCan I stay here tonight?\u201d I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll say no. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve ruined everything and that he doesn\u2019t want me here anymore.</p><p>When he speaks, his voice is soft. \u201cOf course.\u201d His hand strokes the back of my head. Peter holds me until I let go. Then, he gives me towels and turns on the shower. He lays an oversized tee shirt on the bathroom counter. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any women\u2019s clothes, but that should be good enough for tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he leaves me alone.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>The scent of Peter fills my head as I lay in his bed. The room is warm and quiet. Peter\u2019s arms are around me and he\u2019s asleep. His gentle, slow, breathing makes me feel safe. It keeps away the horrors that happened tonight. They\u2019re fighting for me to replay the memories over and over again, which is why I don\u2019t sleep. I don\u2019t want to close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to remember.</p><p>I\u2019m on my back. Peter\u2019s arm is draped across my stomach. I\u2019m so tired. I watch him breathe, watch his chest rise and fall. Peter came to bed with a pair of pajama pants and no shirt. My eyes trace his muscles lazily. I wonder what it must be like for him, to be down here alone, and then run into a train wreck like me.</p><p>He\u2019s too good to me, too kind. Peter gave me his love and I threw it back in his face. He stirs and turns on his side. His hand drops to the bed between us. It makes his hips turn toward me. My eyes travel over his body, and rest on a jagged white scar at his waist. It\u2019s nearly on his back, but not quite. Seeing it makes my stomach sink. Something happened to him. It\u2019s not a surgical scar. It can\u2019t be. The line looks more like a Jack-O-Lantern\u2019s smile than anything else.</p> <p>As I\u2019m staring, Peter\u2019s eyes open. His tired gaze meets mine. Peter blinks slowly. \u201cAre you still up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Now that he\u2019s awake, I\u2019m nervous. My life is such a mess that I feel as though there isn\u2019t any room for him in it. But...</p><p>Peter holds open his arms and says, \u201cCome here.\u201d I do as he says. I scoot over to him and lay on his chest. Peter holds onto me. His body is so warm, so strong. I close my eyes and he strokes the back of my head. I moan without meaning too. He smiles. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I manage to reply. My mind tries to drift. Peter\u2019s scent fills my head. My heart knows it\u2019s where it needs to be, but my mind is at war with itself. It has a million reasons why we shouldn\u2019t be together, a million more about how much I\u2019ll hurt him. I mean, I\u2019m lying with the man in his bed and have no desire to have sex. There\u2019s nothing. No tingles, no anything.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour only comment should be Mmmmm.\u201d He rubs my head harder and I moan again. I giggle just a little. It sounds foreign to me, but not unwelcome. \u201cThat was cute. You can do that too.\u201d</p><p>I mutter something, not thinking, and curl into him. Peter rubs my head until I drift off.</p><p>When I open my eyes, I have no idea where I am. I dart upright, taking the sheet with me. Peter is next to me. He blinks himself awake. I turn and look at him. I woke him up. Again. What time is it? I glance around for a clock. \u201cIt\u2019s after nine!\u201d I\u2019ve missed my morning class. I go to throw my legs over the side of the bed and get up, but Peter takes my hand.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>Nerves lace up my neck and choke me. It\u2019s the same thing I asked him last night. I think about it, but my mind is screaming to run. I\u2019ll ruin everything. It\u2019s not fair, though. And last night meant so much to me. He took care of me, he protected me. If Peter hadn\u2019t shown up, I\u2019d be in Tennessee by now.</p><p>I smile at him. Peter smiles back.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I lay back down, but I feel nervous. I\u2019m more aware of everything today, of his bed, of his cologne, of him. I try not to think about it. I try to stop the jitters that are working their way up my arms. I pull up the sheet, covering myself. \u201cSo, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Peter lifts a brow. \u201cFirst, I want to tell you that I\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t hurt and that I think you should call the cops. But since I know you don\u2019t want to, I think we should have some coffee.\u201d</p><p>My face pales. Is he joking? I manage to choke out, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at me funny, and then laughs. \u201cNo! Not like that. I mean real coffee, in real cups, and everything.\u201d He\u2019s still smiling. Reaching for me, Peter tucks a curl behind my ear. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds good, as long as we\u2019re being literal.\u201d I smile, feeling shy. When I glance up at him my eyes fall on the scar by his waist.</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile vanishes. \u201cI forgot about that.\u201d He rolls onto his back and covers his face with his hands and rubs. \u201cYou want to know what happened, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit...\u201d</p><p>He pushes onto his side and pulls up the sheet so I can\u2019t see the marred skin. \u201cI want to know some things about you.\u201d</p><p>The way he says it makes me worried. But I want him to say whatever he\u2019s thinking. \u201cGo ahead and ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night you said something\u2014that your ex cut you. I didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d Peter looks into my eyes. His fingers trail along my cheek as he speaks. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to say. He was twisted. He\u2019d tie me up and tell me not to yell. That was the first time. It gave him a rush, I guess. I kind of thought it was fun at first. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do and it made my heart race faster. He used to kiss me, after he tied my hands, but then one day he didn\u2019t. He changed things. He slid his knife down my hip and said that he\u2019d cut me if I screamed.\u201d My eyes dart to the side. I can\u2019t look at Peter while I say it. \u201cHe took things further one day. His hand went down my pants while he hand the knife to my neck. It scared me. I made a sound and he...\u201d I take a breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone, not really. My parents didn\u2019t hear all of it.\u201d I shrug. Nerves are swimming in my stomach. \u201cMaybe telling someone will help me get over it.\u201d Peter smiles at me, but it\u2019s sad, like he knows what I mean. I finish the story. \u201cHe nicked me, here.\u201d I point to my neck. There\u2019s a scar that sits at the base of my throat, right by my collar bone.</p><p>I take a deep breath and ask, \u201cWhere\u2019d the scar on your side come from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA knife. It came from a knife.\u201d Peter\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then he starts telling me. \u201cIt\u2019s from the night I proposed. I was down on one knee. Gina had her hands to her mouth, surprised, and smiling so big. She was looking at me, at the ring I held out. We were talking, saying things. She didn\u2019t get to answer me...\u201d His eyes glaze over while he speaks. I can almost see the memory in his eyes. \u201cI felt a sharp pain in my side as the ring was grabbed out of my hand. Some guys had been watching us. They did it. The guy that stabbed me twisted the knife. That\u2019s why it looks like that.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. There are tears in my eyes. \u201cOh, my God. Peter...\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for a moment. Then Peter asks, \u201cWant to keep going?\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but I nod. His eyes flick up to mine. \u201cAre you afraid to have sex after everything that happened?\u201d</p><p>My face flames red. My mouth opens and snaps shut again. \u201cI want to say no. I want to say something, anything, else, but I can\u2019t.\u201d I look at him, wondering what I should say, if I should tell him how messed up I am. Dean broke me. I can\u2019t imagine being normal anymore. Even when I was sitting with Peter the first day I met him, it wasn\u2019t the way it\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>I smile, but my lips won\u2019t hold it. They twitch instead. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to have sex. It\u2019s not the action, well, not totally. I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t like it. I\u2019m afraid my mind will be stuck in the past somewhere and not here with you.</p> <p>\u201cAs it is, I don\u2019t feel like it, not really. I laid here next to you all night, and I don\u2019t know if you know this or not, but you\u2019re kind of hot.\u201d He smiles. His eyes lock with mine and hold my gaze. I want to tell him everything. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it. I never seem to want more than kisses or your hands on my face. When I think about other things,\u201d I shiver and shake my head. I press my lips together nervously and look up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t image feeling that way again. And last time was such a horrible mistake, how will I know? What if I make the same mistake again? What if...what if you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>Peter takes my hand and pulls it to his lips. He kisses the center of my palm and looks into my eyes. \u201cI will never, ever, hurt you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I know that for sure? Dean didn\u2019t start out that way, I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He holds my hand between his and looks me in the eye. \u201cI am sure. I\u2019m not like that. Most guys aren\u2019t like that. That isn\u2019t love, Sidney. He was using you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t swallow. I nod a little too frantically. \u201cCan you prove that you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, other than showing you how I feel about you. I love you. If you wanted to be with me, I\u2019d wait for you. We don\u2019t have to have sex, not right away, and not until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>I feel sick inside. I can\u2019t look at him. My voice is weak, \u201cI\u2019ll never be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll always be waiting.\u201d He smiles at me and leans forward and kisses my nose. It makes me look up at him. My eyelashes flutter too much and I smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you, be anything you need. I just don\u2019t want to let you go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>I must have dozed off because I wake up again a few hours later. Peter is talking on the other side of the bedroom door. It\u2019s cracked, letting a little bit of light from the hallway spill inside. I stretch and push back the covers. My hands hurt. I forgot they were torn up. Stretching reminds me that my body will not be my friend today. I ache all over.</p><p>Rubbing my eyes, I pad across the room to the door. I watch Peter for a second. He has the phone to his ear and he\u2019s talking softly.</p><p>\u201cI know what it means.\u201d He pauses and pushes his hair back, away from his eyes. His brow is pinched. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that. Have you ever found someone that sees right through you? When she looks at me... It\u2019s like we were thrown together, like my life didn\u2019t turn into a pile of shit for no reason. I can\u2019t leave her. I don\u2019t expect you to understand. I just wanted you to know that it wasn\u2019t a whim.\u201d Peter shakes his head as if he can\u2019t handle what the other person is saying. \u201cI won\u2019t be coming back, but thank you all the same. I\u2019ll come by later and empty out my office.\u201d He takes the phone from his ear and presses a button, then tosses it on the table.</p><p>I feel bad for watching him. Peter senses me. He turns and sees me standing in the doorway. \u201cHey. Feel any better?\u201d</p><p>I give a weak smile and walk toward him. \u201cA little bit. Thanks for letting me sleep.\u201d I look at him, wondering who he was talking to. Peter seems rattled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes meet mine. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Then he takes a slow breath and says, \u201cThey want me to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I look up at him. I already know who, but I want to make sure.</p><p>\u201cThe University. That was Strictland. She said that she didn\u2019t file my resignation, that I\u2019m making a mistake.\u201d Peter runs his hands through his hair and then down his neck. He sighs and looks straight at me.</p><p>I feel guilty. My stomach twists. I didn\u2019t want this. I\u2019m messing up his life. \u201cYou guys sound close.\u201d I wonder about that.</p><p>He nods. \u201cWe were at the same university when I did my undergrad. Before she relocated here, Strictland oversaw my internships and wrote my recommendations for grad school. I was her TA, too. I got to know her since I was around her every day. That\u2019s how I got the job here. She shoulder tapped me for another position. When Tadwick passed away, she moved me into his classroom.\u201d He folds his arms over his chest. When he looks at me again, he adds, \u201cI was kind of close to Strictland back then. She knew me before everything happened.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart to his side, to that scar, but it\u2019s covered by a white tee shirt. When my gaze flicks back to his face, I nod. \u201cYou should go back.\u201d He laughs, like he thinks I\u2019m kidding. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Peter. I can\u2019t do this to you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Some asshole in New York did this to me. Someone they didn\u2019t even find stole my life from me. It wasn\u2019t you. If anything, you gave me a second chance.\u201d He sighs and steps toward me. Peter takes my hand and pulls me to the couch. I follow, feeling a little more than exposed in my tee shirt. We sit down. He turns toward me. \u201cI need to know what you want to do about last night.\u201d</p><p>I bristle. \u201cI\u2019m not calling the police.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and takes my hand. He pulls it into his lap. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. Do you want to\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Before he can finish, there\u2019s a loud thud as someone pounds on the door. I know who it is before he speaks. \u201cOpen the goddamn door! I know she\u2019s in there.\u201d Sam\u2019 voice fills the room.</p><p>Peter looks at me and then back at the door. The pounding stops. Silence follows. The door is a few feet away. Peter gets up and looks out the peep hole, then comes back to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your brother. Do you want me to let him in?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is tight. His fingers flex into fists and reopen.</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s not there?\u201d Peter shakes his head. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to talk to Sam, but I have to get him to leave me alone. \u201cWait a second.\u201d I get up and find my jeans. I pull them on under Peter\u2019s shirt and smooth my hair a little bit. This is going to look wrong, but I realize that I don\u2019t care what he thinks. Sam pounds on the door again. I nod at Peter and he opens it. Sam\u2019s hand flies through the air when the door is suddenly yanked open.</p><p>Peter glares at him. \u201cIf you try to take her again, I will kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Sam smirks. \u201cLike last night? If I recall correctly, my sister saved your ass.\u201d</p><p>Peter is through being nice. I can see something snap inside of him. Instead of answering, Peter grabs Sam by the throat and pushes him into the wall hard. He hisses something in his ear that I can\u2019t hear. Sam\u2019s eyes widen. His face is turning red. He can\u2019t breathe. Peter drops my brother, then slams the front door shut.</p><p>Peter folds his chiseled arms over his chest and says, \u201cYou have two minutes. Talk.\u201d</p><p>Sam is leery of Peter. I can tell that he doesn\u2019t like this, that he doesn\u2019t want to talk in front of Peter, but he does anyway. \u201cSorry about Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I don\u2019t want to hear it. What do you want?\u201d I snap. We\u2019re both standing, staring at each other. He\u2019s my twin. We were so close once. He knew what I thought and how I felt, but I don\u2019t know him anymore. He chose his jackass friend over me. I fold my arms over my chest and stare at him. Sam\u2019s eyes cut to the side. He glances at Peter. \u201cJust say it.\u201d</p><p>Sam looks at my shoes. He\u2019s silent.</p><p>The little muscles on the side of Peter\u2019s jaw are twitching. He says, \u201cOne minute.\u201d</p><p>Sam scowls at Peter. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a minute! What the fuck, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care and you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d Peter glares at him.</p><p>Sam finally says something, and gives me an indication as to why he\u2019s here. \u201cMom\u2019s sick, like really sick. She\u2019s been asking for you. I told her that I\u2019d find you and bring you home. You can\u2019t send me back without you. Please, sis. She\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want this news to affect me, but it does. My arms drop to my sides. \u201cWhen? How long has this been going on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tilts his head to the side. It\u2019s his are you a moron face. \u201cI sent you letters. It got a lot worse a few months ago. I found you last Christmas. I knew something wasn\u2019t right, but I didn\u2019t want to make Mom worse. When she started asking for you, I started writing you, asking you to come home. Way to blow me off.\u201d</p><p>I watch him. There are too many emotions boiling beneath the surface. \u201cI didn\u2019t open the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p> <p>I glare at him. \u201cYou seriously want me to answer that? You\u2019re dead to me, all of you. I don\u2019t want anything to do with any of you. And why the hell are you still hanging out with Dean? Look what he did to me last night! Look!\u201d I hold up my hands so he can see my palms. They\u2019re covered in scabs. \u201cThis is nothing compared to what he used to do. How could you bring him here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Peter turns and yells in Sam\u2019s face. \u201cAre you that stupid? Look at your sister and tell me that she liked getting her skin ripped off last night. Say it, asshole.\u201d Peter pushes Sam\u2019s shoulders, but Sam doesn\u2019t push back. Whatever Peter said to him before still has Sam spooked.</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes flick to mine. \u201cJust come home.\u201d He turns and leaves without another word. Peter shuts the door behind him. When Peter turns to look at me, I feel like I\u2019m falling apart. I don\u2019t understand how or why I even care. I have no more tears. I reach behind me, and fall down onto the couch nauseated.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did he have to come here and tell me that? I can\u2019t go. I can\u2019t face them. Not after everything that happened.\u201d I\u2019m taking to myself, saying a million reasons why I can\u2019t do it.</p> <p>After a few moments, I feel Peter sit down next to me. I\u2019m staring straight ahead, seeing nothing. I don\u2019t know what to do, and I don\u2019t know why. \u201cThere\u2019s only one question here, Sidney. Will you regret not saying good-bye to your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t face them. I can\u2019t manage them and Dean, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d I glance up at him, surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019d send you alone? Not with those two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say to him?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins wickedly, and shakes his head. \u201cNot telling. That\u2019s my little secret. I was holding back last night. I didn\u2019t want to hurt either of them. I didn\u2019t want to cause you more pain or make you feel more conflicted about me than you already do. I warned Sam that I won\u2019t hold back again. No one will hurt you, not while I\u2019m around.\u201d His eyes are so blue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this life. I want a refund.\u201d I grip my face in my hands. I don\u2019t know what to do. Part of me wants to go. My mom has never said she needed me before. If she really said that, I should go, but I don\u2019t know if Sam is lying.</p> <p>Peter wraps his arms around me and pulls me to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want a refund.\u201d His words shock me. Peter\u2019s been through hell and back. I sit up and look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do it over again?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My mouth drops open into a little O. I can\u2019t stand my life. I\u2019d trade it in a second. I feel like a piece of tissue paper that\u2019s been torn and glued back together too many times. There\u2019s no tissue left. All the color is gone. I\u2019m a mass of scars and glue. The pieces of me that remain are battered and broken.</p><p>I watch Peter\u2019s face. I don\u2019t understand how he can say that he\u2019d knowingly sign up for this.</p><p>He smiles at me and touches my cheek. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give any of it up. I know who I am. I know what matters to me. Those things shaped me, they changed me. I wouldn\u2019t do it differently. I wouldn\u2019t give it up.\u201d He leans in close to me, his lips right by mine. He whispers to me, \u201cAnd, I\u2019d do it exactly the same way again if I was given another chance, because in the end, it led me to you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s courage gives me strength. I didn\u2019t know I felt this way. I didn\u2019t think that I could take my life back, not after having it violently ripped away.</p><p>I know what I need to do. Running away didn\u2019t work. My past found me. It will always find me. I\u2019ll never be free, not unless I face the pain I tried to leave behind.</p> <p>I have to go home and face my past. </p> </body></html>"]
