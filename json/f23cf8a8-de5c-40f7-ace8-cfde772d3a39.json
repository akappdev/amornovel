THE BIGGEST DAMNED POLAR bear anyone had ever seen in or around Prudhoe Bay in the last twenty-five years, or so it was reported.</p><p>Arrogance got him killed, though, and if William Emmett Harrington hadn\u2019t been such a narcissist, he might still be alive. But he was a narcissist, and he was also a braggart.</p><p>The only topic of conversation William was interested in was William, and since he hadn\u2019t accomplished much of anything significant in his twenty-eight years on earth, he was painfully boring.</p> <p>William lived off his inheritance, a hefty trust fund set up by his grandfather, Henry Emmett Harrington, who must have had an inkling of the lazy-ass gene he was passing down, because his son, Morris Emmett Harrington, didn\u2019t work a day in his life. And William happily followed in his father\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>Like all the Harrington men before him, William was a handsome devil and knew it. He didn\u2019t have any trouble getting women into his bed, but he could never lure any of them back for a repeat performance. No wonder. William treated sex like a race he had to win in order to prove that he was the best, and because he really was a narcissist, he didn\u2019t care about satisfying his partner. What he wanted was all that mattered.</p><p>His past conquests had come up with various nicknames for him. Pig was one. Quick Trip was another. But the one that was uttered most behind his back was The Minute Man. All the women who had gone to bed with him knew exactly what that meant.</p><p>Besides self-gratification, William\u2019s other passion was running. He\u2019d made it a full-time job because, as with sex, he was shockingly fast. In the past year he had accumulated twenty-four first-place prizes within a six-state area, and he was about to enter a 5K race in his hometown of Chicago to collect his twenty-fifth. Since he believed crossing the finish line first was going to be a momentous event that everyone in Chicago would want to read about, he called the Chicago Tribune and suggested they do a feature article about him in the Sunday paper. Harrington also mentioned more than once how photogenic he was and how a full-color photo of him would enhance the article.</p><p>One of the local news editors at the Tribune took the call and patiently listened to William\u2019s pitch, then bounced him to one of the entertainment editors, who quickly bounced him to one of the sports columnists, who bounced him to one of the health and fitness editors, who wrote an entire article on the top-five allergens plaguing Chicago while he listened to the spiel. None of them was impressed or interested. The last editor to speak to William suggested that he give him a call back when he had ninety-nine wins under his belt and was going for one hundred.</p> <p>William wasn\u2019t discouraged. He immediately called the Chicago Sun Times and explained his idea for a story. He was rejected yet again.</p><p>William realized he was going to have to lower his expectations if he wanted to see his name in print, and so he contacted the Illinois Chronicle, a small but popular neighborhood newspaper that focused primarily on local issues and entertainment.</p><p>The editor in chief, Herman Anthony Bitterman, was an antacid-popping seasoned veteran of the press with a pronounced Brooklyn accent. For thirty years he had been on the foreign desk of The New York Times and had garnered several prestigious honors including the RFK Journalism Award and the Polk Award, but when his good-for-nothing son-in-law ran off with another woman\u2014his daughter\u2019s yoga instructor, for the love of God\u2014Herman retired from the Times and moved with his wife, Marissa, to Chicago where she had grown up and where their daughter now lived with her four little girls.</p><p>A newsman at heart, Herman couldn\u2019t stay retired long. When the opportunity presented itself, he took the job at the Chronicle as a distraction from boredom and an escape from the horde of meddling in-laws.</p><p>He liked Chicago. He\u2019d gone to Northwestern University, where he\u2019d met Marissa. After graduation, they had returned to his hometown, New York, so he could take a job at the Times. Coming back to Chicago after decades in New York was a real adjustment. He had lived in a cramped two-bedroom Manhattan apartment for so long that a two-story brownstone took some getting used to. His only real complaint was the lack of noise. He missed falling asleep to the soothing sounds of cars screeching, horns blaring, and sirens shrieking.</p><p>With so much quiet, even at the office, Herman found it difficult to get any work done. To compensate, he brought in an old television set from home, plopped it on top of his mini refrigerator, and left it on all day with the volume turned up.</p> <p>When the call came in from William Harrington, Herman hit the mute button before picking up the phone. While he ate his lunch\u2014an Italian sausage and green pepper sandwich drenched in ketchup and washed down with an icy cold Kelly\u2019s Root Beer\u2014he listened to Harrington pitch his story idea.</p><p>It took Bitterman all of half a minute to sum up William Harrington. The man was an egomaniac.</p><p>\u201cRed, huh? You always wear red socks and a red T-shirt for every race. And white shorts. Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Even when you run in the winter? Still wear the shorts?\u201d</p><p>His question encouraged Harrington to ramble more, allowing Bitterman time to finish his sandwich. He took a long swig of his root beer, then interrupted Harrington\u2019s grandiose opinion of himself and said, \u201cYeah, sure. We\u2019ll do the story. Why not?\u201d</p><p>After scribbling down the particulars, Bitterman disconnected the call, then wadded up his brown lunch sack and tossed it into the trash can.</p><p>He crossed the office to get to the door\u2014a no small feat considering nearly every inch of the room was filled with crates of Kelly\u2019s Old-Fashioned Root Beer stacked halfway to the ceiling. Since his door wasn\u2019t blocked, his office hadn\u2019t been deemed a fire hazard, at least not yet. He was hoarding what was left of Kelly\u2019s Root Beer because, in his estimation, it was the best damned root beer he had ever tasted, and when he\u2019d heard the company had been forced to close its doors and was going out of business, he had done what any root beer addict would do and rushed out to buy as many bottles of the stuff as he could get his hands on.</p><p>\u201cBlond Girl!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019ve got another story for you. This one\u2019s a humdinger.\u201d</p><p>Sophie Summerfield Rose tried to ignore Bitterman\u2019s bellow as she put the finishing touches on an article she was about to e-mail him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Sophie, I think Bitterman\u2019s calling you.\u201d</p><p>Gary Warner, a brute of a man and the office snitch, leaned over her cubicle. His smile reminded Sophie of a cartoon fox with his teeth bared. He looked a bit like a fox, too. His nose was long and pointy, and his complexion was as dull as his long straggly hair. Mullets had never really been in style, but Gary loved his and used so much hair spray on it, it looked starched.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the only female here today and since you\u2019re the only blonde in the entire office, I\u2019m pretty sure \u2018Blond Girl\u2019 means you.\u201d He had a good laugh over what he considered a hilarious observation.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t respond. No matter how obnoxious Gary became, and he had cornered the market on obnoxious a long time ago, she refused to let him rile her. She carefully pushed her chair back so she wouldn\u2019t hit the file cabinet again. It already had so many dents, it looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to it.</p><p>The Chronicle was housed in an old warehouse. It was a huge, gray stone building with gray cement floors, gray brick walls, and a dingy gray ceiling that Sophie suspected had once been white. The fluorescent lighting was nearly as old as the building. The presses were in the basement. Circulation and the other departments were on the first floor, and the editorial offices were on the second floor. It was a huge space, yet each gray-paneled cubicle, including hers, was the size of a refrigerator. A side-by-side, but still a refrigerator.</p><p>The Chronicle could have been a depressing place to work, but it wasn\u2019t. Colorful posters hung above the gray file cabinets that lined the far wall, and each cubicle was brightly decorated. Some were more creative than others, but each gave a hint of the occupant\u2019s personality.</p><p>Gary\u2019s cubicle was decorated with half-eaten sandwiches and pastries, some at least a week old. He wouldn\u2019t let the cleaning crew touch his desk, and Sophie didn\u2019t think it had ever been cleared of the clutter. She wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find roaches skittering under all the garbage, but Gary probably wouldn\u2019t have minded. He was most likely related to some of them.</p><p>Still hanging over her cubicle wall, his frame was so large she thought he might just snap the panels. When Sophie stood, Gary was entirely too close, his rancid aftershave overwhelming.</p><p>So that he couldn\u2019t snoop while she was in Bitterman\u2019s office, Sophie turned her computer off and made sure he saw her do it. She wasn\u2019t being paranoid. Just last week she had caught him sitting at her desk trying to get around her password to access her e-mail. He had already rifled through her desk. Two drawers were open, and he hadn\u2019t bothered to put the stack of papers back where she had left them. When she demanded to know what he was doing at her desk, he stammered lamely about his computer being down and how he was checking to see if hers was down, too.</p><p>Bitterman roared again, and Sophie, feeling somewhat like a mouse navigating a maze, hurriedly zigzagged her way around the cubicles to reach his office at the end of the long room. She pictured a piece of yellow cheese dangling from a string in front of her boss\u2019s door. Wasn\u2019t that the reward for the little mouse at the end of the maze?</p><p>\u201cHey, Sophie, heard from your father lately?\u201d Gary shouted from behind.</p><p>He had asked her that same question about ten minutes after she had started working at the Chronicle, which was probably why she had taken such a quick dislike to him. Not only was Gary a snoop, but at times he could be downright antagonistic. Usually, people skirted around the subject of her dad, Bobby Rose, when they first met Sophie, but not Gary. She had just started writing her first article when Gary had called over the cubicle wall, \u201cHey, Sophie Rose...oops, it\u2019s Sophie Summerfield, isn\u2019t it? I forgot, you\u2019re not using your daddy\u2019s name. Guess you don\u2019t want the world to know who you are, huh? I wouldn\u2019t either if my old man was a crook. Who\u2019s he scammed lately? Heard he\u2019s made off with a butt-load of money. If you ever see him again, tell him ol\u2019 Gary could sure use a loan. Tell him a couple of million would do just fine....\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t answered him then or the hundred or so other times he\u2019d asked about her father, and she wasn\u2019t about to answer him now.</p><p>Gary wasn\u2019t the only one interested in finding her father. She received regular visits from the FBI, the IRS, the CIA, and just about every other government agency with initials. All of them wanted to know where Bobby Rose was; all of them wanted a pound of his flesh.</p><p>She heard Gary call out his question again, but she continued to ignore him as she rounded the last cubicle and reached Bitterman\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cShut the door, will you,\u201d Bitterman ordered. He didn\u2019t bother looking up.</p><p>The urge to slam the door was strong, and though it would have given her enormous satisfaction for a fleeting second, with her luck these days she\u2019d break the glass and Bitterman would make her pay to replace it. Besides, if truth be told, she actually liked her boss. For all his bluster and bellowing, he was a good man. He loved his wife and family, and he cared about his employees, too, at least most of them.</p><p>One of her conditions for accepting her job at the Chronicle was that Bitterman wouldn\u2019t pressure her to talk or write about her father, which was the reason she had left her last job. Bitterman had given her his word, and so far he\u2019d kept it. He\u2019d taken his promise a step further, too. He shielded her as much as he could from what he called those blasted, sleazy, rag mag, bottom-feeders\u2014he absolutely refused to call them journalists\u2014who continually hounded her for an interview. Bitterman also attempted, but failed miserably, to protect her from the FBI, citing every amendment and law he could think of that would give her the right to be left alone.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t be slamming any doors today. No matter how much he aggravated her, Sophie would treat Mr. Bitterman with the respect he deserved. She gently pushed the door shut, stepped around a crate of root beer, and waited for him to look up from the stack of papers he was bent over.</p><p>\u201cSir, you really have to stop calling me Blond Girl. It\u2019s sexist, rude, and demeaning. I\u2019ve worked here long enough for you to know my name, but just for fun, let\u2019s go over it one more time. Sophie Summerfield Rose. There. Not so difficult to remember, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re using your mother\u2019s maiden name on your bylines. Summerfield, right?\u201d</p><p>Since she had just reminded him of her full name, she didn\u2019t feel it necessary to answer.</p><p>Bitterman couldn\u2019t help but notice she was still frowning. \u201cAll right. No more Blond Girl. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He considered her for a long minute and then said, \u201cSophie, everyone in Chicago knows who you are. You\u2019re Bobby Rose\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am his daughter,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t believe everyone in Chicago knows, which is why I use my mother\u2019s maiden name on my articles.\u201d</p><p>He tried to lean back in his chair, but the crates of root beer stopped him.</p><p>Not wanting to continue the conversation about her father, she hastily said, \u201cI finished that piece on termite infestation you wanted. It\u2019s riveting. I e-mailed it to you a minute ago. Do you have anything else disgusting for me to research and write about? Sewage? Vermin? The mating habits of beetles?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhy, Sophie Rose, are you giving me attitude? I think maybe you are. I know it when I hear it. I get enough sass from my eight granddaughters. I don\u2019t need to hear it from my employees, not even from my favorite one.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSir, you have four granddaughters, not eight.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his root beer. \u201cWhen they\u2019re all chattering away at me, it seems like eight. And yes, I do happen to have something else for you. A man named William Harrington called and pitched a story idea. You ever run a 5K?\u201d</p><p>He explained the human interest story, told her how long he thought the copy should be, handed her his notes, and said, \u201cCall him and set up a time to meet before the race. Maybe you could get a couple of photos of him, too. Yeah, do some before and after shots. You know, get a good one of him starting off and one of him crossing the finish line. Harrington swore to me that he\u2019s photogenic. He seemed to think being good-looking was important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t Matt take the photos? He\u2019s always telling everyone here that he\u2019s the official photographer for the Chronicle; I\u2019d hate to upset him. You know how he can be.\u201d She didn\u2019t say the word \u201cneurotic,\u201d but she thought it. \u201cThe more excited he gets, the higher his voice goes. He could break glass if he tried. With all these root beer bottles, it would be a disaster.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bitterman nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Matt should take the photos...if he were still working here. He quit on me. Gave me his notice last night and told me he didn\u2019t want to stick around this dump\u2014his words, not mine\u2014for two more weeks. He said it was a waste of his valuable time. That\u2019s right...his valuable time. He cleared out his cubicle lickety split.\u201d Bitterman waved his hands, one over the other, like a professional card dealer signaling to the ceiling cameras in a casino. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has another job lined up. He told me he wanted to take important photos for important articles.\u201d</p><p>Sophie hadn\u2019t known Matt well. She\u2019d only worked with him on a couple of stories, and both times he\u2019d thrown a territorial tantrum.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, he was a lousy photographer anyway,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cAlways cutting off the top of people\u2019s heads, and besides, you\u2019ve got a better camera than the Chronicle\u2019s ancient one. I think Jimmy Olsen used one like it in that Superman movie. And those photos you took last month of the kitchen makeover were good, real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it my best try,\u201d she said. She was looking at his notes, trying to decipher his chicken scratches. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t tell...when is the race?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d He put a hand up to ward off any argument she wanted to give. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. It\u2019s short notice.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cShort notice? Tomorrow\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat can I tell you? It\u2019s obvious we weren\u2019t Harrington\u2019s first choice...or second or third, I\u2019m guessing. The guy just called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have time to do much of a background check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already got this Sunday locked in, so we won\u2019t run it until next Sunday, and if Harrington turns out to be a wacko, it might even make for a more interesting article. You\u2019re not going for the Pulitzer here. Do what you can, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, if the guy really is a flake, we\u2019ll run something else. Time\u2019s a-wasting. Better get going.\u201d</p> <p>She was pulling the door closed behind her when he said, \u201cYou know the drill. Meet him in a public place, and better yet, take a friend with you. Be safe, not sorry.\u201d</p><p>He always said those exact words to her whenever she left on an assignment. Be safe, not sorry. The ritual was actually comforting. Bitterman, she decided, had a duel personality. One minute he was barking orders like a mad Doberman, and the next he was playing the part of an overly protective mother hen. At least she thought that was how a mother would act. She didn\u2019t have enough experience to know.</p><p>In her cubicle, Sophie typed \u201cWilliam Harrington\u201d into a search engine and within seconds all sorts of information about him popped up on screen. The man had his own website, a blog, and would soon, according to his entry, have a video of himself on MySpace, YouTube, and Facebook. He\u2019d written long essays on his childhood, his summers in Europe\u2014which should have been interesting but weren\u2019t\u2014and on his fitness campaign.</p><p>Sophie wouldn\u2019t have any trouble recognizing Harrington. There were dozens of photos of him on his website.</p><p>After making a few notes about his other 5K wins, she called him. He must have been waiting to hear from her because he answered on the first ring. Sophie thought it would take only a few minutes to set up a time and place to meet, but Harrington was a talker and kept her on the line for a good fifteen minutes before he finally got around to scheduling their interview.</p><p>\u201cOf course you know the race is tomorrow, so we\u2019ll have to meet tonight. I hope you\u2019re a morning person because the 5K starts early, and you\u2019ll want to be there, right? With a photographer,\u201d he added in a rush. \u201cThe race is in Lincoln Park, so how about tonight we meet someplace around there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about Cosmo\u2019s Pub?\u201d she asked and gave him the address.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Cosmo\u2019s. I go to more upscale restaurants. But that\u2019s just a few blocks from where the race will start tomorrow. We could meet at seven. No, better make it six-thirty to give us more time. Does six-thirty work for you? I need to get to bed early. I want to be in top form tomorrow, especially since I\u2019m going to be filmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s filming the race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re going to film me running the race,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThey\u2019ll stay with me the whole way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to put the video on your website?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The man sounded serious. Who besides William Harrington would watch it? she wondered.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re paying someone to film the entire race?\u201d she asked, still doubting.</p> <p>He spoke at the same time. \u201cTwenty-five wins is more than impressive, at least to some very important people it is. After the trial, there will be another video on my website, and that one will, no doubt, be just as impressive. Twenty-five wins is a huge accomplishment. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Running the Boston marathon was impressive, and finishing that race was definitely an accomplishment. But a 5K? Not so much. Sophie kept her opinion to herself, though, because she didn\u2019t want to squelch his enthusiasm or antagonize him. Harrington had an ego the size of Illinois, but he was polite and eager and seemed harmless enough.</p><p>Getting him to stop talking about himself proved to be a challenge, and time was slipping away. It was already after three.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean when you said there will be another video after the trial? What trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been invited to join the Alpha Project. It\u2019s very exclusive,\u201d he boasted. \u201cOnly the fittest are asked, and I plan to break a record with this race. I\u2019m going to shave off a couple of minutes. Bring a stopwatch if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>When he finally took a breath, she blurted, \u201cSo much to talk about tonight. I\u2019ll see you at six-thirty. Bye now.\u201d</p><p>He was still talking as she disconnected the call. She quickly gathered her things and raced around the cubicles to get to the elevator. In her hurry she nearly ran headfirst into a delivery man wheeling a dolly with yet more crates of Kelly\u2019s Root Beer. She pointed the way to Bitterman\u2019s office.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 2</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We\u2019re ready to head north. After years of studying the arctic wolves in captivity, Brandon and Kirk will finally be able to observe these glorious animals in their natural habitat. Eric and I are novices, but our excitement matches theirs. If everything goes as planned, we\u2019ll know much more about the socialization of this subspecies as well as their adaptation to their environment, which is what I\u2019m most interested in.</p><p>Not looking forward to the cold, but the information we\u2019ll be able to contribute to the scientific community about these mysterious creatures will be worth any personal sacrifices we may have to make.</p><p>Who knows? We might become famous.</p><p>TWO</p><p>ALL HE WANTED WAS A CHEESEBURGER.</p><p>Agent Jack MacAlister had just completed a grueling two-day undercover assignment in one of Chicago\u2019s toughest neighborhoods, and he was tired and dirty and hungry. The last thing he needed as he walked into the burger joint was to interrupt an armed robbery.</p><p>With a single shot through the center of the heart, Jack\u2019s bullet propelled the man backward, away from the teenage girl he was holding hostage, and slammed him into the wall. A single stream of blood oozed down the perp\u2019s dirty T-shirt.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t have to kill the other one. A couple of swift moves, and he was able to disarm the guy and get him facedown on the floor. He held him there with a foot on the back of his neck.</p><p>Outside, Jack\u2019s partner, Alec Buchanan, heard the gunshot. Drawing his weapon as he deftly slid over the hood of his car, Alec raced to the door. Inside the restaurant, bedlam had erupted. The teenage girl was screaming at the top of her lungs and backing away from Jack. When she turned and saw Alec\u2014though it didn\u2019t seem humanly possible\u2014her screams got even louder. It was apparent that she was as terrified of them as she had been of the men who would have killed her.</p><p>Jack held up his badge. \u201cFBI!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re okay now. You can stop screaming. You too, ma\u2019am,\u201d he added to the nearly hysterical woman fanning herself with a limp napkin and bouncing up and down as though she were doing some sort of manic jumping jacks.</p><p>Alec dug his badge out of his pocket and held it up as he made his way over to his partner. He squatted down next to the dead body. \u201cNice shot,\u201d he remarked when he saw where the bullet had penetrated.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Jack replied quietly, so only Alec would hear. The man he was holding down started squirming. \u201cYou get up, and I\u2019m just gonna mow you down again.\u201d</p><p>Alec put his foot down hard on the base of the man\u2019s spine to get him to stop moving.</p><p>Three police cars, sirens blaring, screeched to a stop in the parking lot. To keep from getting riddled with bullets, Jack and Alec continued to hold up their badges. Since the two of them had just been doing undercover work, with their greasy long hair and scraggly beards, they looked more like deranged killers than agents of the FBI.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what happened?\u201d Jack asked Alec as he tilted his head toward the man he\u2019d killed.</p><p>\u201cI figured he didn\u2019t get your order right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hopped up on something. God only knows what. He was gonna kill the girl, no question.\u201d He glanced down and shifted his stance so that more of his weight pressed on the captive. \u201cThis guy\u2019s eyes are so dilated they look like saucers.\u201d</p><p>Alec noticed another teenager holding up his cell phone. He wondered how long the kid had been taking video. Muttering an expletive, he turned his back on the teenager and said, \u201cWe just blew our cover. How much you want to bet we\u2019re on the Internet within the hour?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cThe job was done today anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Alec stepped aside as the police swarmed through the door.</p><p>The first officer knelt beside the body. \u201cIt\u2019s Jessup,\u201d he called to the others.</p><p>A couple of policemen came closer to take a look. \u201cSon of a gun,\u201d one of them said. \u201cNever thought he\u2019d be taken down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jessup?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>The officer kneeling on the floor looked up. \u201cA major drug supplier. We\u2019ve been trying to stop him for years. Looks like he started sampling some of his own stuff.\u201d</p><p>Paramedics walked in with stretchers, and soon the tiny burger joint was crowded.</p><p>Jack leaned against the counter and turned to Alec. \u201cYou still hungry?\u201d</p><p>Alec picked up a laminated menu. \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, after filing reports and turning the case over to the police, they were finally on their way back to headquarters. The second they walked inside, they were told to report to the office of the special agent in charge. No surprise there. She had already texted them. Three little words that spoke volumes: My office. Now.</p><p>Margaret Don\u2019t-Ever-Call-Me-Maggie Pittman sat behind her massive desk. A group of agents had formed a semicircle behind her, all of them intently watching her computer screen.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s decided to join us,\u201d she drawled in her Arkansas twang. \u201cAgent Hot Stuff and his sidekick Agent Hot Shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYouTube?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>In unison every agent in the room nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough now,\u201d Pittman dismissed the crowd around her desk. \u201cYou\u2019ve all had your fun. Get back to work while I talk to the movie stars.\u201d Had she been smiling, her comment would have been funny. \u201cGentlemen, step over here. Agent MacAlister, perhaps you can tell me what\u2019s happening here.\u201d She pointed to the monitor.</p><p>Damn. The kid had gotten it all. Jack winced when he saw himself leaning against the hood of Alec\u2019s car. One ankle was crossed over the other, and he was devouring his cheeseburger while the paramedics were rolling the body bag past him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this looks like, Agent? I\u2019ll tell you. You kill a man, karate chop and tae kwon do the hell out of another man to put him down, and then you enjoy a nice cheeseburger while you take in the afternoon sun, acting like none of it affects you one little bit. That\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>Jack thought she was finished. \u201cIn my defense\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we know it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work, and we can\u2019t let it get to us, but the public doesn\u2019t necessarily understand that, Agent, and they expect us to be...sensitive. Yes, I said sensitive, Agent Buchanan. They don\u2019t want us to be cavalier or blas\u00e9 after we gun down someone.\u201d</p><p>Sensitive? Jack thought. Was she serious? She couldn\u2019t be, could she? Since Alec had worked with Special Agent in Charge Pittman longer than he had, Jack looked at him to see his reaction. No help there. Alec was stone-faced.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you consider appropriate behavior, ma\u2019am?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>She squinted at him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what isn\u2019t appropriate. Eating a damned cheeseburger while they\u2019re carting a corpse past you.\u201d</p><p>He had a feeling she wasn\u2019t finished. He was right.</p><p>\u201cSit down, both of you. I\u2019m tired of cranking my neck back.\u201d</p><p>She waited until both men were seated facing her from across the desk, then said, \u201cNow today is an interesting exception. The higher-ups aren\u2019t going to be happy when they see this video.\u201d She sighed and then said, \u201cThey\u2019ve probably already seen it. However, the public, at least the public looking at this video, have turned you two into rock stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRock stars?\u201d Alec said</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Jack said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, rock stars. So far, this little video has had over two thousand visitors and counting. Hopefully, once you two clean up and get rid of the long hair and beards, you won\u2019t be recognizable to your fan club.\u201d</p><p>Jack groaned. \u201cFan club? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Pittman glared at him. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m kidding, Agent MacAlister?\u201d</p><p>Having caught on that she liked to answer her own questions, Jack didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t kid,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThe media are another story. They\u2019ll try to interview you, and we don\u2019t want that, do we?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a good ten seconds before answering. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Fortunately, you had already finished your last assignment, and of course there won\u2019t be any more undercover work for a long, long time. Until this situation blows over and the public finds something else to get all worked up about, you two are going to keep a low profile. Got that? A low, low profile. In fact, I think it would be a good idea if you both took some vacation time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning\u2014\u201d Alec began.</p><p>\u201cAgent Buchanan, did you think I was making a suggestion? Let me clear up that misconception right now. You are taking time off. You too, Agent MacAlister. This isn\u2019t a choice. Oh, and you will stay in Chicago during your vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you calling this what it is?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA suspension.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cA suspension would indicate that I believe you\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are we on vacation?\u201d Jack asked. He folded his arms across his chest while he waited for a response.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer the question. Instead she said, \u201cWhile you are enjoying your vacation in Chicago,\u201d she stressed, \u201cyou will report in by e-mail or phone every morning. You will avoid talking to the media, and that includes telling them where you think they should put their microphones, Agent MacAlister. You will be ready to go back to work twenty-four hours after you\u2019re notified, which is why you will stay close in case I need you.\u201d</p><p>Jack was going to argue, but Alec spoke first. \u201cWhen does our vacation begin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Jack was following Alec out the doorway when Pittman called out, \u201cAgent MacAlister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work today.\u201d</p><p>What the...He didn\u2019t say what he was thinking. He simply nodded to his superior and continued on, but once he and Alec were in the elevator, he repeated her remark.</p><p>\u201cGood work today? What\u2019d she mean by that? You\u2019ve worked for her longer than I have, so tell me, was she being sarcastic, or was that her attempt at humor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Alec said. \u201cYou did good work today, and she\u2019s acknowledging it. You watched the video. The kid got it all, from the minute those drugged-out bastards walked inside, until it was over. You prevented a bloodbath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us should have grabbed the kid\u2019s phone before we ordered the cheeseburgers.\u201d</p><p>Alec laughed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what screwed both of us. They weren\u2019t even good cheeseburgers.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened on garage level B. Alec headed one way and Jack the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat time tomorrow night?\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>\u201cTry to get there by nine, and bring money, Jack. Lots of it. I want to win back what I lost.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cYeah, like that\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 8</p> <p>FAIRBANKS</p><p>Arrived in Fairbanks this afternoon. It\u2019s spring, but it\u2019s still chilly.</p><p>We\u2019ve all brought extra equipment with us. Brandon has assured us that everything we\u2019ll need is already in our shelter waiting to be unpacked. We\u2019ll fly into Barrow tomorrow, and from there we\u2019ll have quite a trek to our research facility. Brandon has shown us photos. The lab is quite spacious by most standards and connects to two temporary structures where we\u2019ll live.</p><p>Besides our scientific work, each of us has other duties. Eric is our designated medic. There will be times in the winter months when it will be impossible to get help, should there be an emergency. He\u2019s stocked the lab with supplies and medicines, but we all know the dangers we\u2019ll be facing, living such an isolated life while we do our work.</p><p>Kirk is in charge of weapons. We have no desire to hurt any animal. We are the intruders, after all, not they, but should we run into a grizzly, the sound of our rifle will hopefully chase him away. None of us will leave the safety of our shelter without protection. The arctic fox is known to carry rabies, and we will kill any rabid ones we encounter.</p><p>Yes, there will be challenges. We will meet them head on.</p><p>THREE</p><p>SOPHIE KNEW SHE\u2019D BE CUTTING IT CLOSE, BUT SHE\u2019D spilled salad dressing on her blouse at lunch and needed to go home first to change clothes before she met William Harrington at Cosmo\u2019s. She also needed to grab her recorder.</p><p>Times like today, when she was rushing around like a crazy woman, Sophie wished she still owned a car. She would have to run in high heels three blocks\u2014three long blocks\u2014to get to the El, and at this time of day the train was going to be packed with the surly going-home-from-work crowd.</p><p>She squeezed into the train just as the doors closed. The air inside was stuffy and smelled of old disinfectant. Sophie slowly made her way to the back of the car. Two teenage boys tried to engage her in conversation, but other than giving them a quick smile, she ignored them and continued on. She passed a middle-aged man who reeked of whiskey and who obviously hadn\u2019t touched a bar of soap in a long time. She thought herself fortunate to find an empty bench behind him and sat down. The drunk turned to face her. His eyelids were at half mast and he began to list to the left, but he jerked himself upright and moved toward her. He held on to the bar above his head and kept trying to get her attention by making weird sounds as he leered at her. He embodied the expression \u201cdirty old man.\u201d Sophie thought he might be a relative of Gary\u2019s: his repellent leer was nearly identical.</p><p>The two teenage boys turned out to be quite chivalrous. Like everyone else on the train, they noticed the man\u2019s behavior. Jumping to their feet, they squeezed their way around him and blocked him from getting closer to Sophie. They also blocked him from getting off the El when she did.</p><p>She gave the boys an appreciative smile, though their sweet gesture hadn\u2019t really been necessary. She was quite capable of taking care of herself. The husband of her best friend was an FBI agent, and he\u2019d taught Sophie all the moves she needed to protect herself. She also carried pepper spray. And as she stepped off the train, she released the grip she had around the canister.</p><p>She had a half hour before her appointment. Fortunately, her one-bedroom Lincoln Park condominium was just a couple of blocks from Cosmo\u2019s, a fact she deliberately hadn\u2019t mentioned to Harrington. Few people outside of law enforcement knew where she lived, or so she liked to believe, and she was determined to keep her private life just that: private.</p><p>Her father had given her the condo for her sixteenth birthday, and as soon as she was of age, he had transferred the title to her. With conditions. She couldn\u2019t sell it, which to her meant she didn\u2019t really own it. Still, there wasn\u2019t a mortgage, and she was thankful for that. Her father had paid cash for it, and back when she was a teen, Sophie didn\u2019t ask or care where his money came from. She had been too busy worrying about Social Services taking her away after his arrest, which she had thought was inevitable. At the time, there simply had not been room in her mind to think about cash problems or how her father, without any noticeable job, was able to live such an extravagant life. Back then, extravagant seemed ordinary. Sophie had never known anything different.</p><p>The morality of her situation didn\u2019t register until after she had graduated from the university. Due to the prodding of her two closest friends, she finally stopped taking money from her father, and that meant drastically modifying her lifestyle. When her car was in need of costly repairs, she sold it and began to walk or take the El to get around the city. Her life had become more strenuous, but it was definitely simpler now, and she liked that. She was proud that she had become a strong, independent woman who could succeed on her own.</p><p>Today was her personal best, she decided. She had a history of being late, but she was making a real effort to change that bad habit. After a quick stop home, she reached the bar and grill five minutes early.</p><p>Cosmo\u2019s drew a diverse crowd. There were always the junior executives networking while they sipped white wine or martinis, construction workers unwinding after a hard day\u2019s work while they snacked on appetizers and drank icy cold beer, and couples and singles from the neighborhood stopping by for a cold one and catching up on the latest news.</p><p>The bar was known for its bottled beer served just two degrees above freezing. Cosmo, like his father before him, was a fanatic about the temperature. There was also a small but adequate selection of wine from the vineyards of California, and draft beer that was brewed right there in Chicago. The grill was popular for its jalape\u00f1o hamburgers that seemed to get hotter every year. There wasn\u2019t anything pretentious about Cosmo\u2019s, which was probably why Sophie liked it so much. It was comfortable and inviting, a place where all the locals could come dressed in evening attire or jeans and feel right at home.</p><p>The decor was as eclectic as the owner. The furniture was sleek and contemporary with polished chrome tables and chairs with thick, black, padded cushions. Booths with plush, tufted benches lined two walls. The ceiling was the eye-catcher, though. Cosmo loved astronomy, and since he tended the bar nearly every night, he had decided to bring the sky inside. He had painted the arched ceiling a deep blue, dappled it with yellow circles that were supposed to look like planets, and strung tiny white Christmas lights along the beams. When the lights were on, the ceiling became his own dazzling, star-filled night.</p><p>Cosmo spotted Sophie the second she stepped through the door. He shouted her name to get her attention, blew her a kiss, then patted his chest a couple of times to indicate a heart beating wildly for her. He had developed a special fondness for her after she had written a rave review about his bar. Cosmo had been so pleased he\u2019d had it blown up and framed. He kept it propped behind the bar where everyone could see it. She noticed a sign leaning next to her article tonight. In big bold letters Cosmo had printed \u201cNo more Kelly\u2019s Root Beer.\u201d</p><p>Sophie wound her way through the crowd looking for William Harrington. She found him in the back, sitting in a booth. He looked anxious.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrington?\u201d</p><p>He jumped to his feet and thrust his hand out. \u201cYou\u2019re Sophie Summerfield?\u201d he asked. He sounded shocked and looked astonished.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand his reaction. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou did say six-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I did.\u201d He continued to stand, looking perplexed.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit down and get started?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>She slid into the booth, waited until he\u2019d taken his seat across from her, then reached for her digital tape recorder. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve used this, so please be patient,\u201d she said. Normally, such a small, sleek recorder would have been horribly expensive, but this particular model had been discontinued, so she had been able to buy it at a huge discount. Since it was a company expense, she was sure Mr. Bitterman would reimburse her. She checked the charge before placing the recorder on the table between them.</p><p>Harrington stared at her intently.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were young,\u201d he said. \u201cI could tell from your voice over the phone, but I didn\u2019t expect you to be so pretty.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he asked, \u201cWere you surprised when you saw me?\u201d</p><p>Did he expect her to return the compliment? \u201cI saw your photos on your website,\u201d she replied, \u201cso no, I wasn\u2019t surprised. I knew what you looked like. Why don\u2019t we get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like something to drink first?\u201d</p><p>He insisted she order, and so she asked for an iced tea. He ordered a sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cI make it a rule never to drink alcohol or caffeine the night before a race. You know how long a 5K is, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s over three miles. I can\u2019t be sluggish, or it will affect my time, which is why I stick to water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about your first race?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask another question or say another word for the next hour. Once he started talking, he didn\u2019t stop. He was agonizingly boring, but whether she liked it or not, he was determined to go through all twenty-four races, from start to finish\u2014and he had them all memorized.</p><p>Had her recorder been the old-fashioned kind, she would have gone through at least two cassettes. A good reporter would cut him off and take control of the interview, she thought. Or at least might bother to listen to what he was saying. In her defense, she did try several times to interrupt him. And she also tried to pay attention, but his monotonous voice could put an insomniac to sleep. He was on his tenth race when she completely zoned out and started thinking about all the mundane errands she needed to do over the weekend.</p><p>Once she had organized her schedule in her mind, she began to daydream about traveling through Europe again. She\u2019d gone once before, after she\u2019d graduated from the university, but she had missed some of Western Europe. Next time she\u2019d love to see Spain and Portugal. A nice river cruise might be a relaxing way to see the beauty of these countries. She could certainly use a quiet vacation. Or perhaps she could book a stay in the posh spa she had read about in Vogue that had just opened on St. Barts...</p><p>Reality was quick to step in. At the moment she didn\u2019t have enough money in her account to buy an airline ticket to anywhere, unless she decided she could go without food for a month or two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made it a tradition to wear bright red socks.\u201d</p><p>Her attention bounced back to Harrington. \u201cYes, you mentioned that. Red socks, white shorts, and a red T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention my socks are a special kind? Each one has a tiny white band around the top. Only one store carries them, and I\u2019ve bought over a hundred pairs. I don\u2019t dare run out,\u201d he added. Then with a shrug he said, \u201cI guess I\u2019m superstitious. Are you getting all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sophie pointed to the recorder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Let\u2019s take a minute to talk about blisters. Readers will probably want to know all about them. Some have been real bad. There was this one...\u201d</p><p>I hate my job, at least right at this moment I do. And I really hate being poor. But who doesn\u2019t hate being poor? she asked herself. Maybe Gandhi and Mother Teresa hadn\u2019t minded, but they were both considered saints, and Sophie certainly wasn\u2019t a saint.</p><p>Harrington ended his dissertation on foot ointments and, without stopping for breath, said, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the races, shall we? Now the morning of my eleventh race...\u201d</p><p>Dear God, just kill me now.</p><p>Had she groaned out loud? Harrington either didn\u2019t notice or care that her eyes had glazed over.</p><p>She took a deep cleansing breath and pretended that she was in her yoga class. She would remove all negative energy from her thoughts and think only positive thoughts. Tomorrow night she was having dinner with Regan Buchanan and Cordie Kane, her two best friends since kindergarten. She couldn\u2019t wait to see them. Regan had been traveling for business but was returning to Chicago late tonight. Cordie had been working on her thesis for a PhD in chemistry, and Sophie hadn\u2019t seen her in over two weeks. She was wondering where they would eat when she realized that Harrington had stopped talking and was looking at her expectantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Would you repeat that last\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...no, I\u2019m not,\u201d she answered. And then, before he could ask another personal question, she dug through her purse, pulled out her notebook, and flipped it open. \u201cOn the phone you mentioned being invited to join some kind of exclusive project, and you also mentioned something about a trial. I believe you called it the Alpha Project. What exactly were you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying anything about a project or a trial.\u201d He looked down at the table when he answered, a sure sign that he wasn\u2019t telling the truth.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t interested enough to pursue it. \u201cOkay then, I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>She was putting her notebook away when he reached across the table and picked up her recorder.</p><p>\u201cHow do I turn this off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, here it is.\u201d He pushed one button, then another. \u201cThere, now it\u2019s not recording. I don\u2019t want what I\u2019m going to tell you on any kind of recorder. This is strictly \u2018off the record.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that what reporters say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d she began, but he cut her off with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI trust you won\u2019t tell anyone. This is very hush-hush.\u201d He leaned forward and in a near whisper said, \u201cIt\u2019s like the Olympics. At least that\u2019s how it was explained to me.\u201d</p><p>She put her purse back on the seat beside her and gave him her full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat is like the Olympics?\u201d</p><p>He nervously looked around to make certain no one was listening, then said, \u201cI\u2019m in excellent condition and that\u2019s why I qualified.\u201d</p><p>He was maddening. \u201cQualified for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe trial,\u201d he explained. \u201cJust like the Olympic trials...you know, the qualifications. The physical exam took three long days, and I swear they took half my blood to test. Oh, and I had a full body scan and an MRI, too. They didn\u2019t tell me why all those tests were necessary, but I think they were making certain I didn\u2019t have any big problems, like an aneurysm or a blockage, anything that might inhibit my peak performance or disqualify me.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cIt\u2019s really something to be invited to participate. Only a select few are chosen.\u201d</p><p>His eyes swept the room as he took a quick drink of his water and said, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not giving you the wrong impression. I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m bragging, but you can see why I was chosen, can\u2019t you? I mean, just look at me.\u201d</p><p>She swore that if he flexed his biceps, she was going to get up and leave, story or no story. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou were chosen for what, Mr. Harrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d he corrected. \u201cPlease, no formalities. I can already tell you and I are going to be close.\u201d</p><p>Wanna bet? Sophie impatiently brushed her bangs out of her eyes and let her frustration sound in her voice when she repeated her question for what seemed like the umpteenth time. \u201cYou were chosen for what, William?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Talkative suddenly became evasive. \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t be discussing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I did, but I\u2019m not supposed to talk about it. Not until it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She decided not to press him. She checked the time instead. It was already close to nine o\u2019clock. Harrington had been talking nonstop about himself and his twenty-four races and his blisters for over two hours, and now that the subject had become interesting, he turned reticent. It all sounded so bizarre, she thought he might be making it up to keep her there.</p><p>\u201cI understand, William,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s confidential,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cConfidential. Then I guess we\u2019re finished here. Thank you for the interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like another drink?\u201d he asked as he held up his hand to get the waiter\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The poor waiter, his eyes shooting daggers, had been watching them for about an hour now. He looked hostile as he dropped their bill on the table. An iced tea and a sparkling water\u2014not much of a tip there.</p><p>Sophie was hungry, but she didn\u2019t want to eat with Harrington. She would wait until she got home and could kick off her shoes. She\u2019d relax while she zapped a frozen dinner in the microwave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he said in a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cIf you will go out to dinner with me tomorrow night, I\u2019ll explain everything to you then. I guarantee you\u2019ll be happy you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy I went to dinner with you, or happy I heard what you had to say?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHopefully, both. Interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I already have dinner plans tomorrow night...and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday night then?\u201d</p><p>Sophie weighed the bad against the possible good. On the one hand, she\u2019d have to suffer through another night listening to him drone on and on about himself, but on the other hand, what if he was telling her the truth? What if there was some kind of a secret club that only a select few were invited to join? What would be the purpose of such a club? And if they all had to be super athletes, was it some kind of a superman club? What would be the point?</p><p>Crazy. It had to be crazy. Still...</p><p>\u201cYes, all right, I\u2019ll have dinner with you, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner here at Cosmo\u2019s. Seven-thirty, Monday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to eat here. I want to take you to a five-star restaurant. Perhaps Nuvay or J\u2019Adore. They\u2019re both excellent. Give me your address and I\u2019ll have a driver pick you up at seven. Don\u2019t you worry,\u201d he added with a wave of his finger, \u201cI can afford to take you to dinner anywhere in the world.\u201d</p><p>She remained unimpressed. \u201cAs enticing as that sounds, I still prefer eating here at seven-thirty or not at all, William. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like bar food,\u201d he pouted.</p><p>While Sophie would have loved to dine in a great restaurant, she felt safe at Cosmo\u2019s, and she didn\u2019t know much about William Harrington except that he seemed totally into himself.</p><p>He must have figured from her silence that she wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. We\u2019ll eat here,\u201d he conceded. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t so pretty, I wouldn\u2019t bother with you, but I\u2019m a sucker for curvy blondes, and those gorgeous blue eyes of yours...\u201d He looked away as he said almost offhandedly, \u201cYou\u2019re stunning.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d His glance shifted to her feet and slowly moved up her body. \u201cYou know, Sophie, women don\u2019t usually play hard to get with me.\u201d</p><p>She decided to ignore his lascivious smirk. \u201cWhere would you like to meet tomorrow before the race?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>It took another ten minutes for him to settle on a time and place, and then she was finally free to head home. He stood and offered his hand as she slipped out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow then,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook his hand. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at her watch, she walked toward the door. Almost three hours now. Unbelievable, she thought. If there wasn\u2019t the possibility of another story here, there was no way she would spend another second with this man. He was insufferable. And what did he mean by \u201ccurvy\u201d? Was he telling her he thought she looked healthy? Wholesome? Chubby? Or overly endowed? He\u2019d been glancing at her chest every other minute since they\u2019d sat down. And the comment that he wouldn\u2019t bother with her if he didn\u2019t think she was pretty? Was that supposed to be a compliment? The man was unbelievably rude, and his ego was somewhere in the stratosphere.</p><p>Sophie had calmed down by the time she\u2019d reached home and was bolting the door behind her. It was rare for her to be home on a Friday night. The truth was, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had stayed in, and she planned to take advantage of her down time. She would catch up on her e-mails and go to bed early.</p><p>But time always seemed to get away from Sophie, and tonight was no exception. She didn\u2019t get to bed until well after one a.m., which would have been fine if she didn\u2019t have to get up at the crack of dawn for her second round with William Harrington.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 22</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Brandon and I headed out again. It was a bitterly cold day, but we took every precaution against frostbite. Last week, Eric and Kirk had spotted a pack of wolves crossing this plateau, and they tracked them to see where they would settle. Brandon and I won\u2019t set up our monitoring equipment until we are certain we have found a stable sampling.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>HARRINGTON HAD BEEN INSISTENT THAT THEY MEET TWO hours before the race. He was waiting for her at the designated spot in front of a fountain that was one of Sophie\u2019s favorites. It was shaped like a weeping willow with water gently cascading down from the top branches.</p><p>He was doing stretching exercises as she approached. True to his word, he wore his uniform: white running shorts, which she thought were a little too form-fitting; a red T-shirt; black running shoes; and red socks with a thin white band around the top. She snapped quite a few photos while he chatted away and made suggestions for poses. Sophie wasn\u2019t much of a morning person, but Mr. Self-Involved seemed not to notice or care that she wasn\u2019t saying much. How could he possibly notice? He never stopped talking...or giving directions.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll have your camera ready at the finish line? Do you know where you\u2019ll wait? I think the steps across the street from the finish line would be the best spot. It\u2019s important that you get a good picture, don\u2019t you think? Especially since it\u2019s going to be on the front page.\u201d His tone sharpened as he asked, \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to check\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cI was promised the front page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were? Then I guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again he interrupted. \u201cIt was implied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She didn\u2019t, but it was all she could think to say. Oddly enough, her response seemed to placate him.</p><p>\u201cNow about the photos,\u201d he began. \u201cYou have to be ready. A professional photographer would know that. I honestly don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re taking the pictures. You should have brought one of the photographers from the paper with you. Do you even know what you\u2019re doing? Be sure to snap at least one of me at the starting line, and you have to get just the right angle with the sun behind me when I cross the finish line. Not exactly right behind me, mind you, or you\u2019ll get a glare, and we don\u2019t want that, do we? But you need to be ready or you\u2019ll miss the shot.\u201d</p><p>She swore that if he told her she needed to be ready one more time, she was going to start screaming. \u201cYes, you mentioned that.\u201d About twenty times now, she silently added. \u201cAnd I assure you, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>He acted as though she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cI know what we can do. Do you have any of your business cards with you?\u201d</p><p>She found one in the bottom of her purse and handed it to him. She didn\u2019t have a logo or a business address on her cards, just her name and her cell phone number. She\u2019d had them printed after she had left her old job. Trying to stretch every dollar, she was determined to use all of them before she had more made.</p><p>Harrington unzipped a pocket in the back of his running shorts and pulled out a thin leather wallet. He opened it to slip her card in but stopped as though he\u2019d just had a second thought. Stuffing the wallet back into his pocket, he said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll give this to someone on the film crew.\u201d He knelt down on one knee and tucked her card in his right sock. \u201cHe can call you when I get close to the last hill. You know, so you can be ready.\u201d</p><p>Ready for what? She was dying to ask that question just to see how he would react. Not well, she guessed. He didn\u2019t seem to have much of a sense of humor, and normally this early in the morning, neither did she.</p><p>He stretched his arms over his head, rolled his shoulders as though he were trying to get rid of a crick in his neck, then said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019d better get going. I like to be the first to sign in, and I\u2019ll need to limber up even more. I allow thirty minutes for stretching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I don\u2019t like to be surprised, so I plan down to the last detail. I believe it\u2019s important to be precise. You might want to mention that in your article about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get going then...if you want to keep on schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He was jogging down the path when she called out, \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t need luck. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was happy to be rid of him for a little while. She backtracked to a coffee shop three short blocks away, drank two cups of hot tea, and, feeling human again, headed to the starting line to watch the race.</p><p>Runners were milling around the street with numbers safety-pinned to their shirts. She had her camera ready to take the photo of Harrington as he started out, assuming that he would be in the front of the pack, but she couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. She circled to the other side of the starting line, found an empty park bench, and stepped up on it, craning her neck to find Harrington in the throng. Still no sign of him. His red T-shirt should have made it easier for her to pick him out of the crowd, but who knew that so many people would be wearing red today?</p><p>The loud pop of the starting gun sent the runners scurrying for position. A sea of faces streamed before her, but none of them belonged to William Harrington. She had missed him.</p><p>Irritated, Sophie slumped down on the bench with her camera in her lap. If Harrington was so adamant that she get a shot of him at the beginning of the race, why wasn\u2019t he in front? He had been one of the first runners to arrive at the park, even before the organizers had set up their tables, so he\u2019d had ample time to get a good spot. Why would he let others take off ahead of him? With thousands of runners swarming down the street like some massive colony of ants, there was no way for her to see every one.</p><p>She looked around the crowd of spectators for some sign of a film crew and couldn\u2019t see any.</p><p>There was nothing to do now but wait. The course of the race wound through the streets and ended half a block from where she was standing. She made her way to the finish line to watch for the winner to appear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Minutes later she saw a figure rounding a corner a couple of blocks away. The crowd cheered him as he drew closer.</p><p>Okay, here we go, Sophie thought. She raised her camera, ready for the shot at the finish line.</p><p>The runner came closer and closer, and was within a hundred yards of the line as the other competitors came into view far behind him.</p><p>Sophie lowered the camera slightly to get a better look. Uh-oh. The winner wasn\u2019t William Harrington. It was a man she\u2019d never seen before. She quickly glanced back at those now approaching. Harrington wasn\u2019t among them either.</p> <p>Runner after runner came across the line, but still no Harrington. He wasn\u2019t first\u2014nor last\u2014nor anywhere in between.</p><p>The man had simply disappeared.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 23</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Eureka! We have identified the pack. Six adults and three pups. We were able to pick out the alpha male right away. He\u2019s quite easy to identify because of his thick white coat tinged with a small dark patch across his back. He is also physically larger than the others. Brandon is thrilled with this new family we will study.</p> <p>The alpha male is magnificent.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>IT WAS SOPHIE\u2019S TURN TO PAY FOR DINNER.</p><p>Regan insisted on eating at The Hamilton, the flagship of her family\u2019s five-star hotel chain. She reserved one of the private dining rooms adjacent to the atrium. The two-story windows looked out over Lake Michigan.</p><p>As Regan led the way to the table with Cordie and Sophie trailing behind, Sophie said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you insisted on eating here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I was in the mood for scallops, and I love the way Chef Eduardo prepares them,\u201d Regan declared.</p> <p>Sophie wasn\u2019t buying it. While it was true that Eduardo\u2019s scallops were outstanding, she knew the real reason Regan wanted to eat there. If they ate at her family\u2019s hotel, a bill wouldn\u2019t be presented. Convenient, since it was Sophie\u2019s turn to pay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just doing this because you know I\u2019m poor,\u201d she said.</p><p>A waiter pulled out a chair for her. Sophie flashed him a smile, thanked him for the menu he offered her, then turned to Regan again.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like dining here?\u201d Cordie asked. She was looking at Sophie over the top of her menu.</p><p>\u201cI love dining here, but that isn\u2019t the issue. I simply want Regan to admit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re poor? Okay. You\u2019re poor,\u201d Regan said cheerfully.</p><p>Cordie nodded. \u201cYes, you are. Very poor. I\u2019d say you were dirt poor, but you know, that expression doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. What\u2019s dirt poor?\u201d</p> <p>Sophie frowned. \u201cNot being helpful, Cordie. Regan, I want you to admit that my being poor is the reason we\u2019re eating here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s the reason,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Regan agreed amiably.</p><p>Cordie put her menu down. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to get huffy, are you, Soph?\u201d Her smile indicated she wasn\u2019t too concerned about the possibility.</p><p>\u201cMy being poor is all your fault, Regan, and yours, too, Cordie. I was perfectly happy going along with my life, buying whatever I wanted. I had a beautiful car, credit cards without limits, amazing clothes, and I didn\u2019t have a single worry line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t happy,\u201d Regan countered. \u201cYes, you had to give up your car, but walking is better for you than driving. You still have beautiful clothes even if they\u2019re last season\u2019s. You don\u2019t need credit cards, and you still don\u2019t have a single worry line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoverty agrees with you,\u201d Cordie said without laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou asked us to help you wean yourself off your father\u2019s money,\u201d Regan reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but did you have to be so...enthusiastic about it? So rigid? What\u2019s wrong with buying an occasional Prada blouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clothes are gorgeous, but taking the money from your father to pay for the blouse is wrong,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cThe money your father gave you was gotten by illegal means,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>Sophie reached for her water glass. \u201cHow do you know that for certain? He\u2019s never been convicted of any crime, and aren\u2019t you supposed to be innocent until proven guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it for certain,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told us, which is why Cordie and I agreed to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me be poor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp you do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Sophie impatiently brushed her bangs out of her eyes and sat back. \u201cI really hate being poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn to budget like I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, you\u2019re not poor. You have a huge trust fund your father set up for you, and Kane Automotive is now nationwide. You know what your problem is? You don\u2019t care about money because you have it. I want to buy...stuff. Oh, God, I sound shallow.\u201d</p><p>Before Cordie could argue, Sophie said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about money anymore. I\u2019m starving. I want to order dinner.\u201d</p><p>Although the room was quite elegant with candlelight and crystal, none of the three had champagne appetites. Sophie ordered salad and soup. Cordie wanted grilled chicken, and Regan ordered a grilled cheese instead of the scallops. None of them wanted to drink anything stronger than iced tea.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize it was on this very day a million years ago that the three of us met in kindergarten at the Briarwood School?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou two became my sisters that day,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cI remember you arrived in a limo,\u201d Regan told Sophie. \u201cI thought you were a princess with your white-blond hair and blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou arrived in a limo, too,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cMy father drove me in his old pickup truck,\u201d Cordie laughed.</p><p>\u201cSophie, you got us into so much trouble with your schemes,\u201d Regan said. \u201cYou were always the champion for anyone you thought was being treated unfairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still that way,\u201d Cordie told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the time we got locked inside the coat closet?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie chimed in. \u201cWe were positive no one would ever find us. When we discovered a candy bar in the pocket of Billy Miller\u2019s jacket, we were so relieved because we figured we could ration it among the three of us and survive for days.\u201d</p><p>One memory led to another and another as the three reminisced about their childhood antics. Dinner was served and devoured while each of them told her favorite stories.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you reserved a private dining room, but now I know why. We make a lot of noise laughing and carrying on,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cAiden suggested this room,\u201d Regan said. \u201cHe says we get rowdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you talk to Aiden?\u201d Cordie asked. \u201cIs he coming home soon?\u201d She realized how eager she sounded and quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m just curious. That\u2019s all. I lead a very dull life. I do,\u201d she insisted when she thought her friends were going to protest. \u201cThink about it. I teach high school chemistry to kids who just want to blow up stuff, and when I\u2019m not teaching or preparing lesson plans, I\u2019m working on my thesis. I don\u2019t even know anymore why I\u2019m doing it. If one more student brings Mentos to my lab with bottles of Coke, I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions. I need to know that there are people out there doing exciting things. All three of your brothers travel the world building hotels. They lead glamorous and fascinating lives, and I love hearing about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot them, him,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cYou love hearing about Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? He\u2019s the oldest and the most sophisticated. He\u2019s probably on a jet flying around Australia this weekend. You know what I did yesterday afternoon and all day today? Research. I was stuck in a library doing research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I\u2019ve so got you beat,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI gave up my Friday night to sit and listen to the most obnoxious, self-centered, narcissistic man talk about himself. I also had to get up before dawn today to meet him in the park and listen to him yet again. His name is William Harrington. My boss wanted me to write an article on him, but Harrington bailed on me.\u201d</p><p>She then told them about the 5K and how Harrington had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he got sick?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was hurt warming up,\u201d Regan offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I know what happened,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI talked to a couple of the event coordinators after the race. They told me they knew Harrington and that he\u2019d never checked in. The winner of the race was a newcomer named Brett Mason, and everyone was talking about how fast he was. I think Harrington heard all the talk before the race and was afraid of the competition. He wasn\u2019t about to take the chance that he might lose his twenty-fifth race, so he took off. I can\u2019t believe I wasted all that time on him and ended up without a story. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, but I\u2019m determined to find out and make him apologize.\u201d</p><p>Regan shook her head at her two friends and their frustrations. \u201cDo you know what both of you need?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sophie groaned.</p><p>Cordie sighed and said, \u201cLet me guess. You think we need to fall in love and get married. That\u2019s easy for you to say, you found the perfect man.\u201d</p><p>Regan\u2019s lips curled upward in a dreamy smile. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Alec is perfect.\u201d She quickly switched back to being serious. \u201cBut we\u2019re not talking about Alec and me. We\u2019re talking about the two of you. I don\u2019t think you have to get married necessarily. Just fall in love. Make room for a relationship, that\u2019s all I\u2019m suggesting. I know both of you could go out with a different man every night of the week if you wanted to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell us we\u2019re too particular, are you?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. But I think you\u2019re doing what I used to do before Alec came along. You\u2019re dating the wrong kind of men. They\u2019re all...I don\u2019t know...country club. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring their dismissive frowns, she continued, \u201cI want to fix both of you up with real men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal men as opposed to...?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do blind dates,\u201d Cordie said at the same time.</p><p>Regan ignored their protests. \u201cAlec has lots of friends. He has a partner now. He\u2019s really good-looking, and he\u2019s unattached. Sophie, I think you should go out with him.\u201d</p><p>For a second or two Sophie thought Regan was joking. When she realized she was serious, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s FBI. You can\u2019t honestly think I would be interested in him, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t be interested in me. You do remember who my father is?\u201d</p><p>Regan shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget, but I think going out with an FBI agent might help you get over your aversion to anyone associated with law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Behavior modification? I don\u2019t have an aversion,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou know I love Alec, and I like his friends Gil and John, and they\u2019re both in law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGil\u2019s retired, and you\u2019ve known both John and him for a long time. You\u2019ve gotten used to them, and they don\u2019t work with the agents who have been investigating your father. It\u2019s not the same thing. You still have the aversion. I really think you ought to give it a shot. His name is Jack MacAlister, and I\u2019m sure Alec could talk him into a blind date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? You have to be joking. You are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Regan didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI have news. Alec and I are going to be looking for a place to live here in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying permanently?\u201d Sophie asked excitedly.</p><p>Everyone started talking at once. Sophie couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Regan and Alec had moved a couple of times since he\u2019d joined the FBI.</p><p>Cordie was also thrilled. \u201cHow did this happen? Did Alec put in for a transfer? I knew he was tired of undercover work, but how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t have to ask. The last year and a half, he\u2019s had cases in Chicago, so the agency has decided to assign him here permanently. His new partner had something to do with it, too. Sort of, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I already love him,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cHow was he responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get home, get on the Internet and go to YouTube. Type in Jack MacAlister\u2019s name. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell us,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. You have to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d Cordie repeated.</p><p>\u201cA video. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell you, and since you just said you already love his partner, I think you should go out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking Cordie to the dark side. One FBI agent in this family is enough.\u201d</p><p>Regan beamed. \u201cSo you\u2019ve accepted Alec into our family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I have.\u201d</p><p>Regan held up her glass. \u201cTime for a toast. To family.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 28</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Kirk named the alpha male Ricky. The alpha female that Ricky has selected as his mate we call Lucy. Ricky is very partial to her. Lucy appears to be mischievous and playful, while Ricky seems a bit put out by her antics.</p><p>The adults head out in the morning and bring their prey back to Lucy and her pups.</p><p>This morning we waited until they were far enough away, then Brandon and I used dart guns to sedate the adults. We had to work quickly to attach the tracking monitors. I wanted to take blood samples, but he convinced me there wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><p>We hunkered down a far distance away and used our binoculars to observe. We were too far away for any of them to see us, though we know they had our scent. Ricky was the first to wake. When he finally was able to stand, he appeared to look directly at us.

During the summer when the weather cooperated, they met on the rooftop garden, and when it didn\u2019t, they met in a private room connected to the bar on the first floor of the hotel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John Wincott, a sleep-deprived detective with the Chicago Police Department, was a regular, and so was Gil Hutton, a retired policeman who always seemed to know the latest news before anyone else did. Gil didn\u2019t like to drink alcohol these days, and so he was always John\u2019s designated driver because, after one and a half beers, John was usually half asleep.</p><p>Since it was unseasonably hot and humid that night, they met in the room off the bar. Gil and John were already at the table when Jack walked in.</p><p>\u201cI hate this frickin\u2019 heat,\u201d Gil remarked. \u201cI hate the rain, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take hot over cold anytime,\u201d Jack said. His shirt was covered with wet spots, and his dark hair was damp.</p> <p>There was a small bar in the corner, and it was always fully stocked. Jack grabbed a Diet Pepsi and was opening it when John called out, \u201cGet me a beer, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely recognized you, Jack,\u201d Gil said. \u201cWithout the matted, snarly, long hair and the beard, you look kind of human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of human?\u201d John repeated. \u201cI think he looks like a movie star. Wait, did I say movie star? I meant Internet star.\u201d</p><p>The two men shared a good laugh. Jack handed John his beer, took a sip of his Pepsi, then dropped into a chair across from the two men. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve seen the video on YouTube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ten times now,\u201d John said, grinning. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to get old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI found the cinematography visually stunning as well as suspenseful,\u201d Gil said with a straight face. \u201cThe way you held the perp down while you discussed the menu with Alec. Priceless.\u201d</p><p>John nodded. \u201cI hear they\u2019re going to show it at the IMAX.\u201d</p><p>Alec, carrying a tray stacked with sandwiches, walked in just in time to hear John\u2019s comment. \u201cYouTube?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>All three men nodded. Since Gil had a knack for knowing what was going to happen before it happened, Alec asked him how long he thought it would take for this to blow over.</p><p>Gil scratched his bald head while he thought about it. \u201cI\u2019d give it a couple of days at the most before another video takes center stage. You shouldn\u2019t be on \u2018vacation\u2019 long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about the forced vacation?\u201d Jack\u2019s surprise was evident in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve always got my finger on the pulse, Jack.\u201d He tapped his wrist. \u201cOn the pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be back at work in a week at the most,\u201d Alec said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cUnless Jack needs to shoot someone else while he\u2019s ordering a taco or something,\u201d John said cheerfully. \u201cOr...\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr unless the networks pick it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, damn,\u201d Jack groaned.</p><p>John thought Jack\u2019s reaction was humorous and laughed until tears came into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre we through talking about this yet?\u201d Jack demanded.</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to play poker, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWho are we waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVice,\u201d Gil answered.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Alec asked. He ducked down behind the bar to get a soft drink from the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cNo, just Woods and Zahner.\u201d Gil smiled as he said their names. Most of the guys from vice were good card players, but Woods and Zahner were the exception. They were both terrible. The funny thing was, neither seemed to realize it. They always thought their losses were due to bad luck, and none of the other players felt the need to enlighten them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aiden?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t make it tonight,\u201d Alec said. \u201cHe\u2019s still in Sydney on hotel business.\u201d</p><p>A collective sigh of relief went around the table, for Alec\u2019s brother-in-law was the reigning champion. When he played, he usually won, and when he was on a hot streak, he won damn near every hand.</p><p>Jack\u2019s cell phone rang. He smiled when he saw who was calling, got up from the table before he answered, then walked to the window and looked out at the rain while he listened.</p><p>\u201cMust be a woman,\u201d John commented.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Gil sighed. \u201cI remember those days.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and Regan opened it and stuck her head into the room. \u201cMay I interrupt you for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Gil and John stood as she hurried to her husband\u2019s side. They watched as Alec leaned down and whispered something into her ear that caused her to blush. Gil rolled his eyes heavenward. Alec and Regan had been married for well over a year, but they still acted like newlyweds. He couldn\u2019t fault Alec for his lovesick behavior. Regan was quite a catch: dark hair, pretty eyes, long shapely legs. Gil understood why Alec had been drawn to her\u2014any man would be\u2014and he also understood why Alec had stayed. She was a smart business-woman; she had a kind heart and gentle spirit, and her sense of humor was almost as warped as Alec\u2019s. They were meant for each other.</p><p>Regan chatted with Gil and John for a couple of minutes to catch up. She had known both of them for as long as she had known Alec and considered them good friends. She would have spoken to Jack, but he was on the phone and had his back to her. She had met him once at a dinner party and had been impressed. He was better than good at what he did\u2014Alec had told her so. He also assured her that he could not have a better partner, so she didn\u2019t have to worry as much. She had seen the video on YouTube, and that had impressed her as well. In a crisis, Jack had shown amazing strength, speed, and accuracy. It was a bit scary how nonchalant he had been about it all, but then he was used to undercover work. Jack and Alec, she decided, were perfect partners. They were so much alike.</p><p>Jack finished his call and turned around just as Regan said, \u201cSophie needs a favor.\u201d</p><p>He walked forward. \u201cHi, Regan. It\u2019s good to see you again. Who\u2019s Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him about Sophie?\u201d John asked Alec the question and started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo one told me,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cJohn, what\u2019s so amusing?\u201d Regan gave him the very same look his own wife used whenever she was irritated with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...you know...her...\u201d John began, then looked to Gil for help. John had started to say something about Sophie\u2019s infamous father but stopped in time. Regan was extremely protective of Sophie.</p><p>\u201cHer what?\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed out,\u201d Gil said. \u201cNot meeting Sophie. She\u2019s something else. If I were thirty years younger and thirty pounds lighter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still wouldn\u2019t have a shot in hell,\u201d John said. He looked at Jack as he explained, \u201cSophie doesn\u2019t particularly like the police or the FBI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr any law enforcement agency. We\u2019re the exceptions,\u201d Gil said. \u201cShe loves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really never mentioned Sophie to your partner, Alec?\u201d John was having difficulty wrapping his mind around the fact.</p><p>\u201cIt never came up,\u201d Alec said. \u201cAnd by the way, when you found out, you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting off track here. Let\u2019s get back to Regan, shall we?\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d John agreed. \u201cYou said Sophie needs a favor? What kind of favor? Is it legal or illegal?\u201d he asked Regan.</p><p>She leaned into her husband\u2019s side. \u201cIt depends on how you look at it. She needs Gil\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>John nodded. \u201cSay no more. I get it.\u201d</p><p>Jack kept waiting for someone to fill him in. He knew he\u2019d missed something vital in the conversation. He hadn\u2019t known Gil or John long at all, and he\u2019d only been Alec\u2019s partner on the last three assignments, so he figured this had to be an inside joke.</p><p>They all heard laughter coming from the main bar, and a second later the door opened and Sophie walked in.</p><p>Whoa. Jack felt as though he\u2019d just taken a hard hit to his midsection. The sight of her knocked the air out of him. Long blond hair swayed against her shoulders with each step she took, and her body\u2014my God! her body\u2014was sheer perfection. She was wearing ridiculously high heels that made her legs look a mile long, and the fluid drape of her silk dress revealed every curve. If there were any flaws, Jack couldn\u2019t find them, but then he was distracted by the sexy way her h*ps moved as she walked toward Regan.</p><p>Sophie greeted Alec first with a kiss on his cheek, then turned to smile at John and Gil who were both grinning at her like boys with raging hormones.</p><p>Regan introduced her to Jack. \u201cThis is my best friend, Sophie Rose.\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled at Jack and said hello, but other than that, she pretty much dismissed him. That pricked his interest all the more. Jack wasn\u2019t used to being ignored by women. He loved them and they loved him. Alec called him a player, but Jack didn\u2019t think he was. He just didn\u2019t believe in committed relationships, and while marriage might work for his friends, it wasn\u2019t for him. He liked being free to do what he wanted when he wanted, and he made certain the women he dated understood that. The truth lessened complications. There were as many women as men who felt exactly the way he did.</p><p>He watched with a connoisseur\u2019s appreciation as Sophie sat down at the table next to Gil.</p><p>\u201cGil, I hate to ask...\u201d Sophie began.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you need, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind cleaning my apartment again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t mind. You know I\u2019d do anything for you. What about your office? Do you think it needs a good cleaning, too?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a few seconds and was about to say no, that it would be too much of an imposition, but Regan nudged her and whispered, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt, could it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. I would appreciate it if you could clean my cubicle, too. What time is good for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow afternoon around four? I\u2019ll start with your apartment,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd if you can wait, I\u2019ll clean your office after five Monday evening. Does that work?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank you so much. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever repay you.\u201d</p><p>He wobbled his eyebrows comically. \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed. \u201cCome on, Regan. Cordie\u2019s trapped in the bar with two guys from vice. They\u2019re scaring the other customers.\u201d</p><p>Alec held the door open for his wife and her friend, smiling over something Regan said as she passed him, but as Sophie was walking out the doorway, she looked back over her shoulder at Jack. \u201cIt was lovely to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Her sultry smile had just the impact Jack thought she intended. She left him gaping.</p><p>She was gone before he could think of a response. He stared at the door for several seconds while he tried to remember how to swallow. He finally got it together and turned to Gil to ask if Sophie was involved with anyone.</p><p>Sprawled in their chairs, John and Gill were watching him, grinning like idiots.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Jack agreed.</p><p>At this point Woods and Zahner followed Alec into the room. The two vice cops looked like they owned a tattoo parlor. Their arms and necks were covered in faded designs. Woods had two bottled beers in his hands, and Zahner was carrying a bowl of cashews.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zahner asked as John started laughing.</p><p>\u201cJack just met Sophie,\u201d Gil explained.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Just now?\u201d Zahner asked, breaking into a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not married,\u201d John volunteered.</p><p>\u201cAnd Regan says she isn\u2019t dating anyone at the moment. Are you interested?\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled out a chair but didn\u2019t sit. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Zahner asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Woods said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Jack repeated. \u201cHas she been married three or four times? Is she out on bail for murder? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never been arrested,\u201d Alec volunteered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an upstanding citizen,\u201d John added.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a real sweetheart,\u201d Woods said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jack prodded, waiting for the zinger.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s hot, man, really hot,\u201d Zahner said.</p><p>\u201cAnd her name is Sophie Rose,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>He was about to explain that Rose wasn\u2019t Sophie\u2019s middle name, but John shook his head and held his hand up. \u201cWait for it...wait for it...\u201d</p><p>Jack suddenly flinched.</p><p>John burst into laughter as he leaned back and put both hands up. \u201cAnd there it is.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cSon of a...she\u2019s Bobby Rose\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an FBI agent for nothing,\u201d Woods drawled.</p><p>\u201cJack figured it out quicker than you did,\u201d Zahner reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIf you could see your face, Jack, you\u2019d think you were having a stroke,\u201d Gil told him.</p><p>Jack dropped into his chair. He looked dumbfounded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cleaning her apartment all about? You looking for bugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d John answered for Gil.</p><p>\u201cAnd every time I look, I find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho plants them?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to find out,\u201d Alec said. He wasn\u2019t smiling now. \u201cNo agency will own up to it, but if I had to guess...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI?\u201d Zahner suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not FBI.\u201d Alec was emphatic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking CIA,\u201d Wood said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cNo way. It\u2019s IRS,\u201d John said. \u201cYeah, definitely IRS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cATF,\u201d Gil said. \u201cAbsolutely ATF.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFDA,\u201d Woods said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s food and drugs, you idiot,\u201d Zahner said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is none of the above. Are we playing cards or what?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>John dealt the first hand. He looked up at Jack and asked, \u201cYou still want her phone number?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 32</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Eric and I managed to collect several blood samples.</p><p>Arctic wolves haven\u2019t been hunted by men, so they\u2019ve been relatively trusting.

One of Lucy\u2019s pups died. Though we were curious to know the cause, Brandon is insisting that we not interfere.

She had taken more than an hour after the race to look for him.</p><p>As she had walked back to her apartment that morning, she had tried to call Harrington at his home. His answering machine had clicked on, and she\u2019d left a message for him to please call her. She had tried to sound concerned, not irritated. But she was irritated. How could anyone be so rude? And what about dinner Monday night? That, she assumed, was off.</p><p>By Sunday morning there was still no word from him. She called his home number again. After two rings, a mechanical voice clicked on, announcing that the phone number was no longer in service. She thought she must have punched in the wrong numbers, but when she entered them a second time, she got the same message. She called his cell phone number next and got another mechanical message. No longer in service.</p><p>That left Harrington\u2019s website. When she had looked at it during her research on him, she had discovered that he provided visitors a place to leave comments. She decided to pull up the site and leave a written message. She typed in the address. His website was no longer there. She did a quick search and couldn\u2019t find a trace. The website, like Harrington, was gone.</p> <p>Okay, now it was getting really weird. She decided to make one last effort to get hold of him before dropping the matter. She had his home address\u2014he\u2019d given it to her during their interview Friday night\u2014and since he didn\u2019t live all that far from her, she decided to walk to his building, knock on his door, and demand some answers.</p><p>Harrington\u2019s condominium was much farther than she had estimated. It actually took her forty-five minutes and a twenty-dollar cab ride after her feet started screaming because she had forgotten to change out of her three-inch heels.</p><p>Harrington lived in an exclusive neighborhood. His building was sleek and modern with reflective, tinted windows. The doorman wearing an impeccable gray uniform let her inside. A short corridor led to a palatial lobby with marble floors and walls covered in white linen. A thirty-something man with a buzz haircut and an extremely muscular frame was adjusting his tie as he rushed behind the granite counter to wait for her to approach.</p><p>He was either ex-military, she thought, or a bodybuilder. He reminded her of Bluto in the Popeye cartoons. His eyes seemed too small for his head, and his head seemed too small for his huge shoulders and arms. Receptionists were supposed to be friendly, but Bluto must not have read the job description. Stone-faced, he stared at her and waited for her to speak. He was neatly dressed in dark pants and a striped shirt. Sophie decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he was part of the building\u2019s security team and was just filling in for the actual receptionist.</p><p>The security was impressive. She saw cameras tucked into the crown molding at every corner of the fourteen-foot-high ceiling. Somewhere, maybe through the door behind the reception counter, there was a security center where computers recorded every person who came into the building.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked, his voice surprisingly pleasant and at great odds with his frown.</p> <p>\u201cYes, thank you. Could you please call William Harrington\u2019s apartment and tell him that Sophie Summerfield would like to speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here,\u201d he said, glancing over her shoulder to the hallway leading to the street.</p><p>Sophie couldn\u2019t tell if the impatient man just didn\u2019t want to be bothered or if Harrington really wasn\u2019t home.</p><p>\u201cPlease call just to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not home.\u201d His voice was no longer pleasant.</p><p>His scowl didn\u2019t faze her. \u201cDo you know when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked toward the entrance again.</p><p>Was he worried the doorman would catch him being rude? He didn\u2019t look the sort to worry about people\u2019s impressions.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to leave a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll wait here until Mr. Harrington returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrington won\u2019t be home for a long time. He packed up and left for Europe. He didn\u2019t say when he would return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me when I first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe guard our tenants\u2019 privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a way I could get in touch with Mr. Harrington? Do you happen to have his schedule or know where he\u2019s staying in Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And if I did, I couldn\u2019t give that information to you or anyone else. Like I said, we guard out tenants\u2019 privacy.\u201d Without pausing he added, \u201cWould you like me to show you the way out?\u201d</p><p>Sophie got the message. She didn\u2019t answer him but simply turned around and left. She thought about telling the doorman how rude the man at the desk was, but what could he do? Surely he already knew the man was rude.</p><p>Sophie felt she had gone the extra mile. She was now officially finished with William Harrington.</p><p>She rummaged through her purse for cash. She had enough to take a cab back to her apartment, but if she spent it, she\u2019d be short for the rest of the week, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to have to borrow later from the \u201cpurse fund\u201d she kept hidden in her closet. She decided walking would do her good. Plus, she could window-shop along the way.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t yet three o\u2019clock when she walked through the doors of her building, Gil was already waiting. Her condo didn\u2019t have quite the security Harrington\u2019s building had, but it was still safe in Sophie\u2019s opinion. There weren\u2019t cameras at every corner, but there was a doorman and good locks and buzzers that worked.</p><p>The doorman knew Gil and had let him wait in the lobby. He was reading The New York Times when she walked inside.</p><p>Finding bugs wasn\u2019t as easy as it looked in the movies. It took time and expertise. Fortunately, Gil was a pro and knew where to look, but he wasn\u2019t complacent. He always checked and rechecked every possible hiding place. Their routine was simple. She turned on the television, plopped down on the sofa, and stayed there until he gave her the all clear. While he was searching, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Gil found three devices this time. Two were what he called standard issue, but he had never seen anything like the third device before. Alec would be interested in seeing this one, he told her.</p><p>It was past six by the time Gil finished, and Sophie rushed to dress for her date. He was picking her up at seven. She had promised to attend a charity function with Jeffrey Oakley, a friend and her go-with guy when she wasn\u2019t dating anyone and needed an escort. Jeffrey was as sweet and as bland as a marshmallow, and for years he had been carrying a torch for Regan, but now that she was married to Alec, the torch had been passed to Cordie. He professed his love for Cordie on a regular basis, and Sophie listened sympathetically.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s own love life was a barren wasteland, but that was okay with her. She didn\u2019t need the complication of a romance in her life right now.</p><p>THE CRANK CALLS STARTED early Monday morning. Sophie didn\u2019t even have time to put her purse in her cubicle desk drawer before the first call came in.</p><p>\u201cSophie Rose?\u201d A muffled voice hissed her name.</p><p>\u201cSophie Summerfield,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d she repeated forcefully.</p><p>\u201cYour father took my money, and he\u2019s not going to get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to the police,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>She was about to hang up when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve come up with a better idea.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t ask, she told herself. Don\u2019t ask. \u201cWhat could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hurt you. Soon, Sophie. Real soon. And then your daddy will know what it\u2019s like to lose.\u201d</p><p>Slamming down the receiver in its cradle, she dropped into her chair. That was a new twist, she thought. Whenever her father was being blamed for something, the callers threatened to get even, and she was supposed to pass the message on to dear old dad. This call had sounded more sinister, and she wasn\u2019t sure what she was going to do about it.</p><p>She decided to concentrate on work until her nerves settled. This creepy caller had scared her, and that hadn\u2019t happened in a long time. Work would help her put things in perspective.</p><p>The first order of business was William Harrington. She headed to Bitterman\u2019s office to report what had happened. But what could have been explained in five minutes took fifteen because, once she started, she couldn\u2019t stop. The longer she talked, the angrier she got. Bitterman let her rant about her wasting her time while he enjoyed a frosty Kelly\u2019s Root Beer, then gave her two more ideas to replace the Harrington story.</p><p>Bitterman wanted to discuss each one at length, so by the time she got back to her cubicle, there were three messages from the switchboard operator waiting for her. Two were from Regan, and one was from Cordie. All three were marked urgent.</p><p>Her friends had left messages on her cell phone as well, but she didn\u2019t get a chance to listen to them because she was summoned to the production room to answer some questions. When she returned to her desk, Bitterman was shouting at her. This time he used her name, and that could mean only one thing: whatever he wanted was bad.</p><p>Gary tried to follow her, but Bitterman waved him back, pulled Sophie into his office, and shut the door in Gary\u2019s face.</p><p>The television was blaring. He turned the volume down and said, \u201cIt just hit the noon news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>Nodding to the television, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a press conference going on.\u201d</p><p>Sophie knew what he was going to say before the next words were out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI has just named your father as a person of interest.\u201d</p><p>Again.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 45</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Ricky has become quite predictable. He sets out on foraging trips with the other males at the same time each day and returns at approximately the same time. Today, however, he was gone only an hour. When he returned to the den, he was agitated and roused the pups out of their naps. The other males circled the den in confusion. They knew something was wrong.</p><p>Ricky moved to stand in front of the den, his back to the pups, and stared off to the north. We could see nothing in the distance, but with binoculars we spotted a bear about half a mile away. As the bear drew closer, Ricky began to growl. The other males followed his lead. A hundred feet or so from the den, the bear stopped and raised up on his hind legs.</p><p>Ricky didn\u2019t back down. The bear paced back and forth several times, but finally turned and headed to the east. Facing a formidable adversary like Ricky and his small army was probably not in his plans.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>DADDY WAS ON THE LAM AGAIN.</p><p>Bobby Rose would never make the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List. He loved his country; he loved his hometown, Chicago; and he loved his fellow man. He had never raised a hand against anyone; he didn\u2019t own a firearm, and he didn\u2019t believe violence ever solved a problem. He certainly wasn\u2019t a threat to any law-abiding citizen. He had style and charisma and was always a gentleman. And oh, yes, he was a thief.</p><p>As much as the authorities wanted to put him behind bars for various thefts they were convinced he had committed, they had yet to come up with a single shred of proof.</p><p>One disgruntled investigator was quoted saying Bobby Rose was nothing but a common criminal. Chicago disagreed. There wasn\u2019t anything common about the man. He did steal, but he had his standards. He only took from those men and women who had accumulated wealth through illegal or immoral means. Bobby knew, before any law enforcement agency, who those men and women were and, more important, where they hid their money. The law had been outsmarted time and again by Bobby Rose, and they didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>To most of the public, he was a modern-day Robin Hood. When times were tough, they needed to believe in him. And times were tough now. Families were finding it harder and harder to stretch the dollar. Prices for necessities were up, and salaries were either frozen or down. Home foreclosures were at an all-time high; outsourcing had become a hot-button topic, and it seemed that every other week another company closed its doors, putting more and more men and women out of work while greedy CEOs pocketed millions.</p><p>Fear, frustration, and anger were the staples these days, and the \u201cget-even\u201d stories about Bobby Rose gave them hope.</p><p>Sophie stood next to Bitterman with her arms folded across her chest, her stance rigid as she watched the live press conference. She didn\u2019t recognize the man standing in front of the microphones, but that really didn\u2019t matter. Her father\u2019s accusers all looked the same to her. Dressed like senators in their designer suits, their hair as perfect as the knot in their ties, their speech as polished as fool\u2019s gold, their expressions always righteous and indignant\u2014they had to practice in front of a mirror to be perfect\u2014they pounded on the podium with their fists vowing to bring Bobby Rose to justice.</p><p>Her father got blamed for everything but the weather. And whenever the finger-pointing started, Sophie received invitations from the Chicago Police Department or the FBI, and sometimes the IRS, to sit down and have a chat about him. These weren\u2019t invitations she could decline. If she didn\u2019t cooperate, she would be dragged out of her office chair and taken into custody for obstructing an investigation.</p><p>In other words: same old, same old.</p><p>Bitterman awkwardly patted her shoulder, then squeezed past the crates and banged his already bruised elbow as he dropped into his chair.</p><p>\u201cMove those papers off that chair and take a seat,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Too anxious to sit, Sophie turned her back on the television, leaned against the side of the desk, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen to another pompous speech about how terrible my father is. Please, just tell me what he\u2019s been accused of now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bitterman hit the remote\u2019s mute button and began to absent-mindedly rub the sting out of his elbow while he explained.</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s Root Beer. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoot beer?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe man doing all the yapping is Darren Ellis of Ellis, Ellis and Cooper, Attorneys at Law. Their firm represents Kevin Devoe.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie glanced over her shoulder to look at the attorney. \u201cAnd who is Kevin Devoe?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately answer her question. \u201cDo you remember how you wanted to write about Kelly\u2019s closing, and I pointed out that every other newspaper in the city was already writing about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA company everyone in Chicago loves as much as they love the Bears shuts down after sixty-some years in operation, and people want to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the company wasn\u2019t making any money. Costs were up and profits were down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I read that, too, but that isn\u2019t much of an explanation, now is it? No details were given. No, closing didn\u2019t make any sense to me. The best damned root beer in the United States isn\u2019t making a profit? Hogwash. Why didn\u2019t the company simply hike the price per bottle? I would have paid double, even triple, and most of Chicago would have done the same. Can\u2019t get root beer like Kelly\u2019s anywhere else, can you?\u201d</p><p>Sophie doubted everyone in Chicago loved Kelly\u2019s Root Beer as much as Bitterman did, but she might hurt his feelings if she told him so. For some reason, he was sensitive about his soft drink.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, you can\u2019t get root beer like Kelly\u2019s anywhere else,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled because she had agreed with him. \u201cTurns out there\u2019s a whole lot more to the story. The retirement fund for all those loyal employees is gone. Gone,\u201d he repeated, snapping his fingers for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d she asked. \u201cA pension fund is closely monitored by...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, stopping her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pension fund. It was a retirement fund. Big difference. Kelly was a shrewd businessman, and he wanted to do right by his employees. He hired an investment manager and told his employees that if they wanted to, they could put as much as a third of their monthly paycheck into a retirement fund, and he would match their contribution. An employee puts in a hundred bucks a month; Kelly kicks in a hundred. It was a generous retirement plan and, over the years, had great tax advantages. The investment manager Kelly chose was good, real good, and the fund showed strong growth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d she asked. A feeling of dread was twisting her stomach into knots.</p><p>\u201cPeople get old and tired,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe investment manager was the first to retire, and Kelly chose a man named Kevin Devoe to replace him. He was a conservative investor, and the fund continued to grow under his supervision. Initially, that is.</p><p>\u201cKevin met Tom Kelly\u2019s only child, a daughter named Meredith, at one of the company functions, and they took a shine to each other. Six months later they married. Tom was ill and finally retired. He named Meredith president and left her husband in charge of investments. Don\u2019t know that that was legal, but no one objected at the time.</p><p>\u201cNow here\u2019s where it gets dicey. Two years after Kevin took over as investment manager, he moved the money into another fund. There were three companies in the fund, and all of them were showing remarkable growth. On paper, that is. The numbers were inflated, and Kevin now says the money was invested in what he thought was a reputable stock fund, but now he realizes he was scammed. He also says no one but Bobby Rose could have pulled this off, and as Kevin\u2019s attorney just stated on television, they have discovered that Bobby owned an interest in one of the companies. He didn\u2019t say what that interest was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a convenient scapegoat these days.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cKevin\u2019s wife filed for divorce a few weeks ago, just before all this came to light.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they\u2019re blaming my father for that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the divorce? No, no, of course not.\u201d He picked up a pencil and began to roll it between his fingers. \u201cI mention it because Kevin was eager to turn over his financials to his wife\u2019s attorney, and made sure the press got copies. And guess what? On paper he looks like a pauper. He wants everyone to know that he put most of his own money into the stock fund and that he is as much a victim as the employees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. He chose the fund, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure did, but he insists the numbers were grossly inflated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the possibility that my father had an interest in one of the companies, is there any actual proof that he took the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the FBI is looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t find any. My father didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Her loyalty was admirable. In this case, Bitterman thought it was also justified.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t see this as something your dad would do. However, there are a lot of people who think he used the classic pump-and-dump ploy. You know, the stock gets talked up until a huge amount is sold, then the guys who did the talking sell and, boom, the stock crashes. There are a lot of people who think he did take the money. They\u2019re angry, very angry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI understand. I read that some of those employees had worked for Kelly for over thirty years. Now they have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just letting you know that microphones are going to be shoved in your face the second you step outside. Security already called to say a couple of reporters for those rag mags have tried sneaking up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the warning,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being blindsided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to think about some time off until this blows over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did that every time my father was in the news, I\u2019d never get anything done.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman stood and looked past her into the main office. \u201cHere comes the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re early this time,\u201d she said without turning. They usually didn\u2019t take her in for the chat until at least a day or two after her father hit the news. \u201cI wonder why the hurry.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman looked sympathetic as he answered her. \u201cBecause I called them.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 61</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Today we observed the pack take down a caribou. It was amazing to watch the wolves work together to cut a straggler from the herd and attack from all sides, as though they communicated by mental telepathy.</p><p>Ricky orchestrated it all, and the others followed his lead. He made the kill. His powerful jaws clamped down on the caribou\u2019s throat, and he would not release his hold until the animal had fallen to the ground. The other wolves pounced then, and with Ricky\u2019s permission, enjoyed a feast.</p><p>I cannot feel sympathy for the caribou. His purpose was obviously to feed Ricky and his family.</p><p>Survival of the fittest.</p><p>When he returned to our facility, Eric and I talked about Ricky\u2019s amazing strength and the abundance of the mysterious hormone in his blood. Eric is calling it K-74. He\u2019s asked for my help in isolating Ricky so that we can take another blood sample. Since Brandon and Kirk have shown little interest in Eric\u2019s findings, he has asked me not to mention what we\u2019re doing.</p><p>I have become Eric\u2019s willing assistant, for my curiosity as a scientist is the reason I have traveled this far. I believe we must be flexible and willing to try new methods. Since Brandon is old school and would not agree with my opinions, it\u2019s best he not know what we\u2019re doing.</p><p>NINE</p><p>DECISION TIME. SOPHIE COULDN\u2019T QUITE MAKE UP HER mind if she wanted to play the dumb blonde or the bitchy blonde during the questioning. Over the years, she\u2019d perfected both roles. Maybe for a change of pace she\u2019d be flirty this time. Her friends said she knew how to work a room. Flirting with an FBI agent, though? Sophie doubted she could pull that off.</p><p>She knew there would be two agents. They always seemed to travel in pairs. For safety\u2019s sake, she supposed.</p><p>She squared her shoulders and turned around. All thoughts of playing any games flew out the window as soon as she saw Alec approaching. She relaxed her guard and took a deep breath.</p><p>Bitterman edged his way around the desk and went to the door to open it. Sophie was smiling until she saw another agent turn the corner and follow Alec. Uh oh. He was the man she had met at the hotel the night of the poker game. Jack MacAlister.</p><p>It had taken a considerable amount of discipline on Sophie\u2019s part to dismiss him then, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could pull it off again. No harm looking, was there? He was awfully handsome. What woman wouldn\u2019t look? But Jack was also in the FBI, and she was the daughter of a man they considered a career criminal. That reminder helped her control the attraction. She barely glanced at him again and kept her focus on Alec.</p><p>Her boss had met Alec several months ago when he had given her a ride to work. He shook Alec\u2019s hand and said, \u201cCome on inside.\u201d</p><p>Alec introduced Jack to Bitterman and smiled as he watched Sophie\u2019s boss squeeze his way around the root beer to get to his chair.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, all of you,\u201d Bitterman said.</p><p>Jack looked around the office in astonishment. \u201cThere must be a hundred crates in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish I had that many,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cIf you want a cold one, there\u2019s some in the fridge behind Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of the feds took him up on his offer. \u201cYou do know this is a fire hazard, right?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThe way I see it, the root beer would put any fires out.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cIt probably would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, Regan wants you to call her,\u201d Alec told Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember meeting Jack?\u201d</p><p>She finally looked at the agent. \u201cI remember. I would say it was nice seeing you again, but it might not be. I guess it all depends on why you\u2019re here.\u201d Turning to Alec, she asked, \u201cWhy did Mr. Bitterman call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d</p><p>Bitterman shook his head. \u201cI figured she would just shrug it off. I thought I\u2019d leave it to one of you to tell her and hopefully make her understand how serious this is.\u201d</p><p>Alec was pretty sure she would shrug him off, too, so he nodded to Jack to let him know he wanted him to break it to her. Maybe hearing the news from someone who wasn\u2019t a friend would have a greater impact.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t bother to be diplomatic or ease into the announcement.</p><p>\u201cSomeone wants you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She nodded, nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cOkay? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>As far as Jack could tell, the news didn\u2019t affect her at all. God love her, she shrugged. She was good. He couldn\u2019t help but be impressed.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear this kind of stuff often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is Bobby Rose. What do you think, Agent MacAlister?\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to smile. Yeah, she was good all right, but he still wasn\u2019t buying the blas\u00e9 attitude.</p><p>Alec was much more gentle in his approach to get through to her. \u201cThere have been some threats.\u201d</p><p>Still no visible reaction. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not taking this lightly, Sophie,\u201d Alec said, his voice firmer now. He was trying the no-nonsense method even though he knew it was pointless. Sophie was as stubborn as his wife. No wonder they were such great friends.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll go call Regan. You didn\u2019t tell her about the threats, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell her, but she saw the press conference. She knows your father\u2019s back in the news.\u201d</p><p>Jack noticed something protruding ever so slightly on the wall next to the refrigerator. He moved closer, then glanced over his shoulder at Alec and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bug in here.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman planted his hands on his desktop, half stood, and looked around the room. \u201cWhere? What kind of bug? I hate roaches, and I hate spiders.\u201d He sat down again and was rolling up a newspaper as he anxiously waited.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of bug, sir.\u201d Jack leaned close to Sophie, his arm brushing against her shoulder as he reached past her and pulled the listening device from the wall next to the refrigerator. To a novice, the barely visible bug would look like it was part of the dark wall socket. It was dusty, which meant it had been there for some time.</p><p>Jack tossed the device to Alec. \u201cLook familiar?\u201d</p><p>With Jack standing so close, Sophie was trapped. Pressed up against the refrigerator, she could feel it humming behind her back. She thought about trying to squeeze past him or nudge him aside, but he wasn\u2019t the type to be nudged. His body looked solid as a rock. She doubted she could nudge him anywhere. Besides, if she squirmed or moved at all, he might notice her discomfort, and she didn\u2019t want him to notice anything about her. FBI agents other than Alec weren\u2019t to be trusted, and she wasn\u2019t about to let Agent MacAlister know he made her nervous.</p><p>When it came to her father and his \u201cissues,\u201d no one was going to push her around.</p><p>Jack glanced down at Sophie and held her gaze for only a second or two, but it was long enough to look into her gorgeous eyes, time enough to take in the scent of her subtle, feminine perfume. Very nice.</p><p>He quickly moved away. The last thing he needed was to get close to Bobby Rose\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Sputtering and red-faced, Bitterman drew his attention. \u201cAre you saying...Are you telling me someone\u2019s bugging my office? Someone is listening in on my private conversations?\u201d He was outraged. \u201cWho\u2019s doing it?\u201d he demanded in the next breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not FBI, is it? Is it FBI, Alec?\u201d</p><p>Alec shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind Gil found in Sophie\u2019s apartment,\u201d he told Jack. To Bitterman, he said, \u201cNothing we would use.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman realized he was still clutching the rolled-up newspaper. He tossed it into the trash can. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like something you could buy over the Internet,\u201d Jack remarked. \u201cAmateur stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute. Someone bugged your apartment, Sophie?\u201d Now Bitterman was outraged on her behalf.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said to calm him. \u201cI\u2019m used to it. I don\u2019t want you to worry about this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to having your privacy invaded?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Exasperated, she said, \u201cAgain, Agent MacAlister. My father...Bobby Rose...?\u201d</p><p>The way she drew her father\u2019s name out made Jack want to laugh. If she were a man, he\u2019d probably call her a smart-ass, but she wasn\u2019t a man. She was an outrageously sexy woman. With spunk. Ah, man, he should get away from her as soon as possible. He should have waited outside in the car. But he\u2019d been curious. First impressions were often wrong, and he wanted to find out if she was as provocative as he\u2019d remembered.</p><p>She was. Definitely.</p> <p>His voice was abrupt when he said, \u201cShow me where you work.\u201d</p><p>Sophie assumed that Jack was going to sweep her cubicle, and as she was walking toward the door, she asked Alec to please call Gil and let him know she didn\u2019t need him to come to her office.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m doing that, I want you to pack up whatever you\u2019ll need from your office for the next week or two. You\u2019re going to be working from home. You know the drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d Jack told her. He gave her a gentle push to get her moving.</p> <p>His abruptness bordered on rudeness. Sophie thought about telling him to stay out of the discussion, but because he was Alec\u2019s new partner, she kept silent. There was also the possibility that he might not take criticism well and decide to take her in for one of those lovely interviews.</p><p>Alec wouldn\u2019t let him do that, but even so, why cause friction?</p><p>Bitterman stopped any further protests. \u201cYou have two articles to research, and you can do that from home. You\u2019ve got a computer there and an Internet connection. You don\u2019t need anything else.\u201d</p><p>Sophie wished she could get Alec alone and ask him why he was wasting his time over a couple of heat-of-the-moment threats. He wasn\u2019t a rookie, so why was he given this assignment?</p><p>Or had he even been given this assignment?</p><p>\u201cMr. Bitterman, did you call the FBI, or did you call Alec?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlec is FBI,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did some snooping,\u201d her boss admitted sheepishly. \u201cI looked through your address book and found his number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet moving, Sophie,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. In a second. Was there more than one threat?\u201d she asked her boss. \u201cWhenever my father is in the news, there are always two or three threats at the very least. Agent MacAlister, if you push me one more time, I\u2019m going to have to push you right back.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn around when she made the threat. Jack grinned. Sophie was turning out to be far more stubborn than he\u2019d been told. He decided he would leave it to Alec to get her to cooperate.</p><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s been more than one threat,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve gotten three. The message was always the same. Your father took something of value from them, so they\u2019re going to take something of value from him. Meaning you,\u201d he added. He looked at Alec as he continued. \u201cA couple of the callers used the same word: retribution. That was kind of odd, I thought. Real muffled voices, too, and all of them used the words \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019 That was odd, too, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they call you?\u201d Sophie asked.</p> <p>\u201cI guess the callers figured I\u2019d make you give up your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the threats came from the same men,\u201d Alec remarked.</p><p>\u201cA buddy at the phone company checked the source of the incoming calls,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cThey were made from public phones around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has there been a price on Bobby Rose\u2019s head?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Sophie whirled around. \u201cWhat? There\u2019s a price...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attorneys at the press conference said they\u2019d put up a reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConviction for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing Kelly\u2019s company retirement fund?\u201d Bitterman suggested.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s guilty until proven innocent? Is that how the system works?\u201d Sophie blurted.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the reward is why the office was bugged?\u201d Bitterman asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThink about it. This is a small neighborhood newspaper. How many enemies can you make writing articles about the pollen count? I know that sounds insulting, and I don\u2019t mean it that way, sir. I\u2019m just saying, you don\u2019t tackle heavy political issues or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bitterman waved his hand. \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, and I\u2019m not taking offense. We are a small paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut growing,\u201d Sophie said defensively. \u201cAnd some people want to read about the pollen count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people know Bobby\u2019s daughter works here,\u201d Alec pointed out. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re thinking she\u2019ll talk to him on the phone or talk about him to you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to find out exactly who\u2019s listening in on my conversations,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cThere could be more of those things, couldn\u2019t there?\u201d he added, pointing to the bug Alec held in his hand. \u201cAnd what about the phones? Do you think the phones are tapped? Damn it all, I want to know who\u2019s behind this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some techs in here\u2014\u201d Jack began.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Bitterman interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to get out yet, not until we find out who the culprit is.\u201d</p><p>Before Alec could point out the obvious, that bugging an office was an illegal activity, Sophie said, \u201cWhat about Gil? He\u2019s a retired police officer, Mr. Bitterman, and he does consulting work now. His specialty is security and finding bugs. He\u2019d be perfect for this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Gil could help,\u201d Alec agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay him, but his fee is reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay anything,\u201d Bitterman said. \u201cWait, I didn\u2019t mean that. Don\u2019t tell Gil I\u2019ll pay anything. Could you get him on the phone now and ask him to get over here as soon as possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sophie, let\u2019s get going,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>She led the way to her cubicle, then stood in the narrow corridor to wait while Jack searched for listening devices. He found one identical to the one in Bitterman\u2019s office. It had also been attached next to the electrical plate.</p><p>Gary came out of the lunch room eating a jam-filled croissant. He spotted Sophie and scurried over to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you standing in the hall?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to answer. He saw Jack sitting at her desk going through the drawers. \u201cWhat\u2019s that man doing?\u201d he asked with a mouth full of food. He saw the gun holstered to Jack\u2019s side. \u201cHey, he\u2019s got a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s FBI,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dressed like FBI.\u201d</p><p>Jack was wearing a pair of worn jeans and a faded burgundy T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s casual Friday,\u201d she said with a straight face.</p><p>Gary went into his cubicle and continued to watch Jack. \u201cWait a minute. It\u2019s Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s casual Monday,\u201d she said without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s searching my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe better not try to search my cubicle. My space is private, and no one is coming in here without a search warrant,\u201d he blustered. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a reporter, Sophie. You should feel the same way I do. If I were you, I\u2019d tell him to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack suddenly stood, towering over Gary. His gaze was piercing. \u201cWhat would you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Gary shrunk before her eyes. He backed into the corner of his cubicle as he said, \u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t mean...never mind.\u201d</p><p>Jack stepped into the corridor so Sophie could get to her desk. It only took her a few minutes to transfer several files by e-mail to her home computer. She turned off her computer and stuffed two fat folders into her tote bag along with a book and a stack of papers she needed to go through. She pulled her purse from the bottom desk drawer, picked up her cell phone and charger, then looked around to make certain she had everything she needed.</p><p>Gary\u2019s curiosity overrode his fear of Jack. \u201cAre you under arrest?\u201d he asked Sophie. \u201cWhat did you do? Did you help your father? That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? Is it Kelly\u2019s? Did you help your father rip off the retirement fund?\u201d</p><p>Sophie was used to Gary\u2019s stupidity, but she couldn\u2019t resist feeding his frenzy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Agent. Are you going to put the handcuffs on me now or when we\u2019re in the elevator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the elevator,\u201d he answered without hesitation. \u201cJust don\u2019t try anything funny.\u201d</p><p>She kept her head down, pretending shame. Jack motioned to Alec as he followed her to the elevator.</p><p>The farther away Jack got, the bolder Gary became. \u201cShe knows where her father is,\u201d he shouted. \u201cShe just won\u2019t tell. That\u2019s why you\u2019re taking her in, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got it all figured out, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Jack shook his head as he lowered his voice. \u201cHow can you stomach working with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she answered. \u201cHopefully, someone will quit, and I can move away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a reporter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he is. But he\u2019s not very observant. He didn\u2019t even notice you weren\u2019t carrying handcuffs. How come you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s casual Monday. No ties. No cuffs. Do you want me to carry that?\u201d he asked, reaching for her tote bag. It looked heavy.</p><p>The elevator doors opened just as Alec joined them. All three stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Sophie handed him the bag. \u201cBut be careful with it. It\u2019s Louis Vuitton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Lou breathe in there?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s Louis, not Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpensive, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very expensive. It was a gift, and I\u2019m trying not to get any scratches on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift from your father?\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered abruptly.</p><p>She was glad he had asked the annoying question. She was starting to like him, and she was certainly attracted to him. Who wouldn\u2019t be? The man was sexy as hell. But fortunately his nosy question reminded her that he was FBI.</p><p>She stood between the two men facing the doors. She felt awkward and uncomfortable. If Jack hadn\u2019t been there, she would have been fine. She loved Alec because he loved Regan, and Sophie felt safe and relaxed around him. Alec didn\u2019t judge; Jack apparently did.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ride with Sophie, and I\u2019ll follow in my car?\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him when she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t own a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Huh. I figured you for a BMW or a Mercedes. Guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Huh. I figured you for an arrogant, judgmental jerk.\u201d She didn\u2019t add, \u201cGuess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him to see how he was reacting to her comment and was taken aback when she saw the laughter in his eyes.</p><p>They reached the bottom floor. Jack had parked his car in the garage below the warehouse. When the elevator doors parted, he held his hand up to stop her. He checked to see that the coast was clear before he let her step out. There were no reporters lurking, waiting to ambush her. She thought Bitterman had overreacted when he\u2019d said microphones would be thrust in her face. She climbed into the backseat of Jack\u2019s car. They drove down the ramp, and as Jack was waiting to make a left turn onto the street, a swarm of reporters suddenly appeared. They crowded both sides of the car, but they seemed to be as interested in Jack and Alec as they were in her, even calling them by name.</p><p>\u201cHow do those reporters know you two?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t actually know us,\u201d Alec hedged.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re shouting your names and taking your photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t seen it?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently not. Talk to Regan or Cordie,\u201d Alec told her. \u201cThey\u2019ll be happy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what? Alec, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. A cameraman pounded his fist on the hood of the car to get Jack\u2019s attention. He was obviously going for the deer-in-the-headlight shot. Jack didn\u2019t oblige.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I tell you? It must be a slow week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI agents don\u2019t give interviews,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those reporters know that. Why are they hounding you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Sophie. When you get home, call my wife.\u201d</p><p>She decided not to wait. She pulled out her cell phone and sent a text to Regan and Cordie.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you think I\u2019ll get if I run over a couple of them?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d give you ten, twenty bucks,\u201d Alec answered.</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cI meant years. How many years would I get?\u201d</p><p>Traffic opened just as one reporter cleared the bumper, sliding toward Alec\u2019s window. Jack drove away before the man could get a clear shot.</p><p>\u201cI hate reporters,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t ever write the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t so,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>He ignored her protest. \u201cIt\u2019s all about sensationalism. Anything for a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a reporter,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAgent MacAlister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 113</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ve been with the wolves for months now. We\u2019ve gathered reams of data about their habits and have studied tissue samples to understand their physical adaptation, but there is so much more to learn. If our plans succeed, the foundation will extend our grant, and we\u2019ll be able to return to continue our study next year.</p><p>There haven\u2019t been any questions about losing the male that Kirk had named Jasper.

THERE weren\u2019t interruptions; Gary wasn\u2019t hanging over her partition drooling like a St. Bernard while he pestered her for information about her father. Also, in her apartment, all of Sophie\u2019s forbidden snack foods were within reach. She didn\u2019t even have to answer the phone if she didn\u2019t feel like it. And if she were so inclined, she could work in her pajamas.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t like was being forced to work from home. She felt like a prisoner, and she didn\u2019t like the idea of anyone else making choices for her. Mr. Bitterman, however, was her boss, and he had her best interests at heart. Unlike the creep threatening to do her bodily harm. Now she was going to have to reschedule all of her appointments, which included apologizing ad nauseam and begging Raul to change her haircut appointment.</p> <p>And all of this disruption because of a few crank phone calls. It could be worse, she supposed. She should be thankful she hadn\u2019t been dragged downtown by the authorities. Not yet anyway.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter which agency called on her. They all asked the same questions over and over again. Have you spoken to your father lately? Like she would ever tell them if she had. Has he ever told you how he made his money? She had a lot of sarcastic answers for that one, but she kept silent because even at an early age she had learned never to alienate men with badges, especially if she wanted to go home rather than sit in a smelly interrogation room for hours and hours.</p><p>They all wanted to know about a safe, too. Did her father have one hidden somewhere? And where did he keep his important papers? Did he ever tell her secrets?</p><p>Nowadays, Sophie took the questions in stride, but that had not always been the case. The worst experience she had was when she was nine years old. A cranky old detective told her that if she didn\u2019t spill the beans\u2014she had no idea what that meant\u2014and tell him where her father was, he would call child protective services and have her taken away permanently and put in foster care. No one would know where she was, and she would never see her daddy or her friends again.</p><p>To this day, Sophie wasn\u2019t certain how Regan\u2019s brother Aiden found out about that interrogation. She thought perhaps her housekeeper had called him, but the woman never owned up to it.</p> <p>Like a knight in shining armor, Aiden showed up at the police station with three attorneys to save her from the detective\u2019s terror tactics. Sophie remembered she cried when she saw him and ran into his arms. Aiden had seemed terribly old to her, but he was barely twenty at the time. He was outraged on her behalf and made quite a few threats of his own, including lawsuits for illegal detention, public humiliation, and heaven only knows what else. He got in the detective\u2019s face and told him that if the words \u201cfoster care\u201d were ever spoken again, he would have his badge. Aiden\u2019s attorneys insisted he could do it, too.</p><p>Aiden drove her home, gave her the law firm\u2019s private phone number, and made her memorize it. He told her that she could reach them day or night. To this day she remembered that number, and occasionally she used it.</p><p>She never told Regan or Cordie what had happened the night Aiden rescued her, and she had asked Aiden to keep the secret, too, to never let anyone know, not ever, that she had cried. She was a worrier, and Aiden recognized that. He somehow tracked her father down as he was flitting from place to place and got him to agree to let Aiden become her guardian in his absence. Sophie was eternally grateful.</p><p>Sophie wondered if she was going to have to call Aiden\u2019s attorneys because of this latest round of threats. Her hope was that it would all die down and be forgotten in a couple of days.</p><p>When she arrived at her apartment, Alec and Jack went up with her. They stood by as she played the day\u2019s messages, all thirteen of them. None were threatening, but the last one perplexed Jack. The caller identified himself by the name Muffin, and the readout on Sophie\u2019s caller ID indicated he was making the call from the Southside Reserve Soup Kitchen. The deep timbre of his voice was a contradiction to his name.</p><p>\u201cSophie, honey, I wanted to thank you for the beautiful Fendi special edition purse and wallet. I\u2019m looking at them right now, and they\u2019re spectacular, honey, just spectacular. Once again, you\u2019ve out-done yourself. You know how much we appreciate it, don\u2019t you? And hey, rumor has it you\u2019re going for a Birkin next. That\u2019s awfully ambitious, but I know you can do it. You take care now. You know I love you.\u201d</p> <p>Jack asked the obvious. \u201cYou gave a purse and a wallet to a soup kitchen? Did I hear that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Alec, are you going to look in all the corners and make sure no one\u2019s hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t at all curious about Muffin\u2019s phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Alec replied, smiling as he walked into Sophie\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t want to let it go. \u201cExplain why you would give a soup kitchen a purse and wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to,\u201d she answered. \u201cDon\u2019t look so worried, Agent MacAlister, the purse and wallet aren\u2019t code words for anything illegal.\u201d</p><p>Sophie left Jack looking bewildered and went to the kitchen to get a bottle of water from the refrigerator.</p> <p>Alec finished his inspection, got a bottle for himself, and tossed one to Jack. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll stay in tonight and tomorrow,\u201d he said to Sophie. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you give me your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Don\u2019t forget that you already gave me your word you wouldn\u2019t tell Regan about the threatening calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You know what a worrier she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan might stop by later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted before she realized it was a trap.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not worried,\u201d Alec said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to take any chances with my friend\u2019s life, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m being cautious. Besides, I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her on the cheek. \u201cLock the door behind us.\u201d</p><p>Jack waited until he and Alec were in the elevator and then asked, \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has protection. She just doesn\u2019t know it. Whenever her dad\u2019s in the news, I hire Gil, and he gets a couple of his friends, all retired cops, to help watch round the clock. No one will get to her. She\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe threats...these happen a lot?\u201d</p><p>Alec nodded. \u201cYes, but this is the first time Bitterman has gotten any calls about her. That\u2019s new. But like I said, she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Sophie really wasn\u2019t worried. As soon as Alec and Jack left, she changed her clothes and went to work on her computer. Time got away from her, and it was almost seven when Cordie called. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d she said. \u201cStart watching.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t waste any time. She ran to the television to make certain she was recording the reality show. It was one of her favorites. The truth was, she and Cordie watched and loved almost all the reality shows. Regan called her friends reality junkies. Neither Cordie nor Sophie was offended.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Sophie called Cordie. \u201cHow can John and Sara think they\u2019re in the desert? There isn\u2019t any sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be the first to go,\u201d Cordie predicted.</p><p>Five phone calls later, the show was over and real life resumed. Sophie stretched her arms above her head and yawned. Deciding to turn in early, she switched off her computer and headed toward her bedroom. There weren\u2019t any sheets on her bed. She had only one set of king bedding, and they were in the washer. While she waited for the sheets to dry, she ate half of a cold pizza, then went to the bathroom to brush her teeth.</p><p>The phone rang. Seeing that it was Cordie, she picked up.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Soph,\u201d Cordie laughed, \u201chave you looked at YouTube yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Sophie mumbled through the toothpaste.</p><p>\u201cJack MacAlister. You\u2019ve got to see the video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d She hung up the phone and went back to the bathroom to gargle.</p><p>The phone rang yet again. \u201cOh good grief, Cordie...\u201d She plodded back to her bedside table. Caller ID displayed an unfamiliar area code. She hesitated for two rings, then decided to answer.</p><p>\u201cIs this Sophie Summerfield?\u201d Summerfield. Good. He wasn\u2019t calling for Sophie Rose, and he had a friendly voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Joe Rooney and I\u2019m a police officer here at Prudhoe Bay. You know where that is?\u201d</p><p>She knew it was somewhere in Alaska, but she didn\u2019t know which part. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to admit it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Alaska, way up at the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be cold\u201d was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s already chilly here,\u201d he replied. \u201cUnusually so, this early in the season. The reason I\u2019ve called...\u201d</p><p>His hesitation made her all the more curious. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found your card. Your business card. It\u2019s the only identification, so I thought I\u2019d call and ask if you knew the man we found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t tell you who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t say anything, ma\u2019am. No easy way to tell you. He\u2019s dead. We found your card inside his red sock.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be, could it? Sophie needed to sit. \u201cDid you say a red sock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he answered, sounding relieved.</p><p>Harrington. Oh my God. William Harrington. She remembered he had taken her card and tucked it in his sock. He\u2019d shoved it way down to his ankle and then pulled the sock halfway to his knee. Who else could it be? But it didn\u2019t make sense. Prudhoe Bay? What would William be doing in Prudhoe Bay? He was in Europe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be calling with such terrible news,\u201d Rooney said.</p><p>Sophie needed to be sure before she gave the caller William Harrington\u2019s name. \u201cTell me what he looks like.\u201d</p><p>A long sigh came through the phone. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is...we only found a piece of him. We found a foot and part of his leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA leg and a foot?\u201d She couldn\u2019t take in what he was telling her.</p><p>\u201cA foot and part of a leg, not all of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was his right foot. Would that help you identify him for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying...my God...how did he die? And where\u2019s the rest of him?\u201d</p><p>Another sigh came through the phone. \u201cNo easy way to say this,\u201d Rooney said. A slight hesitation and then he blurted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got polar bears up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA polar bear did him in.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 187</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>It\u2019s great to be back in Chicago. We spent eight months together in Alaska, survived a bitter winter cooped up in our housing, and I accumulated enough data on the behavior of my coworkers to begin my paper.</p><p>The pecking order in our little family shifted over the course of our stay. Brandon could not handle disagreement of any kind, and Kirk became passive in every argument. Eric and I became the alphas, though admittedly Eric is too busy to lead anyone.</p><p>The foundation was impressed with our reports and has agreed to fund another two years. In three months we will head back north.</p><p>Eric is spending his time off in his lab. I brought with me a few early blood samples from each member of the pack\u2014all but Lucy and her pups, that is\u2014so I\u2019ve also taken time in the lab to see if I can isolate the hormone Eric found in Ricky\u2019s blood. So far I\u2019ve come up with some amazing and startling conclusions. I will have to wait until I return north to show Eric my discovery. I\u2019m anxious to hear what he has to say.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>HOLY CRAP!</p><p>A foot and part of a leg were all that was left? Could it be William Harrington? Her business card had been tucked in his sock, his red sock. It had to be him.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s mind raced. She was so rattled by what she was hearing, she couldn\u2019t think of a single question to ask.</p><p>Rooney broke the silence. \u201cIt was a male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe polar bear was male,\u201d he explained. \u201cHad to weigh in around twelve hundred pounds, give or take a hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone witness the attack?\u201d she asked, mentally cringing at the possibility.</p><p>\u201cNo, but there were telltale signs. Can you identify the victim for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be William Harrington,\u201d she said. \u201cI gave him my business card, and I saw him tuck it in his sock.\u201d She gave him Harrington\u2019s home address and said, \u201cHe lived alone. His phone has been disconnected, and I was told that he had left for Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe evidently changed his mind,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cHow did you know this Mr. Harrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know him really. I just met him a couple of days ago. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you much about him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a real help just giving us a name,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou will find a way to verify that it is Harrington before you notify his relatives, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. They\u2019ll send the remains to the morgue, probably in Anchorage. I\u2019m new here, so I don\u2019t know the exact procedures they\u2019ll follow, but I can tell you the body parts will be kept in the morgue until positive identification has been made and instructions are given for the disposal.\u201d</p><p>Disposal. What a horrible word to use.</p><p>After promising Rooney she would call if she had any information that could help him, Sophie hung up the phone. The shock from the news about William Harrington\u2019s demise quickly evolved into puzzlement. Why was he in Alaska and not in Europe like she was told? She thought back to the events of the last couple of days, replaying what Harrington had said as well as what she\u2019d found out at his condo. None of this made any sense.</p><p>Within an hour of receiving the call from Joe Rooney, the phone rang again. The second call also came from Alaska, and this time the caller identified himself as Paul Larson.</p><p>\u201cI work for a security company up here,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe\u2019re primarily responsible for the population at the oil fields, but the police are pretty shorthanded in these parts, so we help them out when we can. Joe Rooney told me about the death of your friend.\u201d Larson\u2019s voice became sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. I told Joe I\u2019d do a little investigating to learn the circumstances surrounding the bear attack, so I hope you won\u2019t mind answering a few questions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI appreciate your condolences, Mr. Larson,\u201d Sophie said, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t know William Harrington well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Paul,\u201d he replied. His demeanor turned professional again. \u201cWhat was your relationship to Mr. Harrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t actually have a relationship. I work for a small newspaper, and I was going to write a story about his running a 5K.\u201d She wondered if her explanation sounded as lame to him as it did to her. \u201cIt was a human interest story,\u201d she added, almost as an excuse. \u201cI met with him for a couple of hours and interviewed him, but he only talked about running. He was very proud of his accomplishments and of his physical prowess. In fact, he mentioned that he\u2019d been chosen for some hush-hush project because he was so superior to other men. Other than that, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you any personal information about him. He didn\u2019t mention any family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll contact the Chicago police and track down the next of kin. You\u2019ve been very helpful. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul, Joe said he was sure a polar bear killed Harrington because there were telltale signs. What were those signs?\u201d</p><p>Larson hesitated a second before answering. \u201cOne of the pilots here saw the polar bear. There was...there was blood, a lot of blood, and the bear was cleaning himself. They do that, you know. They\u2019re kind of obsessive about cleaning themselves. Sometimes they\u2019ll stop in the middle of a meal just to clean up. It\u2019s an instinctive thing. If a polar bear\u2019s coat gets dirty and matted, it can\u2019t do the job nature intended and protect him from the harsh elements.</p><p>\u201cThe bear in question was dragging the sleeve of a ski jacket, and the remains, the victim\u2019s foot and leg, weren\u2019t that far away from him, and there was a blood trail, so you can see why we\u2019re assuming that\u2019s the bear that killed the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to the polar bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happens to him. This is his domain, not ours. Listen, how about I give you my private phone number? If you think of anything else that might help us, or if you have any questions, call me.\u201d</p> <p>After she had written down his number, she asked, \u201cWill you please call me when they get positive identification?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Hey, have you ever been to Alaska? I\u2019ll bet there are at least a hundred human interest stories here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you inviting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt will be an adventure for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to take you to dinner. Can\u2019t serve you wine. No alcohol allowed here, but I could dig up a couple of candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not married with six children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at you right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at your bio. We have computers up here,\u201d he added. \u201cI Googled you. Unless someone airbrushed the hell out of your photo, you\u2019re very attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about your invitation, Paul. I\u2019ve just been told a polar bear ate a man, and now you\u2019re suggesting I come up there for a candlelight dinner?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat was a rare occurrence. Besides, we\u2019ve got a whole lot more grizzlies than polar bears around here this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the invitation open. Call me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone but didn\u2019t move from the bed for a long while. Her mind jumped from one thought to another. Polar bears often stop in the middle of a meal to clean themselves. That\u2019s what Larson had said. Poor William Harrington was the meal. What a horrible way to die. A bear\u2019s snack.</p><p>Her thoughts moved back to Paul Larson. He had actually been hitting on her. Not real appropriate, she thought, given the circumstances of his phone call.</p> <p>Restless, she went into the kitchen and grabbed a bag of forbidden potato chips to nibble on while she thought. They weren\u2019t good for her; she shouldn\u2019t eat them, but she didn\u2019t want to throw them out because that would be wasteful. It was a sin to waste food. The key to not eating potato chips was to stop buying them, but Sophie was honest enough to admit that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Every time she went to the grocery story she ended up with a big, fat bag of chips. Kettle-fried were her favorites. She couldn\u2019t make herself buy the baked ones.</p><p>She leaned against the counter and munched while she pondered more important things. Why had Harrington told the staff at his apartment building that he\u2019d gone to Europe? And what was he doing in Prudhoe Bay?</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t know all that much about the area, and feeling somewhat like a dumb blonde in all those jokes about dumb blondes, she put the chips away and went to her computer to look up Prudhoe Bay.</p><p>The largest oil field in North America, it was located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean? She shivered just thinking about how bitterly cold it could get, and though she had no plans to ever go there, she was curious to know all she could about Prudhoe Bay and any nearby towns. There had to be towns around there, right? And would those towns have accommodations for travelers? Surely they would. Not everyone who ventured that far north worked on oil rigs, did they?</p><p>Once she started reading, time quickly passed. A lot of what she already knew but had filed away in the recesses of her mind came flooding back. She now recalled the argument for and against the expansion of the pipeline. Both sides were passionate about the subject.</p><p>Reading about Prudhoe Bay led to reading about tundra and permafrost. She read well into the night, until her eyes blurred from staring at the computer screen. It was three in the morning by the time she collapsed into bed. She didn\u2019t think she would be able to sleep, what with all the facts and figures about the number of barrels of oil pumped from the icy water and sent down the pipeline swimming around in her brain, but as soon as her head hit the pillow, she was out.</p><p>She dreamed of polar bears. She was in a blizzard surrounded by the huge white animals, and then the scene changed to the street outside her apartment and the polar bears were coming after her with cameras. Finally, one of the bears morphed into Jack MacAlister, and the FBI agent moved toward her, more ferocious than any of the bears.</p><p>A bell saved her. The phone rang at 6:45. Her boss was on the line.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She doubted he believed her lie since her voice sounded like a croaking frog.</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten any more threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped here, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI still want you to stay home, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should already be at the computer then,\u201d he said. His tone became all business. \u201cHave you done any work on the cell phone piece I gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need it as soon as you can e-mail it to me. The piece on bone density testing didn\u2019t get done. I assigned it to Bernie, and he couldn\u2019t get the interview with the specialist, so I\u2019ve moved it to next week. How soon can you get your article to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon do you need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo later than noon tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cNo problem. Noon tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Now today I need the piece on the Southside Soup Kitchen you wanted to feature. They need donations, and I need the article. Get that to me by four and I\u2019ll put it on the front page. Have a good day, Sophie, and stay inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. Bitterman...\u201d</p><p>He had already hung up.</p><p>Sophie threw off the covers and staggered to the bathroom. She was going to be drinking gallons of tea with caffeine in order to concentrate on work. She needed a solid eight hours of sleep to function at her maximum capacity, but she could get by on six. Functioning on four hours was a definite stretch of brain power. Anything less than that and she\u2019d turn into a blithering idiot.</p><p>She worked all day, got a solid eight hours of rest, then plunged into the next day of work, managing to get both articles with interviews completed by Bitterman\u2019s deadlines. By early afternoon, she was ready for a break. She should have wanted to get away from the computer screen, but not all of her questions about Prudhoe Bay had been answered. She wanted to learn all she could about the place. Maybe some piece of information might help explain why Harrington had gone there.</p><p>She pulled out her notebook and the digital recorder she\u2019d used during her initial interview with Harrington at Cosmo\u2019s. Listening to him talk about his twenty-four races and his endless, disgustingly graphic descriptions of each and every blister wasn\u2019t something she was looking forward to, but it had to be done, and probably more than once. No other way to try to solve this mystery, she thought.</p><p>After she put the recorder and notebook on her bed, she sat down at her computer again. There was a town close to Prudhoe Bay called Deadhorse. Cool name, she thought. Depending on what website she went to, the population varied. The optimistic number was twenty; the pessimistic number was seven.</p><p>A couple of personal accounts repeated a popular joke about the place. Men who were being recruited to come and work there were told they\u2019d find a na*ed woman behind every tree. No wonder Larson had flirted with her. He probably hadn\u2019t seen a woman in ages in the treeless Arctic.</p><p>She stood and twisted her torso to stretch her muscles. She hadn\u2019t been to the gym for almost an entire week now. Her apartment was spacious, but she felt as though it were closing in on her. She walked past the digital recorder and groaned. She didn\u2019t want to listen to Harrington alone. Misery really did like company, she decided, and in this instance she wanted Regan and Cordie to listen along with her. She was dying to tell them about this latest development with Harrington anyway, and perhaps one of them would pick up on something she\u2019d missed when she played back the interview.</p><p>How to get to The Hamilton without everyone going ballistic was Sophie\u2019s real dilemma. She considered various possibilities while she showered.</p><p>Getting around Bitterman was going to be the trick. She\u2019d given him her word she wouldn\u2019t leave her apartment; he\u2019d pitch a fit if he found out after the fact. But she wasn\u2019t a child. She didn\u2019t need his permission to go outside, even if a promise was a promise, and her boss had her best interests at heart. Sad as it was to admit, she was used to hearing threats, but Bitterman had been shaken.</p><p>She had also given her word to Alec. Maybe if she called him, he could pick her up and take her to the hotel. No, that wouldn\u2019t work. Asking Alec to shuttle her back and forth would be an inconvenience for him. Besides, it seemed that wherever Alec went these days, his arrogant, judgmental partner tagged along.</p><p>Sophie had to think of another way.</p><p>No one could complain if a former policeman drove her. Now there was a plan! Gil could drive her to the hotel. He was most likely downstairs in the lobby right now. She knew that each time her father was in the news or threats were made, Alec asked Gil and his team to watch over her, but since neither Alec nor Gil ever mentioned it, she assumed they didn\u2019t want her to know what they were doing, and so she had always kept silent. Yes, Gil was the solution to her problem.</p><p>She decided to set her plan in motion by starting with Bitterman.</p><p>Bitterman wasn\u2019t in his office. Lucy, the receptionist, told Sophie he was taking a late lunch with his wife at the Pavillion, one of his favorite restaurants. It was within walking distance of the newspaper.</p><p>Sophie called him on his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered the grilled salmon, right? You always order the salmon at the Pavillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a reporter...and Lucy was happy to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even looked at the menu yet, but you\u2019re right, I\u2019ll probably order the salmon. I\u2019m still waiting for my wife to get here. Why are you calling me? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept my promise to stay in, but now that the threats have stopped, I\u2019m going over to The Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow listen here. You gave me your word, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo FBI agents will be with me.\u201d She was going to burn in purgatory for that lie.</p><p>\u201cAlec and Jack?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t make me say it. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll let you off the hook. I expect you in the office tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the call before she could say anything more. It was odd. She felt a pang of guilt over the lie she\u2019d just told Bitterman, but she didn\u2019t feel any guilt at all about breaking her promise to Alec. She adored him, but he was an agent of the FBI...and he didn\u2019t sign her paycheck.</p><p>She called down to the doorman and found out Gil was in the lobby, taking his shift. When she got off the elevator, he\u2019d have to go with her to the hotel.</p><p>Blindside him. The perfect strategy.</p><p>She grabbed her purse, dropped her notebook and keys inside, then reached for the recorder. It wouldn\u2019t turn on or off. Needed new batteries, she decided. Triple A, which she didn\u2019t have. The hotel would have some in the gift shop, or Regan would definitely have a supply on hand. She threw the recorder in her purse with the rest of her things and went to her closet. She reached for her favorite Dolce &amp; Gabbana blouse and skirt. Whenever she wore them, she felt better. Clothing shouldn\u2019t affect her mood, but come on, it was Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and she didn\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t feel happier wearing the designers\u2019 exquisite clothes.</p><p>She slipped on the skirt and then the blouse. She hadn\u2019t yet buttoned it when the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you home?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m working. Doing some research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt like it.\u201d</p><p>Before Sophie could tell her she was on her way over to the hotel, her friend blurted, \u201cHave you seen it yet? I was sure you\u2019d call once you had, but when you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat answers my question. Just watch it and call me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan, watch what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe YouTube video. Just type in Jack MacAlister\u2019s name, and it will take you right to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Agent MacAlister, so why would I want to watch his video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love my husband, and he\u2019s also in the video. Just watch it, okay? And why don\u2019t you like Jack? Yes, I know, he\u2019s FBI, and I know all about your aversion but\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold that thought. My cell phone\u2019s ringing.\u201d</p><p>Sophie cradled the home phone in the crook of her shoulder and fumbled through her giant purse searching for her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cJust call me back,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait,\u201d Sophie replied. \u201cI want to tell you something.\u201d</p> <p>The cell phone was, of course, at the bottom of her purse. \u201cAh, found it. Hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>The male voice was cheerful and familiar, but she couldn\u2019t place where she\u2019d heard it.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a second. I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook out the living room window, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Even though she knew it was a silly request, she was walking into the living room as she asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me? I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a sport. You have to look, or I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She was still trying to put a face to the voice. She reached the window and looked out. \u201cOr you can\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hear his last whispered words. The bullet shattered the double-paned glass and struck her chest. The velocity threw her backward, and she crashed to the floor.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 260</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>It\u2019s been three months since we left our arctic home in March, and now Kirk and I have returned. Brandon and Eric should arrive in a few more weeks.</p><p>The wolves mate in March, and the gestation period is a short sixty-three days. To our delight, Lucy has three new pups and is once again being fed by the males who hunt for her.</p><p>One of the older males, the one we called Lester, is no longer with the pack. Our tracking device didn\u2019t indicate a separation, so we can only speculate what happened to him.</p><p>Ricky is still definitely in charge. We\u2019ve estimated his age to be six years, and since the average lifespan of the arctic wolf is about seven years, we would expect to see him slowing down, but he seems more vigorous than ever.</p><p>Eric and Brandon will arrive within days of each other. As soon as I have the opportunity to get Eric alone, I will confront him.</p> <p>I know what he\u2019s been doing. The question is: will he admit it?</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>SHE JUST HAD TO LOOK.</p><p>Sophie was furious, mostly because of her own stupidity, though she would take that admission to her grave.</p><p>She was lucky to be alive. The bullet had struck her dead center, just below the front clasp of her bra. But the distance of the shooter on the roof of the apartment building across the street and the rising north wind slowed the bullet\u2019s velocity, as did the double-paned window and the thick metal clasp of her purse. Still, the bullet cut through her skin, leaving behind a small, perfectly round hole.</p><p>All things considered, it was really just a minor wound\u2014at least according to the emergency room physician who gave his diagnosis even as he was backing away from the curtained-off cubicle to distance himself from Sophie\u2019s wrath. The doctor\u2019s nurse had already called security.</p><p>Sophie understood their reaction. After all, she had threatened to kill an aide, a woman wearing the name tag \u201cTrainee Louanne,\u201d and if Sophie had been the one holding the scissors, she just might have followed through on her threat. Trainee Scissor-Happy hadn\u2019t gently removed Sophie\u2019s beautiful blouse. Oh, no. She\u2019d used her scissors to cut it off her, and Sophie had been too woozy to stop her. When Sophie had tried to protest, the aide gave her a contemptuous grin and continued to shred the delicate silk.</p><p>The blouse, being unbuttoned during the shooting, had escaped the ravages of the bullet, but now it was in tatters. Her beautiful, beautiful Dolce &amp; Gabbana blouse was ruined. Sophie knew she was being foolish, even a little crazy maybe, to love something as much as she loved that blouse, but she also knew it wasn\u2019t actually the blouse she loved as much as what it represented. It was the last thing she had bought with the birthday money her father had given her. She had worn the blouse several times before she\u2019d developed scruples, and because it wasn\u2019t a new purchase, she didn\u2019t have any qualms about continuing to wear it. Since she would not allow herself to accept money from her father to buy such an extravagant gift, she doubted she\u2019d ever buy anything that luxurious again. Any extra money she saved on her paltry salary went to charity. It was just the way things had to be. She wasn\u2019t sure why she was so obsessive about it. Perhaps she was doing penance for her father\u2019s supposed sins, or maybe it was her own pathetic attempt at damage control.</p><p>As soon as the nurse and the trainee left Sophie alone, she sat up and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Even though they\u2019d given her a shot to ease her discomfort, she felt a jolt of pain. She winced, grabbing hold of the sheets on either side of her to keep from pitching forward. She heard raised voices coming from the nurse\u2019s station down the hall. Men were arguing. Probably doctors and security officers bickering about who was going to have to deal with her.</p><p>She felt a little embarrassed by the scene she\u2019d caused, and she knew she had been a pain in the backside. But then she looked down, saw the tattered remains of her blouse, remembered the smug look on the trainee\u2019s face, and was once again furious.</p><p>Trainee Louanne pulled the curtain aside and returned to pick up the remnants. Her expression was downright ugly. It took Sophie about ten seconds to figure out what Louanne was all about. She was a bitter woman who felt she deserved better. There was a hard, mean look about her. She was in her forties, Sophie estimated, but her bloodshot eyes and red-veined nose suggested a liver that was pushing eighty. Her heavy, nauseatingly sweet perfume was, no doubt, poured on liberally to hide the smell of the alcohol she added to her drinks during breaks.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Louanne said with a contemptuous snort.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Now go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour last name isn\u2019t Summerfield. It\u2019s Rose.\u201d Trainee Louanne all but spit out the name as though it was the most foul of words. She looked over her shoulder to make certain no one was listening before continuing. \u201cYou can\u2019t threaten me and get away with it. You\u2019re nothing but trash. You know what? Your daddy\u2019s a money whore, and you\u2019re his daughter, so you have to be a whore, too.\u201d When she didn\u2019t get any reaction, Louanne\u2019s anger intensified. \u201cThe police are going to arrest you. I\u2019ll file a complaint,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to arrest you.\u201d Still no reaction. Louanne became incensed. \u201cYou better apologize.\u201d</p><p>That got a reaction.</p><p>\u201cApologize? That was a Dolce &amp; Gabbana,\u201d Sophie railed. \u201cGa...bbana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell the police you struck me. That\u2019s called battery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s called lying.\u201d</p><p>The one good thing about FBI agents was that they could be quiet when they needed to be. Louanne turned around and found Jack MacAlister standing just a foot behind her.</p><p>She looked back at Sophie. \u201cIt\u2019s my word against yours.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t have the patience for stupidity. \u201cAlec, you getting this?\u201d</p><p>Only then did Louanne notice the badges and guns. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean nothing by\u2014That crazy woman yelled at me, and I didn\u2019t think that was right, and she threatened to kill me with scissors!\u201d she added, bobbing her head frantically. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably deny it, but she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. I did threaten to kill you. Hand me those scissors, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, for God\u2019s sake...\u201d Alec began.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Louanne shouted. \u201cDo you see? And she was screaming at me about a stupid blouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Have a little respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Alec didn\u2019t say a word. They simply stared at the woman.</p><p>Louanne swallowed and stammered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really going to lie to the police. But she was terrible to me. Just terrible. And I was just trying to do my job. I\u2019m behind on my work, so I better get to it. There are other patients more appreciative.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the privacy curtain closed and was sniffling as she hurried down the hall. Both men waited until she had disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Alec said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go get Regan. You keep Sophie company.\u201d</p><p>Jack took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not going in there. I\u2019ll go get your wife.\u201d</p><p>Alec slid the curtain back and walked over to Sophie\u2019s bed. \u201cAre you in much pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.\u201d</p><p>The sympathy in his voice made her feel weepy. She put her hand up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me, not yet anyway. I\u2019m on the edge, Alec, right on the edge.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her dramatic warning. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself. You made that trainee cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to find a way to live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my partner\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Now that cheered her up. \u201cYou always know just the right thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hug you and pat your back and tell you it\u2019s going to be all right, but I don\u2019t want to get blood all over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show your love by shooting someone for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer do I have to wait? I\u2019ve been X-rayed, CAT-scanned, prodded and poked. I lost some blood, and I think they may have taken the rest.\u201d</p><p>She felt nauseated again. The adrenaline rush from her anger had ebbed, and pain was now radiating up her chest.</p><p>\u201cThe surgeon\u2019s looking at the films now. Then he\u2019ll come in to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what happened. Someone shot you. I also know you couldn\u2019t have seen the shooter. He was too far away. There are some details you could clear up for me, but that can wait until you\u2019re sewed back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Agent MacAlister go everywhere with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s the other way around. I\u2019ve been assigned to him. I go wherever he goes. That might change soon, though. Jack might be taking a leave of absence.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother asking why. \u201cBoth of you should go home. This isn\u2019t a federal matter. I\u2019ll give my statement to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, and it hasn\u2019t been decided yet if this will stay local or be a federal investigation. Besides, I want that bullet as soon as they pry it out of you.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered at the thought. \u201cI\u2019ll mail it to you.\u201d She sighed and added, \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be here long.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t remember much after that. The surgeon came in with a nurse who gave her another shot, and sleep was almost instantaneous. She didn\u2019t know how long she was out, but when she next opened her eyes, she was in a hospital bed with an IV drip. Regan and Cordie stood together by the window whispering. Sophie knew they were worried.</p><p>\u201cDid you see it?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>Jack was in the doorway. He had heard what she asked and thought the question odd. Why would she think her friends had seen her injury? Or maybe she was asking them if they had seen the bullet that had done the damage.</p><p>Apparently Cordie and Regan knew exactly what she was asking.</p><p>\u201cWho would deliberately destroy a Dolce &amp; Gabbana?\u201d Cordie asked. \u201cIt\u2019s criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shirt,\u201d Jack commented.</p><p>It was the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful blouse,\u201d Regan snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt was symbolic,\u201d Cordie added. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA symbolic blouse with blood all over it.\u201d</p><p>Regan groaned. \u201cWe could have tried cleaning it. The bullet didn\u2019t tear it. That woman who cut it was barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you threatened to kill her?\u201d he asked, addressing Sophie as he walked into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about a cabana anyway?</p><p>\u201cGabbana,\u201d Cordie corrected.</p><p>\u201cHe knows what it is,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cHe\u2019s making fun of me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. He watched for her reaction as he asked her friends, \u201cYou tell her about the skirt yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...not the skirt,\u201d Sophie whimpered. \u201cI loved that skirt. It was\u2014\u201d His smile stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 283</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>I finally had the opportunity to talk to Eric in private. I insisted that he accompany me to set up a temporary shelter to observe the pack.</p><p>I didn\u2019t beat around the bush. I told him I had a sample of Ricky\u2019s blood, that it was one of the first vials taken, and that there was no unknown hormone evident, not a trace, even though the samples he took showed high levels of the mysterious stuff.</p><p>Eric bluntly admitted he had been experimenting on Ricky, but he swore he hadn\u2019t injected any of the other wolves. He knew what he was doing would get him in trouble, so he begged me to keep silent until I had read the data he\u2019d collected.</p><p>We spent hours and hours going back and forth, but in the end Eric convinced me to go along with the experiment. If his incredible claims prove to be accurate, he\u2019s stumbled upon a wonder drug.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>SOPHIE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL THE FOLLOWING evening. Regan pleaded with her to come and stay at The Hamilton, and Cordie lobbied for her to move in with her in her not quite yet renovated brownstone. Sophie refused their kind offers, insisting that she would be just fine at home. She wanted to sleep in her own bed. There would be round-the-clock protection until the shooter was in custody.</p><p>Alec insisted on driving her home, which meant she also had a second escort, Jack MacAlister.</p><p>Once she was in her own place and had changed into sweatpants and an old flannel shirt, she could finally relax. She sat on the sofa, swung her feet up on the ottoman, and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Detective Morris?\u201d she asked Alec. \u201cI don\u2019t remember his last name.\u201d</p><p>Alec smiled. \u201cYou mean Detective Morris Steinbeck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteinbeck, like the author?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the detective in charge of your case, and no I haven\u2019t talked to him yet. I\u2019ll call him in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she said. \u201cHow come John Wincott didn\u2019t take the case? He\u2019s a detective and he\u2019s your friend, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t assigned to John,\u201d Alec explained.</p><p>\u201cSo the locals are handling it?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to take over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to, but John told me that Steinbeck\u2019s a good detective and I should butt out and let him do his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want the case, you should take it,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m too close to it,\u201d he said. \u201cSophie\u2019s a good friend. If Steinbeck doesn\u2019t keep me informed, then I might cause some trouble.\u201d</p><p>Such arrogance. Had Sophie\u2019s incision not been throbbing, she might have laughed. Were all men as arrogant and cocky as these two? If Steinbeck doesn\u2019t keep me informed, I\u2019ll cause trouble? Oh, brother. Power. Is that what it was about? FBI trumps police? Alec sounded egotistical, but at least he meant well.</p><p>While Alec and Jack continued to discuss territorial issues, she grabbed her sack of supplies. She\u2019d left the hospital with an antibiotic, extra bandages, and pain medication. It was definitely time to take a pill.</p><p>Alec turned to Sophie. \u201cTell me about Steinbeck. What did you think of him?\u201d Alec wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to know what he was doing. He was thorough. He certainly asked a lot of questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to tell, was there?\u201d Jack asked before disappearing into the kitchen. Sophie heard him rummaging through the cabinets.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he looking for?\u201d she asked Alec.</p><p>\u201cFood. We\u2019re starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some carrots in the fridge,\u201d she called out.</p><p>She heard Jack laugh. He came back into the living room with bags of potato chips and pretzels, two bottled waters, and a Diet Coke. He tossed the pretzels and one of the bottles to Alec.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have seen the shooter,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her on the sofa. \u201cHe was too far away.\u201d He kicked off his shoes and put his feet up next to hers on the ottoman.</p> <p>\u201cComfy?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>The man obviously didn\u2019t understand sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the shooter. I had to tell Steinbeck about the threats, and he asked me to give him names of people who would want to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that\u2019s a long list,\u201d Jack commented nonchalantly as he ripped open the bag of chips.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d she retorted. \u201cI told the detective that everyone loves me, that I\u2019m kind and sweet, and no one would ever want to harm me.\u201d Except maybe Trainee Louanne, she thought, and the emergency room doctor. She\u2019d made him shake in his boots. And, oh yes, the creepy guy who hit on her on the El, the one who wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. There was also the woman at that boutique....</p><p>\u201cAll right, maybe there is a long list,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI told the detective that when Kelly\u2019s closed and it came to light that the pension was gone, there were a lot of very angry employees. Can you blame them? They were counting on that money for their retirement. My father happened to be a big shareholder in one of the companies in the hedge fund where the money was invested. As soon as the fund went belly up, the finger-pointing started. I\u2019m sure you saw the press conference where the lying CEO came right out and said my father took the money before the stock crashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe CEO didn\u2019t come right out and say it, Sophie. He was smart enough not to get charged with slander,\u201d Alec said.</p> <p>\u201cHe implied it, and that\u2019s just as damaging,\u201d she countered. \u201cDon\u2019t you think a few people believed him? And those same people might want to get even. Everyone wants a scapegoat. No one wants to be responsible for anything bad that happens. When Congress screws up, they find one or two scapegoats to feed to the public even though they were responsible. My father, in this instance, is the scapegoat just because he\u2019s had some questionable dealings in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen those vengeful people should go after your father, not you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cLeave my father out of this.\u201d</p><p>Jack noticed she was having trouble getting the bottle open and took it from her. \u201cCan\u2019t leave your father out,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s smack in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss my father with you or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Jack let it go for the moment. She wasn\u2019t in any shape to argue right now. She looked pale and her hands shook when he gave her the opened bottle. She would have spilled the pills all over the sofa if he hadn\u2019t taken the bottle from her again.</p><p>\u201cListen, since you haven\u2019t spoken to Detective Steinbeck,\u201d Sophie said, \u201cI probably should tell you something...\u201d She didn\u2019t get any further. This was going to be difficult to explain and she thought maybe she should let Steinbeck tell them instead.</p><p>Alec and Jack both waited for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Jack asked, holding up the pill bottle. \u201cAnd who do you need to tell? Alec or me?\u201d</p><p>She held out her palm, surprised to see how she trembled. \u201cOne, please, and I guess I\u2019ll have to tell both of you since you\u2019re sitting right here. I don\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ship sailed a long time ago.\u201d Jack looked at the label on the medication. \u201cThese aren\u2019t very strong. Sure you don\u2019t want to take two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne pill is enough to swallow.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGet it? You\u2019re the other pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they X-ray your head at the hospital?\u201d Jack countered.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Alec jumped up to answer it. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs the security detail already here?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gil isn\u2019t coming until nine. Hopefully, Regan and Cordie are here with groceries and carry-out. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Jack got up to help. Cordie handed him a bag of groceries and Regan handed her husband the barbecue.</p><p>Sophie called from the sofa, \u201cDid you get my batteries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriple A, like you asked,\u201d Regan replied as she stocked the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019ll put them here on the counter.\u201d</p><p>Sophie wasn\u2019t hungry, but Cordie coaxed her into drinking some of the hot soup she\u2019d stopped to get at the Chinese restaurant down the street. The tasty soup picked her up.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s friends hovered over her. Cordie put the back of her hand on Sophie\u2019s forehead to make sure she wasn\u2019t feverish, and Regan shoved pillows behind Sophie\u2019s back and wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt was minor surgery,\u201d Sophie protested. \u201cMinor,\u201d she repeated. \u201cStitches come out in a week, and then I\u2019m back to normal. I could even get back to the weights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have you ever done weights?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything we can do for you?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Sophie looked around the room. The drapes were closed for the first time in probably a year, and it reminded her of how the glass had been shattered by the bullet.</p><p>Alec followed her gaze. He and Jack had finished eating and were sprawled in easy chairs flanking her fireplace. \u201cGil took care of the window for you. He had people here early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just may have to marry that man,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cHe\u2019s so efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou could put the groceries away and then go home. You\u2019re making me nuts hovering. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Cordie followed Sophie into her bedroom and would have gone into the bathroom with her if Sophie hadn\u2019t quickly shut the door. She changed the bandage and was surprised that the incision didn\u2019t look all that bad. After washing her hands and face, she grabbed a tube of moisturizing cream and opened the door. She burst into laughter. Cordie had made the bed and fluffed the pillows.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get into bed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God. No, I don\u2019t want to get into bed. I had minor surgery,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s not even seven o\u2019clock, and I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d</p><p>Cordie followed her back to the sofa. \u201cI have to call Mr. Bitterman,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cordless phone? I know he must be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already talked to him,\u201d Alec said. \u201cHe called me on my cell phone when he heard you\u2019d been shot, and I assured him you were fine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCordie, did you e-mail everyone to let them know I\u2019m okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you notify?\u201d Alec asked. He sounded mildly curious.</p><p>\u201cFamily and friends,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her father? Did you notify him?\u201d</p><p>Regan gave her husband \u201cthe look,\u201d which he completely ignored.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d really like to talk to him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou know, take him out for a beer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hard man to pin down,\u201d Alec added.</p><p>\u201cHe moves around a lot,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cMy father is a busy man. At the moment, he\u2019s out of the country.\u201d</p><p>Cordie and Regan knew how uncomfortable Sophie was talking about her father, and they quickly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cOne of my kids tried to blow up my lab,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cCordie teaches chemistry at one of the high schools,\u201d Sophie explained to Jack. \u201cDidn\u2019t one of your kids blow up the lab last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cHow does someone sort of blow up a lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Cordie looked at Regan and tilted her head toward Sophie, a hint that it was her turn to keep the conversation away from Bobby Rose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget that noise,\u201d Regan blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat noise?\u201d Sophie asked. She remembered she hadn\u2019t taken her antibiotic and was now tackling the childproof bottle.</p><p>\u201cOver the phone, I heard a booming sound and glass shattering and then a crash.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t have the patience for the bottle, and without thinking what she was doing, she tossed the bottle to Jack. He\u2019d opened one bottle; he could open another.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were dead, Sophie,\u201d Regan said and immediately became teary-eyed. \u201cI really did. I called nine-one-one on one house phone and called Alec on another. But I kept the cell phone line open, hoping you\u2019d answer me. Did you hear me shouting to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage three phones at once?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it, but I did. Alec and Jack were in a meeting, and usually the secretary won\u2019t interrupt, but I didn\u2019t have to do much explaining. I think I freaked her out, shouting about you getting shot.\u201d</p><p>Alec reached for Regan and pulled her into his lap. \u201cWe made it to the hospital before you did, Sophie,\u201d he said.</p><p>Regan dabbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home and have a good cry.\u201d</p><p>Alec patted her arm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and cry now? You\u2019ll never make it all the way back to the hotel dry-eyed.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed. Regan could cry at the drop of a hat. It was really kind of impressive. When the three of them were in elementary school, Cordie and Sophie would see who could make Regan cry first. Sophie always told a sad story she\u2019d made up, and Cordie always sang a sad song. Now that she thought about it, what they did wasn\u2019t very nice. Fun, but still not nice. This was an odd time for these memories to surface. Maybe the pain pills had something to do with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you cry when we were little,\u201d Sophie said, suddenly feeling guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you make her cry?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d Cordie admitted.</p><p>\u201cUntil I caught on.\u201d Regan shrugged. She went into the foyer to get her sweater and purse. She turned around to Cordie and said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home if you\u2019re ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Sophie doesn\u2019t need me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease go,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI\u2019m begging you, and take these two with you.\u201d</p><p>It took five more minutes before her friends made it to the door. Regan turned back one last time and asked, \u201cI was wondering. Who was on the cell phone when you got shot? Whoever it was must have been freaked out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, about that...we\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Alec and Jack hadn\u2019t picked up on her evasive answer. They seemed rooted to their chairs.</p><p>Once Regan and Cordie were gone, she turned to the men. \u201cYou should go home, too,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until Gil gets here,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you have to wait with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jack\u2019s ride home, so yeah, we both have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was on the cell phone?\u201d Jack asked. Now he was curious.</p><p>\u201cI already explained it all to Detective Steinbeck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplained what? Who was it?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Up to now, she had avoided telling them, but she guessed this moment was inevitable. There was no getting out of it.</p><p>\u201cThe man who shot me.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 290</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Something dreadful has befallen the pack. Allie, one of the females, died yesterday. We noticed she had been unusually quiet the last couple of days, but we didn\u2019t pay close attention.</p><p>Eric took me aside to assure me he had nothing to do with Allie\u2019s death. I believe him, but I\u2019ll be relieved when I find no unusual hormone in Allie\u2019s blood.</p><p>Two more wolves are showing symptoms. We\u2019re guessing the cause is a virus, but we\u2019ve been unable to identify it. We all feel so helpless and pray the others remain healthy.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cBUT YOU WOULD HAVE LOOKED,\u201d SOPHIE PROTESTED.</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d said Alec. \u201cNo, I would not have looked. Would you have looked out that window, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Sophie glanced from one to the other. \u201cOh, come on. If someone called you, and that someone\u2019s voice sounded familiar, and he told you that he didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise...\u201d</p><p>The two men appeared so incredulous that she stopped trying to justify her actions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much reacting the same way Detective Steinbeck reacted,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask him if he would have looked out the window?\u201d Jack wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jack prodded when she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>\u201cAnd he said he wouldn\u2019t have looked,\u201d she admitted reluctantly. \u201cHe\u2019s a homicide detective. What else could he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember why your boss wanted you to work from home?\u201d Alec asked. \u201cDid you forget about the threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t forget,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t take them seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get threats all the time\u2014at least every time my father is in the news being unfairly accused of some crime or other. He\u2019s never been convicted, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past, what kind of threats have you gotten?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>She gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cThe usual stuff. You know: \u2018I hate you,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you sorry,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m gonna rip your head off...blah, blah, blah...\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told her to report these the minute they happen,\u201d Alec told Jack.</p> <p>\u201cTell the police?\u201d Sophie scoffed. \u201cAnd have them hovering around me even more than they already do? For what? The threats always stop within a week or two. Alec, I am not going to live my life in fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did the shooter say to you before you looked out the window?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Be a sport.\u2019 I asked him to tell me his name, and he said, \u2018Be a sport.\u2019 He also said he didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you looked,\u201d Jack said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...Yeah, I guess getting shot might be considered a surprise,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not helpful to be sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>Jack, sitting in the other chair across from her, leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. \u201cSo if I ask you to be a sport, you\u2019ll pretty much do whatever I want you to do?\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t appreciate his attitude. If it involves shooting you, I probably would, she thought.</p><p>Alec wanted her to continue. \u201cYou said the voice sounded familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of familiar,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe was very cheerful, and he reminded me of a salesman. At the time I thought his voice sounded like I\u2019d heard it before, but now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time you get a threat, you call me immediately. Understand?\u201d Alec said, his tone hard.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Wrong thing to say, she realized, especially since she had just been released from the hospital and was nursing a gunshot wound. Alec looked as though he wanted to shake some sense into her. Jack\u2019s expression was even worse.</p> <p>\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I looking at you?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cLike you think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I nailed it. Good.\u201d</p><p>What did they want from her? The truth? Not going to get that, she decided. Of course she was scared, and so tired, tired of pre tending that none of the threats bothered her. They were both waiting for some contrition. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll admit it. I wasn\u2019t being cautious.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded agreement and turned to Alec. While he recited a litany of all the horrible things that could happen to her if she were not more careful, she sat in silence and observed. He really was a jerk, she thought. Too bad he was so damned sexy. She couldn\u2019t believe she was actually attracted to him. But why not? He was one fine specimen of masculinity\u2014tall, broad-shouldered, muscular. He had thick, dark hair, a chiseled face, and piercing eyes, and his bad boy smile made her stomach shiver when he looked at her a certain way.</p><p>She knew he was attracted to her, too. The way he watched her was awfully personal for an FBI agent. He looked at her the way a man looks at a woman he\u2019s interested in. She also knew he didn\u2019t want to want her. Considering that he thought she was an imbecile with a smart mouth, and considering who she was related to, who could blame him?</p><p>She studied Jack MacAlister closely as his conversation with Alec proceeded without her. Did he know she was attracted to him? She hoped not. Oh, God. FBI. What was wrong with her? What had happened to her standards?</p><p>She could go to bed with him, she supposed. It would just be sex, a lot of wild, amazing, passionate sex. No love involved, though. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to fall in love. She had to protect her heart. She wasn\u2019t like other women. She could never get married and have children...not with her family history.</p><p>Animalistic, crazed sex...no strings...nothing wrong with that, was there?</p><p>Hello.... FBI. Stop it, Sophie, she scolded. She had to be crazy thinking such thoughts. FBI. Why couldn\u2019t she seem to remember that when she looked at him?</p><p>She needed to occupy her mind with something else so she wouldn\u2019t have time to think about her warped choices of men. It was like dieting. Whenever she was on a diet, she had to keep busy so she wouldn\u2019t think about the quart of H\u00e4agen-Dazs chocolate chunk ice cream in the bottom of her freezer. Granted, she usually caved and ate the ice cream anyway, but she was determined not to cave with Jack. That was one craving she could resist.</p><p>William Harrington. With all the turmoil of the last twenty-four hours, she\u2019d practically forgotten about him. Now there was a mystery she could concentrate on. What had happened to him? And why had he gone to Prudhoe Bay? Did he go there after leaving the race? Why, then, had she been told he\u2019d gone to Europe? Something was wrong here, but what?</p><p>Sophie wasn\u2019t sure how to proceed. She thought about running her thoughts past Alec. She could tell him how she had met Harrington and explain the bizarre circumstances surrounding his death, but what could Alec suggest? That it was an accidental death? A horrible way to die, but still accidental?</p><p>She needed to talk to Mr. Bitterman. He was an expert on checking sources, and he would certainly know how she should investigate this. After all, he\u2019d played in the big leagues, working at one of the most prestigious newspapers in the world for over twenty years. She should call him.</p><p>Alec and Jack had ended their discussion of her, and Alec was texting on his iPhone.</p><p>\u201cAlec, do you think someone could be listening in on my phone conversations?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up as he answered, \u201cGil checked. He\u2019s positive no one is tapping the line. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was curious, that\u2019s all. Agent MacAlister, do you have someplace you need to be? You keep checking your watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you started calling me Jack? And no, I don\u2019t have any plans that can\u2019t be changed. I\u2019ll just make a quick call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec, for goodness\u2019s sake, drive Jack to his car. Let him keep his date. It\u2019s rude for him to cancel so late in the day.\u201d She couldn\u2019t leave it at that. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve heard that some of the high-priced escort services charge for last-minute cancellations.\u201d</p><p>Jack flashed a smile and said, \u201cCan\u2019t leave until Gil gets here.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang just then. Jack burst into laughter. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t plan that.\u201d</p><p>Gil was two hours early. He rushed inside carrying three large pizza boxes with two six-packs of bottled Kelly\u2019s Root Beer balanced precariously on top.</p><p>\u201cOut of my way, Alec. We\u2019ve got to eat these pizzas while they\u2019re nice and hot, and drink these sodas while they\u2019re nice and cold. Hey, Sophie, darling, how are you doing? Feel like eating a slice or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. Where\u2019d you get the Kelly\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack market,\u201d he answered with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou went to a lot of trouble bringing hot food in,\u201d she said. She was about to add that it was a shame Jack and Alec had already eaten and Regan and Cordie had already left, but Jack followed Gil to the table while Alec went into the kitchen to get some napkins.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind did you get?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what kind? The works, of course. If it\u2019s edible, it\u2019s on there.\u201d</p><p>Sophie crossed the room and nudged Jack out of the way to examine the huge pizza Gil had just opened. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to eat again?\u201d she asked, looking up at Jack.</p><p>Jack glanced down and suddenly felt tongue-tied. Damn, she was pretty. Face scrubbed, not an ounce of makeup, and she still looked gorgeous. Seductive as hell, too. Another time, another place, he\u2019d make a move.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, trying to remember what she\u2019d asked him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you were going to eat again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course I\u2019m gonna eat. It\u2019s pizza. We\u2019ve gotta eat while it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a no-brainer, Sophie,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>It\u2019s more like gluttony, she thought. She left them to their Roman feast, which seemed to be close to an orgasmic event, and went into the kitchen to make a cup of hot tea. She spotted the package of triple A batteries on the counter and was reminded of the digital recorder she\u2019d used to interview Harrington. Tonight, no matter what, she was going to listen to every single word Harrington had said. It was a fitting penance for calling him a narcissist. He was a narcissist, but she felt bad saying so.</p><p>This time she would pay attention. He might have said something relevant about Prudhoe Bay while she had zoned out, and maybe that something would explain the where, when, and why. The poor man was dead, and so she made a promise to herself not to complain while she listened to him drone on and on and on about each of his twenty-four races. And, oh yes, also the saga of his blisters. She would not fast forward through any of it no matter how strong the urge. She sighed. That poor dead man. That poor, god-awful boring, dead man.</p><p>She sipped her tea and went into the bedroom to get the digital recorder. She thought she\u2019d left it on her desk, but it wasn\u2019t there. As she was checking the drawers, she remembered she\u2019d put it in her purse just before Regan called. Uh-oh. It was all coming back to her now. She remembered holding the purse, the call interrupt, and now the infamous \u201cBe a sport\u201d spoken to her in such a cheerful voice.</p><p>The memory caused her to shudder. The purse had to be in the living room.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, though.</p><p>\u201cAlec, did you see my purse? Red leather...\u201d She glanced around the room again. \u201cI was holding it when I got shot. It has to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d Gil said around a mouthful of pizza. \u201cIt was on the floor, right over there by the window,\u201d he added, waving a half-eaten slice in that direction. \u201cIt was covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovered in blood? No, not my Prada!\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at Alec and tilted his head toward Sophie. \u201cIs this gonna be like the cabana shirt?\u201d</p><p>She heard him. \u201cIt was a Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and the Prada red leather tote is a one-of-a-kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas a one-of-a-kind,\u201d Jack corrected.</p><p>She felt like cursing. She slumped into the chair next to Jack. \u201cWas? Care to explain what you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say the Prada helped save your life,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThe bullet went through the latch before it got to you.\u201d</p><p>She sat back. \u201cOkay, I can have that fixed. If the leather isn\u2019t stained...if I can get the blood out...where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t here,\u201d Alec told her.</p><p>\u201cIt was part of the crime scene,\u201d Gil explained, \u201cso it was taken to the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it back. My recorder is inside, and my wallet with all my identification, and oh, my God, my credit cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Steinbeck in the morning,\u201d Alec promised as he finished the last of the pizza and began to clear off the table.</p><p>Sophie yawned. The pain medication was making her sleepy and she was worn out. \u201cDon\u2019t you two have someplace better to be?\u201d she asked Alec and Jack. \u201cMaybe some bad guys to catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cI might be taking a leave of absence. If I do, I\u2019m going to find a secluded beach where it\u2019s hot all year long and set up a hammock. I hate the cold, and Chicago\u2019s already getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a lovely time,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cNow, if you will please excuse me, I\u2019d like to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I\u2019ll head out,\u201d Alec said, \u201cbut Gil\u2019s staying here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Sophie began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me on this one, Sophie,\u201d Alec warned.</p><p>Gil winked at her. \u201cThat sofa looks mighty comfortable to me. I promise to be quiet as a mouse. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Sophie gave in. She no longer had the energy to argue.</p><p>After locking the door behind Alec and Jack, she went to her linen closet to get a blanket and pillow for Gil. She straightened up the kitchen and turned out the lights, then headed for her bedroom. The living room was illuminated by the glow of the TV. Gil was watching a basketball game with the volume turned down.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Gil,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Sophie, darling,\u201d he answered through a yawn.</p><p>Sophie dressed in her nightgown and sat on the edge of her bed. She was so weary she could hardly keep her eyes open. The clock on her nightstand said 11:30. She couldn\u2019t go to sleep yet. She had to stay awake another half hour, so she picked up a magazine and read. Finally, at 11:55, she slipped quietly out of bed. She tiptoed to her bedroom door and cracked it open a sliver. Gil was snoring loudly. Gently closing the door again, she crossed the room to her closet and pushed aside a stack of shoe boxes on the floor to reveal a small wooden panel. With a couple of taps the panel came loose. Behind it was a cavity the size of a paperback novel. She reached inside and pulled out a thin cell phone. Glancing across the room at the nightstand, she squinted to see the clock. It now said 11:59. She waited.</p><p>At precisely midnight, the phone vibrated in her hand.</p><p>Sophie quickly flipped it open and put it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 300</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>I cannot describe how distraught all of us are. Lucy, the other adults, the pups, all gone. The only survivor is Ricky.</p><p>Ricky was at death\u2019s door, too. Eric convinced Brandon and Kirk to return to the base facility. As soon as they left, Eric sedated Ricky and then, with my help, gave the wolf another injection of K-74. I urged him to increase the dosage.</p><p>Within hours of injecting him, Ricky was up and as strong as ever. His remarkable recovery in such a short time stunned Brandon and Kirk.</p><p>For the first time, I saw emotion in our alpha male. Ricky went into deep mourning over the loss of his family. He couldn\u2019t seem to find his bearings and wailed long into the night; in the daytime, he paced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FIFTEEN</p><p>EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, ACCORDING TO her father anyway, and ninety-nine percent of the time he was right. Things did have a way of working out for the better, and, as he constantly reminded her, there would be a light at the end of the tunnel. It was just that crawling through that tunnel to get to the light was always such a pain.</p><p>Getting shot was a perfect example. What possible good could come from that? Too soon to know, she supposed, but she chose to believe her father and to embrace his optimistic outlook on life. She also thought she\u2019d start embracing another of his philosophies: get even. Sophie would welcome the opportunity to shoot the man who had shot her. See how much he liked it.</p><p>Over the phone her father promised her that Kelly\u2019s employees would get justice, and she trusted him. She hoped they would get their money back, too, which she mentioned several times. Her father\u2019s response was a simple, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>After they finished discussing the current sorry state of affairs with Kelly\u2019s Root Beer, she told him all about William Harrington, sparing no details of his gruesome death. He suggested that she pack her bag and take a trip to Prudhoe Bay. He reminded her that she was a reporter, and that there was obviously a story to be had there. Sophie recognized her father\u2019s real motive. He wanted her out of Chicago until all the hoopla over Kelly\u2019s closing calmed down. What he suggested made good sense, though. There was a story to be told in Alaska.</p><p>The next couple of days went by surprisingly fast, yet Sophie didn\u2019t get much of anything accomplished. She slept a lot, ate a little, and felt dull as oatmeal. Gil spent only that first night in her apartment, but he was never far away. When he wasn\u2019t guarding her apartment, someone else was on duty. No one got past the lobby without identification and permission. The added security was Alec\u2019s doing, and Sophie didn\u2019t know how she was ever going to repay him for keeping her safe.</p><p>She had company, lots of company, and there were Get Well cards and fresh flowers. Mrs. Bitterman came by with a pot of homemade spaghetti sauce and meatballs. There was enough to feed a family of twelve. Even complete strangers sent good wishes for her speedy recovery. Most insisted they didn\u2019t believe Bobby Rose\u2014Chicago\u2019s very own Robin Hood\u2014had stolen money from Kelly\u2019s retirement fund. The vast majority blamed Kevin Devoe, Kelly\u2019s investment money manager, for being inept and making bad stock purchases.</p><p>Sophie couldn\u2019t escape from the scandal. Every night there was something in the local news about the company closing and also about the bitter divorce. Kelly\u2019s daughter, Meredith, and her soon-to-be-ex, Kevin Devoe, were involved in a nasty, hateful fight. Accusations were being flung by each side, and all of them were caught on film and shown like a sick soap opera on the six o\u2019clock and ten o\u2019clock local TV news. Their vile, angry sneers were right there in the middle of the screen for everyone to see.</p><p>How could a couple who obviously had loved each other when they married turn into such gargoyles? Love one day, hate the next? No wonder the thought of marriage made Sophie want to gag.</p> <p>Mr. Bitterman called her every day, but he refused to come and see her until she had recovered from her injury, and he refused to let her say a word about work.</p><p>\u201cI know if I do, you\u2019ll hound me to let you get back to the newspaper, and I\u2019ll feel sorry for you because you were shot, and I might give in,\u201d he told her.</p><p>When she opened her mouth to talk, he cut her off. At first she was infuriated by his obstinacy because she was dying to tell him about Harrington\u2019s fate, but she soon realized Bitterman\u2019s stubborn insistence could work to her advantage. She needed more time to gather information before approaching him with her plan.</p><p>Sophie couldn\u2019t get Harrington out of her mind. She wanted to call Paul Larson in Prudhoe Bay and ask him if he had found out anything more about the deceased. Paul had given her his cell phone number and had told her she could call him anytime night or day, but she didn\u2019t want to bother him. He had a full-time job working as a security officer for the oil companies, and he had promised that he would call her if and when he had further information about Harrington. Still, waiting to hear something was driving her to distraction.</p><p>She kept a notebook close, and every time she remembered something Harrington had said during that endless interview, she jotted it down. Guilt plagued her. She should have paid more attention to him.</p><p>Her attention now, however, was focussed on her missing purse. What she should do is find out where the crime lab was located, go there, and demand that they give her back her personal possessions. They still had her digital recorder with every word Harrington had said on it.</p> <p>THE DAY HER STITCHES WERE REMOVED started out as a very good day indeed. Paul Larson, the security guy from Alaska, called with all sorts of interesting information.</p><p>\u201cThey found Harrington\u2019s wallet. It was thirty yards from the remnants of a tent that had been set up about twenty miles from nowhere. I mean it. It was smack dab in the middle of the most desolate land you could ever imagine. Nothing around for miles and miles. A small plane flew over looking for Barry, and they set down to put some new markers up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Barry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe male polar bear that ate...I mean that killed William Harrington. I\u2019ve discovered that Barry is quite the celebrity up here.\u201d</p><p>She was horrified. \u201cBecause he killed a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no. He\u2019s a celebrity because he\u2019s been part of a scientific study on polar bears. There\u2019s always one scientific group or another up here collecting data about something. If it\u2019s not the polar bears, it\u2019s global warming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they were checking up on Barry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The pilot spotted a long strip of red fabric flying in the wind. A big wad of it was part of a tent, but then there was another smaller strip frozen to the wallet. If the tent hadn\u2019t been such a bright color, he never would have seen it. Even so, when you think about how huge this place is, it\u2019s pretty amazing they found anything. They call it a frozen wasteland.\u201d</p> <p>And William Harrington pitched a tent in the middle of it? What in God\u2019s name was he doing camping twenty miles from...frozen nothing? Sophie couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what he had been up to. She wondered aloud: \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose Harrington was in Alaska because of one of these scientific studies, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of study?\u201d Larson asked.</p><p>\u201cThis might be a stretch, but I keep thinking about the project Harrington mentioned. He called it the Alpha Project. It\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cHarrington was pretty boastful, so he most likely was exaggerating about some superman club he was a part of, but it might be worth a little investigating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha Project?\u201d Larson laughed. \u201cSounds a little sci fi to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Paul,\u201d Sophie admitted, \u201cyet I can\u2019t help but be intrigued. I still wonder why Harrington was in Alaska. What was inside the wallet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis driver\u2019s license, a couple of hundred-dollar bills, and a twenty, and a Visa bank card. There wasn\u2019t a scratch on that skinny leather wallet. Not a scratch they said. Amazing, huh? Considering...you know...\u201d</p><p>Considering that good old Barry had chewed up William Harrington?</p><p>\u201cThey sent the wallet down to the lab in Anchorage. The remains had already been taken there. I talked to a guy down there, told him I was real interested in the investigation, and that I would appreciate it if he would let me know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI guess they started with the bank that issued the credit card and from there they tracked down the name of a law firm handling Harrington\u2019s affairs. They even got the name of the one and only relative, who, I understand, is going to inherit a hell of a lot of money. Dwayne Wicker. A second cousin. Pretty sad he only had the one relative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who his friends were or if he even had friends,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cWe only discussed the twenty-four races he\u2019d won. And blisters. We talked a long time about his blisters.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cBlisters? You\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m ashamed to admit I sort of daydreamed while he talked. I feel bad about that. Those races meant so much to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he blow off the twenty-fifth race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say he knew he wouldn\u2019t win, but the fact that he was still wearing his racing socks in Alaska is making me wonder if there isn\u2019t much more to his disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ve got an idea. Since you\u2019re not going to be writing about races, come up here and write about Alaska. We\u2019ve got a five-star hotel just outside of Barrow. How about I make a reservation for you? I really want that candlelight dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they put chocolates on the pillows every night in this five-star hotel?\u201d</p><p>He had a nice laugh. \u201cOkay, I made up the hotel, but you still have to come up here. We have a no-frills hotel here with clean rooms and clean sheets, and you\u2019ve really got to see the northern lights. The view here is spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was a wasteland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beautiful wasteland.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a contradiction. You just have to see it to understand. Alaska will fascinate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThink about me, too.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond to his comment. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me if you get any more information on Harrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call you anyway. Bye now.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE WAS DESPERATE. \u201cI need Kelly\u2019s Root Beer, and I need it bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re calling me because...?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you know how to get things from the street...the \u2019hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2019hood, like in neighborhood. Can you get me some or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of bottles in my refrigerator. I could bring them over after my last chem lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. I need cases of the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll ask the obvious. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Mr. Bitterman is coming over tonight. There\u2019s a story I want to investigate and it might be necessary for me to take a trip. My hope is that he\u2019ll approve the story and cover my expenses. I\u2019ll tell you everything when we get together. But now I need root beer and lots of it. I lured Mr. Bitterman to my apartment with a promise, and I exaggerated just a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much is a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggested I had a closet full of the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an easy solution. Call the grocery store and have them deliver a couple of cases of another brand of root beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bitterman would have heart failure. It has to be Kelly\u2019s Root Beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Regan? Maybe she can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already given her an assignment. She\u2019s supposed to work on Alec to help me get my things back from the crime lab. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for them to hold on to my personal possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGil told me there was blood all over your purse and that the bullet went through the clasp. Poor you. They had to take it because it was part of the crime scene. Don\u2019t you ever watch any of those CSI shows on television? You\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t cut your rug up and take that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the things inside my purse? Why do they need to keep my wallet and digital recorder and my cell phone? I guess I can kiss that battery good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Detective Steinbeck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have talked to him. He keeps telling me he\u2019ll get my things back real soon, but I\u2019ve stopped believing him. He\u2019s just humoring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think Alec can do. This isn\u2019t a federal investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has friends in the police department, and I\u2019m hoping he can get one of them to help. I really need my recorder. There\u2019s an important interview I have to listen to,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cAh, the runner interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m desperate. I even left a message on Alec\u2019s cell phone telling him that if I don\u2019t get my recorder back by tomorrow, I\u2019m going to break into the crime lab and get it myself. If I have to tear up the place, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cOh, I bet he just loved listening to that message.\u201d</p><p>After she finished talking with her friend, Sophie tried several other possibilities, but none of them could hook her up with Kelly\u2019s Root Beer. The beverage was as scarce as mascara at an Amish convention.</p><p>Nothing was going her way, and Sophie had reached the end of her rope. She wasn\u2019t asking for much, just a little good news.</p><p>And then it came. But why is it that most good news is accompanied by bad news? Sophie wondered.</p><p>Good news: She got her digital recorder back.</p><p>Bad news: Jack MacAlister came with it.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 304</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Brandon called a meeting and proposed we keep the deaths of the pack \u201cour little secret.\u201d He fears that our funding will be taken away. It had only just been renewed, and none of us wants to leave until we see what happens to Ricky.</p><p>We\u2019ve all agreed to Brandon\u2019s proposal.</p><p>Ricky has found a new pack for us. He wandered alone for almost two weeks before he found another family. It\u2019s typical for wolves to move around in the fall and winter. Ricky came across a pack in migration, and though it\u2019s highly unusual, he has managed to blend in. It remains to be seen if this alpha male will cause trouble in his new community.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>AGENT MACALISTER WAS AS CHARMING AS EVER. AND SO was his greeting. He didn\u2019t waste time on \u201cHello\u201d or \u201cHi there.\u201d She opened the door and heard, \u201cIt\u2019s a felony to break into a crime lab and steal evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t break into the lab, did I? I merely threatened to,\u201d she replied. \u201cI suppose it would be impolite to ask you to give me my recorder and then go away, Agent MacAlister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Call me Jack.\u201d He smiled as he walked past her into the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting your recorder back until you say my name.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like he was going to be leaving anytime soon. He was making himself comfortable on her sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest and suddenly remembered she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra under her T-shirt. The band rubbed against her incision. She grabbed her oversized cardigan. She had placed it on the back of a chair and planned to put it on before she opened the door to Mr. Bitterman, but she\u2019d forgotten all about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack dropped her recorder on the table next to him, pushed the ottoman farther from the sofa to accommodate his long legs, then sat back and put his feet up.

It\u2019s a leave of absence.\u201d His answer was abrupt, impatient.</p> <p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat beach do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what beach yet.

He could have sent a messenger with the recorder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to listen to the interview.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand up when he saw she was going to object and said, \u201cDetective Steinbeck told Alec he\u2019d already listened to it, but when pressed, admitted he had trouble paying attention. Said that the guy you were interviewing...what\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrington. William Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Steinbeck said it was a real dry interview...\u201d</p><p>Her back stiffened. \u201cI beg to differ. I don\u2019t do dry interviews.\u201d</p><p>Jack continued as though she hadn\u2019t interrupted. \u201cSteinbeck said Harrington droned on and on in a monotone voice.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie nodded. True. Harrington had droned on and on.</p><p>\u201cThe police are investigating anyone you may have come in contact with in the days before the shooting and Alec thought one of us should listen to it just in case there was some connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just talks about 5K races he\u2019s won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many 5K races?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cTwenty-four. Are you sure you want to listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. She tapped her foot impatiently while deciding what to do. Then she gave in. \u201cFine. You may listen to the interview.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSophie, I wasn\u2019t asking for permission. I\u2019m gonna listen to it. I can do it here, or I\u2019ll take the recorder and listen to it at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen to it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to start now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. We\u2019ll wait until Mr. Bitterman gets here. He probably won\u2019t want to listen to the interview, but I should give him the choice. And please, don\u2019t interfere when I\u2019m talking to him about an article I want to write. You\u2019ll want to interfere, but try and restrain yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to interfere?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe polar bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolar bear? You want to write about a polar bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly about the bear. His name is Barry, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a smile. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re writing a kid\u2019s book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if my intention was to scar them for life,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSay my name, Sophie, or I worry I might just have to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to call you by your first name because I don\u2019t want to get that friendly.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, you do. It\u2019s okay. I want to get friendly, too.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to like you to get friendly with you.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what to say now, and so, feeling a bit like a coward, she retreated to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGrab me a root beer,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she called back. \u201cThe root beer\u2019s for Mr. Bitterman.\u201d</p><p>He decided to join her in the galley kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWord on the street is that you\u2019ve got a whole closet full of Kelly\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The pipeline from Cordie to Jack needed to be plugged.</p><p>\u201cYou may have a Coke, a Pepsi, diet sodas, or water.\u201d</p><p>He had to check out the refrigerator himself before making a decision. He finally settled on a can of Diet Coke, then went to the cabinets to find something to snack on.</p><p>She tried to push rice cakes on him. Regan had gotten them for her at the grocery store, but Sophie didn\u2019t like them. What she did like was kettle chips, and so, of course, that was the snack Jack wanted.</p><p>\u201cJust because Alec can go through my cabinets doesn\u2019t mean you can.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already opened the bag and was chewing on a chip. \u201cYou aren\u2019t being a very gracious hostess. What are we having for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Her response wasn\u2019t clever. She sputtered.</p><p>\u201cUse your words, Sophie. Use your words,\u201d he drawled as he strolled back to the sofa.</p><p>She wanted to use a meat cleaver. Good thing she didn\u2019t own one. While she enjoyed a few other murderous thoughts, she got a cold soda out of the refrigerator, took a couple of deep breaths, and then went to join him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been injured. I\u2019m not cooking dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the looks of your kitchen, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t cook at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? The price tags and stickers are still on your pots and pans, or rather, your pot and pan. Didn\u2019t see any lids.\u201d</p><p>She sat down next to him, reached across his lap, and grabbed a handful of chips. \u201cI microwave.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly changed the subject. \u201cWhen\u2019s your boss getting here?\u201d</p><p>She checked the time on his watch and said, \u201cHe should be here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is the recording?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours, maybe a little more. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be in bed by ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen, huh? You don\u2019t look ninety. Must be all that sleep you\u2019re getting?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bitterman didn\u2019t show up until almost an hour later. It was odd, but sitting with Jack while they waited wasn\u2019t at all uncomfortable. He wasn\u2019t hesitant to answer questions about his background, where he grew up, where he went to college, and how, after graduating from law school, he had decided to become an FBI agent instead of joining a law firm.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re taking a leave of absence. Burn out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot someone you shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMental problems? That\u2019s a yes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d She nudged him in his side. She was as tenacious as he was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a forced leave of absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to explain, and when he kept silent, she pressed again. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to ask. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly told her about the YouTube video. Once he\u2019d finished explaining, he added, \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only person in Chicago who hasn\u2019t watched the damned thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe video. That\u2019s right. Regan and Cordie told me to watch it, but I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil something more interesting gets filmed, I\u2019m being hounded by the press. At first the higher-ups wanted me to lay low in Chicago, but this isn\u2019t going away. Now they want me out of town, so I\u2019m heading to an ocean until this blows over.\u201d He shook his head as he added, \u201cI guess I know what it must be like for you every time your father\u2019s in the news.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t want the conversation to get anywhere near her father, and so she steered him away with a couple of other personal questions. The only topic he was reluctant to discuss was his love life. He admitted he\u2019d never been married, but when she asked him if he\u2019d ever come close, he changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t push. \u201cI\u2019d ask about your background, but I don\u2019t need to. I know all about you.\u201d He then proceeded to prove it.</p><p>When she thought he had finished, she said, \u201cYou read my file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a whole lot more that isn\u2019t in your file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cLike you work hard to make people think you\u2019re superficial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am superficial.\u201d She protested even as she realized how ridiculous she sounded.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s your protection, isn\u2019t it? The only people who know the real you are Regan and Cordie, and maybe Regan\u2019s brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hide who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d His voice softened as he added, \u201cI\u2019ve done a little checking, and I\u2019ve got you all figured out, Sophie Rose.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re always saving for a new purse, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like purses.\u201d Jeez, she sounded defensive.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually buy the purses, though, do you? You pick out the one you want, save enough to buy it\u2014and I\u2019ve heard some of them are way up there in price\u2014and then you give the money to a two-hundred-forty-pound muscle man named Muffin, who runs a soup kitchen. It\u2019s become a game you and Muffin play. You send a photo of the purse in an envelope along with the cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m going to buy a Birkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s several thousand, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to buy the Birkin,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWould I go to visit it every Wednesday at five p.m. if I weren\u2019t? It\u2019s a gorgeous buttery tan with gold markings.\u201d</p><p>He looked exasperated. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to buy it. What you\u2019re going to do is save the money and then give the money away. You do a lot of nice things you don\u2019t want anyone to know about, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She started to protest again, but he stopped her. \u201cGive it up, Sophie. You\u2019re not an artificial, money-hungry, label-loving dimwit. Sorry, sweetheart. It just doesn\u2019t fly with me.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was squirming in the hot seat, but Mr. Bitterman saved the day when he knocked on the door. She had never felt such relief. She hated that Jack knew so much about her. Why had he gone to the trouble to find out her secrets? Why was he interested? What was he up to? Her father. That was it. He wouldn\u2019t be looking into her history and her behavior if he weren\u2019t hunting for something about her father.</p><p>Bitterman handed her his coat. Tugging off his tie on his way into the living room, he sat down hard in an easy chair. While he and Jack discussed the attempted murder investigation\u2014her attempted murder investigation\u2014she hung his coat in the closet and went into the kitchen to get him a cold root beer.</p><p>Bitterman was rolling up his sleeves as he asked Jack, \u201cSo no progress on the case at all? No leads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Detective Steinbeck is telling me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Bitterman pointed a finger at Sophie. He took the root beer she offered but held on to his frown. \u201cThen you\u2019re sitting tight, young lady. I don\u2019t want you running in the streets while there\u2019s some trigger-happy nutcase on the loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I don\u2019t run in the streets, and as far as sitting tight...I asked you to come over to talk about something important.\u201d Without thinking, Sophie crossed to the sofa and sat down next to Jack. Bitterman noticed.</p><p>\u201cBefore this conversation turns to business matters, I have to ask you how you were able to get so much root beer,\u201d her boss asked. \u201cI thought I\u2019d nabbed the last case in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Jack. He was trying not to laugh. \u201cYeah, Sophie, how\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>Her thoughts flashed back to the meat cleaver.</p><p>\u201cActually, sir, I was desperate to get you to come over so I could talk to you, and I might have exaggerated the exact amount of root beer on hand.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman leaned forward. \u201cYou might have exaggerated?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>She looked him in the eyes. \u201cI did exaggerate. I don\u2019t have a closet full of root beer. Just a couple of bottles. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, she lied,\u201d Jack was happy to interject.</p><p>Sophie gave him a look that should have withered him but didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want Mr. Bitterman to dwell on his disappointment so she quickly tried to turn his attention to a more important matter.</p><p>\u201cSir, do you remember William Harrington and the 5K race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I remember. He changed his mind at the last minute and didn\u2019t run the race, right? You told me it was because he knew he couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, but it turned out I was wrong. That wasn\u2019t the reason he didn\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman looked around the room. \u201cSeriously, there isn\u2019t more root beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, what I\u2019m trying to tell you is important.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right. So what was the guy\u2019s reason for not running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman took a few seconds to absorb the information, then said, \u201cWhat a shame. He was a young man, wasn\u2019t he? He had to be young to run all those races. I suppose dying is just about the best reason there is not to run a race. Where\u2019d it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Alaska,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe died in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>From her tone, Bitterman knew something more was coming. He set his root beer on the coffee table and sat back. \u201cHe did, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA polar bear ate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, confused. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She repeated the terrible news, and Jack chimed in at the end. \u201cBarry ate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, they named the polar bear that ate a man? That\u2019s awful callous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. He already had a name.\u201d</p><p>Now to the tricky part. Sophie had to convince Mr. Bitterman to let her investigate the story, and if necessary, send her to Alaska without making him think she might be in danger. Her boss was overly cautious about her. She hadn\u2019t quite rehearsed what she was going to say, but she thought she did a great job of piquing his interest and not hinting at anything other than a human interest story idea.</p><p>Then Jack started asking hard questions about living conditions, the wild animals, and the harsh climate\u2014all questions she didn\u2019t want to answer in front of her boss. Sophie poked him in his side with her elbow. \u201cWe can talk about this later, Jack. Remember, you weren\u2019t going to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe danger of\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cI know, it\u2019s terribly cold up there, but I\u2019ll wear the appropriate clothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2014\u201d</p><p>She poked him again. \u201cInstead of this story, I could write about your leave of absence and remind Chicago of the video.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned in close. \u201cIf you want to go to Alaska and freeze to death, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the sweetest things.\u201d</p> <p>It turned out that Bitterman liked the idea of Sophie getting out of Chicago for a while. He also thought his subscribers would enjoy reading some human interest stories about the rugged people who lived in Alaska. If she made the trip, he might as well get his money\u2019s worth.</p><p>\u201cI read somewhere that the high school in Barrow has started a football team. It was a clever way to keep the kids in school and off drugs and alcohol. It\u2019s working, too. You might want to go there. You\u2019ve sold me, Sophie. You can do the story. I\u2019ll fund the trip.\u201d</p><p>He started to stand, then changed his mind. \u201cJust wondering...how did you find out about Harrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had my business card with him. The police up there found it and called me to tell me he had died.\u201d</p><p>Before he asked another question, she rushed on, \u201cJack and I are going to listen to the interview I did with Harrington. I\u2019m hoping he said something I missed that would explain why he went there. It\u2019s a bit of a puzzle I\u2019d like to solve. Would you like to listen to the interview with us?\u201d</p> <p>Bitterman declined. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. I want to get home and relax.\u201d</p><p>The second the door closed behind him, Jack started toward her. She backed up.</p><p>\u201cA bit of a puzzle?\u201d he asked. \u201cCare to explain what you\u2019re really doing?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m giving William Harrington the last word.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 316</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p> <p>Eric and I have become brothers of a sort. Since we\u2019re both still in our twenties, the bond comes naturally. We keep no secrets from each other. I confessed to him that I was doing research on my own, that I had thought to study the effects of the bitter cold and the isolation on Brandon, Kirk, and Eric, too. I admitted I wanted to increase the stress with various experiments but had decided to forget that plan and concentrate on Eric\u2019s amazing discovery.</p><p>I wanted to be bolder. I urged Eric to inject more of the new pack. I have certainly changed, for now I believe that scientific discoveries that can benefit others justifies whatever means necessary.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>THE MORE JACK HEARD ABOUT SOPHIE\u2019S PLANS, THE CRAZIER he thought she was, and he made the mistake of saying so.</p><p>Her response was sharp. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the authority to stop me from going there or anywhere else, for that matter. I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else will.\u201d She brushed past him as she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think William Harrington\u2019s death was an accident. He was excited about being asked to join some secret group or project because he was so physically fit.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly remembered something else Harrington had told her and whirled around to face Jack. \u201cTests. Harrington told me that they did a CT scan and an MRI, and they took gallons of his blood to test. They were looking for flaws. Admit it, Jack. That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p> <p>She stood with both hands on her hips. Her face was flushed with excitement. Jack had trouble concentrating on her words.</p><p>\u201cDid he happen to mention who they were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. He wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about any of it, but wouldn\u2019t it be easy to find out? The list of places where one can get an MRI can\u2019t be all that long. I could start there.\u201d</p><p>He followed her into the living room. She bumped into him when she abruptly turned around again.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t get medical records. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted. She folded her arms and stared into space, thinking. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some way for me to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we listen to the interview now? I want to get this over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said, \u201cso you can leave and go look at an ocean somewhere.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the censure out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the attitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should care and you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a crime is committed, I damned well do care. Harrington\u2019s death was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Hands were back on her hips. \u201cI think it was murder.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t laugh, but he wanted to. \u201cA polar bear murdered him. Was it a premeditated act? Barry could end up on death row if...\u201d</p><p>He sat down before she could push him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s funny?\u201d she said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. Kind of.\u201d</p><p>Sophie rolled her eyes, \u201cYou are such an idiot. No wonder you work for the FBI.\u201d</p><p>He patted the cushion next to him. \u201cSit down and convince me Harrington\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said, pleased he had decided to be open-minded.</p><p>\u201cWilliam Harrington was all set to run what was for him a big race, and then boom!\u201d She snapped her fingers for emphasis. \u201cHe dies alone in Alaska in the middle of nowhere with a tent nearby. In the meantime, his home phone and his cell phone were disconnected, and his website was shut down. I went to his apartment building and was told he\u2019d packed a bag and left for Europe, but he was actually in Alaska. Now I ask you, does that make any sense to you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him a chance to answer. \u201cOh, I know what you\u2019re going to say. Harrington had his phones disconnected because he didn\u2019t know how long he would be in Europe\u2014which is a stupid reason, but logical\u2014and he simply changed his mind about Europe and chose instead to go camping miles from nowhere alone in the Arctic.</p><p>\u201cThen you would say, all that talk about being so super-fit and being invited to join some kind of Superman project was a lie he made up to impress me. I don\u2019t think it was a lie, though.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDo I need to be here for my part in this conversation?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll admit I can get a little eager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re searching for a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I\u2019m searching for the truth. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting any longer. I\u2019m listening to the interview.\u201d</p><p>With that, he pushed the button on the recorder. Harrington\u2019s voice filled the room.</p><p>Sophie ran into her bedroom to get her notebook and pen. Very professional now, she returned to sit on the edge of the sofa, pen in hand and notebook balanced on her knees, poised to take copious notes.</p><p>An hour later she was sprawled out next to Jack sound asleep. Her feet were in his lap; the notebook was on the floor, and her pen had disappeared between the cushions.</p><p>Jack lasted another half hour before giving in. At that point, he either had to take a break or throw the frickin\u2019 recorder out the window. When he stopped the recording and moved her feet off his lap, she woke up.</p><p>Sophie opened her eyes and saw him. The hubba-hubba hunk, she\u2019d decided to call him. One of her socks was hanging off her foot, and he was pulling it up for her. When he caught her staring at him and smiled, her heart missed a beat. She was sure of it.</p><p>Bizarre, she thought. Absolutely bizarre. She\u2019d never had such an instant love/hate reaction to a man before. Jack was different, and that made her worry. This man could hurt her. The big jerk.</p><p>She slowly sat up and brushed the hair out of her face, clearing her mind of hubba-hubba thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, races one through twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only got that far?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cAt least I listened. I didn\u2019t fall asleep five seconds after Harrington\u2019s voice came on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have criticized you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefresh my memory. How many more races do I have to listen to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on,\u201d he groaned. \u201cThis is brutal.\u201d Standing to stretch his legs, he said, \u201cThe CIA could use this stuff in interrogations. Stick a pair of headphones on the suspect, and in three hours tops, he\u2019d crack like a pi\u00f1ata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d She picked up the notebook and put it on the table next to the recorder then started searching for her pen. \u201cYou could come back tomorrow and listen to the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave, I\u2019m taking the recorder with me.\u201d</p><p>She knew it wouldn\u2019t matter if she pointed out it wasn\u2019t his to take. He would still be difficult. Did she expect less? Of course not. He worked for an agency that had no misgivings about such things.</p><p>\u201cThen you have to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet you back at the sofa in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sophie went into the bathroom off her bedroom to wash her face and brush her teeth. The cold water revived her. Now all she needed was a little more caffeine, and she could get through the rest of the races without falling asleep. After glancing in the mirror, she decided to comb her hair and put on a little makeup. She had a bottle of perfume in her hand and was about to dab some on her wrist and her neck when she suddenly realized what she was doing and, worse, why she was doing it. She wanted to look pretty...for him.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d she whispered. She stared at her reflection a full ten seconds waiting for an answer. \u201cApparently so,\u201d she said then. \u201cFBI. Remember what that stands for?\u201d</p><p>The reminder helped. And so did Jack. If he noticed she\u2019d fluffed up, he didn\u2019t comment. The fact was, he barely glanced at her. As soon as he heard her coming, he turned the recorder on.</p><p>William Harrington had just begun his riveting chat about blisters. To his credit, Jack managed to get through all the races without cursing.</p><p>\u201cNothing Harrington said would be helpful to Steinbeck in his investigation,\u201d he concluded as he flipped the Off switch.</p><p>\u201cDid you think there would be something? Whoever tried to kill me had to be someone who lost his pension when Kelly\u2019s closed, or maybe was a relative or friend of someone who lost his pension. Harrington didn\u2019t have a thing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u201d was his noncommittal response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Detective Steinbeck didn\u2019t bring my recorder and listen to the interview himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteinbeck is following up on leads and questioning people, and this interview is low on his priority list. Alec knew you wanted to get your recorder back. Like I said, I was doing him a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can tell Detective Steinbeck and Alec that there wasn\u2019t anything relevant to the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Jack headed to the door. \u201cI could tell Alec, but will I? Doubtful,\u201d he said. \u201cReal doubtful.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the mischievous smile in his voice. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying my partner would have to listen to the entire interview if I were to suggest that there were some suspicious comments made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d lie to your partner?\u201d she asked, pretending shock but inwardly thinking it was a great idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seriously considering it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Detective Steinbeck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the deadbolt, then turned around. Sophie took a step back, but she was still entirely too close to him. The foyer was cast in shadows.</p><p>\u201cSorry your evening was ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little after nine now, and didn\u2019t you say you wanted to be in bed by ten? You can still make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did say that, but I think I\u2019ll go home instead.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for her to understand what he was telling her. He had planned to be in some woman\u2019s bed by ten, not his own.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d She tried to sound cheerful.</p><p>\u201cOr the day after. You can wait that long, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked indignantly. \u201cAre you suggesting that you\u2019ll be in my bed? A bit presumptuous, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t thought about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...um...I might have...but it\u2019s too complicated...it\u2019s all...\u201d</p><p>He smiled and said, \u201cTrust me. It will be worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and slowly lowered his head, his lips lightly brushing hers in a sweet, no-nonsense, see-you-around kind of kiss. When he raised up, their eyes met. She could have pulled away, but instead she put her arms around his neck, and this time there was nothing sweet or hurried about their kiss. His mouth was hot, wonderfully hot. He didn\u2019t have to force her lips apart; she willingly gave him what he wanted. His tongue slowly penetrated and rubbed against hers, igniting such heat inside her. He stroked and explored her mouth, learning the taste of her.</p><p>A kiss shouldn\u2019t be lazy and erotic at the same time, but this one was unbelievably arousing. He acted as though he had the rest of the night to seduce her, and when he ended the kiss, he could have taken anything he wanted.</p><p>He knew it, and so did she.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say good-bye. He simply turned her into Jell-O and left. She didn\u2019t know how long she stood there leaning against the wall, but she finally got it together and turned the deadbolt. She switched off the lights in the kitchen and the living room, then went into her bedroom.</p><p>She held her hands up in front of her face. They were trembling. But that was all right\u2014she had simply been surprised by his kiss. Her curiosity was appeased, and she could move on. She\u2019d just forget about it.</p><p>Sophie fell back onto her bed and stared at the ceiling, trying to convince herself that it hadn\u2019t been any big deal. All the while, a little voice in the back of her mind whispered, Holy Crap!</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 400</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>Our work in the lab has given us incredible results.

Fortunately, the thug masquerading as a security guard/receptionist wasn\u2019t on duty. She didn\u2019t think she would be able to get past him even with Mr. Cross attached to her elbow.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss Mr. Harrington,\u201d Cross said as he followed them into the elevator. \u201cHe was the ideal tenant. Paid his dues on time, kept to himself, didn\u2019t cause any problems, and he rarely had late-night visitors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to run into Mr. Harrington\u2019s second cousin in the apartment. He\u2019s been coming and going all week. He isn\u2019t anything like Mr. Harrington. Quite the opposite,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA tad uncouth, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Uncouth? Mr. Cross was being kind. Dwayne Wicker was stunningly crude. Sophie wasn\u2019t one to make rash judgments about anyone, for first impressions were often deceiving, but she made an exception with Dwayne. While Mr. Cross was making the introductions, Dwayne felt the need to adjust the crotch of his pants. Couldn\u2019t get much more uncouth than that.</p><p>A toothpick dangled from the corner of Dwayne\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat do you want? What are you doing here?\u201d The toothpick bobbed with each word he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI need to go through Mr. Harrington\u2019s papers,\u201d Sophie told him.</p> <p>He squinted at her. \u201cWhy? Were you like his secretary or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, then that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t care about his papers. I already know where his cash and investments are,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou hit the lottery, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Gil asked.</p><p>\u201cSure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well did you know William?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know him well at all. He didn\u2019t have much use for me. He loaned me money a few times, but then he stopped. Bet he\u2019s burning you-know-where for that. He had more money than he knew what to do with, and I was just scraping by. It wasn\u2019t my fault I couldn\u2019t hold down a job. I\u2019ve got back problems. Being blood relation, he should have shared. Right?\u201d</p><p>Neither Sophie nor Gil said a word. Dwayne took their silence to mean they fully agreed.</p><p>\u201cHe was stingy is what he was, but he couldn\u2019t take it with him, could he? Now I get it all.\u201d</p><p>Dwayne was making Sophie sick to her stomach. \u201cWhere are William\u2019s papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in a pile on the floor in the dining room. I already sold the table and chairs, so you\u2019ll have to sit on the floor while you sort through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it premature to be selling his things so soon after his death?\u201d Gil asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Wicker answered. \u201cI figure the minute the police confirmed that William was dead, all this was mine. I\u2019m the closest relative he had. I could have gotten to this sooner if the police hadn\u2019t insisted on absolute proof. They sent hair out of a brush up to Anchorage so they could run DNA tests. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s William.\u201d He pointed to the dining room. \u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up. I got movers coming any minute now, and a Realtor to tell me how much I can get for the place.\u201d</p><p>Harrington\u2019s apartment had been quite elegant at one time: high ceilings with beautiful, deep crown moldings, spacious rooms with lots of light. It now looked like Dwayne was getting it ready for a garage sale.</p> <p>The pile of papers turned out to be a gold mine. Sophie found phone bills, letters from Harrington\u2019s physicians, medical test results, his address book, and credit card bills, all filed in manila folders. She collected a huge stack and stuffed it into her oversized tote. She would have taken more if Dwayne hadn\u2019t strolled in to see what she was up to.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re so interested in his papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Dwayne was suddenly suspicious of her motives. \u201cAre you looking for something in particular? Hey, wait a minute. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d Before she could answer, he asked, \u201cWere you and William together? You know what I mean. Were you giving it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving what, Mr. Wicker?\u201d</p><p>The disgust in her voice set him off. \u201cScrewing him,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He squatted next to her, saw the letter from a law firm in her hand, and tried to snatch it. \u201cI know what you\u2019re up to. You think my cousin left you some money, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re going through his papers. I\u2019ve got news for you, sweetheart. You\u2019re not getting a dime.\u201d</p><p>Gil sat on the window seat watching. He spoke before he thought about the consequences and inadvertently threw gasoline on the budding fire. \u201cUnless he wrote a new will and left his sweetheart every dime.\u201d</p><p>The possibility sent Dwayne into a tailspin. He nearly swallowed his toothpick. \u201cThe hell he did. Give me those papers and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Sophie paused only long enough to stand and glare at Gil. \u201cSeriously...?\u201d</p><p>A tug-of-war immediately ensued. Dwayne was no longer calling her \u201csweetheart.\u201d \u201cBitch\u201d was her new name as he tried to pull the tote out of her hands. Each time he tugged at her bag, she pulled it away. He had a few other crude names for her, but Sophie wasn\u2019t bothered until he stepped over the line and slapped her.</p><p>She was so shocked by the attack, she froze. So did Dwayne, and then a smug smile began to spread across his face. Before Gil could bound across the room, Sophie curled her hand into a fist and, quick as a snake, struck, splitting Dwayne\u2019s lip and snapping his toothpick. She might have broken his nose, too, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>After firmly locking the straps of her tote in her hands, she shook her head at Dwayne and said, \u201cShame on you, hitting a girl.\u201d</p><p>Retreat seemed the logical move before Dwayne regained his senses and his temper.</p><p>\u201cLovely to meet you,\u201d she said as she walked ahead of Gil out the door. \u201cYou have yourself a nice day now.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 422</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>The foundation has given us the green light to finish our original study with the wolves. The old gang is back together again. We\u2019ve made a few updates to the facility here in the frozen north, but for the most part things have remained the same. While we were back in Chicago, Eric and I set up our own lab. We begged and borrowed and managed without assistance. I am now an equal partner, and we aren\u2019t owned or controlled by any pharmaceutical company or government agency. Our testing will remain secret while we gather data.</p><p>Amazing. The tracking device is still working. We couldn\u2019t believe our eyes when we found Ricky. He\u2019s at least nine years old now but looks as vigorous and young as the day we first spotted him. In fact, he is once again the leader of his own pack. He hasn\u2019t lost one iota of his virility. This warrants a study of its own.</p><p>While Brandon and Kirk identified and tagged each of the members of the new pack, Eric and I took blood and tissue samples from Ricky. It was not an easy task to sedate him, but we managed. Up close his coat doesn\u2019t have the same luster, but the blood work tells a different story. Ricky has a hormonal balance unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, plus we still see traces of K-74.</p><p>Ricky will get another dose of the drug soon. Once we see how he reacts, we plan to inject the others.</p><p>We won\u2019t be putting our findings in any official report. What we\u2019re attempting isn\u2019t within the parameters of our mission here and could get us thrown out of the program, but we\u2019re banking on the reward being worth the risks.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>SOPHIE SAT ON THE FLOOR OF HER APARTMENT WITH MANILA folders spread out in front of her. She had spent the afternoon combing through William Harrington\u2019s files looking for some thing that would explain his sudden disappearance and his untimely death. So far, all she could be certain of was that Harrington was obsessed with his health. The thickest folder was stuffed with medical reports and test results, and from what she could decipher from them, he was as fit as he claimed to be.</p><p>The latest examination report was on the top. Knowing that she would probably be rejected, she decided to try her luck anyway. She found the number of the clinic on the first page and dialed it. Sophie cheerfully introduced herself to the receptionist who answered the phone, and then she laid out her case. She told the woman that she was a reporter and that she wanted to write an article about one of the clinic\u2019s clients who had recently met an untimely death. She did her best to convince the woman that the article was to be a tribute and not an expos\u00e9, but the receptionist cut her off in midsentence, explaining rather forcefully that neither she nor anyone else at the clinic could divulge information about their patients. The answer was exactly what Sophie had expected, but she felt it was worth a try. She hung up the phone discouraged but not deterred. She\u2019d have to keep looking.</p><p>Next she picked up Harrington\u2019s address book. There were very few entries, and most of them were professional contacts: the law firm, a couple of doctors, a hair salon, several restaurants. None of them appeared to be friends, making Sophie wonder if Harrington had any. If he did, he probably kept their contact information on his cell phone or PDA, and since she didn\u2019t have either, there was no way she could check. However, there was another solution: the cell phone bill. Sometimes the bills listed the numbers of incoming calls. She shuffled through the folders but couldn\u2019t find the one she wanted. It was probably still in Harrington\u2019s apartment. She had stuffed only half the files in her tote bag when Dwayne Wicker had intervened, and considering her last encounter with him, she doubted he\u2019d welcome her with open arms if she visited the apartment again.</p><p>Sophie was contemplating her next step when the phone rang. Paul Larson was calling from Alaska.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if you\u2019d reconsidered my invitation.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed. She couldn\u2019t fault the man for his persistence.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d he said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019m excited to meet you.\u201d He hastened to add, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because I\u2019m starved for female company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I come, it will be for business only. I\u2019ve been doing some research on William Harrington, and there are a few things here that I want to check out first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other reason I\u2019m calling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got news. I heard about two guys who talked to Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did they talk to him? What did Harrington say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Paul said with a chuckle, \u201cand let me explain. You might not know this, but we\u2019ve got trucks coming up and down the Dalton Highway pretty much all year long. The rigs come from Fairbanks with equipment and supplies.</p><p>\u201cOne of the drivers is a real nice guy named Sam Jackson. He told me he was giving two brothers a ride back up to Deadhorse. Their last name\u2019s Coben, and they\u2019re trappers,\u201d he explained. \u201cAccording to Sam, they\u2019re kind of strange, but not scary. I think he means the brothers don\u2019t know how to be social. They\u2019re maybe awkward but still friendly and don\u2019t mean any harm.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, to pass the time, Sam told them about Barry killing a man, and when he mentioned where it happened, one of the brothers asked him if the man\u2019s name was William. They had met a William who was all alone out on the flats. Neither brother could remember the man\u2019s last name, but they both recalled that William told them not to call him Bill. Odd thing to remember, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhat else did the brothers say?\u201d she asked, trying to hurry him along.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, Sam didn\u2019t know William Harrington\u2019s name, but he was sure the brothers were talking about the same guy, though one of them told him that this William was setting up camp in a remote area, and he looked like he was going to be settling in for a long spell. They also told Sam that they talked to him for quite a while and offered to help him put some of his equipment together, but William wouldn\u2019t let them help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Harrington tell them what he was doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam didn\u2019t say, but he did tell me the brothers spent several hours with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s already on his way back to Fairbanks,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I could dig up his phone number for you or have him call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean the brothers. I want to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a problem. Sam said they were picking up supplies and then heading toward Umiat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I get their cell phone number?\u201d</p><p>Her question gave him a good laugh. \u201cSophie, they\u2019re trappers. They don\u2019t carry cell phones. They\u2019ve probably never used one. They live in the wilderness and don\u2019t have any need for cell phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if they get into trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have rifles and guns and hatchets and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Wilderness men,\u201d she said. \u201cLive in log cabins in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like prefabricated trailers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd cell phones couldn\u2019t get signals where they are anyway. If you get up here fast, you can probably catch them before they head back to their camp.\u201d</p><p>She tallied up the work she needed to do for the newspaper. \u201cIt might take a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sooner you get here, the more likely you are to find the Coben brothers,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make my reservations today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know your arrival time, and I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m there to greet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I go ahead and reserve some rooms for you at the hotel. How many do you think you\u2019ll need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re traveling alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Is that going to be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. You\u2019ll be perfectly safe here. Probably safer than in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Based on the fact that she\u2019d recently been shot, she had to agree with Paul. Prudhoe Bay had to be safer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe accommodations in Deadhorse are a bit unusual. You can either get a room but share a bathroom, or share a dorm room with a bunch of guys.

If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll take some time off and show you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to see where Harrington was camped, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m up there, I\u2019ll need to go to Barrow. My boss wants me to write a couple of articles about the high school football team he heard about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBarrow isn\u2019t a hop and a skip away. You\u2019ll have to fly there, but I can arrange that for you. You\u2019ll fly right over the accident site,\u201d he added. \u201cYou know, where Barry...\u201d</p><p>Snacked on William Harrington? \u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>He mentioned several other places he thought she should see while she was in the bay, as he called the massive northern area of the state. Umiat, the Topagoruk River, and Alaktak were just a few. She couldn\u2019t spell the names let alone pronounce them, but Paul was familiar with all of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the Arctic Ocean. That alone is worth the trip.\u201d</p><p>Paul made it sound like such an adventure. Time to get educated, she decided. She still didn\u2019t know much about Alaska. She went to her computer and started reading. The north shore fascinated her. Nights that lasted over fifty days, winter winds that could pick up a man and toss him around like tissue paper, and temperatures that could drop as low as 60 degrees below zero. Who in his right mind would live there?</p> <p>She called a travel agency to find the best way to get to Prudhoe Bay. After making her reservation, she called Paul Larson\u2019s phone. It went right to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cPaul, this is Sophie Summerfield,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be on flight 459, Wednesday, five p.m. See you then.\u201d</p><p>She had much to do before leaving Chicago. Gathering all the folders into a pile, she stacked them on her dining room table and went to work on one of her assigned newspaper articles. When she finally turned off her computer, it was past midnight.</p><p>Her mind was filled with images of Alaska, but when she finally curled up in bed and closed her eyes, her thoughts turned to Jack MacAlister and the kiss. That frickin\u2019 kiss. Big, big mistake. Definitely. So how come she wanted to make the same mistake again?</p><p>THE SECOND MISTAKE SHE MADE was forgetting about the gossip grapevine. Gil picked her up the next morning. He was her designated driver to the doctor to have her stitches removed, and on the way home she casually mentioned her travel plans. He seemed genuinely interested and asked a lot of questions about the places she hoped to visit.</p><p>By the end of the day, Gil had a new name: Big Mouth.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t been home more than an hour when the phone calls started. She heard from Regan; Regan\u2019s brother Aiden, who was calling from the airport while he waited for his flight home, which meant that Regan had already squealed to him; and she heard from Cordie, who had to limit her tirades to coincide with the five-minute breaks between classes. It took her three phone calls to finish.</p><p>Sophie took the are-you-crazy calls in stride until she heard from Alec. Regan had obviously convinced her husband that it was his duty to keep Sophie from doing anything rash. He told her flat out that she couldn\u2019t go. She didn\u2019t get angry. She laughed and then reminded him that she would do whatever she wanted as long as it was legal. Then she lied. She told him she hadn\u2019t made up her mind to go to Alaska and promised that he would be the first to hear, once she made the decision.</p><p>Alec wasn\u2019t buying the lie. He\u2019d known Sophie a long time now and understood how her mind worked. He\u2019d bet a month\u2019s salary she already had her airline reservations, and just for the hell of it, he checked. He was right.</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t stop her, but he hated the idea of her going alone. Harrington had ended up stranded in the middle of nowhere, and he didn\u2019t want that to happen to Sophie, too. It didn\u2019t matter that Harrington\u2019s death was ruled an accident. There was still something sinister in play, and knowing Sophie, she would want to find out what it was.</p><p>Alec knew he could request assistance from the FBI office in Anchorage, but they couldn\u2019t give Sophie twenty-four-hour protection, and she wouldn\u2019t allow it anyway. Since he had married Regan, both Sophie and Cordie had become like sisters to him. Cordie was the more reasonable and practical of the three friends; Sophie, though sweet and charming, was the daredevil. She always ended up fighting for the wronged and the forgotten, and, despite the risk, usually she got them the justice they deserved. Sophie, he\u2019d learned, was all about fairness.</p><p>Alec didn\u2019t care how Sophie felt about it. Someone had to go with her, and there was only one person he could think of who had the time and the mettle. He also had a gun and a badge, and both would certainly come in handy.</p><p>Jack was the man for the job. Convincing him was going to require a little finesse and a whole lot of manipulation.</p><p>Only one way to make it work. Emergency poker night.</p> <p>JOURNAL ENTRY 493</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Brandon and Kirk have returned home, and they believe Eric and I will be leaving the facility in the next few days.</p><p>They are pleased with their work with the pack, and Brandon has become quite attached to this family. He is sorry to leave them, but he fully expects to see them again next year.</p><p>Eric and I had our work cut out for us after they left. It took some time to locate all the wolves that were injected with K-74. They all seem to be as lively as when we last saw them. None has aged much at all.</p><p>Too bad we had to end their lives while they were still in their prime, but a more thorough analysis is called for to determine the effect of K-74 on a cellular level.</p><p>The most remarkable discovery we\u2019ve made thus far is that the more stress an organism undergoes, the stronger and more youthful he becomes. How is this possible?</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>THEY WERE ALL IN ON IT.</p><p>Gil couldn\u2019t wait to brag. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you should have seen Sophie. She split Wicker\u2019s lip wide open, and I think she might have broken his nose. I sure hope she did. The scumbag howled like the mangy dog he is.\u201d</p><p>Gil sounded like a proud uncle boasting about a goal one of his nieces had made at a soccer game. He had just taken his seat at the poker table and was recounting the incident at Harrington\u2019s apartment to the poker regulars: John, Alec, Jack, and Zahner.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with our Sophie,\u201d John said. \u201cShe\u2019ll take you down every time. Aiden made sure she and Regan and Cordie all knew how to take care of themselves.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table smiled and nodded, everyone but Jack. \u201cThat son of a bitch hit Sophie? Where were you, Gil? Why didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie didn\u2019t need my help. By the time I was halfway across the room, she had already let him have it. It was funny how she did it, too. She put her hand right up in front of his face, then slowly made a fist, staring him in the eyes the whole time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe have rings on the hand she fisted?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cSure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. Do more damage when you\u2019re wearing rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zahner agreed. \u201cHave enough rings on, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re wearing brass knuckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Sophie made a fist...\u201d John prodded Gil to continue.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about two, maybe two and a half, feet away from him, and he\u2019s wearing a real smart-ass expression, and then\u2014bam!\u201d Gil paused to smack his right fist into the palm of his left hand. \u201cShe goes straight at him. No swinging her arm up in an arch giving him time to duck. Nope, just straight on...hard...as quick as a cobra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should have gotten him in the crotch,\u201d Zahner said. \u201cI always tell my girls, kick them in the crotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat girls would those be?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cThe working girls I\u2019m trying to get off the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a damned pimp,\u201d Alec remarked.</p><p>Zahner wasn\u2019t offended. In fact, he had a good laugh. \u201cI\u2019d make a whole lot more money if I were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Zahner?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWhen did you get the gold tooth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a snap-on,\u201d he said. \u201cMy girls love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the girls,\u201d John said, chuckling.</p><p>Alec\u2019s brother-in-law, Aiden Hamilton, walked into the room just as Jack asked, \u201cIs Sophie okay? Did that bastard hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone hurt Sophie?\u201d Aiden asked as he removed his suit jacket and casually draped it over a chair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Gil said, and then proceeded to tell the incident once again.</p><p>When he was finished, Aiden asked, \u201cAre the police going to be knocking on her door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries about that,\u201d Gil told him.</p><p>\u201cPossibility of a lawsuit?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, her surrogate father?\u201d Zahner asked Aiden.</p><p>Alec answered. \u201cAiden was Sophie\u2019s unofficial guardian for a while. He wasn\u2019t quite twenty-two when he petitioned the court. Did you ever make that legal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter now? She\u2019s over twenty-one,\u201d Aiden pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Zahner said. \u201cShe has a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he was a wanted man back then. Sophie could have gone into the foster care system if Aiden hadn\u2019t stepped in,\u201d Gil said.</p><p>\u201cAre you playing poker with us tonight, or are you just stopping by to say hello?\u201d John asked.</p><p>Aiden rolled up his shirtsleeves and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m playing.\u201d</p><p>A collective groan went around the table. A card shark, Aiden rarely lost.</p><p>He pulled out a chair and sat. \u201cYou boys ready to lose your money?\u201d He looked at Jack, then glanced over at Alec and gave a barely noticeable nod.</p><p>The con was on.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 498</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We haven\u2019t quite defined the correlation between stress and the effectiveness of our serum, but it appears that the adrenaline produced in a stressful situation can exponentially increase the potency of the drug.</p><p>It is time to move to primates.

He passed Alec on his way, and from the sympathetic expression his partner gave him, Jack knew he was going to be hearing some unpleasant news.</p><p>Nothing could be more unpleasant than where he was being forced to go, thanks to the poker bet he\u2019d lost. Alaska may be a beautiful wilderness, but he couldn\u2019t even say the name of the state without mentally shivering. He hated the cold. Always had, always would.</p><p>As it turned out, Pittman also wanted to talk about his leave of absence. Wanting to get him away from the media, she had approved his vacation plans, but now he was asking for something different.</p><p>By the time he finished explaining where he wanted to go and why, including everything he had learned about William Harrington, Pittman appeared interested. A little too interested, he thought, which put him on guard.</p><p>\u201cUh-hum, uh-hum, I see, I see,\u201d Maggie said briskly. \u201cYou want to start your leave today, and you\u2019re going to northern Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re traveling with Miss Sophie Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. Sophie just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>\u201cAgent Buchanan was just in here giving me an update. He mentioned that Miss Rose has been doing a little investigative work. She\u2019s determined to find out why William Harrington went to Alaska.\u201d Pittman shook her head. \u201cDeath by polar bear. That\u2019s a new one for me. I think Miss Rose could write several interesting stories about the Arctic. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>The ten-second rule had passed and Pittman was still looking at him expectantly. She actually wanted him to answer the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure she could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Miss Rose needs continued protection. Don\u2019t you agree, Agent MacAlister? Of course you do. Now, it\u2019s my understanding that Agent Buchanan and Aiden Hamilton have been paying for security; well, now it\u2019s time for us to take over. The woman\u2019s taken one bullet, and who\u2019s to say she won\u2019t be taking another if she stays in Chicago. I\u2019ve spoken to Detective Steinbeck,\u201d she added, \u201cand he admits they don\u2019t have any significant leads. The shooter\u2019s still out there.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand up to block any interruptions Jack might have wanted to make and continued, \u201cWe\u2019re not interfering in the investigation. We\u2019re just...observing. Detective Steinbeck knows he can call on us to assist...\u201d she paused to smile and said, \u201cto take over the investigation if need be. We\u2019re not good at assisting, are we? We like to take charge because we know what we\u2019re doing, and we get the job done. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t bother to nod. He simply waited for her to tell him his answer.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is right,\u201d she said before abruptly changing the subject. \u201cBy the way, do you have any idea how many hits there have been on that video you starred in? We\u2019re over two million now and still climbing. I\u2019ve had three major networks hounding me for interviews with you.\u201d She held up three fingers and wiggled them. \u201cYou\u2019re the new American Idol.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, and Pittman reacted with a glare. \u201cOne of my assistants asked me why we didn\u2019t just shut down the video. I told her, why bother? By the time we found out about the thing, it had been downloaded to about eight hundred sights,\u201d she exaggerated. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the Web now. And as you probably know, we did try the it\u2019s all-a-hoax ploy, but that didn\u2019t fly.\u201d</p><p>Pittman wasn\u2019t one for idle chitchat. She\u2019d brought up the video for a specific reason. Jack waited for her to tell him her real agenda.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, and Pittman\u2019s assistant peeked in.</p><p>\u201cIs that the DVD?\u201d Pittman asked. \u201cGood...good. Thank you, Jennifer.\u201d</p><p>The woman handed Pittman a large manila envelope and left.</p><p>She removed the disc from the envelope. \u201cI want you to watch this in a minute. You\u2019ll find it enlightening.\u201d</p><p>Jack hoped to God he wasn\u2019t one of the stars on the DVD. His mind raced. He hadn\u2019t shot anyone since the hamburger joint.</p><p>\u201cThe video is the reason I\u2019d like to start my leave today,\u201d he reiterated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t going to be taking a leave. You\u2019re going to be working. Your new assignment is Ms. Rose, and she will be your sole responsibility. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to that young woman. Now, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m so interested in keeping her alive, aren\u2019t you? For one, she\u2019s a U.S. of A. citizen, and we\u2019ve taken an oath to protect our U. S. of A. citizens. For another, her father. That\u2019s right. She can give me Bobby Rose.\u201d</p><p>Maybe in your dreams, Jack thought. \u201cSophie\u2019s extremely loyal to her father,\u201d he said instead. \u201cShe\u2019s not about to hand him over to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Pittman tossed the DVD to Jack. \u201cPut that in the player for me.\u201d</p><p>The television sat on the credenza behind her desk. Jack did as she requested while she pushed her chair back.</p> <p>\u201cI understand she\u2019s loyal. She\u2019s his daughter, and she loves him, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even give him time to start the silent counting ritual.</p><p>\u201cOf course she does. Bobby Rose isn\u2019t a wanted man, not at the moment anyway. I would just like to have a visit with him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. A visit. Pittman was too smart to think Bobby Rose would say something incriminating. What else did she have in mind?</p><p>She was now searching through the desk drawers looking for the remote that controlled the DVD player.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a person of interest too many times to count, and he did spend some time in a holding cell years ago. Couldn\u2019t keep him there, though. Lack of evidence. Every time, it came down to lack of evidence. Of course, there\u2019s also the fact that Rose is probably the most brilliant lawyer I\u2019ve ever run across.\u201d</p><p>She located the remote in the center drawer crammed behind a manual, picked it up, and waved Jack back to the chair facing her desk.</p><p>\u201cWe have had our differences with Mr. Rose.\u201d</p><p>Jack wanted to laugh. Differences? Various government agencies had been trying for years to put Bobby Rose behind bars.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bloodhound,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cThat man can sniff out money these criminals think they can keep for themselves. It doesn\u2019t matter where they hide it; he finds it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he hides it and keeps it,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cYes, he does, but we can\u2019t prove that, can we?\u201d She almost sounded as though she admired him.</p><p>She rolled back in her chair and turned the player on. \u201cBobby sent this DVD for us. The DVD was delivered by messenger service, and when questioned the young man said he picked it up at the front desk of the Hamilton Hotel. No one behind the desk knows how the package got there. The beginning is from the local newscast two nights ago.\u201d</p><p>She pushed Play and the overly cheerful voice of a perky newscaster came on.</p><p>\u201cAnd now for an update on the closing of Chicago\u2019s beloved root beer company. The bitter accusations are mounting, aren\u2019t they, Tom?\u201d</p><p>The screen flashed to Meredith Devoe and her attorney standing in front of the courthouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thankful my father isn\u2019t alive to see this. My soon-to-be-ex-husband has destroyed his company. My father trusted him,\u201d she cried. She paused to dab at her eyes with a tissue before continuing. \u201cHe invested the employees\u2019 retirement money in a risky stock fund. The values were overinflated, and now all is lost. Kevin Devoe should be behind bars because of his stupidity.\u201d</p><p>The reporter asked Meredith when she had last spoken to her husband.</p><p>\u201cI have not exchanged one word with him since I filed for divorce, and I hope I never have to speak to him again.\u201d</p> <p>The attorney stepped forward to add his two cents. \u201cMy client is penniless, thanks to Kevin Devoe\u2019s irresponsible behavior. He gambled and lost everything they owned.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned at the DVD player. \u201cThen who\u2019s paying the attorney bills?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like an answer to that question as well,\u201d Pittman agreed.</p><p>The screen went black, and a second later Kevin Devoe was being interviewed.</p><p>\u201cI have done nothing wrong. Those stock numbers were inflated, yes, but all the reports indicated they were sound investments. It was Bobby Rose who drove the price up. He got his money out and let the house of cards fall. If anyone should be taken to task, it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>When asked how he felt about his wife\u2019s accusations, he responded, \u201cShe\u2019s a fool. Her father, Kelly, had faith in me. He was a good man, but his daughter...well, let\u2019s just say she\u2019s a hard, angry woman. I don\u2019t know what I ever saw in her.\u201d</p><p>Pittman hit Pause, capturing and freezing Kevin Devoe\u2019s sneer.</p><p>\u201cNote the date and time at the bottom of the next frame.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the Play button again. The next scene was a dark building that looked like a warehouse. A light hung above the single side door. A beat-up old Ford pickup entered the frame and pulled across the gravel parking lot to stop at the door. The date was yesterday; the time, 3:10 a.m. A man wearing a hoodie got out of the truck. He kept his head down until he heard a faint whistle. When he turned toward the light, his face was visible. Kevin Devoe. No doubt it was him. The door flung open as he rushed to it, and there, waiting with open arms in an open trench coat and little else, was Meredith Devoe. The greeting was hot and heavy.</p><p>\u201cGuess this can\u2019t be shown on the six o\u2019clock news,\u201d Pittman remarked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the porno channel,\u201d Jack replied.</p><p>The screen went dark and Pittman spun her chair around, emptying the rest of the envelope\u2019s contents onto the desk. \u201cBobby Rose also sent us statement copies of three accounts, all with rather large sums of money. The accounts were under fake names, but our people checked. The money belonged to the Devoes...and you\u2019ll notice I said belonged. The money was in the accounts, but it\u2019s gone now. We tracked it as far as we could, and the only thing we\u2019re sure of is that the Devoes didn\u2019t withdraw it. However, I rather doubt either one of them will report it stolen.</p><p>\u201cI think the Devoes have been squirreling away Kelly\u2019s money for years, enough to tide them over until they can get to the big money: the retirement savings. If they play the victim and cry that they\u2019re penniless, people are less likely to accuse them of having anything to do with the lost retirement money. Those investment funds were stripped, all right, and I don\u2019t think Bobby Rose had anything to do with it. Maybe I\u2019m being na\u00efve, but my guess is that Bobby Rose emptied these accounts and knows exactly where the retirement money is.\u201d</p><p>Jack thumbed through the stack of account statements. \u201cYou\u2019re sure all of this came from Bobby Rose?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Pittman said. She picked up a folded card and handed it to him. \u201cThis came with the video and the records.\u201d</p><p>The card read: More to come. Bobby Rose.</p><p>Pittman continued. \u201cIf history has shown us anything, it\u2019s that Bobby Rose doesn\u2019t let innocent people suffer. He\u2019s got something up his sleeve, and we\u2019re going to let this play out. And we\u2019re also going to do right by his daughter, like we should have from the beginning. Plus, Rose will be grateful that we\u2019re watching out for her.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Pittman ordered. \u201cJennifer has your schedule. Oh, and Agent MacAlister, one last thing...\u201d</p><p>Jack stopped at the door. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out for polar bears.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 516</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We have become masters of deception.

One of them has secured three healthy monkeys for us.</p><p>We had come up with an elaborate lie to tell Eric\u2019s friend, but he was only interested in the money and didn\u2019t care what we did with the animals.</p><p>He might come in handy in the future.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>SOPHIE FOUND OUT JACK WAS GOING TO ALASKA WITH HER when he showed up at her door and told her so.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, she had assumed it was Gil. He had said he would be checking on her before she left for Alaska. He was such a nice man, he even offered to drive her to the airport tomorrow afternoon. She appreciated the kind gesture, but she suspected that at least part of his motivation was penance for squealing on her. Who hadn\u2019t he told that she was heading to Alaska?</p><p>Gil and his posse, as he liked to call his team, were still taking turns watching out for her. As long as the shooter was on the loose, Gil and his friends would be bodyguards. Alec and Aiden insisted on it. It was pointless to argue because they were going to do what they were going to do whether Sophie approved or not. Thankfully, once she was on the plane and away from Chicago, Gil\u2019s services wouldn\u2019t be needed.</p><p>She should have looked through the peephole before she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early\u2014You\u2019re not Gil.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked exasperated. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Move out of my way, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She automatically stepped back, allowing him entrance\u2014another dumb move. It would be easier to tell him to go away if he were in the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Alaska with you,\u201d he matter-of-factly informed her.</p><p>It took a couple of seconds for the announcement to settle. Reeling from the surprise, she protested, \u201cWhat? No! You\u2019re not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart,\u201d he replied. \u201cI am, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>Dropping his duffel bag in the foyer, he walked past her. She caught the scent of his aftershave. Very appealing...musky and masculine.</p><p>Not relevant! her mind screamed. \u201cYou hate cold weather,\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>\u201cSure do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, Sophie. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Deal with it? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of traveling by myself,\u201d she argued. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to go with me.\u201d</p><p>He tossed his heavy sheepskin coat on the back of her sofa. He was wearing a T-shirt that showed off his muscular arms and chest, and a pair of jeans that looked as though they\u2019d been purchased at the fifth-hand store. Did the jerk have to be so...built?</p><p>\u201cWant and need are two completely different things,\u201d he answered as he settled into an easy chair, kicked off his shoes, and reached for the television remote. \u201cI sure don\u2019t want to go with you, but here I am.\u201d</p><p>She took a tentative step forward. \u201cYou\u2019ll just get in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably will, but I\u2019m still going. What channel is the Food Network on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...the food...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll find it. You look a little confused. Have you packed yet?\u201d</p><p>Sophie continued standing in the foyer, stunned. \u201cNo...I\u2019ll pack tomorrow. I don\u2019t leave until late afternoon. Why is your duffle here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur plans have changed, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers through her hair. \u201cOur plans? We don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we do,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving on a seven a.m. flight to Fairbanks, which is why I\u2019m spending the night.\u201d</p><p>This announcement sent her rushing into the living room. \u201cThat can\u2019t be. I\u2019m flying out tomorrow afternoon. I\u2019ve already paid for my ticket.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in front of the television, blocking his view. He motioned for her to move to the left.</p><p>\u201cAh, here it is,\u201d he said. \u201cBobby Flay is doing paella. I\u2019ve always wanted to know how to make it.\u201d He added, \u201cThe transaction was voided.\u201d</p><p>She tried to clear her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonrefundable ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for the FBI, Sophie. When I tell you the charge was erased, you can believe me.\u201d</p><p>Still incredulous, she asked, \u201cWho changed my reservation?\u201d</p><p>She shifted from one foot to the other with her hands on her hips; her elbow blocking his view. Once again he motioned for her to move. She complied without thinking.</p><p>\u201cJennifer,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe made the reservations. Ah, man, look at that food processor. I\u2019ve got to get one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennifer who?\u201d Sophie\u2019s frustration was brimming over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sophie took a deep breath. This was maddening. None of it made any sense. She decided to approach the situation rationally. \u201cEven if for some reason I have to take an earlier flight, there\u2019s absolutely no reason for you to come along, and there\u2019s certainly no reason for you to stay here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes there is,\u201d he countered. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make it to the airport on time, we\u2019ll need to be out of bed by four-thirty a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said, never taking his eyes off the television as he watched Bobby Flay toss clams and lobster claws into the pan.</p><p>\u201cJust like that? Okay? No argument?\u201d She was appalled by the disappointment she heard in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cNo argument,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you change your mind, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Sophie went to her linen closet and pulled out a thick down comforter and pillow. After dumping them on the sofa, she said, \u201cThis discussion isn\u2019t over,\u201d then headed to her bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>She needed time to think. Why would Jack want to go to Alaska? He hated the cold. Alec had something to do with this; she was sure of it. She\u2019d deal with him later. She had to think of a way to convince Jack to be reasonable and stay in Chicago, but for now she had a much bigger problem: Jack, just beyond the door, sleeping on her sofa.</p><p>It was one thing for Gil to camp out in her living room. He was old enough to be her grandfather. He was also sweet. Jack, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t at all sweet or considerate. He was rude, arrogant, and stubborn, but also sexy and gorgeous. Every time she looked at him, all sorts of crazy notions popped into her head...like jumping his bones.</p><p>It was that kiss, that stupid kiss that made her curious to know what it would be like to sleep with him. No, not curious. Hot. Hot for him. And what did that say about her morals? She did still have them, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Sophie was determined to stay away from him until morning. No waffling on that. She\u2019d let him drive her to the airport, and on the way she would surely come up with something to make him change his mind.</p><p>Okay, plan made. She showered, washed her hair, and took her time blowing it dry. She put on her sexiest nightgown, but only because she happened to like the pink lacy top. It was a short gown that didn\u2019t quite come to her knees. She probably should change into something more modest, but why? Jack wasn\u2019t about to see what she was wearing to bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kept up the ridiculous pretense until she had applied lip gloss. Oh, yes, she always went to bed wearing lip gloss. Never know who might come knocking on the door in the middle of the night.</p><p>She stared at herself in the mirror, then reached for a tissue to remove the lip gloss. She sighed. She still wanted to rip Jack\u2019s clothes off and kiss every inch of his body. When it came to Jack, she didn\u2019t know right from wrong.</p><p>No matter what, she wasn\u2019t going to open that door. She circled her bed, pulled the covers back, and then set her alarm clock and her cell phone to wake her at the ungodly hour of four-thirty a.m.</p><p>Daddy! She suddenly remembered that her father would be calling her at midnight. She knew she couldn\u2019t stay up till then if she had to get up at four-thirty, and that meant she should call him now and leave a long message on his voice mail. She could hear Jack talking on the phone in the living room. This would be the perfect time for her to call, but as she was heading to her closet, Jack knocked on her door.</p> <p>\u201cSophie, you got a minute?\u201d</p><p>Say no. Just say no. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Okay, new plan, she decided. At least take the time to put on a robe before opening the door. No reason to give him the idea that you might be even remotely interested in...what did he call it?...oh yes...getting friendly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reach for her robe. Yes, her nightgown was on the short side and a bit low-cut, but he couldn\u2019t see through it unless he had X-ray vision. The silk wasn\u2019t transparent. Besides, women wore much less clothing to a Chicago beach. What was the big worry?</p><p>The beach didn\u2019t have a bed, nor the privacy for a man and a woman to do whatever they wanted. That was one gigantic worry.</p> <p>Do not open the door.</p><p>She opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>Jack stood with his phone in his hand for several seconds, never taking his eyes off hers.</p><p>\u201cJack? Did you want something?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cAlec called,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Sophie couldn\u2019t read his expression.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d She was becoming more embarrassed by the second as she waited for Jack to say something about her nightgown, but he didn\u2019t say a word about the way she was dressed...or undressed.</p><p>\u201cTo say good-bye, I guess. Your hall bath doesn\u2019t have a shower. Think I could use yours? Where are the towels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinen closet.\u201d She was surprised she managed to get the words out.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI looked. None there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in the dryer. Laundry room is just off the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks,\u201d he said as he slowly pulled the door closed.</p><p>He was gone. Sophie\u2019s insecurities came roaring back. Had he even noticed? She glanced down at herself and shook her head. She certainly hadn\u2019t made much of an impact on him, had she? She had thought this nightgown was sexy, but if that were so, then apparently the woman wearing it wasn\u2019t. Maybe she was the problem, not the gown.</p><p>Sophie was used to men noticing her. She liked to flirt, but she didn\u2019t tease, and she knew the difference. She did not sleep around. Truth was, she was as much of a prude as Cordie\u2014although her friend called it being old-fashioned. Unlike Sophie, Cordie allowed herself to have dreams. She wanted to get married and have children, but there was one little glitch in her happy-ever-after fantasy: Cordie was madly in love with Aiden Hamilton, and he, stupid man that he was, didn\u2019t have a clue.</p> <p>Sophie was thinking about Cordie\u2019s predicament when it suddenly dawned on her how foolish her own behavior was. She had never seduced a man, and why she thought it would be okay with Jack was beyond her. She didn\u2019t have an excuse except that she had let lust control her thoughts. Fortunately, she had come to her senses.</p><p>Jack knocked on her door again. This time Sophie didn\u2019t run for her lip gloss or play silly mental games about her appearance. She was through acting like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you set your alarm clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, four-thirty. Did you find the towels?\u201d Dumb question since he had one draped over his shoulder.</p><p>As he disappeared into the bathroom, she wondered if he noticed that she was now wearing a robe. She heard water running in the shower, and that meant he was getting naked. She picked up a book from her nightstand thinking she\u2019d get lost in a good novel, but several minutes passed and she hadn\u2019t read one word. Her imagination was in that shower.</p><p>Apple. She\u2019d get an apple and stay in the kitchen until he was out of the bedroom, and she would quit acting like a budding nymphomaniac, but before she could leave, Jack stepped out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. No shirt, no shoes...no service. Why that saying came to mind she couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>Jack barely glanced at her as he walked past, and that made her all the more bewildered. Damn it, he had kissed her. Didn\u2019t that mean he was attracted? Must have changed his mind.</p><p>She followed him into the next room. \u201cJack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cI want the truth. Why are you really going with me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate with his answer. \u201cI lost a bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost a bet? Very funny.\u201d He couldn\u2019t come up with a more believable lie?</p><p>\u201cReally, Sophie, I lost a bet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can, except when someone calls and tells you to look out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to let that go, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d Each word was carefully enunciated. He picked up the comforter and unfolded it. \u201cAnd Sophie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, if you open your door dressed like that again, I won\u2019t be sleeping on this sofa.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 618</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>To keep things quiet, we have set up cages in the basement of Eric\u2019s house, which is out in the country and is the only house for miles. He inherited the home from his parents, and we are both thankful he didn\u2019t sell it.</p><p>It has been three months since we took tissue samples and blood from the monkeys and then injected them with K-74. They\u2019ve reacted remarkably well, showing signs of increased energy and stamina. We will know more when we do the autopsies.</p><p>Killing has never been easy for either of us, but it\u2019s unavoidable if science is to advance.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>\u201cALL RIGHT THEN.\u201d SOPHIE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED back into her bedroom, the sass back in her stride. She didn\u2019t smile until she\u2019d closed the door. Her world made sense again. Her insecurities were gone, for the moment anyway, and she was feeling desirable once more.</p><p>Jack had noticed and had obviously been affected by the sight of her in her nightgown. Was she disappointed he hadn\u2019t taken her into his arms and kissed her? Of course not. But why hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Oh, no, she wasn\u2019t going down that road again. She knew she could be neurotic and obsessive about certain things, but her feelings for Jack were making her all sorts of crazy. One minute she was convinced he was a jerk, and the next minute she thought he was the hottest man she\u2019d ever met. If that wasn\u2019t crazy, what was?</p><p>Sleep would be impossible if she didn\u2019t stop thinking about him. She forced herself to be practical by going through her checklist of what she had packed and what she would need to buy in Fairbanks. If she needed an extra pair of wool socks or thicker long underwear, she was sure she could pick them up in one of the stores there. Should she take her laptop? What about her cell phone? She knew she could get a signal in Prudhoe Bay and probably in Barrow as well.</p><p>An hour later she hung up her robe and got into bed. Her head had barely touched the pillow when she remembered she needed to call her father and leave a message for him.</p><p>She crept to the door to see if Jack was asleep yet. She peeked out and saw the television was still on, but he wasn\u2019t sitting in the easy chair. She could only see the back of the sofa, but she assumed he\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>The soft light from the bathroom spilled into her walk-in closet. Leaving the door open a crack, she got the cell phone from its hiding place and sat back against the wall with her legs stretched out and one ankle crossed over the other. Once she was comfortable, she called her father. She didn\u2019t have to leave a message. He answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t midnight yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Sophie quickly explained that she was leaving for Alaska early in the morning, and she didn\u2019t want him to worry when he called at the scheduled time and she didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t have any idea how long she would be away. One week, maybe two. Once she\u2019d filled him in on her itinerary, she wanted to hear what he\u2019d been up to. He told her that he was working on a resolution for Kelly\u2019s, but he wouldn\u2019t explain what that meant or even give her a hint of what his plans were. Her father liked to be cryptic, and she had learned not to ask questions.</p><p>Daddy was in a chatty mood and told her a couple of very funny stories that made her laugh, and by the time she ended the call and put the cell phone back in its cubbyhole, she was feeling relaxed and sleepy.</p><p>She was still sitting in her dark closet when Jack opened the door.</p><p>\u201cSophie? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>It should have been obvious, but apparently it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sitting on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your closet.\u201d</p><p>She looked around. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d</p><p>With as much dignity as she could muster, she slowly stood and walked past him into the bedroom. She couldn\u2019t help but notice that he was wearing a pair of faded plaid boxer shorts and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cI heard talking and then laughter,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she agreed, nodding. \u201cThat was me...talking and laughing.\u201d</p><p>He had to think she was crazy. How could she have been so careless as to assume he was asleep and couldn\u2019t hear her? She had kept her voice to a whisper, but she shouldn\u2019t have laughed, no matter how funny the stories had been. If he had heard anything, it was inevitable he would figure she was talking to someone on the phone, and it wouldn\u2019t take a leap to guess who that someone was. She needed to distract him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that scar?\u201d She took a step toward him and put her hand on his chest. His skin was warm, wonderfully warm. \u201cThis scar,\u201d she said as she traced a tiny circle above his heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a scar there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and held it against him. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m distracting you. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>He slowly nodded. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his heart beating under her fingertips, and the way he was looking at her made her own heart race.</p><p>\u201cYou should get some sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. Neither did she.</p><p>\u201cYou should kiss me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWant me to tell you what will happen if I kiss you?\u201d He started walking her backward to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you showed me.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped the back of her neck, and he roughly pulled her toward him. \u201cThis is going to get complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do complicated,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It was all the permission he needed. He tilted her head back and kissed her hungrily, letting her feel the passion inside him. His tongue delved into her mouth to mate with hers, and the sweet taste of her was so intoxicating he had to have more. He kissed her again and again until he was shaking with desire.</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck and melted into him. Her unrestrained enthusiasm overwhelmed him.</p><p>In the bedroom Jack was a master of pacing and control, always giving his partner the ultimate pleasure, usually multiple times, before he took his own. Slow and easy. Satisfaction guaranteed.</p><p>But Sophie changed all that. Kissing him with such abandon, her mouth so warm, her lips so wonderfully soft, she held nothing back, rubbing her tongue against his, her fingertips stroking his shoulders as she moved seductively against him. Her erotic sighs drove him wild, and within seconds she had turned him from a master to a novice with raging hormones. His breathing was harsh, ragged. He held her tight against him, burying his face in the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cSlow and easy, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She gently tugged on his earlobe with her teeth. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Before he could think of an answer, she pushed him back, keeping her eyes locked on his, as she seductively lowered the left strap of her nightgown and then the right, letting it slide down the length of her body.</p><p>Suddenly, slowing down didn\u2019t make any sense to him at all. She was beautiful. His gaze slowly moved over her golden skin, her full breasts, her tapered waist, and her long, perfect legs. Oh yes, she was magnificent. A tightness settled in his chest, and he was desperate to touch her. He stripped out of his shorts and wrapped his arms around her, groaning from the surge of arousal he felt when she moved against him.</p><p>Together they fell into bed. He wedged his knee between her silky thighs, then stretched out on top of her. His arms bore his weight so he wouldn\u2019t crush her. Her soft full br**sts rubbed against his chest and sent tremors through him. He buried his face in her hair. Her feminine scent aroused him; her velvety skin felt so good against his. He wanted to touch her everywhere, to use his mouth, his tongue to excite her. Caressing her breasts, he kissed a path down her neck, her whispered sighs urging him on.</p><p>Sophie loved the way he stroked her, loved the feel of his hot mouth against her skin. When his hand slid down her stomach and moved between her thighs, the fire inside her intensified until it became unbearable. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades as she arched against him and cried out.</p><p>Their kisses became ravenous, their caresses more demanding, rougher. Sophie made him burn like no other woman had, and Jack could feel his control slipping away. When he knew he could wait no longer to make her his, he moved between her thighs and thrust inside, groaning from sheer ecstasy. Liquid heat surrounded him, and the jolt of pleasure was so intense, he thought her fire would consume him.</p><p>He stayed perfectly still for several seconds. \u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her breathing was as ragged as his, her need as demanding. He kissed the base of her throat, felt the frantic pulse of her heartbeat.</p><p>Sophie wrapped her arms around his waist and raised her legs to take him deeper inside.</p><p>Jack moved slowly at first, but the urgency built inside him, and his control snapped. Their lovemaking was wild, passionate, and when at last they cl**axed, she cried his name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a loud groan he collapsed on top of her, pinning her to the mattress. He stayed inside her for long minutes, savoring the intimacy. She\u2019d taken his strength, but he was able to roll to his side, keeping her wrapped in his arms. He was reeling from the sensations coursing through him. What the hell had happened to him? Sex had never been like this before.</p><p>Long minutes passed before his breathing was once again steady. Sophie took a little longer to recover. She shifted onto her back and stared at the ceiling. Jack raised up on one elbow to look at her and was arrogantly pleased with what he saw. She looked dazed. Her eyes were misty; her face was flushed, and her lips were rosy from his kisses.</p><p>She was the most amazing creature. She was totally uninhibited with him, and in the aftermath of their lovemaking, she didn\u2019t hurry to cover up.</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t stop touching her. His fingers slowly trailed down her neck to her navel. He gently touched the skin where the bullet had struck and was shocked by the surge of anger he felt that someone had tried to hurt her.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d And before he could say a word, she asked, \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>His head dropped to her shoulder, and he began to laugh. \u201cI think I\u2019m supposed to ask you that question. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She turned toward him and began to stroke his chest. The mat of hair tickled her skin. She snuggled closer.</p><p>\u201cVery lovely,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYeah? Give me a minute. I\u2019ll show you spectacular.\u201d</p><p>Jack was a man of his word.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 644</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We have tested and retested, and the results are conclusive. The adrenaline produced in stressful situations does increase the potency of our drug. No matter how terrified the monkeys become, their heart rates don\u2019t increase. The cellular degeneration seems to slow as well.</p><p>Is this serum the first step in discovering the fountain of youth?</p> <p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>THEY MADE IT TO THE AIRPORT WITH TIME TO SPARE, quite an achievement considering Jack had to drag Sophie out of bed. She didn\u2019t wake up happy, but a quick shower revived her. Fortunately, she had laid out the clothes she would wear, and she was completely packed except for her makeup bag, which she dropped into her carry-on as she ran out the door.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t notice that Jack was carrying his gun until he showed his credentials at check-in. The airline had already been informed that an FBI agent named MacAlister would be on the flight, so it took no time at all to get through security.</p><p>With his gun holstered in plain sight on his hip, Jack naturally got some worried looks from passersby, but it was Sophie who attracted the most attention. Every man she passed stared at her. Although irritated, Jack couldn\u2019t blame them. Sophie was a beautiful woman. Gil had called her a bombshell, and he wasn\u2019t wrong. Dressed for the cold in a long-sleeved, fitted, black turtleneck sweater and a pair of snug jeans with boots, she held her coat and walked as though she were on a runway. She captured every eye, but Jack knew she was oblivious to the stares.</p><p>They were seated in first class. The attendant took their coats and offered them beverages while Jack stowed their carry-ons in the bin above. Sophie took the window; Jack, the aisle. The seats were wider in first class, but his legs were still too long to stretch out without tripping the people filing past.</p><p>Neither had mentioned what had happened last night. Their passion had reached a crescendo numerous times, so they didn\u2019t get much sleep. Sophie was exhausted. She clipped her seat belt into place, closed her eyes, and was sound asleep minutes later.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wake up until they were about to land in Fairbanks. When she opened her eyes, she saw Jack flipping through a magazine. He didn\u2019t notice she was watching him. The images of his hot, na*ed body rubbing against hers made her face warm, and she tried to block the memories. Only one way to get through this trip with Jack, she decided. She would take the stance that nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Like some of the corrupt men her father went after, she would deny, deny, deny.</p><p>Once on the ground and inside the airport, she went to the ladies\u2019 room to freshen up. After brushing her teeth and splashing water on her face, she felt good as new. She had assumed there would be a layover in Fairbanks, but she was wrong. The mysterious Jennifer without a last name had booked them on Chip\u2019s Charter Service, and the flight was scheduled to leave in less than an hour.</p> <p>Jack leaned against a pillar, reading the sports section of a newspaper, waiting for her. Sophie\u2019s heart skipped a beat when she saw him through the crowd, and she was once again a little breathless. Was it any wonder? Jack was one fine-looking man. \u201cVery fine,\u201d she whispered. Denying wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, folding the paper under his arm.</p><p>They stopped at a snack bar in the terminal, but Sophie was sorry she had eaten the muffin and juice when she reached the gate that would lead them outside to Chip\u2019s Charter Service. There were small jets and small planes, and then there was Chip\u2019s six-seater. Her stomach dropped to her feet when she saw it on the tarmac. She was certain jets flew to Prudhoe Bay. Why weren\u2019t they taking one of those?</p><p>She stepped closer to Jack. \u201cYou know what? I think we should drive.\u201d</p><p>He could see the worry in her eyes. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We definitely should drive. It\u2019s only five hundred miles, give or take, and we can\u2019t get lost.\u201d She hastily added when he shook his head, \u201cOnly one highway, the Dalton, goes up to Prudhoe Bay. We could do some sightseeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed it\u2019s snowing? Can\u2019t do much sightseeing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed, and I also noticed how windy it is, which is why we shouldn\u2019t fly in that paperweight plane.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt has two engines. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig trucks go back and forth on the Dalton all the time. We could catch a ride with one of them.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the window and saw a heavyset man, looking a little like Santa Claus with his white beard and mustache, circle the plane and head toward them. She kept her eye on him as she whispered to Jack, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea. Have you ever flown in a little plane like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have. One of my brothers is a pilot. He\u2019s taken me up a couple of times. Relax, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Jack went outside to talk to the pilot, and Sophie stepped close to the window to watch him. She was suddenly overwhelmed. In the last twenty-four hours Jack MacAlister had uprooted her plans and her life. What was she doing here in Alaska with him? She had taken him to her bed and done the most intimate things with him, but she barely knew him. He had told her a little about his background, but there was so much more she didn\u2019t know. One of his brothers? How many siblings did he have? Were his parents still alive? Weren\u2019t these things you should know before sharing the most private part of yourself with someone? The reality of what she had done sank in, and she was mortified. When it came to relationships, she had always played it safe. Cautious to a fault, according to her friends...until Jack. He had made her forget everything she had ever promised herself, and it was time for her to regain control.</p><p>From this moment on, she was going to keep things polite and professional, and she would definitely not be sleeping with him again. No more foolishness, she told herself.</p><p>The door opened, and a blast of freezing air swept over her. The pilot was actually younger than he had appeared from a distance. He was probably still in his thirties; his dark brown beard was covered with a layer of ice and snow, which is why it had appeared white.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said as he pulled off his glove and extended his hand. \u201cYou must be Sophie Rose. My name\u2019s Chipper, but some like to call me Chip. Either\u2019s fine with me. As soon as your luggage is weighed and loaded, we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fly in this wind?\u201d she asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI sure can. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll do my final check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChipper...does the plane have heat?\u201d</p><p>He turned back. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>Jack started to laugh. \u201cOf course it has heat.\u201d</p><p>She leaned close to whisper. \u201cChipper has ice chips in his beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you can\u2019t say that fast five times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious,\u201d she said. \u201cChipper has either been walking around his plane for a long while or he\u2019s been flying without heat. Ice in his beard, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be just fine, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>His calm reassurance irritated her. Of course they\u2019d be fine\u2014unless Chipper accidentally tipped the plane into the side of a mountain, or misjudged the icy runway and dumped them into the ocean. Until today, Sophie hadn\u2019t considered herself a nervous flyer, but as she watched the small plane pitch back and forth from the force of the wind, she thought it was a perfectly sensible reaction to be a little freaked out.</p><p>A phone rang, and that reminded Sophie of Paul Larson. He was going to be at the airport to meet her plane, and she hadn\u2019t notified him that her flight had changed and she would be arriving in Prudhoe Bay ahead of schedule. She made a mental note to call him when she arrived.</p><p>Chipper opened the door and announced it was time to leave.</p><p>Sophie put on her gloves, picked up her bag, and took a deep breath.</p><p>Jack turned her toward him and pulled the collar up around her face, then took her shoulders in his hands and leaned close to say, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay. You trust me, don\u2019t you, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes and was surprised to discover...she did.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 662</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We have had long discussions about the next step. We must test our serum on human beings. But how to go about it, that\u2019s the question. If we run our trials through a clinic, even if we were to patent our findings, our secret would be out, and we would be in danger of losing our edge.</p><p>People would kill for our formula. When the world discovers what we have, every pharmaceutical company in the world will want a piece of it, and we know there are many who would stop at nothing to nab the profits for themselves. We have to be cautious and do the tests ourselves. When we hit the market with our creation, all the money and recognition will be ours.</p><p>We\u2019ve worked too hard not to enjoy the benefits.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>DEADHORSE, ALASKA, SITS AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD. Some call it a town; others call it a camp.</p><p>From her research, Sophie had learned that Prudhoe Bay is a working community. At any given time there are approximately five thousand men on the drilling sites owned by the oil companies, but they don\u2019t mingle with travelers who come to Deadhorse. Each company has its own self-contained facility for its workers. The rigs and the housing for the employees are enclosed to protect the equipment from the climate, and the accommodations are comfortable despite the harsh environment. The men on the rigs work twelve-hour shifts for two weeks straight, then fly home for two weeks. The money is substantial, but the social life is nonexistent.</p><p>Tours to the oil fields and the Arctic Ocean are available during the summer months, but a week\u2019s notice is required so that background checks can be made. Security is tight. One hundred sixty men comprise the security force that protects the rigs. Two policemen are on duty in Deadhorse, and like the workers on the rigs, their shifts are two weeks on and two weeks off.</p><p>Planes fly in and out of Deadhorse all day, every day, weather conditions permitting, and there\u2019s even a helicopter pad by the airport.</p><p>Sophie was fascinated by what she had learned and, despite the bumpy plane ride to get there, couldn\u2019t wait to experience the area for herself. As the plane approached the airstrip, she could see massive rigs off in the distance, and below a white canvas spread out as far as her eye could see. The ice and snow created a solid surface now, but after the spring thaw, the land would look as though it were floating in puddles of water. Deadhorse was little more than a scattering of prefabricated buildings perched aboveground with steps leading up to the doors. They looked more like warehouses than homes or businesses.</p><p>Considering the wind and the snow blowing across the runway, the plane\u2019s landing was smooth. Chipper offered to fly Sophie and Jack back to Fairbanks or on to Barrow when their business in Deadhorse was finished, and then he took them to the Prudhoe Bay Hotel.</p><p>\u201cHotel\u201d was not a term the Hiltons or Marriotts would have used to describe the structure, but it served the purpose. The prefabricated units, hooked together as one building, offered simple accommodations.</p><p>Sophie and Jack knocked the snow off their boots before they entered the small office. There wasn\u2019t a crush of people waiting for rooms. In fact, Sophie and Jack were the only customers. The manager, who stood behind a linoleum-topped counter sorting through paperwork, welcomed them warmly and told them to call him Zester. It was difficult to judge his age. His face was so weathered, he could have been fifty or thirty, but from his booming voice, Sophie pegged him at forty.</p><p>\u201cI should have a reservation,\u201d Sophie told him. \u201cPaul told me he\u2019d make arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Zester didn\u2019t have to look in the register. \u201cNot here you don\u2019t. Think you might have one at the Caribou Inn? I\u2019ll call for you and cancel. You\u2019ll like staying here much better.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for permission but turned his back and dialed his competitor.</p><p>Jack nudged Sophie. \u201cWho\u2019s Paul?\u201d</p><p>Sophie pulled off her scarf and folded it. \u201cPaul Larson. Didn\u2019t I tell you about him?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>Zester interrupted before she could explain. \u201cNope. You didn\u2019t have a reservation at the Caribou.\u201d He chuckled as he added, \u201cWhen I told Charlie how darn pretty you are, he said maybe you did have a room reserved after all. I expect he\u2019ll be coming over to say hello.\u201d</p><p>Jack unbuttoned his coat, and Zester spotted the gun at his waist.</p><p>\u201cHold on now. We don\u2019t allow guns here. At least we don\u2019t allow our customers to carry them around.\u201d He leaned over the counter. \u201cWhat kind is that? Doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he continued before Jack could reply. \u201cA thirty-eight or a forty-five or a Glock...none of those will take down a bear. A fox maybe, but not a bear. You\u2019d end up in jail if you tried to shoot a bear,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Zester looked shocked. He took a quick step back, then moved forward again. In a whisper he said, \u201cFBI? Something bad happen? Someone break the law?\u201d He shook his head and added, \u201cNo, I\u2019d hear about it if someone broke the law. I can keep a secret, so you can tell me. Why are you here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophie answered. \u201cHe lost a bet.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled at how disgruntled Sophie had sounded. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>Zester didn\u2019t ask for clarification. \u201cHow about I set you up with my deluxe two rooms with a bathroom in between? That\u2019s the best I can offer.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, after dropping their bags in their rooms, Jack and Sophie followed Zester into the small cafeteria. Sophie felt as though she were walking through an elongated mobile home. The lunchroom was small, sparse, and spotless.</p> <p>\u201cMeals are included in the price of your rooms,\u201d Zester explained. \u201cYou missed lunch, but I can offer you some cold sandwiches. There\u2019s always food, twenty-four/seven,\u201d he added. \u201cAs far as drink, we\u2019re dry here, so nothing stronger than coffee, tea, or soft drinks.\u201d</p><p>Sophie asked for hot tea, and Jack wanted a Coke. While they ate their sandwiches, Zester called the policeman on duty and asked him to come over to the hotel.</p><p>He handed the phone to Jack and said, \u201cTim wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>While Jack talked to the officer, Sophie used her cell to call Paul Larson. A recorded voice answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Paul. It\u2019s Sophie. Call me when you get this.\u201d</p> <p>Zester went back to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee for himself, and as soon as they were alone, Jack said, \u201cSophie, I\u2019m still waiting to hear who Paul Larson is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with the security force here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. How do you know him?\u201d</p><p>In his FBI mode his tone was no-nonsense.</p><p>\u201cI told you about the policeman who called me to tell me they had found my business card in William Harrington\u2019s sock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot long after that call, Paul Larson contacted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get your phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously he got it from the policeman who found my card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and frowned. \u201cAre you interrogating me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>At least he was honest about it. \u201cPaul\u2019s been very helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow helpful?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe called when they found Harrington\u2019s wallet, and he explained where Harrington\u2019s remains would go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnchorage.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any idea why Harrington had decided to camp out in the wilderness, but he said he\u2019d ask around and find out if anyone had talked to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to a lot of trouble for you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Was Jack jealous? Sophie immediately discarded the notion. \u201cWhy so grumpy?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a lot to do up here when you\u2019re not working, and he thought it was a mystery, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Harrington would camp out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack sighed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention Larson earlier?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI should have,\u201d she said, then added, \u201cYou\u2019ll like him. He\u2019s very pleasant over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Pleasant.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou know what your problem is? You\u2019re too damned trusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t know what to make of his attitude, but she decided to placate him. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Paul the way I trust you. He works for the security force here, so you know the powers that be have done a thorough background check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting riled, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The endearment flustered her. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back to my room and unpack. I\u2019ve got to charge my phone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe battery\u2019s low. Are you going to stay here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t leave the hotel without me, all right?\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the window. The snow was now coming down hard. Since she wouldn\u2019t be able to see two feet in front of her if she went outside, that was an easy request to agree to. With the lack of sunlight, she could easily get disoriented and end up wandering in a snowstorm. There was also the possibility of running into Barry or one of his furry relatives.</p><p>Polar bears, up close and personal. She shivered thinking about it.</p><p>Sophie stopped at the front desk to ask Zester if he had heard of William Harrington.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s heard of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the man Barry went after.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDid you happen to meet Mr. Harrington, or do you know anyone who might have spoken to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never met him,\u201d he answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that anyone around here did. He might have flown into Barrow and taken a small plane to Alaktak and headed west, or maybe he went to Nuiqsut or Umiat and headed east. His camp wasn\u2019t too far from there. He was found close to the ocean, though, so I can\u2019t really say how he got there.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t have any idea where Alaktak or the other towns were located. She had a map in her bag and would have to look them up.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Coben brothers? Do you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She repeated the name. \u201cThey\u2019re trappers,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I heard secondhand that they had talked to Mr. Harrington.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCould be. I\u2019m only filling in here for a couple of days, but I know a lot of people come through here, and they don\u2019t all stay in the hotel, of course. The name\u2019s familiar, though.\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness for Paul, Sophie thought. If he hadn\u2019t taken an interest and helped her, she wouldn\u2019t have learned anything about the Cobens on her own. Paul had talked to a number of truckers who drove in and out of Deadhorse. He\u2019d done the legwork for her.</p><p>Sophie thanked Zester and went to her room to unpack. She spread her map out on the bed and used a highlighter to mark the villages Zester had mentioned. The police could tell her where Harrington\u2019s campsite had been.</p><p>An hour passed as she was organizing, and when she was finally settled, she called Mr. Bitterman to check in. He was in a fine mood and asked a lot of questions about Prudhoe Bay.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the northern lights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like?\u201d</p><p>She answered that question and several others.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to join the polar bear club?\u201d he asked. \u201cBe a heck of a story if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, there are limits to what I will do for my job. I\u2019m not jumping into the Arctic Ocean for a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it some thought,\u201d he said. \u201cNow tell me about Harrington, and then I\u2019ve got a whopper of a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got here so there\u2019s very little to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Jack\u2019s with you, isn\u2019t he? Alec called me this morning. It was a relief to hear that you\u2019ve got an FBI agent with you. Can\u2019t be too cautious, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, tell me the surprise,\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cCan you get to a computer and look at the newspaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat paper do you want me to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs, Sophie,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cI want you to read today\u2019s edition of our newspaper.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOf course. What am I looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heck, I might as well tell you. Full-page, four-color ad, paid for with a cashier\u2019s check telling Chicago that Kelly\u2019s employees are going to get their pensions.\u201d</p><p>Tears came into Sophie\u2019s eyes. Daddy had kept his promise.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who placed the ad? Was there a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, but everyone in Chicago is celebrating. They\u2019re saying Bobby Rose is behind it. You should hear the call-ins on the radio. Lots of excitement, Sophie, and when times are hard with the layoffs and all, we need some good news, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, we do. You can stop hoarding root beer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not until the company\u2019s doors are open. Call me tomorrow to check in\u2014and Sophie, you be careful.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to tell Jack about the ad. If she couldn\u2019t find a computer to use in the hotel, she\u2019d pull up the Internet article on her phone. She hurried back to the cafeteria and found two men sitting with Jack. He made the introductions. One of the men was a police officer in Deadhorse, and the other was an oil company security guard. Jack pulled out a chair at the table, and when she sat down, she noticed a stack of papers in his hand with a list of names that he handed to the security officer.</p><p>\u201cJack tells me one of our men has been helping you with your investigation. Is that right?\u201d the security guard asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly on his time off,\u201d she explained, not wanting to get Paul into trouble.</p><p>The guard smiled. \u201cI understand you\u2019ve had several conversations with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe said he was helping the police, and he provided some information about William Harrington\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>When the two men glanced at each other, she became curious. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you talked to Paul Larson?\u201d the policeman asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d she stated emphatically.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d the policeman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you talked to, but it wasn\u2019t Paul Larson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2014\u201d Sophie began.</p><p>The security officer didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a Paul Larson here.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 680</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>Eric and I are calling our study the Alpha Project.</p><p>We\u2019ve had no trouble keeping our work secret in Chicago, but Inook was another matter altogether. Living in such close quarters with Brandon and Kirk made it difficult. Luckily, Brandon decided that he and Kirk should go off and observe another pack, and that gave us more freedom. Eric gets so nervous about being found out, I worry that he will let something slip.</p><p>I\u2019ve been checking out pharmaceutical companies. What I\u2019ve learned so far is that they\u2019re all mired down in bureaucracy. I don\u2019t think we can approach them about our findings. If we were to tip our hand now, we\u2019d lose all control. I\u2019ve also learned they pay a pittance for independent research because they have to factor in how long it will take to get government approval. That could be years, if not decades.</p><p>If Eric and I are going to get the money we deserve, we\u2019ll have to take matters into our own hands. There are plenty of other markets out there.</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>WHY WOULD HE LIE?</p><p>Sophie\u2019s initial reaction to the news was that there had to be a mistake. Of course Paul Larson existed. She\u2019d spoken to him!</p><p>When Jack went to get her some hot tea from the cafeteria\u2019s beverage service, she tried the phone number Paul had given her. Once again, she left a message on his voice mail.</p><p>While she was waiting to hear back, Jack made a call to his sources to run a check on the number. He received his answer minutes later, not surprised to learn that the number Sophie had been calling was registered under yet another fictitious name at a fictitious address.</p><p>What kind of game was this man playing?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a fix on the location of the phone, so we\u2019ll know where this guy was calling you from,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got employees flying in and out of here every day, but they check in right away and get to work,\u201d the oil company security guard said. \u201cTruckers will spend the night in Deadhorse when they need to, but they usually head back the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d the Deadhorse cop added, \u201cwith so many people coming and going, we would notice a stranger hanging around.\u201d Looking across the table into Sophie\u2019s eyes, he said, \u201cI checked with Joe Rooney, the officer who called you about Harrington, and he\u2019s never heard of Paul Larson. He certainly didn\u2019t give anyone your phone number. Joe\u2019s a reliable guy, so I don\u2019t have any reason to doubt him.\u201d</p><p>All three men took turns asking Sophie questions, but there was little she could tell them. The guard and the police officer assured her that they would ask around, but other than that, there was nothing they could do, concluding that she had been the victim of a twisted practical joke.</p><p>After they left, Jack continued grilling her about the details of her phone conversations with the man calling himself Paul Larson.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me anything specific about himself. Why would he? Oh, wait. He did say he was single and asked to take me to dinner, but I don\u2019t think he was serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you tell him about yourself?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Irritated, she responded, \u201cNothing personal. I wasn\u2019t talking to a dating service.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood and began to pace. Sophie drummed her fingertips on the tabletop while she thought about her conversations with the fictitious man.</p><p>\u201cSo this guy lures you up here\u2014\u201d Jack began.</p><p>\u201cHe did not lure me here,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI wanted to come up here to talk to people in hopes that someone had seen Harrington. He didn\u2019t just drop out of the sky and land in a tent next to Barry. I\u2019m still determined to find out what happened to him.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say: Barry happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that. Would you have started in Prudhoe Bay, or did you come here because Paul suggested it?\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck while he waited for her answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He told me there were trappers near here that I could talk to,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is crazy. Was anything he told me true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did find Harrington\u2019s wallet, and his remains were taken to Anchorage, so yes, I guess some of what he said was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you know where he was calling from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat will take a little time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here first thing in the morning. I\u2019ll call Chipper and put him on standby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Chipper really Chipper?\u201d she asked. She smiled at how silly that sounded. \u201cIs he really who he says he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Jack answered. He crossed the room and stood in front of her. \u201cAnd do you know why I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked him out. I don\u2019t take anything on blind faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an FBI agent. You\u2019re trained to be suspicious. I\u2019m a reporter. I\u2019m trained to be curious. My interest wasn\u2019t in Paul Larson, so why would I want or need to investigate him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack gave up trying to make his point. He could tell this was going the route of the \u201cYou would have looked, too\u201d argument she\u2019d used after she was shot.</p><p>Sophie now walked to the cafeteria window and stared outside. \u201cDo you know it\u2019s against the law to lock your car doors here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s because of bears. I guess if you run into one, or one happens to be chasing you, you jump in a car.\u201d She sighed and turned around. Jack stood just a foot away. \u201cI should have checked him out,\u201d she admitted.</p> <p>He pulled her into his arms and rubbed his chin against the top of her head. \u201cYeah, you should have,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAny other interesting facts you want to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost foxes carry rabies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Barrow Whalers made the play-offs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Whalers. They\u2019re the high school football team in Barrow. You\u2019ll probably get to meet some of them. They\u2019re a new team, and football has made a positive impact on the lives of these boys. I promised Mr. Bitterman I\u2019d write their story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to Barrow, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>JACK WAS PREOCCUPIED at dinner, but Sophie didn\u2019t mind. It had been a long day, and she was weary.</p><p>They returned to their rooms, and Sophie went into the bathroom to get ready for bed. After showering, she opened the bathroom door into Jack\u2019s room and overheard him talking on the phone. \u201cIt has to be connected\u201d was all she managed to hear. Who was he talking to, and what had to be connected?</p><p>Jack looked up and smiled when he saw her. She wasn\u2019t wearing a skimpy nightgown, but she was just as sexy in her oversized, blue and white cotton pajamas. And fuzzy pink socks. After he finished his call, he took his turn in the shower.</p> <p>The wind was picking up outside, and the window rattled. Sophie had read somewhere that the winds could get as strong as a hundred miles an hour. The thought made her shiver.</p><p>The bed wasn\u2019t a double or a twin, but something in between. She pulled back the covers and stretched out on top, leaning against the headboard. Her mind wouldn\u2019t quiet down, racing from one thought to another. If the man calling himself Paul Larson was playing a joke, what was the point? Why go to all that trouble? There must be a reason. Had any polar bears ever gotten inside the hotel? She should have asked Zester.</p><p>Sophie was rubbing on hand lotion that smelled of jasmine when Jack entered her room. He obviously didn\u2019t mind the chill in the air. He wore just shorts and a T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get warm in a minute. Did you set your alarm? We\u2019re getting up early.\u201d</p><p>Sophie noticed him staring at her socks. She felt a little silly, but what did she care? She had made up her mind to keep their relationship simple and professional.</p><p>No, not relationship. Association.</p><p>\u201cThe phone calls were made from Fairbanks,\u201d he told her before he reached down and pulled one pink sock off, then the other.</p> <p>\u201cSo Larson had no intention of meeting my plane tonight?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat was the point? Don\u2019t you think that was a rather strange prank?\u201d</p><p>Jack went to the door to make sure it was locked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what his motive was, but I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d</p><p>Sophie got under the covers. The sheets were cold. Jack was walking toward his room when she remembered the ad Mr. Bitterman had mentioned.</p><p>She told Jack about Kelly\u2019s Root Beer, then asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the ad.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into his bedroom, and Sophie felt a pang of disappointment. She wasn\u2019t going to let him sleep with her. Still, it would have been nice if he\u2019d asked. A minute later, Jack came back carrying his gun and holster. He didn\u2019t ask permission to join her. He put his gun on the table next to her pillow, pulled the covers back, and told her to scoot over.</p><p>He slid in next to her and turned toward the wall with his back to her. The heat radiating from his body warmed her in no time at all. She slipped her hands under his T-shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could sleep with me,\u201d she whispered against his neck as she cuddled up against him.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d He reached over and turned out the light.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Sophie said in the darkness. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible reporter, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 702</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>Eric and I are weary from our trip, but it\u2019s been worth it. We\u2019ve found a buyer. Our contacts in Asia and Europe produced nothing. Don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t think of the Middle East in the first place.</p><p>To the Dubai billionaire, fifty million means nothing, and he was willing to agree to it on the spot. All he requires is that we give him hard data on our human experiments.</p><p>I\u2019ve been having dreams about how I\u2019ll spend my share. Always wanted to visit Fiji. If the sands are soft and the women softer, I may just stay there.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>JACK DIDN\u2019T EMBELLISH OR COMPLIMENT HER ON HER REPORTING skills. He simply answered her question. \u201cYou\u2019re not a terrible reporter.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes passed. Sophie asked, \u201cHow many brothers do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jack slowly turned toward her. He was a big man, and the bed was small. He rolled Sophie toward him so that she rested on his side.</p><p>\u201cWhy all the questions?\u201d he asked, his face close, their eyes meeting in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYou know everything there is to know about me, and I don\u2019t know much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do. You know where I grew up, where I went to school, and when I joined the FBI. You also know I like the way you kiss me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGood night, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood night, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Jack made it until around two in the morning, and then Sophie began to move restlessly against him. He wasn\u2019t sure if she was awake or asleep, but after removing her clothes without any resistance, he didn\u2019t care. It was his turn to seduce her. And, ah man, it was better than the first time. She was so responsive to his touch, and he loved the sexy sounds she made when his fingers caressed her. This time he made sure she cl**axed before he did, and when at last he found release, she squeezed him tight inside her. And that was better, too.</p><p>He was just drifting off to sleep when a thought popped into his head. Had he done the seducing, or had she?</p><p>DENY, DENY, DENY.</p><p>Again Sophie was furious at her lack of self-control. Why couldn\u2019t she keep her hands off Jack? If they were in Chicago, it would be so much easier to stay away from him, but here they were forced to be together. Fortunately, he respected her unspoken decision not to mention last night\u2019s activities.</p><p>Chipper was waiting for them by his plane. He stowed their luggage while Sophie climbed into the backseat. Jack took the seat by the pilot, and while they were waiting for Chipper to finish his checklist, Jack asked Sophie if she was feeling okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Why would you think I wasn\u2019t? Do I look like I\u2019m not fine?\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop blathering. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been unusually quiet, that\u2019s all, and yeah, Sophie, you look fine, considering neither of us got much sleep with the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarrow is considered a desert, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. She was once again pretending that nothing had happened. \u201cIt is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. It gets very little rainfall, but lots of snow. Temperatures drop below zero in early October and stay down until the end of May or early June. It never gets warm.\u201d</p><p>Chipper climbed into the plane, heard Sophie\u2019s last comment, and added, \u201cBarrow generally gets around seven inches of snow in October. It\u2019s not snowing today, though, not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack wants to see the ocean,\u201d Sophie told Chipper. \u201cHis ideal vacation is to sit and watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in luck then,\u201d Chipper said. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s on three sides of Barrow. You\u2019ll get to look at it every which way you turn.\u201d</p><p>Because of crosswinds, the flight to Barrow ended up being even bumpier than the one to Deadhorse, and Sophie\u2019s stomach did a couple of flips. She was, however, willing to delay their landing when Chipper insisted on circling so that Jack could see the ocean up close.</p><p>Barrow wasn\u2019t a fancy place, but the people were the warmest she had ever met. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They were proud of their city, and they were especially proud of their football team. Sophie had called ahead, and the coach was waiting to greet them. She interviewed him about the boys on his team and their backgrounds, but it was Jack who knew what questions to ask about the games. While the men discussed the season, she took notes.</p><p>Coach Smith told them about the first game the Whalers had won. It was quite an event in the small community. The players and coaches had celebrated by jumping into the Arctic Ocean. A pizza party wouldn\u2019t have been enough? Sophie wondered.</p><p>The coach called a couple of his players over to talk to Jack and Sophie. While they were with the boys, Sophie noticed two teenage girls sitting on the sideline with their heads together, laughing. One girl stood up and the other pushed her friend toward the field, giving her the nudge to approach them. The girl slowly came closer and closer, until she was standing just a few feet behind Jack.</p><p>She gently tapped Jack on the shoulder. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>Jack turned around. \u201cYes?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy friend and I were wondering...\u201d she began. She looked back at her companion who was gesturing for her to continue. \u201cWe were wondering if you\u2019re that guy on YouTube.\u201d</p><p>Sophie burst out laughing.</p><p>Jack patiently talked to the girl for a few minutes, and after thanking Coach Smith for his time, he quickly ushered Sophie off the field.</p><p>\u201cI really must see this video,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack was not amused, but Sophie was still laughing as they walked into a nearby restaurant.</p><p>A couple who were having lunch at the next table struck up a conversation and were glad to talk about their community. They had lived in Barrow all their lives and were able to give Sophie some interesting background for her story. They suggested places to stay the night, and Jack chose the one closest to the restaurant.</p><p>By the time Jack and Sophie walked to the hotel, they were frozen to the bone.</p><p>Jack paced in the lobby trying to get warm. \u201cCouldn\u2019t do it. Couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive here. The cold would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. After all, Chicago\u2019s winters are no cakewalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lips are blue,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cAfter we get our rooms, I\u2019d like to walk around town and talk to some more people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting one room, not two, and we\u2019re not walking anywhere, Sophie, we\u2019ll find a ride to the police station. The headquarters for Deadhorse and the other northern towns is here in Barrow. I want to talk to them about Harrington.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, the police couldn\u2019t tell them anything they didn\u2019t already know. Harrington\u2019s death, they had concluded, was unfortunate, but it had been an act of nature. The file was closed.</p><p>Sophie asked them how she could get in touch with Joe Rooney, the officer who had called her to identify Harrington.</p><p>\u201cJoe lives just outside of Barrow,\u201d the officer told her. \u201cHe\u2019s off this week, but I\u2019m sure if we gave him a call, he\u2019d come in to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>When Jack asked how Harrington would have reached the remote spot where he was camped, one of the officers suggested the possibility that Harrington had flown on a commercial flight to Fair banks and then chartered a small plane to Inook.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the closest village to Harrington\u2019s campsite. Few people live in Inook. Someone there would certainly have seen him. Small planes fly in with supplies. I\u2019ll bet he was a passenger on one of them. That would be easy enough to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close to the ocean was he?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cReal close,\u201d the officer replied, turning and pointing to the map pinned to the wall.</p><p>Later that evening, Jack slid into bed beside Sophie and took her into his arms. This double bed wasn\u2019t as cramped as the night before, but he still wanted her close to him.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll talk to Rooney, and afterward we\u2019ll fly to Inook, but then home, Sophie. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t fall asleep for a long while. Her thoughts were on Harrington. He hadn\u2019t gone camping voluntarily. She was sure of it. He was all about labels and country clubs and impressing people with his money. Camping on his own? No way. Something or someone had drawn him to that barren, frozen place.</p><p>Everyone she spoke to was quick to write him off, and she could understand their rationale. But a doubt gnawed at her. She couldn\u2019t tie up Harrington\u2019s death in a neat package and let it go. Sophie was determined to get to the truth.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 748</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>We\u2019ve been back in camp for a week now.</p><p>K-74 has exceeded our wildest dreams.

I wish we could get rid of Brandon and Kirk. Their high-handed, self-righteous opinion of themselves is getting a little old. They think the world will bow to them when it reads their research. If they only knew how menial their work is compared to ours.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s been the worst. He whines constantly about the pressure he\u2019s getting from the foundation to get something published. His anxiety has been a real pain in the backside for the rest of us. He hasn\u2019t slept a wink while he\u2019s been here\u2014working nonstop. Can\u2019t say that I sympathize. He acts as though he\u2019s so important and the rest of us are just riding his coattails.</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>JACK HAD A LOT ON HIS MIND. HE CHECKED IN WITH THE Chicago FBI office and spoke with one of the agents who was gathering information for him, then called Officer Joe Rooney at his home and set up a time to meet.</p><p>It was easier for Rooney to come to them as he lived several miles southwest of Barrow in an area that was difficult to navigate for anyone who didn\u2019t know his way around. Besides, he was a newlywed, and his wife wanted to do some shopping. They agreed to meet at Rooney\u2019s favorite restaurant, the Red Seal Caf\u00e9. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rooney had arrived first and stood at a table near the back, waving to Sophie and Jack as they entered. After shaking hands and taking their seats, Rooney suggested they try the whale meat stew.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of tangy, but I grew up eating it, and I love it. Unfortunately, my wife is from Anchorage, and she hasn\u2019t figured out how to cook yet, so the only time I can get it is when I come here.\u201d</p><p>Jack was more adventurous than Sophie. She ordered a sandwich, and he ordered the stew. He was able to get down only two bites before he decided he also wanted a sandwich.</p><p>Joe dug in with gusto. \u201cGuess you have to be raised with this kind of food to love it.\u201d</p> <p>Jack got down to business. \u201cStart at the beginning and tell me who found Harrington\u2019s remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA helicopter pilot found him. His name is Massack, and I\u2019ve known him for years. Went to high school with him, as a matter of fact. Anyway, he and another pilot, Walters, were flying near the coast checking bear movement. He told me he set the chopper down near some markers and almost tripped over the foot. He was pretty shocked to look down and see that.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cThat would be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he was wrapping up the leg, he saw the corner of the business card. He pulled it out and found your name, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Joe pushed his empty bowl aside and leaned forward on his elbows. \u201cThe tracks leading away from the remains were fresh. He knew it was a polar bear that got him, and from the size of the prints, he was pretty sure it was Barry. There isn\u2019t any other bear up here that big.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the wallet found?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a week later. We did a thorough search and found strips of a tent.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cStrange place to put up a tent, but there it was.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned back and rested his arm on Sophie\u2019s chair. \u201cFind anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome plastic,\u201d he said. \u201cBits and pieces of what looked like part of a camera. Sent it to the lab with what was left of the tent.\u201d</p><p>Sophie turned to Jack. \u201cHow did Paul get my cell phone number? He called me right after Joe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Larson?\u201d Rooney asked. \u201cThey called me from Deadhorse and asked if I knew a guy by that name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he said he was working with the police and doing some investigating on his own,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>Rooney shook his head. \u201cI can tell you right now, no one outside the department works with us. He called you just after I called? That is strange. I wouldn\u2019t even have had time to put it in my report. What do you suppose he\u2019s up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>They talked about Harrington a few minutes more, then Sophie said, \u201cI understand his remains were found near a village called Inook. I\u2019m hoping someone there saw him. The man didn\u2019t just drop out of the sky into a tent.\u201d She suddenly thought of something else to ask. \u201cPaul told me about two brothers named Coben who were trappers. He said the brothers talked to Harrington, but I\u2019m assuming that was a lie, too. Have you ever heard of the Cobens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt\u2019s surely another lie, but I\u2019ll ask around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Inook,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell. Only a handful of people live there, but they aren\u2019t spread out, and that\u2019s good if you want to talk to all of them. Straight north is the ocean and straight east of Inook is research housing. There are some scientists studying the habits of wolves. They\u2019re biologists I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour, I think. They close down in the late fall and go back in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe habits of wolves?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the way the pack interacts, who\u2019s in charge, that kind of stuff. People must want to know about them because the docs keep getting grants to continue their study. I have to admit, I think it would be real boring to watch a bunch of wolves for months on end.\u201d</p><p>He continued telling them about Inook. \u201cSmall planes bring in supplies, and the people stock up for the dark days of winter. There\u2019s a little cabin that was abandoned years ago, and if the weather should turn ugly, pilots hole up there. They make sure it\u2019s always stocked with supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the people who live there do?\u201d Sophie wondered.</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cThey fish. Their grocery store is the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind setting up a meeting for me with the pilots who found Harrington?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear their version. I\u2019m not doubting you,\u201d he hastened to add, \u201cbut they may have forgotten to mention something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll set it up. Want me to sit in on the meeting with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they\u2019re both in town. Listen, do you think I ought to go to Inook with you two? I could leave midafternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Joe. It will be getting dark,\u201d Sophie said, thinking they\u2019d have to wait until the next morning.</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cLook outside. It\u2019s always dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a little cloudy,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cSun won\u2019t go down for another hour. By mid-November, it will stay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it stay down?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout sixty-five days, but it won\u2019t get totally dark. My wife\u2019s not used to our days yet. She was raised in Iowa and only lived in Anchorage a couple of years before I met her. I\u2019m trying to convince her it\u2019s romantic here.\u201d</p><p>That, Jack decided, would be one hard sell.</p><p>Later, Joe brought pilots Massack and Walters to the hotel to meet with Jack, while Sophie stayed in the room getting a head start on the articles she wanted to write about the people of Barrow. She needed to think about something other than William Harrington for a while. Her mind was cluttered with the lies Larson had spun.</p><p>It was late when Jack returned. Sophie was already asleep, but she\u2019d left the desk light on. Her notebook was sitting beside it.</p><p>Jack dropped the room key on the desk. He read the first couple of sentences of the story she had written. They captured his interest, so he picked up the notebook and read the entire article.</p><p>It was about the older couple they had met in the restaurant. Their names were Samuel and Anna. Jack was impressed by how accurately Sophie recalled the details of the information they had given, but more important, he was struck by how beautifully she captured the essence of the pair, telling of their lives as though they were the hero and heroine of some epic tale. Samuel and Anna had known each other since first grade, and had laughed when they said, \u201cIt was love at first sight.\u201d They had watched their children grow and now, after forty years of marriage, were watching their children\u2019s children grow. When Sophie described the way Samuel looked at Anna, as though she were still the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, Jack could picture the old man\u2019s face. In Samuel\u2019s eyes, he saw an entire lifetime of loving one woman.</p><p>Jack sat on the edge of the bed thinking about the article. Thinking about Sophie, too. When he got under the covers, he gently wrapped her in his arms. He kissed her forehead and fell asleep.</p><p>THE FOLLOWING MORNING, while Sophie showered, Jack checked in with Alec. She was dressed when she stepped out of the bathroom, and while she packed, Jack paced the room. She closed her carry-on bag, put it by her coat, and sat down on the end of the bed, waiting. Jack finally noticed she was watching him.</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re worried. Did something happen while I was in the shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to work something out. Did you remember anything else Larson said to you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI did. He Googled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he Googled me and was looking at my photo. That kind of gives me shivers now,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he find your photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy newspaper sometimes runs my photo above my articles,\u201d she explained. \u201cCome on, Jack. You know these days anyone can find out anything about a person using the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy went to a lot of trouble to get you up here. We don\u2019t know who he is, and we don\u2019t know his motives. I\u2019m leaning toward changing our plans.\u201d</p><p>Sophie put up her hand. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. Back to Chicago, right? And that\u2019s fine, after we go to Inook. I\u2019ve come this far. I don\u2019t want to leave just yet. What\u2019s a couple of hours going to hurt? It\u2019s a tiny coastal village. I\u2019ll talk to whoever\u2019s there, and then I can put this to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cJack, I\u2019m going with or without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Sophie,\u201d he said, a smile in his voice, \u201cthat\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>Suspicious now, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet that you think you have a say. You go where I go, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms defiantly. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 761</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>Horrible day!</p><p>Brandon became so agitated this morning, I worried he would do something drastic. I made the offhanded remark to Eric that Brandon could use a dose of K-74\u2014never imagining that he would actually give it to him.</p><p>Brandon went into cardiac arrest around 3:00 p.m. We called for the medical helicopter, but it was too late. By the time they arrived, he was dead.</p><p>I could tell Eric was scared. When I confronted him, he admitted he\u2019d injected Brandon with the K-74, telling him that it was a mild sedative. Now we find out that Brandon had a heart condition he was keeping a secret. According to Kirk, there won\u2019t be an autopsy. Lucky for us.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>JACK AND SOPHIE LEFT FOR INOOK TWO HOURS LATER. ONE OF those hours was spent arguing. Sophie was pretty sure he finally gave in just to shut her up.</p><p>Once they were in the air, Chipper asked Jack if he would mind making a stop on the way back to Barrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got supplies to drop off at another coastal village. It won\u2019t take long, and it will save me a trip tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be in Inook most of the afternoon. Why don\u2019t you make the trip and come back for us?\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>Chipper was grateful. \u201cI won\u2019t keep you waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get close to Inook, circle so I can get the lay of the land. I want to see where the cabins are.\u201d</p><p>The pilot was happy to oblige. He flew over the water, then passed over a cluster of prefabricated buildings hooked together like the hotel in Deadhorse.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the people watching the wolves stay. I hear it\u2019s a slick setup. They\u2019ve got satellite and DVD players. I know because I\u2019ve brought disks for them. They watch a lot of movies when they can\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>It looked deserted, but with the fresh snow, any footprints would have been covered up. No lights shone from inside.</p><p>\u201cMust be locked up for the winter,\u201d Sophie remarked.</p><p>The noise from the engine drowned out her voice, and neither Jack nor Chipper heard her comment.</p><p>They passed over Inook and landed. Jack unzipped his bag, took out extra gun clips, and put them in the pockets of his ski jacket. He handed another to Sophie and told her to put it in her coat.</p><p>\u201cYou expecting trouble?\u201d Chipper asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just like to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d she told him as she stepped out of the plane. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to war.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t respond. Standing side by side, they watched the plane disappear. Suddenly, they were all alone in the middle of a white wilderness.</p><p>Sophie made a complete circle looking for signs of life. Not a sound could be heard. She shuddered. \u201cJack, could I have a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally getting nervous?\u201d he asked. He took hold of her hand and started walking. \u201cTime to knock on some doors and hope to God no one answers with a rifle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too distrustful,\u201d she told him. She was already gasping for breath. The cold made her lungs feel as though they were freezing and would crack at any second.</p><p>\u201cOut here in the wild, would you open the door without a little protection? Never mind, I know the answer. You\u2019d open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to let that go, are you?\u201d</p><p>He was ahead of her, and she couldn\u2019t see him smiling. \u201cNever let what go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked out the window and got shot. That\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>Jack thought of Samuel and Anna. Did they ever argue the way he and Sophie did? If so, did they have as much fun?</p><p>The terrain was flat, but to Sophie it felt like she was climbing a mountain, a big one. She couldn\u2019t help but notice that Jack wasn\u2019t at all winded. The man was definitely in shape. She ought to know, she thought, remembering the play of his muscles under her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Joe say the homes were close together?\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. Must be by Alaska measurements.\u201d</p><p>They walked for what seemed a mile before reaching a house, but Jack assured her it wasn\u2019t even a fourth of that. The structure was another prefab building, with one window on the side of the door and two snowmobiles parked beside the steps.</p><p>The Native American woman who opened the door looked stunned to see them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they get a lot of salesmen here,\u201d Sophie whispered to Jack.</p><p>She motioned them inside. Sophie sighed with relief when she felt the heat.</p><p>Jack asked several questions, but the woman was hesitant with her answers.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely home,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>She then told them where she was from and why she had ventured here. Within minutes, Sophie had the woman telling her her life story. Her name was Mary, and she had three strong children. Her husband was fishing with a neighbor. As Mary became more comfortable with them, she offered information about the village and about her neighbors.</p><p>\u201cIf one of us had met this man you speak of, all of us would have heard about it. By tonight everyone will know about the woman with the blue eyes and her handsome husband.\u201d She shook her head and with authority said, \u201cNo Harrington here. Did this man get lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he had an unfortunate accident. A polar bear killed him.\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded sagely. \u201cAh yes, Barry ate him. We never knew the man\u2019s name. Now we do. William Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met the scientists who study the wolves?\u201d Sophie asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, they keep to themselves. They watch the wolves, and sometimes they watch us. I think maybe they study us, too.\u201d</p><p>Mary insisted on feeding them. Knowing it would insult her to refuse the kind offer, Sophie spoke up before Jack declined. \u201cWe just ate before we came here, but I would love something hot to drink, please.\u201d</p><p>While Mary brewed tea, she told them about the other villagers. Later, she pointed the way to the three neighbors she knew to be home.</p><p>They spent the next hour knocking on doors and asking questions.</p> <p>As they left the last house, Sophie said, \u201cWe should have listened to Mary. She told us no one saw Harrington, and she was right. She\u2019s a sweet woman, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cYou put her at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could stay inside the empty cabin Joe told us about? I\u2019m freezing. The cold seems worse since I got warm at Mary\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cSure. I think we\u2019re through here. Chipper should be back soon.\u201d He pointed to a small wooden building sitting fifty yards off in the distance. \u201cThat should be it over there,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pulled her close as they made their way to the cabin, and Sophie prayed that there was a heater inside ready to start.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I may never know why Harrington came here,\u201d Sophie admitted.</p><p>They walked up the two steps to the door. Jack reached for the handle just as a loud crack split the air and splintered the wood, the chips flying past Sophie\u2019s face. His reaction was instantaneous. He threw the door open and shoved Sophie inside, covering her with his body as she landed on the floor.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 807</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We can\u2019t afford another mistake like the one Eric made with Brandon. If the Alpha Project is to continue, we have to be prudent and cautious. We\u2019ve refined the formula and believe we\u2019ve found the right dosage.</p><p>We\u2019ve set up a human trial and were amazed at the number of applicants. It\u2019s incredible how many people will sign up for something if we play to their ego.

IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH INOOK had been snapped in half by a demonic force.</p><p>Jack kicked the cabin door shut and dragged Sophie out of the line of fire.</p><p>Stunned, she whispered, \u201cWas that\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh-powered rifle. Stay down!\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was hard, angry.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to tell her again. Her mind took a few seconds to grasp the horror of someone trying to kill them, but her body reacted instantly.</p> <p>Jack ripped his glove off and, gun in hand, rolled next to the window. He leaned against the wall, listening to the silence, waiting for some sound that would tell him where the shot had been fired. Ten seconds passed. Ten more. Nothing. He slowly edged up to look out the corner of the window. Impossible to see much of anything. The wind was stirring up the snow on the ground, and more was falling.</p><p>Sophie crawled on her stomach to the far wall, then quietly turned and sat with her back against a cabinet. She looked around the cabin, searching for anything that would help them defend themselves. It was sparsely furnished with a table and chair, a cabinet, and a cot. A thick drape meant to keep out some of the cold was pulled back on a hook beside the small window, which was their only source of light.</p><p>Another round of bullets slammed into the wall outside. Some of them spit through, hitting the table and chair.</p><p>\u201cGet behind the chest!\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>Sophie hurried to do what he ordered and crouched down just as a bullet hit a can on a shelf above her. Pork \u2019n Beans. The can spun around, flew into the wall, and crashed to the floor.</p><p>The shooter was getting bolder, coming closer. Jack heard the sound of a motor humming in the distance. He looked out again and through the snow saw a light bouncing across the flat area where Chipper had landed the plane. It had to be a snowmobile. The beam of light was widening, and the sound of the motor getting louder.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what, you stay down,\u201d Jack shouted to Sophie.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Jack. Careful...please.\u201d</p><p>Sophie watched him turn and reach for the door handle. He cracked it open an inch, no more. Stretching out his arm, he aimed the gun and waited for the snowmobile to stop. It was still too far away. He needed it to come within range.</p><p>\u201cA little closer. Just a little closer,\u201d he said, deadly calm.</p><p>He got his wish. The snowmobile moved toward the cabin. When it stopped, the shooter turned the motor off but left the spotlight on as he swung his leg over and stood next to it, raising his rifle again. As though realizing he could be seen in the light, he lowered his weapon and leaned across the shield to turn off the beam.</p><p>For an instant he was in the light. That was all the time Jack needed. Shoving the door open with one hand, he fired with the other. The first bullet wounded the man in his shoulder and spun him around. The second bullet went through his neck. He was dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>The wind blew the door toward Jack, and he held it back with his arm as he scanned the area, looking for another target. Motioning for Sophie to stay where she was, Jack disappeared into the snow.</p><p>Sophie lay trembling for what seemed an eternity. She felt helpless. There was no signal on her cell phone, and the people in the tiny village didn\u2019t have telephones, so there was no way to call for help. Every minute Jack was gone felt like an hour. What was happening? Was he all right? Why didn\u2019t he come back?</p><p>The cabin was as cold as a meat locker, and her teeth chattered violently. She couldn\u2019t wait any longer. She got up and ran to the door. Just as she reached for the handle, it opened. Jack was coming up the steps holding the shooter\u2019s rifle in his left hand.</p><p>He wrapped his right arm around her and pulled her back inside, bolting the door. After lighting a candle that sat on the table, he looked around for something that would warm the room.</p><p>Sophie cautiously edged her way to the window and glanced outside. She saw the dead body sprawled on the snow. \u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d she asked. Before he could answer, she thought about the village. \u201cWhat about Mary and the others?\u201d she worried.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re smart, they\u2019ll lock their doors and stay inside.\u201d</p><p>Sophie could barely make out the shapes of the houses in the distance. She couldn\u2019t see any signs of movement. Again she looked at the dead man.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor now, we\u2019ll stay put,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf no one else shows up, we\u2019ll move the body. Someone might come after him.\u201d</p><p>Jack had found a kerosene heater and was lighting it. Sophie rubbed her arms and stomped her feet while he got the heater working. The rifle he\u2019d taken from the dead man lay on the table. It had a scope on top.</p><p>\u201cWho was he, Jack?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before. Do you recognize him? Maybe you saw him in Deadhorse or Barrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see his face from here,\u201d she answered. She dropped the curtain across the window.</p><p>Jack walked over to stand in front of her. Her face was pale, and she was trembling. He surrounded her with his arms and tilted her chin up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed hold of the collar of his jacket, drawing him to her. \u201cI know. And I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you. You\u2019ve got a gun. Can I have the rifle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you show me how.\u201d She glanced at the door. \u201cWhy is this happening? Why would anyone want to shoot at us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d she asked again. \u201cMary told us the men in the village wouldn\u2019t be back until late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis snowmobile came from the east,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing in that direction is the scientists\u2019 camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Sophie said excitedly. \u201cChipper told us the people staying there have all the latest equipment. If they have a satellite phone, we could call the police in Barrow and get some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait it out until Chipper gets here. We can\u2019t take any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack managed a quick smile, but inside he was in a rage. He wanted to shoot the bastard a couple more times. He crossed the room to stand next to the window, moving the curtain aside just enough to watch the area in front of the cabin. Minutes passed and no one else appeared.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to move the snowmobile and the body behind the cabin. You barricade the door behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Sophie cried. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting in here without you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay behind me,\u201d Jack cautioned. He went out first. It was deadly quiet now, the silence eerie.</p><p>Sophie followed Jack to the snowmobile. The halo of blood around the shooter\u2019s head was black against the white snow. Bracing herself, she looked at his face.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cI know him.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 874</p><p>CHICAGO</p><p>We\u2019ve found the perfect subject.

If he were to disappear for a few weeks, no one would miss him.</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>SOPHIE STEPPED AWAY FROM THE BODY. \u201cCHICAGO,\u201d SHE SAID. \u201cI talked to him in Chicago. He was rude, and I thought he looked like Bluto.\u201d</p><p>Jack knelt on one knee and methodically went through the man\u2019s pockets, searching for identification. He found a gun, engaged the safety, and handed it to her. In another pocket he found two clips and gave those to her as well.</p><p>\u201cHe was the security guard,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, I thought he was a security guard. I remember thinking he was filling in for someone else at the reception desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere, Sophie?\u201d Jack asked patiently. \u201cWhere exactly did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the lobby of William Harrington\u2019s apartment building.\u201d</p><p>If Jack was surprised by the news, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cGo back inside before you freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>His expression told her he didn\u2019t want an argument. She headed toward the cabin but dropped one of the clips in the snow. She scooped it up and held it against her so she wouldn\u2019t drop it again. Inside, she carefully placed the gun and clips on the table next to the rifle and felt a little calmer, knowing if anyone else were to start shooting at her she had weapons to defend herself. It wasn\u2019t relevant that she had never even held a gun until just a moment ago. Jack would show her how to unlock the safety and load the weapon. By God, she\u2019d shoot to kill if she had to.</p><p>She remembered the bloodstains on the snow and went outside again. While Jack moved the snowmobile and the body behind the cabin, she scooped up handfuls of snow and covered the blood. Then she stomped it down so the wind wouldn\u2019t carry it away. It seemed to her that the temperature had dropped again. Did it ever get too cold to snow, or was that a myth? She didn\u2019t know. She should have paid attention in earth science class instead of flirting with Billy Gibson.</p><p>By the time she and Jack were back inside the cabin, they were feeling the early effects of hypothermia. Sophie\u2019s feet were numb, but after pacing in front of the heater, her toes began to sting, a good sign, she knew, though it was painful.</p><p>Jack was going through the drawers of the cabinet looking for anything they might need should they be stuck in the cabin all night. In the bottom drawer he found a stack of p**n magazines, which explained how some of the stranded pilots passed the time, and a flashlight. The batteries were weak. He added the flashlight to the pile on the table and kept looking.</p><p>\u201cThis is the most ill-equipped cabin,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat should it be equipped for?\u201d she asked. She pulled off her gloves and warmed her hands in front of the heater.</p><p>\u201cAnything and everything. We\u2019ll need more kerosene, and I don\u2019t see any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChipper will be here soon.\u201d She tried to sound optimistic.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a small utility shed close. I\u2019ll look there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be locked,\u201d she said as she put on her gloves again.</p><p>\u201cIf it is, I\u2019ll break the lock.\u201d He pulled the curtain away from the window and scanned the area in front of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cJack, what are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to scare her, but he wanted her to be prepared. \u201cIf the man I killed had friends waiting for him, they might come looking. We need to be ready for anything...just in case.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her to see how she was handling the dark possibility.</p><p>She simply nodded and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d She wrapped her scarf around her neck and tucked it inside her collar. \u201cShow me how to use the gun.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot tougher than you look.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the man\u2019s gun and made her release and engage the safety several times before he was convinced she wouldn\u2019t forget it in a crisis. Then he showed her how to load the clips and fire the weapon.</p><p>Sophie put the extra clips in her left pocket, zipped it closed, and checked the safety one last time before slipping the gun into her right pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the shed. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he told her. He looked outside before opening the door. Sophie was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you. I can help carry if there are things we can use.\u201d She nudged his back. \u201cHurry. You\u2019re letting the cold in.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the door closed. She walked beside him, and he slowed his pace so that she could keep up. \u201cYou just had to come to Alaska,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI hate this cold.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his complaints. The snowfall had diminished, and Sophie looked off to the east. On the dark horizon, she could just make out the silhouette of a building. Joe had told them that the scientists closed down for the fall, but maybe Bluto had gotten inside and been waiting there for them to show up.</p><p>\u201cHow did Bluto...I mean, how did the man who shot at us know we would be here? He must have followed us,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had reached the shed, and as Jack tried to pry open the door, Sophie pulled the wool scarf over her mouth and nose to warm the air before she inhaled it. Hearing a sound in the distance, she looked up at the heavy clouds hanging over them, expecting to see Chipper\u2019s plane.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed her and pulled her to the side of the tiny building. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. Stay here.\u201d</p><p>He slowly looked around the corner. Two...no, three lights were coming toward the cabin from the east. Three men on snowmobiles were riding at full speed. It was too dangerous for Jack and Sophie to try to make it back to the cabin, so they waited. The men slowed and fanned out as they got closer. One headed toward the front, halting before he reached the cabin so he couldn\u2019t be seen. The other two circled to the back. When they passed the snowmobile Jack had parked there, they stopped abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cThey found the body,\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>One man motioned to the other, and they turned their machines around and retreated a few hundred feet, pausing to confer. Jack saw one of the men lift a fuel can from the back of his snowmobile. On foot, they crept up to the cabin again. The third man moved closer, drawing a gun and aiming at the front door while the other two bent low and ran under the window. One took a rag from his pocket, dipped it in the can, and set it afire. Giving the signal, he broke the glass and tossed the rag inside just as the man with the fuel threw the open can through the window. The light from the flame flashed across the opening, and the cabin ignited. The men crouched in the snow, waiting for Sophie and Jack to run out the door.</p><p>Sophie couldn\u2019t get the gun out of her pocket with her gloves on, so she pulled one off. Flexing her hand for circulation, she wrapped it around the handle with her finger on the trigger.</p><p>One of the men turned to the side and saw motion coming from the shed. By the time he raised his gun in their direction, Jack had aimed and fired. Solid hit. The man dropped on the snow facedown.</p><p>Jack swung to the left and fired again. He wounded the second man, got him in the shoulder, and fired again. The bullet hit him in the back of the knee as he tried to turn to shoot. Screaming, he went down hard.</p> <p>The third man disappeared. A second later, they heard a snowmobile revving up. Jack ran toward the bastard writhing on the ground and kicked the gun away from him.</p><p>Sophie followed. \u201cThis one\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d she shouted as she pointed the gun at his head. \u201cGo after the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he moves, shoot him,\u201d Jack ordered. Running to a snowmobile, he jumped on and took off. The man he followed headed east, then veered north at full speed. Jack thought he must be disoriented. There was nothing in that direction but the ocean.</p><p>The sky had turned dark, and the lights on the snowmobile made it easy to follow him. The light wavered, and Jack heard gunshots. The man was shooting at him. At this speed, it was only a matter of time before he lost control of the snowmobile and killed himself. Jack slowed down, widening the distance between them, and followed as the man zigzagged across the snow, the light on his vehicle bouncing at every bump.</p><p>How many miles had they gone? Jack\u2019s face stung from the cold; his eyes burned from the wind. Where did the bastard think he was headed? Had he lost his bearings? They had to be getting close to the ocean.</p><p>The guy would have to veer again or turn back in his direction. Keeping him within sight, Jack slowed down even more.</p> <p>Suddenly, he heard a loud echoing crack. It was followed by a terrified scream, and then a splash. The lights on the snowmobile aimed toward the sky and disappeared. Another scream...then silence.</p><p>\u201cSon of a birch,\u201d Jack whispered. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at the ice beneath him. Not a good way to go, he thought. He instantly turned his snowmobile around and sped away from there as fast as he could. As he headed south, he saw a light in the distance. The fire from the burning cabin was his beacon.</p><p>Sophie was getting frantic. Jack had been gone too long. When she heard the hum of a snowmobile, she let out a deep breath. It had to be him, she thought. Had to.</p><p>The man she was guarding glared at her. \u201cFBI\u2019s on the way,\u201d she told him, as she shifted from one foot to the other. The heat from the fire warmed her face, but her feet were still freezing. Fire and ice, she thought. It seemed so bizarre to be standing there watching the fire burn and the snow melt, and then instantly refreeze. Crazy. Fire and ice.</p><p>Sophie had never been so happy to see anyone. When Jack walked toward her, she wanted to run to him and throw her arms around him, but she restrained herself. He was going to have to help her release her grip on the gun first. She thought her finger might be frozen to the trigger.</p><p>After Jack took the gun from her hand, he faced the man on the ground. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need medical attention,\u201d the man yelled. He was actually outraged.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jack repeated.</p><p>\u201cI need medical\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack kicked his leg. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>The man screamed. \u201cCarter. Dr. Eric Carter. Now get me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor? Fix yourself.\u201d</p><p>Eric sneered. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of doctor. I\u2019m a Ph.D. in biology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou study the wolves?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>His gaze turned to Sophie. \u201cAll ruined. You\u2019ve ruined everything. Why couldn\u2019t you let it go?\u201d</p><p>They heard the drone of a plane\u2019s engine.</p><p>\u201cChipper\u2019s here,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I let what go?\u201d she asked Carter.</p><p>\u201cOur test subject. Why wouldn\u2019t you leave it alone? You kept pecking away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about William Harrington?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cStupid female. You kept pecking away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you testing?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sophie,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll put you in the plane and come back for him. You need to get warm.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Carter wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Jack got on the snowmobile with Sophie behind him. She rested her face against his back. Jack motioned for Chipper to stay where he was as they drove the snowmobile toward him. He opened the plane door for Sophie, and a burst of warm air poured across her face. Once she was seated in the back, Jack climbed in and shut the door. He didn\u2019t give a damn if Eric had to wait for him in the snow while he got warm. A few minutes wouldn\u2019t kill him.</p><p>\u201cRadio the police in Barrow,\u201d he told Chipper and then quickly explained what had happened.</p><p>Chipper\u2019s brown eyes got so big that, by the time Jack finished explaining, he looked like a cocker spaniel. \u201cWhat are you going to do with Carter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTie him up and put him with the cargo.\u201d</p><p>Once he could face the cold again, Jack headed back to where he\u2019d left Eric Carter. Thinking he saw something moving up ahead, he slowed, and then stopped. The light from the snowmobile was being reflected by a pair of tiny circles. Eyes. Glowing red eyes, watching him. He turned the light and saw the others. Four of them. Wolves standing together about twenty feet from Eric.</p><p>Jack heard their hungry growls. He concentrated on the biggest one at the front of the pack. He was huge. His white coat was marked with a dark strip across the back. He stared at Jack, and their gazes locked. As Jack reached for his gun, the wolf turned toward Eric and pounced with lightning speed. His fangs punctured the doctor\u2019s throat before Jack could draw his weapon. The others leapt, and it was too late. Too late to save the man. The wolf he had been watching lifted his head and looked at him again, then continued to feed.</p><p>Jack got the hell out of there.</p><p>Once he was inside the plane, he could breathe again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have bled to death,\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he definitely bled out.\u201d</p><p>The planes engines drowned out the wolves\u2019 howls.</p><p>Jack leaned back in the seat and closed his eyes. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Sophie tapped his shoulder. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the man you were chasing?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cHe went swimming.\u201d</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 927</p><p>ARCTIC CAMP</p><p>William Harrington remained unconscious when we injected the K-74. After placing him in position, we observed off site.</p><p>Though confused when he gained consciousness, he was reacting as we had expected: disoriented and frightened.</p><p>Our mistake was in failing to factor in all the variables\u2014especially indigenous species.</p><p>We observed Harrington\u2019s stress level increase dramatically. He appeared to be terrified, but we could not discern the cause of this reaction because our remote cameras were not picking it up. Harrington\u2019s screams drowned out the sounds. Within minutes a polar bear, the size of which we had never seen, came into view. There was nowhere for him to run or hide. He was no match for the animal.</p><p>Test invalidated.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>SOPHIE INSISTED ON GOING BACK TO INOOK THE FOLLOWING morning with Jack. She was determined to look at the scientists\u2019 home away from home and, hopefully, find out what Dr. Eric Carter was doing.</p><p>FBI agents were on their way from Anchorage, and the police from Barrow had already made a complete sweep of the property.</p><p>The bodies in front of the burned cabin\u2014or what was left of them once the wolves had finished\u2014were on their way to the morgue.</p><p>Jack had watched them being put into body bags. Eric Carter was unrecognizable. Identification would be made from his fingerprints. Jack stood over the second body and examined his face. He had seen him before, but where? Replaying the events of the last few days in his memory, he came to it. He and Sophie had walked past him on their way to Chipper\u2019s Charter Service. The man had stood outside their hotel and had almost been hit by a truck as he rushed across the street toward his own vehicle. Okay, so the son of a bitch followed them.</p><p>Jack had made sure that Sophie stayed away from the gruesome scene at the cabin. He\u2019d argued that she\u2019d been through enough. She was with the police as they searched the four rooms of the scientists\u2019 quarters, and she walked through each one looking for some clue as to why Harrington had come to Alaska. She knew he had been connected with the Alpha Project. She still didn\u2019t know what that was, but she was positive it had something to do with the scientists who ran this facility. What had Eric Carter been afraid she would discover?</p><p>There were notebooks full of data, but they all were about the wolves. There were videos as well. The disks were labeled and numbered. The subject of disk one through disk twenty was the alpha male named Ricky. One of the officers put a disk in the player, and several others gathered around to watch Ricky and his pack attack a caribou.</p><p>\u201cHow were they able to film this without the wolves coming after them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLook at the jaws on that beast,\u201d another officer said. \u201cI think he could take down a polar bear all by himself.\u201d</p><p>Jack joined the group. He saw the wolf and recognized him immediately. As he watched the video, he felt a strange connection with the animal, probably because he had stared into his eyes and seen the power in him. He also felt a weird sort of fondness for the wolf because he hadn\u2019t attacked him. Scared the hell out of him, but had left him alone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s magnificent,\u201d an officer remarked. \u201cThink he was one of the wolves that killed the doctor last night?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack answered but didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cHe was there.\u201d</p><p>Sophie sat at the desk in the small room the doctors used as a study, looking through notebooks. Jack checked up on her every few minutes. He\u2019d stop in the doorway and just watch her until she looked up. He\u2019d ask her if she needed anything, and he\u2019d also ask each time if she was ready to go back to Barrow.</p><p>She knew he was concerned about her, but couldn\u2019t understand why. She was surrounded by men with guns, and she had her own FBI agent bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried I\u2019ll read something that will freak me out?\u201d she asked the fourth time he appeared.</p><p>\u201cThere is that possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. After yesterday, nothing here will spook me...bore the wool socks off me, but not scare me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t like wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut every little detail of their day? Eat, sleep, kill, eat, sleep, kill...repetitious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey were interested in the behavior within the pack. The alpha interested them most, how he controlled the others...family dynamic stuff.\u201d She closed the notebook, put it back on the desk and stood. \u201cI don\u2019t know how these scientists stood it. Day in and day out watching wolves...and in these conditions.\u201d She walked over to him as she asked, \u201cHave they found anything that connects Harrington to the project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut they\u2019ve only just started.\u201d</p><p>When she looked up at him, he felt a tightness in his chest. She was beautiful, yes, but there was so much more to her. She was loving and trusting and fiercely loyal. He lifted her arms and put them around his neck.</p><p>\u201cGuess what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She moved into him and pulled his head down toward hers. Then she brushed her lips across his mouth, teasing, tempting. \u201cThis?\u201d she asked. She deepened the kiss, rubbing her tongue over his lips. She pulled back and whispered, \u201cOr this?\u201d</p><p>Hungry for her now, Jack slanted his mouth over hers and his tongue moved inside. He loved the way she felt pressed against him, and from the way she eagerly responded, he knew she loved it, too. He would have liked nothing better than to rip her clothes off and make love to her now, in this room, but he lifted his head. His breath was shaky.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or the place, sweetheart...unless you want to make the six o\u2019clock news.\u201d</p><p>One of the officers interrupted. \u201cYour pilot wants to know when\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cTell him to start the engines. We\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Sophie was all bundled up and heading toward the plane with Jack. The wind had kicked up again, and the short walk was miserable.</p><p>\u201cI hate...\u201d Jack began.</p><p>She patted his arm. \u201cI know. You hate the cold.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE FLIGHT BACK to Barrow was turbulent, but Sophie\u2019s stomach barely complained. After her experiences of the last twenty-four hours, a bumpy ride in a tiny plane was child\u2019s play.</p><p>Once back in Barrow, she spent several hours in the police station. She tried to be helpful and apologized over and over again because so many of their questions were left unanswered. Was she ever going to discover what happened to William Harrington?</p><p>\u201cI know that Harrington was involved in something he called the Alpha Project. I just don\u2019t know what his role was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was Harrington connected to the scientists?\u201d one officer asked.</p> <p>\u201cBluto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jack. \u201cYou explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the men who attacked us...Sophie met him in Chicago. He was at William Harrington\u2019s apartment, and he told her Harrington had gone to Europe,\u201d he said.</p><p>The interrogation continued, and when they\u2019d finally concluded that she had told them everything she knew, she was given the chance to ask them some questions.</p> <p>\u201cThe men who came after Jack and me...who were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already named Dr. Eric Carter for us, but we haven\u2019t identified the others yet,\u201d the lead officer answered. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for IDs. The FBI will run prints.\u201d</p><p>Joe Rooney had been standing by Jack listening intently. He joined the conversation. \u201cAs far as we know, there were never more than four scientists at the facility. Besides Carter, there were Dr. Brandon Finch, Dr. Marcus Lemming, and Dr. Kirk Halpern. We\u2019ve spoken to Dr. Lemming and Dr. Halpern. They\u2019re in Chicago, and they swear they didn\u2019t know what Eric Carter was up to. Lemming said Carter often stayed behind after the others had gone home, and he didn\u2019t tell them what he was doing on his own time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you speak with the fourth doctor, Brandon Finch? Where is he?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cIn an urn on his wife\u2019s mantle, I imagine,\u201d Joe said. \u201cHe died of a massive heart attack a couple of months ago. Evidently he had a heart condition and didn\u2019t let the others know about it because he was concerned they wouldn\u2019t let him continue his work. Agents will go through Eric Carter\u2019s house and his lab in Chicago. They\u2019ll check out the other doctors, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the man Jack chased on the snowmobile?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had time yet to get a search team together,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a tough time with the ice shifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those men who died was pretending to be Paul Larson. That\u2019s what I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I had heard their voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some help up here from Anchorage,\u201d Joe assured her. \u201cWe should know more in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>It had been a very long day by the time the police had finished their questioning. Jack invited the officers to join them for dinner, and most of them took him up on his offer.</p><p>The Red Seal Caf\u00e9 was packed with customers. When Jack, Sophie, and the policemen walked in, a hush fell over the crowd. The whole town had heard the news of what had happened at Inook, and Sophie felt as though she were a guppy in a fishbowl. There was little doubt that she and Jack were the subject of every conversation at every table.</p><p>There was another whale meat special, and Jack decided he would try it again. He shuddered at the first bite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep eating. By the third swallow, you\u2019ll like it,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>Jack could only get two bites down before he gave up. \u201cIt must be an acquired taste,\u201d he told the others.</p> <p>Sophie took the opportunity at dinner to get more information about Barrow. She got up and went to the table next to theirs and asked a father and son if they would mind answering a few questions. By the time Jack was ready to leave, the entire restaurant was crowded around Sophie, helping her with her notes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to mention the lack of crime,\u201d one man suggested.</p><p>\u201cUntil yesterday,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d the first man admitted.</p><p>Later at the hotel, she sat down at the desk and started writing while Jack made several phone calls. When she had completed her article, she looked at the clock. Two hours had passed. She turned around. Jack, wearing only a pair of shorts, was sitting in bed reading.</p><p>She slipped into the bathroom and showered. Wrapped in a towel, she came back to the bedroom and stood beside the bed, waiting. When Jack looked up and smiled, she let the towel drop to the floor. He pulled the covers back so she could slip in next to him. He warmed her body with his and began to kiss her neck.</p><p>\u201cJack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d he asked as his fingers slid down her chest to her stomach.</p><p>She inhaled sharply. \u201cYes, I do, but tonight is the last...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d</p><p>His hand moved slower, and his fingers were doing magical things to her, robbing her of her thoughts. She knew she wanted to tell him something, but his touch was such a distraction. She gasped, then moaned. Jack leaned up on an elbow to watch her as he stroked her. The warm glint of his eyes made her heart race even more. She couldn\u2019t stand the torment any longer. She pushed him onto his back, straddled him, and then proceeded to drive him out of his mind.</p><p>When they both had reached the peak of ecstasy, she collapsed on top of him. She lay there for a long time, content to listen to his heartbeat.</p><p>It took Jack a while to control his breath. \u201cWhere did you learn...?\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t learn,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt just felt...right.\u201d</p><p>Her mind cleared and she remembered what she wanted to tell him. She rolled away, pulled the covers up, and said, \u201cThat was the last time we\u2019ll do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He reached for her. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in Chicago, and I can\u2019t get involved with an FBI agent. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She thought he would be more understanding, but he wasn\u2019t. He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou are involved,\u201d he said.</p><p>She\u2019d have to give him that. \u201cOkay, yes, but once we\u2019re home, no more. Jack, you aren\u2019t falling in love with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. Absolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt you. Good night.\u201d</p><p>She had trouble falling asleep. Why hadn\u2019t he asked her if she was falling in love with him?</p><p>Maybe because he already knew the answer.</p><p>JOURNAL ENTRY 928</p><p>ARCTIC CIRCLE</p><p>This may be my last entry for a while.</p><p>When I began this journal years ago, I had intended to create a personal record of my experiences should I one day want to write a memoir. I never could have imagined the journey it would chronicle.</p><p>The Dubai contact is willing to pay the fifty million next month and not wait for further experiments. I wish we could have expanded the testing. I\u2019d especially have liked to try it on female subjects. We might have been able to negotiate another ten million.</p><p>I\u2019m packing up and heading home. Eric will follow later. Our primary objective now is to make sure all of our data on K-74 is secure.</p><p>We regret that William Harrington\u2019s death was in vain, but then, fairness has never been an attribute of science.</p><p>We can\u2019t reveal any knowledge of him or his death, of course. Our voice monitors picked up on some pilots finding evidence of him. They found a business card. They\u2019ll take it to the police, I suppose, and eventually he\u2019ll be identified. We\u2019ve been very careful to prevent any trail leading back to us, but it would probably behoove us to keep an eye on how this plays out.</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>DADDY WAS IN THE NEWS AGAIN.</p><p>Sophie came home to a celebration. She had just unpacked and was about to listen to the messages on her recorder when Mr. Bitterman called.</p><p>\u201cTurn on your television. Hurry. It\u2019s in the news. The FBI is going to owe your father big for this one.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before she could ask him any questions. She dutifully turned on the local news, hit the Record button, and sat down on the bed to watch.</p><p>Natalie Miller was reporting live from the courthouse.</p><p>\u201cKevin Devoe and his wife, Meredith, have been arrested and taken into custody by the FBI. From what we\u2019ve learned, the FBI was sent proof that the Devoes had stolen the money from the Kelly\u2019s Root Beer employees\u2019 retirement fund and had hidden it in several secret accounts using dummy corporations.\u201d</p><p>The scene flashed to another reporter standing with an older man who was waving a cashier\u2019s check.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all here,\u201d he said, beaming at the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact amount I should have gotten when Kelly\u2019s closed. To the penny. All of us got the checks at the same time. I know. I\u2019ve talked to my friends. Bobby Rose did this. He found that money, and he got it back for us. He knew what those crooks were up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it was Bobby Rose?\u201d the toothy reporter asked.</p><p>The man chuckled. \u201cWho besides Bobby has the brains to figure it out and find our money? I\u2019ll tell you this,\u201d he added, waving his finger in front of the reporter\u2019s face. \u201cBobby takes care of his own. Chicago,\u201d he explained. \u201cOh, it was Bobby Rose, all right. Our Robin Hood. You can\u2019t convince me it was anyone else.\u201d</p><p>The reporter looked directly into the camera. \u201cNatalie, the FBI will neither confirm nor deny that they know who was behind this. There will be a press conference tomorrow. Stay tuned for the latest developments.\u201d</p><p>No mention was made of reopening Kelly\u2019s. Mr. Bitterman would be disappointed if that didn\u2019t happen. Sophie called him, and after discussing the good news, she gave him a few details about her trip. They talked about Harrington and what she had learned about the scientists, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell him about the killings just yet. She would wait until they were sitting face-to-face. Besides, she needed time to process it all.</p><p>She discussed a few articles she wanted to write about the people of Barrow, and he suggested she could work from home where there wouldn\u2019t be any interruptions. She was happy to comply and, after hanging up, immediately went to work. She wrote the story of the football team first. After that, she put some finishing touches on her story about Samuel and Anna. She even wrote about the hotel in Deadhorse, but she wasn\u2019t ready to write about Harrington. There were still too many holes in that story.</p><p>On her second day home, she received another piece of good news. Detective Steinbeck called to tell her the police had identified the man who had shot her in her apartment. Working with the FBI, they had checked the fingerprints from one of the bodies in Alaska and discovered they belonged to an ex-convict who lived in Chicago. His name was Ivan Brosky, and he had a record a mile long. When they searched Brosky\u2019s apartment, they found a cache of weapons, and ballistics was able to match one of the guns with the bullet. They had their man. Any further investigation would be handled by the FBI.</p><p>Steinbeck\u2019s call was followed immediately by one from Gil.</p><p>\u201cGreat news, huh, Sophie?\u201d he said. \u201cThey got the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d she began. She didn\u2019t finish because she wasn\u2019t really all that surprised. Gil had his ways of knowing everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Tony downstairs today, and Alec said it\u2019s okay to send him home. I just wanted to let you know. I\u2019ll check back with you in a few days to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Sophie thanked him and hung up. Maybe her life could get back to a modicum of normalcy once again.</p><p>Cordie called her at five o\u2019clock. \u201cGet dressed up. Regan and I are taking you to Fortune\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Cordie would not take no for an answer. \u201cYou love Fortune\u2019s. We\u2019ll pick you up at seven. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it would be good for her to be with friends, after all. Sophie needed something besides work to take her mind off Jack. Hopefully, one of them would have a horrible problem, and she could concentrate on that.</p><p>She quickly finished her work and changed into her favorite black silk dress. She added a bloodred scarf over her wool coat. If the restaurant got chilly, she could use it as a wrap.</p><p>The three women caused quite a stir when they followed the waiter to their table in a cozy alcove with drapes on either side.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Alec tonight?\u201d Cordie asked when they were seated at the round table.</p><p>\u201cHe and Jack were working on something, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was,\u201d Regan answered.</p><p>Cordie talked about school, and Regan caught them up on her search for an apartment. \u201cI don\u2019t want a big house to take care of. Not yet. Besides, Alec might be reassigned. Okay, enough chitchat. Talk to us, Sophie. Tell us what you found out about Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear about Alaska, too,\u201d Cordie chimed in.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t know where to start. She talked about the trip all through dinner. Her friends sat wide-eyed, barely touching their food as she narrated the story of the last few days.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Soph...\u201d Regan gasped, the tears welling up in her eyes. \u201cYou could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the man who shot you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBluto,\u201d Regan said. \u201cShe called him Bluto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe followed you to Alaska. It wasn\u2019t all about Kelly\u2019s like everyone thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Kelly\u2019s...\u201d Regan said. \u201cYour dad is now a hero.\u201d</p><p>Hero today, criminal tomorrow, Sophie thought. \u201cHow much do you want to bet the FBI will be looking even harder for my father now?\u201d</p><p>Her friends nodded. They had known her father for years and were well aware how elusive he could be.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Jack since you got home?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Kelly\u2019s will reopen? Mr. Bitterman thinks it will,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>Regan and Cordie exchanged a look. Cordie said, \u201cDon\u2019t change the channel. You were with a gorgeous man for days\u2014and nights\u2014and you haven\u2019t mentioned him once. Why do you think that is...oh my God, I know why. You slept with him.\u201d</p><p>Deny, deny, deny...except with her friends. Sophie couldn\u2019t lie. \u201cYes, I did,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me. I do have principles...especially when it comes to the FBI...but....\u201d</p><p>Regan opened her mouth to protest, but Cordie cut her off. \u201cWe know, you\u2019re married to an agent, Regan, but your father isn\u2019t a career criminal.\u201d</p><p>Sophie looked miserable. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll go away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Jack,\u201d Cordie said, clearly exasperated. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t go away, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let this happen. I\u2019m in way over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell in love.\u201d Regan nodded.</p> <p>\u201cYou know she did,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cSophie doesn\u2019t sleep around. If she didn\u2019t have feelings for him, she wouldn\u2019t have slept with him.\u201d Turning to Sophie, she said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to sleep with him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to sleep with him again. That\u2019s the problem!\u201d</p><p>Cordie looked sympathetic. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re worrying for nothing. Maybe he doesn\u2019t plan to see you again. He might have moved on now that you\u2019re back in Chicago and safe.\u201d</p><p>The possibility made Sophie\u2019s heart ache.</p><p>IN BED THAT NIGHT, the images of Harrington and Inook and the scientists\u2019 camp came flooding back to Sophie. She had gone to Alaska to write William Harrington\u2019s story, but since returning home, she had done everything she could to avoid the task. A pang of conscience stung her. She had vowed that she would give him a voice, and she owed William at least that much.</p> <p>She threw off her covers and went to her computer. For the next hour she wrote of what she knew about the man and his ambitions and his ultimate demise.</p><p>She thought long and hard about the ending to the story. After all, she didn\u2019t really have all the pieces to the puzzle. And so she wrote:</p><p>William Harrington loved challenges. He thrived on them. What took him to Alaska remains shrouded in mystery for now, but someday that shroud will be lifted, and we will know the truth. His story is not finished.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>HIS STORY IS NOT FINISHED.</p><p>Marcus Lemming read the words in the newspaper and was enraged.</p> <p>He was close to his goal, and nothing was going to get in his way now. Eric had almost destroyed the dream with his stupidity, and he had paid the price. Marcus, on the other hand, was too careful, too intelligent, to let it slip through his fingers. Every last piece of research was compiled, recorded, and filed away in a secure place. No one would find it before it was time to hand it over to the buyer. And no one would ever know about the deal he\u2019d made, the fifty million dollars for his research and Eric\u2019s formula. What the buyer did with it was of no concern to him. It was all part of the confidentiality agreement. The buyer wanted his scientists to take the credit for the discovery, and that was fine with Marcus. If they revealed the truth, they\u2019d look like fools.</p><p>There was just one little problem Marcus had to handle before he was home free: Sophie Summerfield Rose. Eric had said she wouldn\u2019t stop. The article she had written for the newspaper said as much: His story is not finished.</p><p>Marcus had to silence her. He supposed he could find another one of Eric\u2019s friends to eliminate her, but the last one had bungled the job, so why would he go to that well again? He\u2019d see to the job himself, and since there is a purpose behind everything a scientist does, he would gain some benefit from the undertaking. Sophie would become his first female subject. After the experiment, he would give her a lethal dose and cremate the body. No body, no crime. But he would have the data for the sake of science...or at least for his own gratification.</p><p>How to grab her without being seen was the problem he still needed to work out. Preparation and patience\u2014that\u2019s what the situation called for. If she didn\u2019t make any hasty moves and gave him time, he could work out a plan down to the most critical detail. He hoped to have the opportunity to talk to her before she died. He would ask her why she had gone to such lengths to find out the truth. Why did she care? William Harrington was a nobody. He didn\u2019t have any friends or lovers or hovering relatives. He was a loner, and she had done only one interview with him. Just one. She had barely even known him.</p><p>When Eric heard that Harrington had mentioned the name Alpha Project to her, he feared she would dig for the truth and get too close, so he had hired one of his unsavory friends to get rid of her. But Marcus had thought Eric had acted rashly. No one, not even Harrington, knew what the Alpha Project really was. Now things had gotten so screwed up, there was no telling to what extremes she would go to unravel their secret.</p><p>If luck was on his side, he\u2019d have a month before he had to deal with her\u2014a month before he received his fifty million.</p><p>THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>MR. BITTERMAN LOVED THE ARTICLES. HE WAS ESPECIALLY fond of the story Sophie had written about the foot ball team, and was moved by her story about Harrington. It was good to be back to work, back to her routine.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t seen Jack since he\u2019d left her apartment after bringing her home from the airport. He had checked every room to make sure no one was waiting to pounce, kissed her on the forehead, and walked out the door.</p><p>Sophie struggled to keep him out of her thoughts, but late one evening she decided to watch the video on YouTube. She replayed it several times, and each time she saw something new, the way he calmly handled a horrible situation, the way he coolly kept everyone else from panicking. She wasn\u2019t surprised by his courage. She\u2019d already seen him in action and knew how he handled himself in a crisis, how he protected others. He had certainly protected her.</p><p>The alpha male. Jack was that, all right.</p><p>At five minutes to twelve, Sophie went to her closet, got the cell phone out of its hiding place, and waited for her father to call.</p><p>He was always on time.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your trip,\u201d he said in greeting.</p><p>She wanted him to tell her about Kelly\u2019s first.</p><p>\u201cNow your turn, Princess,\u201d he said after giving his account.</p><p>Sophie glossed over the shootings and the fire and told him about the weather and the people and the food, but her father had a way of finding out information, and he already knew down to the last detail what had happened. He sounded like a scolding parent when he said that he would never have encouraged her to go had he known the dangerous trouble she would get into, and he promised to send a team of bodyguards the next time she wanted to travel. She assured him that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. She didn\u2019t plan on going on any more adventures.</p><p>Wanting to move on to more pleasant topics, he said, \u201cI enjoyed the story you wrote about Mr. Harrington. You did an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>After a few more minutes of conversation, her father paused. \u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you. I hear it in your voice. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father. You can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI did such a stupid thing. I fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith...him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI agent.\u201d She thought she heard a gulp. She took another breath. \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He went to law school.\u201d</p><p>She knew how her father felt about attorneys. He was one of the best, but he understood what the unscrupulous ones were capable of; he\u2019d witnessed it firsthand. Many years ago, as an enthusiastic young lawyer, he had unwittingly gone to work for the most corrupt law firm in Chicago: Ellis, Ellis, and Cooper. They had turned Bobby Rose into the man he was today.</p><p>The Bridget O\u2019Reilly case had been the turning point. An automobile explosion took her husband, her three children, and her mother. Bridget was left with severe burns over half her body. Had the auto company heeded the warnings from the dealers and mechanics about the faulty connection, the explosion never would have happened.</p><p>The court awarded Bridget thirty-two million dollars, but by the time the appeals were disposed of, and Ellis and Ellis took their cut and reimbursed themselves for expenses, Bridget was left with two hundred thousand dollars. The amount didn\u2019t even begin to cover her medical bills. Bedridden and settlement gone, Bridget couldn\u2019t get the health care she needed. Before she could get state aid, she died of an infection.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ellis, Ellis, and Cooper celebrated their windfall.</p><p>Bobby Rose had been a young, idealistic attorney at the time. His research had helped win the case for Bridget, and in spending a great deal of time together, they had become good friends. He naively believed that she would receive the justice she deserved, but watching Bridget die penniless as the law partners went on lavish vacations and built colossal homes to match their colossal egos, Bobby changed. He resigned his position with the firm. He didn\u2019t have to tell them why. They knew, and they had a good laugh over his moral indignation.</p><p>Six months later, some of the investments the firm was using as tax write-offs suffered unforeseen and severe losses, and that was followed by unexplainable withdrawals from several accounts. Their assets were dwindling before their very eyes. Since many of their transactions were of a dubious nature to begin with, the lawyers tried to keep the losses quiet. Not only were they afraid of the scrutiny of the authorities, but they also feared for their reputation. They were high-priced attorneys. Who could trust a firm that couldn\u2019t even protect its own accounts?</p><p>From that time on, Bobby vowed that the fat cats who came to their wealth by underhanded and ruthless means would not enjoy their riches. Over the years, he gained a reputation for being involved in the downfall of several notorious businessmen. Of course, to do this, he had to resort to some questionable methods himself, which was why the law was constantly looking for him. Bobby was not only shrewd, he was street smart, and when necessary could disappear. He was never sought for criminal charges, but, rather, for questioning.</p><p>His one regret was that he had not been present for most of Sophie\u2019s growing up. Her mother died when she was a baby, and circumstances kept him from being the kind of father he wanted to be. Still, Sophie had never once doubted that her father loved her.</p><p>\u201cSay something, Daddy,\u201d Sophie prompted when her father didn\u2019t speak. \u201cI said he\u2019s a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shock, Princess, I don\u2019t deny it, but we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be concerned. I just felt I should tell you, but it isn\u2019t going anywhere. He\u2019s moved on, and I will, too.\u201d</p><p>Sophie realized she\u2019d never really been in love before, and if this was how it felt, it sucked.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can get away for a while...just to clear your head? Why not join me in Monte Carlo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said, her voice lacking enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019d have to wait until after Thanksgiving. There are too many people depending on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I know what you have to do. After Thanksgiving then. You go to sleep now, and don\u2019t worry so much. Things have a way of working out.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to believe him.</p><p>WORK BECAME HER SALVATION. She buried herself in it, writing for hours on end. She managed to block out all thoughts of Jack...until she got into bed. She\u2019d close her eyes, and he was right there.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my dreams,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>What was he doing? Where was he now? Had he taken time off and found the warm beach he wanted? Or was he back at work?</p><p>Had he handed off the Inook investigation, or was he still involved? She hadn\u2019t heard anything for days. Surely they were still looking for answers. Had they found a motive behind the men who tried to kill Jack and her? Alpha Project...four scientists...William Harrington. She fell asleep trying to connect the dots.</p><p>THIRTY-SIX</p><p>NOW THAT THE FUROR OVER THE YOUTUBE INCIDENT HAD died down, Jack was able to get back to work. His star had faded because there were two new online superstars for the world to watch. Both were gorgeous Hollywood A-list movie icons, and they were caught duking it out at a high-powered producer's swank wedding reception, the guy having had the bad taste to dump one sexpot to marry the other. What made the video so popular was the X-rated language and the footage of the scantily clad actress punching her way through the crowd to get to the blushing bride. The acid-tongued starlet throwing the first punch ended up sprawled across the ten-thousand-dollar wedding cake. This disaster movie was a huge hit.</p><p>In the meantime, Jack found himself reassigned to a fraud case, but since the investigation labeled \u201cInook\u201d was ongoing, he went to Pittman and argued that he would be far more effective working on the information coming in from Alaska. His argument was valid, and Pittman was swayed.</p><p>\u201cI know you, Agent MacAlister. You\u2019re going to work this case with or without my permission. Isn\u2019t that right? Never mind, don\u2019t answer. Okay, you\u2019re back in. I\u2019ll make the call and let everyone know you\u2019re the agent in charge. Finish this soon. I don\u2019t like my agents getting shot at.\u201d</p><p>All the boxes of information that had been gathered from the scientists\u2019 facility in Alaska had been shipped to Chicago. Anchorage didn\u2019t have the manpower, and since the first crime had been committed in Chicago, the case was theirs. Agents had already pored over every scrap of paper in every box and had viewed the disks. Wolves. Hours and days and months of video about wolves. There was only one thing unusual about the recordings: they stopped before the final year. Had those last months been recorded? If so, where were the disks?</p><p>Jack watched the footage, fast-forwarding through scenes with no activity. Sophie had been right. They did eat, sleep, kill, eat, sleep, kill.</p><p>He was going through a spiral notebook when two assistants came in, rolling a cart with more boxes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are those from?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThe TNI Foundation archives. The research from past years that the doctors had compiled.\u201d</p><p>So far everything the FBI had examined had proven to be mundane scientific research, but they were leaving no stone unturned. Jack kept going back to what Carter had said to Sophie before Ricky got to him: You kept pecking away. What was he afraid she would find? What the hell was he hiding?</p><p>Agents had talked to the two remaining scientists several times, but they were unable to shed any light on Carter\u2019s motives. Jack familiarized himself with the files on each of the four doctors and wasn\u2019t satisfied with what he found. Somebody at TNI had to know something about Carter\u2019s secret.</p><p>Jack decided that it was time he talked to them face-to-face. He would start with Dr. Marcus Lemming in Chicago. He stopped by the doctor\u2019s office unannounced and was told by the secretary that Dr. Lemming had gone to North Dakota for a seminar. The other scientist, Dr. Kirk Halpern, lived just outside of Minneapolis. Jack grabbed a morning flight and was knocking on Halpern\u2019s door early that afternoon.</p><p>The scientist showed him into his cluttered living room. A slight man with hunched shoulders and an old man\u2019s demeanor, his file indicated he was forty-five years old. His obvious fatigue made him look older. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould I get you something to drink, Agent?\u201d Dr. Halpern offered. He moved some newspapers off a chair and motioned for Jack to sit. \u201cMy wife used to keep me organized. She died six years ago.\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve let things go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your wife handle your long trips to Alaska?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>His face lit up. \u201cShe went with me. She loved my work and helped. It was after she passed that I joined Eric and Marcus and Brandon at Inook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about them, Doctor.\u201d Jack stood and removed his top-coat. Noticing Halpern staring at his gun, Jack draped the coat on the back of the chair and took his seat again.</p> <p>\u201cPlease call me Kirk. I can\u2019t tell you anything I haven\u2019t already told the other agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate it if you would go over it again,\u201d Jack urged.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d He moved a needlepoint pillow from the chair and sat down. \u201cI\u2019ll begin with our team leader, Brandon...Dr. Brandon Finch. He was very organized. He even made charts so that we wouldn\u2019t waste time. Brandon got on our nerves after awhile. Things had to be just so. He was obsessive about everything from how we prepared our food to when we went to bed. It was irritating. I got along with him all right, but occasionally we bickered. After a while, the isolation and the weather gets to you.</p><p>\u201cI felt just terrible when he died. None of us knew about his heart condition. He was overweight, but not too out of shape. He kept up with us in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the other doctors get along with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey put up with him, just like I did. Every now and then they\u2019d get into it with him, but there weren\u2019t any hard feelings after they let off steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Eric Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung, eager, intense. He and Marcus became close friends right away since they were the same age. They worked together well and shared similar interests\u2014at the beginning anyway. Eric began to stay by himself more. The longer we were there, the more their friendship was strained. One afternoon while Eric was examining some blood samples he\u2019d taken, Marcus took Brandon and me aside and told us he was worried about Eric. He asked us if we\u2019d noticed any changes. Indeed, we had. Eric had become so withdrawn, he wouldn\u2019t let any of us look at his notes until he had them organized. Most of it was gibberish to us anyway. Marcus said he couldn\u2019t read his scribbles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any idea what he was hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. The agents told me that before he died, he said something to Miss Rose about a test subject. He was concerned about something she was looking for. I have no idea what he meant.\u201d</p><p>Jack was about to move on to Marcus Lemming when he thought of another question to ask. \u201cWhich of you did the recording?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt first we all took our turns with the camera, but the last couple of years, Eric insisted on taking it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there were videos from the last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Eric watched them over and over and over. It drove the rest of us crazy. We finally moved the player into the small room so we could shut the door. Hour after hour he\u2019d watch. He loved Ricky. But then, all of us did. He was a splendid alpha male. I only wish I could have observed him to the end. Don\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be around long. Arctic wolves don\u2019t have long life spans, you know. I had to leave that phase of the study because the last couple of years Brandon wanted me to go with him to track the pups from Ricky\u2019s second pack. I guess you could say we were creating a family tree of sorts. I will admit we learned a great deal, but we didn\u2019t get to film the new packs as much as we would have liked. Eric hogged the good audio and video equipment. He had thirty disk files marked. At night, he\u2019d watch with the sound muted. He didn\u2019t want to hear, just to watch. One through thirty\u2014when he finished the last one, he\u2019d start all over again. Marcus thought Eric was having a breakdown of some sort. He wanted him to go home for a while, see a medical doctor. We would have sent him home, but we were going to close up soon anyway, so we put up with his odd behavior awhile longer. I believed that, once Eric got back to the city, he\u2019d snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>Jack wanted to go back to the videos. \u201cYou said one through thirty disks. Are you sure of that number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found only twenty-three disks.\u201d</p><p>Kirk sat back. \u201cWhat happened to the other seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p> <p>He scratched his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Eric must have done something with them. Maybe he shipped them home. Did you check?\u201d He smiled as he continued. \u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p><p>Jack moved to the last scientist: Marcus Lemming.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you, he was close to Eric until Eric started acting strange. Marcus was dedicated to the study and the pack, and by the time we finished, he was closer to me than Eric. In the evening, while Eric watched his videos, Marcus and I played Scrabble and cards.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a few times since we left Inook. Marcus is thinking about moving back to North Dakota to be near family. This study burned him out.\u201d</p><p>Jack spent another hour talking to Kirk. He was putting on his coat and heading toward the door when he stopped to ask, \u201cYou never called your study the Alpha Project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asked that question about a hundred times now. I told the agents no, and I told Miss Rose no. We didn\u2019t call it the Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she called yesterday. She said she\u2019d like to come see me. We spent a long time on the phone. She asked about the Alpha Project, but then somehow we started talking about my wife. It felt good to reminisce. I\u2019m afraid I got carried away, but Miss Rose seemed genuinely interested.\u201d</p><p>That was his Sophie. She could get anyone to tell her his life story. But then, she wasn\u2019t really his Sophie, was she? Jack thought about her a lot. He missed her.</p><p>She was on his mind as he flew back to Chicago. She was still \u201cpecking away,\u201d as Eric had accused. She wasn\u2019t going to let it go, which gave him an uneasy feeling. Jack needed to call her and tell her to stop. He needed to talk to her, convince her to back off. He needed to see her again.</p><p>THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201cGOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE.\u201d</p><p>Sophie watched the protesters picketing in front of the grocery story with a mixture of disbelief and shock. Mr. Bitterman had given her the assignment, and this one was going in her I-hate-this-job notebook. It might even make the top five.</p><p>Seven protesters holding placards marched back and forth at the store entrance. Three were dressed up as turkeys.</p><p>Sophie crossed the parking lot. Bracing herself, she tapped on the shoulder of the woman at the end of the line. \u201cExcuse me. Could you tell me who the head turkey is? I\u2019d like to find out what you\u2019re protesting.\u201d</p><p>A gentleman with a round face framed in feathers and an orange wattle hanging from his chin stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. I put this together,\u201d he announced with great seriousness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m writing an article for the Illinois Chronicle, sir. May I ask you some questions about your protest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We want to draw attention to this horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat horror would that be?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe heartless cruelty to turkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barbaric is what it is,\u201d a woman shouted over her placard. \u201cThe assassins raise them just to kill and eat them. It\u2019s murder!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want grocery stores to sell Thanksgiving turkeys?\u201d Sophie asked calmly.</p><p>A thin older woman with thick glasses stepped forward. \u201cThat\u2019s right, and we\u2019re going to stay here until the killing stops.\u201d</p><p>Each of the protesters had something to add, and they made extra sure that Sophie spelled their names correctly. When she couldn\u2019t think of another absurd question to ask, she thanked them for the interview and turned to walk away. Behind her, the small but vocal group chanted, \u201cSave the turkeys! Save the turkeys!\u201d</p><p>Holding up her phone, Sophie took some pictures. Cordie and Regan would never believe her unless she showed them the proof.</p><p>She took her time walking back to the office. Pedestrians were rushing about all bundled up in their heavy coats with their collars over their ears and their wool hats pulled down. Sophie hadn\u2019t noticed the cold and was surprised when she looked up at the First Commerce Bank building and saw the temperature in big red letters below the time: twenty-eight degrees. Considering where she\u2019d been, this was balmy weather.</p><p>What was she going to write about the turkey people? She couldn\u2019t call them crazy, and the article needed to be upbeat and cheerful because that\u2019s what people wanted to read. Okay, she\u2019d make them cheerful turkey people.</p><p>Oh God, how had she come to this? Turkey protesters and the heartbreak of static cling\u2014that\u2019s what she was writing about these days.</p><p>Enough with the whining, she told herself. She would write the story without balking because that was her job, but as soon as it was finished she thought she just might run out into traffic and hope she got run over by a very large bus.</p><p>Gary was in her cubicle again. He was getting so bold, he didn\u2019t even pretend to be looking for something.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t pretend to be gracious. \u201cGet out.\u201d She wanted to push him, but knowing Gary, he\u2019d probably sue her for assault. \u201cThis is my space, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking around,\u201d he said sullenly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask what he was looking for. He\u2019d told her once that she always got the good stories\u2014he obviously hadn\u2019t heard about the turkey people\u2014and he wanted to see if he could snatch one for himself. After she looked around to make sure he hadn\u2019t stolen anything, she sat down at her computer, typed in her password, and started writing her article. It took her twenty minutes from start to finish. She attached a note asking Mr. Bitterman not to run her photo with the story.</p><p>She looked at the stack of assignments she needed to catch up on. What next? she thought. Sitting back in her chair, she took a deep breath. Her old notepad was sitting on top of her desk. She picked it up and thumbed through the pages, thinking yet again about her interview with Harrington. She knew she was missing something, and it was driving her crazy. Having read her notes at least twenty times already, she went over them again.</p><p>Selected to join an exclusive club. Was that the Alpha Project? He\u2019d called it a club and had compared it to an Olympic trial. He\u2019d bragged to her that he had taken a battery of tests to qualify.</p><p>\u201cJust look at me.\u201d That\u2019s what he\u2019d said. A superman club? She\u2019d made that note a question. \u201cJust look at me.\u201d</p><p>She needed to talk to Kirk Halpern again, so she made the call.</p><p>Kirk was happy to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cI really hate to bother you,\u201d she began, \u201cbut I was wondering about the wolves you studied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to tell you anything you want to know,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cWere these particular animals unusually vigorous or strong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they were unusual,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey were what we expected for that particular subspecies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice any tremendous improvement in their condition while you observed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t get to observe the same animals throughout the study. Dr. Finch and I branched off to another group the last couple of years. Eric and Marcus continued with the initial alpha male. He, of course, was the strongest of the pack. As you might know, we called him Ricky. He was mature when we first began our observations, so the likelihood of his growing stronger was remote. We couldn\u2019t tell the exact age, but we estimated him to be older based on the wear and tear on the teeth. The life span of the arctic wolf is only about seven years. It was amazing, actually, that Ricky was still alive at the end of the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much of your observation was recorded on video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Carter was diligent with his recordings, though I\u2019ve just learned that the later ones are missing. An FBI agent, Jack MacAlister, was just here asking about that very thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Kirk,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me anytime.\u201d</p><p>Sophie put the phone down and tapped her pencil on her chin as she thought. How was she going to get to those videos? Everything that had been in the Inook facility was evidence in an ongoing investigation, and it would be heavily guarded.</p><p>She was going to have to get tricky. Kirk unknowingly had helped her by mentioning that Agent MacAlister had just left. Assuming Jack would get on the first available flight back to Chicago, she had to hurry. Timing was important.</p><p>She called Alec, and without explaining why, asked him if he would meet her in the lobby of the FBI building. Since he was already at the office, he agreed.</p><p>She smiled sweetly and kissed his check when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cJack told me I should watch some of the videos of the wolves,\u201d she said. She shrugged and sighed. \u201cI know it will be boring, but he did ask, and I promised I would. Could you get them for me?\u201d</p><p>Alec smiled back. He had known Sophie long enough to recognize when he should be suspicious. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Blockbuster. You can\u2019t just check them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. How about I watch them here? That wouldn\u2019t be a problem, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should check with Jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Is he here? He\u2019ll tell you he wanted my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to call him?\u201d she asked, hoping to heaven that he was in the air.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I can reach him. I guess I could arrange for you to watch the disks.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, armed with a visitor\u2019s badge clipped to her blouse, she followed Alec down a corridor to a sparsely furnished room. A technician came in carrying a DVD player, hooked it up, and then asked which of the disks she wanted to watch.</p><p>\u201cThe first three and the last three, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>Alec stayed in the room while she watched the wolves. He did paperwork, but every once in a while, he\u2019d glance up and ask, \u201cFind anything yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>She scanned the first disk and the last.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m finished,\u201d she announced. \u201cI don\u2019t need to see any more. Thank you, Alec.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked her back to the lobby. \u201cSophie, what were you looking for?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSuperman. See you later.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward the door just as Jack was walking in. He seemed as surprised to see her as she was to see him.</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello.\u201d She kept going. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>She tried to walk past him, but he grabbed her arm. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her to watch the videos?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Jack was looking at Sophie. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sure you did,\u201d she said innocently.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lie to a federal officer, did you, Sophie?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Sophie took a quick look at her watch. \u201cOh dear. I\u2019m late for a meeting.\u201d She bolted for the door. \u201cSo nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>SOPHIE FLED THE BUILDING SO FAST SHE NEARLY RAN INTO A couple of elderly women carrying shopping bags.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t go after her. Hands in his pockets, he watched her until she was out of sight, then turned around and headed to the elevator.</p><p>Alec couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Alec grinned. Jack was a careful man and, like most men, kept his emotions close to the vest. Relationships were not a comfortable topic of discussion, and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to talk about the woman he loved. Not now, not ever.</p><p>Alec recognized the signs. Jack\u2019s life had just become very complicated, and he was confused. Had his friend hit the misery stage yet? From the look on his face, Alec thought maybe he had. He\u2019d definitely hit the stage where everyone else could see what he refused to acknowledge. Alec had been through it himself. He knew that it was only a matter of time before Jack fell.</p><p>Jack and Sophie. Now that was going to be an interesting combination.</p><p>Jack punched the elevator button. \u201cWhy did Sophie want to watch the videos? Did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>Alec waited until the doors closed. \u201cShe said she had a theory, but she wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t ready? Why didn\u2019t you make her talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her? You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an FBI agent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it would take a team of agents working around the clock to get her to tell them what she had for lunch. And even then, she\u2019d probably lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s found something and she goes barreling in, she could get into trouble. Do you realize how many times she\u2019s been shot at? I\u2019ll tell you. Too damn many. I think I\u2019ll call Gil and put him back on Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Alec said. \u201cYou know Gil. He likes the extra money for poker, and he loves Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Jack waited until he reached his desk to tell Alec about his trip to Minneapolis and his conversation with Dr. Halpern.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s written a bunch of books and gotten awards, but he\u2019s a pretty unassuming guy,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how he could stand being cooped up with three other men in Alaska all that time. I\u2019m kind of surprised he didn\u2019t go postal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the quiet ones who do. I understand Marcus Lemming is the\u2014excuse the pun\u2014polar opposite. Evidently he doesn\u2019t mind telling you how great he is.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Alec went through the files of information that had been gathered on the case. Closing the last one, Jack pushed his chair back and stretched his legs. \u201cAccording to the reports, Halpern and Lemming weren\u2019t at Inook when Harrington was killed. They claim they never heard of William Harrington. Eric was by himself, and they didn\u2019t know what he was doing. Lemming\u2019s due back in town tonight. I think I\u2019ll pay him a visit,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>JACK STOPPED HIS CAR in front of Marcus Lemming\u2019s home, a tiny 1960s tract house. The one-story, square structure looked na*ed sitting on the lot. There wasn\u2019t a tree or a shrub or a blade of grass anywhere near it. Weeds that had been scalped to ground level substituted for a lawn.</p><p>A scientist who spent most of his time in the Arctic probably didn\u2019t have time to care for a house, Jack thought, but he wondered how the neighbors with their manicured lawns and well-trimmed shrubs felt about him.</p><p>Alec had been right about Marcus Lemming: he was nothing like Kirk Halpern. A brawny man with a square jaw and a distrustful scowl opened the door. When Jack showed his ID and asked for a few minutes, Lemming stepped aside to let him in.</p><p>The interior of his home was almost as sparse as the exterior. The small living room had bare hardwood floors. A futon sat against one wall, and a desk and chair faced the window that overlooked the street. Another wall was covered entirely by bookcases, the shelves stuffed so full of volumes they bowed under the weight.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want to know?\u201d Lemming asked. \u201cI\u2019ve already told the other agents everything I can about Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you describe your relationship with him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWe got along well enough. We were great friends at the beginning, but it became obvious to all of us that Eric was jealous of me. I had already published several books and was asked to join the boards at two major institutes. Eric\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was\u2014I hate to speak ill of the dead\u2014but I\u2019m afraid his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was rather pathetic. He actually went to a state school. He became very possessive of his own work, not wanting to share with the rest of us. He\u2019d go off by himself at night and work on his notes and his videos. He seemed almost paranoid, as though he were afraid of someone stealing his ideas. I can assure you, Eric Carter didn\u2019t have anything that I would want or need to steal.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an ounce of sympathy in Lemming\u2019s voice as he continued to deride Carter\u2019s credentials. \u201cI have no idea why he snapped like that. I think maybe the pressure got to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t see the data he had compiled or the videos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a few of them. But like I said, toward the end he kept them to himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened to his records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of us e-mailed our data home, and we boxed up our hard copies and shipped them. I couldn\u2019t tell you what Eric did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found his notebooks and some disks, but it appears that the most recent ones are missing. Do you know anything about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>The more questions Jack asked, the more impatient Lemming became. When William Harrington\u2019s name was mentioned, a look of concern crossed his face. \u201cI heard what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cA polar bear...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHorrible way to die. I can\u2019t imagine what he would have been doing out in the middle of nowhere like that.\u201d</p><p>After several questions were answered, Lemming hadn\u2019t told Jack anything he hadn\u2019t already read in the files. However, Jack began to notice a theme running through every statement Lemming made: Eric Carter was acting alone.</p><p>Why was he so insistent on this point? Why was it so important for him to distance himself? Those were questions Jack would keep to himself...for now.</p><p>Minutes later, back in his car and driving away from the scientist\u2019s home, Jack looked over his shoulder. Lemming was standing in the window.</p><p>THIRTY-NINE</p><p>JACK HAD LOOKED GOOD, REALLY GOOD...AND TIRED, SOPHIE thought. But really, really good.</p><p>She had spent the afternoon on an assignment and had pushed Jack MacAlister out of her mind, but now he was creeping back in again.</p><p>She wondered what would have happened if she had thrown herself at him in the lobby of the FBI building. Would alarms go off?</p><p>Crazy thoughts. And it was all the big jerk\u2019s fault. She missed kissing him.</p><p>Feeling melancholy, she told herself to stop thinking about him. She had more important things to concentrate on. Like turkeys.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t even bothered to call her since they had returned from Alaska. Why not?</p><p>She was hurrying back to the newspaper. A deadline was looming. She increased her pace until she was almost running. Not good in stiletto heels.</p><p>By the time she reached her office building, she was primed for a fight. She hoped she found Gary in her cubicle again. She\u2019d have a reason to punch him. Let him sue. What did she care? She didn\u2019t have any money, so she wouldn\u2019t lose anything.</p><p>Mr. Bitterman spotted her making her way to her desk.</p><p>\u201cBlond\u2014\u201d he shouted, but stopped himself before adding, \u201cgirl.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was pleased. Mr. Bitterman was trainable after all.</p><p>\u201cPut your stuff away, Sophie, and come in here. I\u2019ve got another assignment for you.\u201d</p><p>If the assignment was a follow-up on the turkey people, she thought she might just buy one\u2014a frozen one\u2014and clobber him over the head with it.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019ve got to stop thinking like this. This job is turning me into a violent person, she thought.</p><p>Gary was huddled at his desk and didn\u2019t look up when she walked past. The day was getting better by the minute.</p><p>Pad in hand, Sophie went into Mr. Bitterman\u2019s office and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice I didn\u2019t call you Blond Girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I did, and I appreciate it. Now maybe you could work on not whistling for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cNow sit down and tell me what you found out at the FBI. Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she hedged. \u201cI have this theory, but it\u2019s way out there. Are you sure you want to hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that Dr. Eric Carter wasn\u2019t just watching the wolves. I think he was doing something to them. One wolf in particular, the alpha male. I can\u2019t prove it, though. The FBI could,\u201d she added. \u201cTheir scientists could get blood samples from the animals or examine the pack or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018doing something to the animals\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Carter was altering them in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDid you tell Jack or Alec your theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Before he could ask why, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind you laughing at me, but I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the FBI investigate this,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. She had hit a dead end anyway. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ve done as much as I can, and eventually the missing videos will be found, and they\u2019ll answer a lot of the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to work on this anymore. Okay, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou said you had an assignment for me?\u201d</p><p>The worry left his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I do. Promise me you\u2019ll hear me out before you start arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to take over \u2018Kathy\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 column.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathy\u2019s opening a bakery downtown in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need someone to fill in until you find a replacement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to take the position full-time. We\u2019ll call it \u2018Sophie\u2019s Kitchen.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh, but stopped when he didn\u2019t join in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I don\u2019t know how to cook. I couldn\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get the hang of it. You\u2019ve got five months to learn. If you want, I\u2019ll pay for a cooking class. Don\u2019t sell yourself short. You can do anything you put your mind to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you agree. I sent that story back to you to proof. Need you to do that right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I...\u201d</p><p>IT WAS A GOOD THING she had a sense of humor, or she\u2019d go looking for that bus again. First turkeys, then the kitchen. Could her life get any crazier?</p><p>Gary had a smirk on his face as he watched her walk by. Such a creep, she thought for the thousandth time. Out of sight, out of mind. Gary was forgotten once she started working. Mr. Bitterman wanted her to proof one of her stories, which was code for \u201cRewrite it, I hate it.\u201d</p><p>She was on the last paragraph when her phone rang. She didn\u2019t take her eyes off the computer screen as she answered. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie Rose?\u201d The voice was deep and gravelly. This was not a newspaper call. The man had not used her professional name.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI have something that you\u2019ll want to see,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m afraid this conversation is over,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She was about to hang up when the man said, \u201cWait. Please. Don\u2019t hang up. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>His pleading tone made her pause. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the tapes that will show you what Eric Carter was doing in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>That caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. All I can tell you is I had nothing to do with any of it. I didn\u2019t know what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t right, and I should never have gotten involved. I just need to get rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake them to the FBI,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. They\u2019ll come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them here to the newspaper then,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d He sounded frantic now. \u201cI\u2019m not letting anybody else have them. I trust you. I read your article. You either take them off my hands, or I\u2019ll destroy them, and you\u2019ll never know what happened to William Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSixty-eighth and Prescott. Meet me there,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cAnd come alone, or you won\u2019t be getting the tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI\u2019ll choose the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, where?\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s mind raced through various spots, public places with lots of people. \u201cCosmo\u2019s,\u201d she said. She gave him the address.</p><p>\u201cBe there at seven,\u201d he said, and then added, \u201cYou better be alone, or the deal\u2019s off.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s watch said it was 6:15. If she hurried, she could get to Cosmo\u2019s early. On the way she\u2019d call Jack and have him meet her there.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn off her computer or tell Mr. Bitterman she was leaving. She grabbed her purse and hurried for the exit. On the street, she searched for a taxi. With rush hour in full swing, the odds of finding an empty one were slim to none. She\u2019d have to take the El. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she was running, she pulled her phone out of her purse to call Jack. The phone rang before she could flip it open. It was her father.</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you to dinner, Princess?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m back in town, and I\u2019m not a wanted man today. We can catch up face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Daddy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou sound out of breath.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting through Nelson Park to catch the El,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m meeting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. You have no business walking through a park in the dark. Why won\u2019t you let me buy you a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Daddy,\u201d she rushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call you back later. I need to get hold of Jack right away. This is really important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack? Jack MacAlister?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He heard, \u201cNo...don\u2019t...\u201d and then a scuffle.</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>FORTY</p><p>JACK SAT AT THE CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE WITH THREE other agents and a stack of case files. Pittman walked in carrying three more files and took her place at the head of the table. Alec trailed in a minute later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, Agent Buchanan,\u201d Pittman barked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer an excuse. She wouldn\u2019t have appreciated one anyway. He wasn\u2019t a child. He was late.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with the Alaska file. Jack, you\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave an update on his interviews with Kirk Halpern and Marcus Lemming. \u201cBoth of them basically reiterated what was in the file. Halpern told me Lemming had the closest relationship with Carter. They spent a lot of time together. Lemming, on the other hand, would have you believe he couldn\u2019t stomach the guy. He blamed Carter for everything but the snow. He didn\u2019t particularly like the questions I asked, so he told me what he wanted me to know. He\u2019s an arrogant prick. He made a point of stressing that Carter wasn\u2019t as smart as he was. He sure wanted me to believe that Carter was keeping secrets. Protested a little too much, if you know what I mean. I think we should be tailing him.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door, and Pittman\u2019s assistant, Jennifer, looked in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any interruptions,\u201d Pittman reminded her.</p><p>\u201cA call just came for Agent MacAlister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a message. We\u2019re in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bobby Rose.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table turned to Jack.</p> <p>The announcement took the wind out of Pittman. \u201cBobby Rose? Why would he be calling you, Agent MacAlister?\u201d</p><p>Jack was already crossing the room to get to the phone when Jennifer said, \u201cMr. Rose insists it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>Something had happened to Sophie. Jack knew it before he answered. Bobby Rose would not be calling him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cPut him on speaker phone,\u201d Pittman ordered.</p><p>\u201cLine four,\u201d Jennifer said before pulling the door closed.</p><p>\u201cMacAlister here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s missing. Someone took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was cutting through Nelson Park on her way to the El.\u201d</p><p>Pittman identified herself and asked, \u201cHow do you know she was taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to her on the phone.\u201d Fear made his voice hard. \u201cShe told me she was going to meet someone, and she needed to call you, Jack. She had to tell you something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d Alec asked the question.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes at the most. She was saying good-bye, and suddenly she screamed...then she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pinpoint her location,\u201d Pittman said as she nodded to an agent.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now, Mr. Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, MacAlister. You find her. You hear me? You find her.\u201d</p><p>The second the call ended, Jack looked at Pittman. In a rage, he said, \u201cThat son of a bitch Lemming has her. I know it.\u201d He threw his chair out of his way and ran.</p><p>Pittman grabbed the phone and called for help as she began issuing orders to the others in the room.</p><p>Alec caught up with Jack in the parking garage. \u201cI\u2019m driving,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Shaking with fury, Jack was trying not to think about what could be happening to Sophie, trying to concentrate on finding her.</p><p>Nelson Park wasn\u2019t far away, but by the time Alec and Jack arrived, the area was swarming with police. There was no sign of Sophie, and no one had seen anything.</p><p>\u201cHe has her, Alec. You know I\u2019m right. I should have dragged him in. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew evidence.\u201d He looked around at the crowd and the police. Other agents were arriving on the scene.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close to Sophie\u2019s office. Maybe she left something behind. An address, a note, anything.\u201d</p><p>Jack was running to the car nodding. \u201cWe\u2019re losing time. The longer he has her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her, we\u2019ll find her,\u201d Alec promised as he jumped into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWhy? Why would Lemming risk taking her? He knew we didn\u2019t have any evidence against him. He\u2019d be in custody if we did. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>Alec slammed on the brakes in front of the newspaper offices and left the car double-parked with the lights flashing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what his reason is,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Bitterman was turning the light off in his office and heading to the door when he saw Jack and Alec running at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Alec quickly filled him in. Bitterman\u2019s face paled.</p><p>\u201cDid she mention where she was going when she left here?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cI assumed she was going home. She was supposed to turn in an article, but she left without finishing it. That\u2019s very unusual for Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything to you, anything at all about where she would be going or who she would be talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about work. She told me about the doctors up in Alaska. She thought they were doing something to those poor animals. I made her promise to stop snooping, and she agreed, said she\u2019d let the FBI figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Bitterman led the way to her desk.</p><p>Gary jumped up when he saw the agents. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Gary immediately looked down at his feet. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry. She\u2019s probably shopping. She\u2019ll turn up.\u201d</p><p>Jack was tearing through Sophie\u2019s desk looking for anything that might shed some light on her whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not shopping,\u201d Bitterman told him in a near shout. \u201cSomeone took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...I see. I hope she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Jack spotted the bug on the back of Sophie\u2019s monitor. \u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>He looked at Alec and picked up Sophie\u2019s phone. He had it apart in seconds.</p><p>\u201cAnother bug,\u201d he said. \u201cShort range.\u201d</p><p>Alec turned to Gary. Jack slowly advanced.</p><p>\u201cYou want to step out into the aisle?\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not finished working.\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t going to waste time explaining. He grabbed Gary by his shirt and tossed him out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d Alec asked, pointing to an earpiece underneath a box of paper clips inside the desk drawer.</p><p>Gary tried to back away. Alec blocked him from going any farther.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been listening to her phone conversations, haven\u2019t you? You bugged her office, and you bugged Bitterman\u2019s office, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you?\u201d Bitterman demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear on Sophie\u2019s phone?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Jack had Gary by the throat. \u201cYou listen to me, you perv. I\u2019m not wasting time here. If you know something, you better tell me now. I\u2019m going to count to five, and then I\u2019m going to snap your neck. One...two...three...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Some man called her and said he needed her help. He wanted to give her some videos she could take to the FBI. She told him to bring them here, but he wouldn\u2019t, so she was going to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosmo\u2019s. He wanted her to meet him somewhere else, but she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he want to meet?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cSixty-eighth and Prescott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you Sophie was missing, why didn\u2019t you speak up?\u201d Bitterman demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d find out I was listening, and I\u2019d get in trouble. I wasn\u2019t gonna hurt anybody. I was sure her father would call and maybe say something I could sell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack shoved him so hard, he fell across his desk.</p><p>Alec was running for the stairs talking on his cell phone, and Jack followed right behind.</p><p>Bitterman shouted, \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep him here,\u201d Jack shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t let him out of your sight, and if he remembers anything else, you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything else,\u201d Gary screamed. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me stay...\u201d</p><p>Bitterman picked up the phone and called security.</p><p>Jack and Alec flew down the stairs to the street. \u201cI\u2019ll call Pittman,\u201d Jack said as Alec gunned the motor. \u201cI don\u2019t know this city. Where\u2019s Sixty-eighth and Prescott?\u201d</p><p>By now, Jack had Pittman on the phone and he repeated the question to her. She had a map spread out on the conference table but didn\u2019t have to use it.</p><p>\u201cOld warehouses and storage units,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big area, Alec. You\u2019ll need help doing a sweep.\u201d</p><p>They got backup within minutes. Jack could hear sirens as police rushed toward them. \u201cHow far away are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far,\u201d Alec said. \u201cShe\u2019s stronger than she looks, Jack. If she can hold on...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you drive any faster?\u201d</p><p>Alec was speeding like a NASCAR driver on the final loop.</p><p>Pittman called back, and Alec put her on speaker. \u201cThey\u2019re setting up around the perimeter. More men on the way.\u201d</p><p>Police cars barricaded 68th Street. Alec slammed on the brakes, and Jack jumped out before the car came to a stop. He looked at his watch. She\u2019d been gone almost an hour. Her chances decreased with every minute.</p><p>Hang on, Sophie.</p><p>FORTY-ONE</p><p>SOPHIE SLOWLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS. SHE GROANED and tried to sit up. Falling back, she tried again, this time bracing her hands on the floor to balance herself. It was pitch black. She reached out to find a light switch, but there wasn\u2019t anything there. She touched the floor again. It was cold, hard...concrete?</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>She finally gained enough strength in her limbs to stand. She swayed back and forth but stayed upright. Her head was pounding, and she felt dazed and disoriented. Stretching her arms out in front of her, she took a tentative step. If she could find a window or door, she could let some light in.</p><p>Something blocked her. She pushed, heard a crash, reached out again, and felt cardboard. Sophie stood perfectly still. With deep, calming breaths, she tried to control the panic she felt welling up inside her.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear any noises, any traffic. Someone had hit her. She could still feel the pain. She touched her face, felt stickiness. Blood from the blow?</p><p>Her memory was coming back. Daddy. She\u2019d been talking to her father. Yes, she\u2019d had her cell phone up to her ear, and suddenly there was excruciating pain...then darkness.</p><p>She had to find a door or a window and get outside. Oh, God, what if she was in a tunnel or a cave? What if she couldn\u2019t get out?</p><p>She tried to control her fear. She put her hands out again, feeling her way until she reached a wall. What was it? Cement blocks? She moved across the wall to a door. She felt a handle. She whimpered as she tried to turn it.</p><p>The door suddenly burst in on her, and she was thrown to the floor.</p><p>She screamed and scrambled to her feet. A glaring light was shoved in her face, blinding her. She put her hand up to block it and saw the outline of a man behind the light, but couldn\u2019t see who he was.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sophie. I\u2019d like to introduce myself. I\u2019m Dr. Marcus Lemming. Recognize my voice? We had such nice talks over the phone. Of course, I called myself Paul Larson then.\u201d</p><p>He put the flashlight on a cardboard box, propped it up, and stepped forward. He was holding a crowbar in his left hand down at his side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve caused me a considerable amount of distress. Do you know why? You couldn\u2019t stop poking your nose in where it didn\u2019t belong. You had to keep searching...had to find out...\u201d</p><p>He lashed out with his fist and hit her hard in the shoulder, knocking her into the wall. She crumpled to the floor. Before she could recover, he grabbed her arm, yanking her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the Alpha Project?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer fast enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Harrington tell you?\u201d Lemming demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cHe didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. What do you know?\u201d</p><p>He slowly swung the crowbar back and forth. \u201cHow did you find out about this place? How did you know to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know...I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he shouted. \u201cDid you find my journal? Is that how you found out about the project? No, you couldn\u2019t have,\u201d he answered his own question. \u201cThe journal\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He took another step closer. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one...I didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He hit her with the crowbar, though he was careful not to kill her. He needed his answers first. The sharp edge had cut into her skin above her ear, and blood now poured down. She tried to focus. He was moving in the light, and there were shadows dancing along the wall. She thought she saw something moving in the corner. Was someone there? Had someone followed her? Daddy? Or Jack...did he call Jack? Please let it be Jack. She had to distract Lemming. Her mind raced. Hurry. Hurry.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to come here?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>The question made no sense. He was out of his mind, Sophie thought. Had he become delirious? \u201cYou know how I got here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped, tilted his head, thinking about her answer. \u201cI know? How could I...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you kill me, they\u2019ll hunt you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never find me. I\u2019ll have fifty million dollars and a new identity.\u201d He pulled her to her knees. \u201cI had great plans for you, but now I\u2019ll have to change them. Too bad you had to be so nosy. You\u2019re making me do this...\u201d</p><p>FORTY-TWO</p> <p>ALEC BUCHANAN WAS THE AGENT IN CHARGE. HE LEANED over the hood of his car. In front of him was a map of the area that one of the policemen had grabbed from his glove compartment. Two plainclothes detectives flanked his sides, and one aimed a flashlight toward the map, watching while Alec sectioned off zones for each team to search. The police and FBI agents were gathered in a vacant parking lot at the end of the huge complex, an industrial area of warehouses and storage units. Most workers had gone home for the night, so the streets were empty.</p><p>\u201cThis will take days,\u201d an officer complained in a whisper to his partner. He happened to look across the car at Agent MacAlister and immediately regretted the comment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lemming\u2019s vehicle?\u201d Alec asked a detective.</p><p>\u201cEvery cop in the city is searching for it. We\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have parked his car inside one of these buildings.\u201d</p> <p>A young policeman in uniform stepped forward and spoke to Alec. \u201cExcuse me, sir, but I know this area. I think I can help.\u201d He pointed to the map. \u201cPrescott ends here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe buildings to the east are boarded up. I know. I\u2019ve had to drag kids out of there. The city\u2019s going to tear them down, but they haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet. There are several places a car could squeeze in...alleys, too. I\u2019d start there and work my way east.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to another section. \u201cThis three-block area here is filled with self-storage units. Some have fences around them, others don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think he could hide a vehicle in there. He\u2019d have to park on the street...or maybe in between the units.\u201d</p><p>Agents and policemen fanned out in every direction to circle the area and slowly move in. Alec made sure every cop in the city was on alert, but the warehouse district got priority. At the moment, it was the only lead he had.</p><p>Another agent, Hank Sawyer, took over so that Alec could search with Jack. They got into Alec\u2019s car and headed east. They drove through the broken gate of a wire fence and turned onto 70th Street.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, wait a minute,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019d have a reason to go to one of the self-storage units. When the team searched his home and his office, they found computer files, but they didn\u2019t look for the hard copies. Kirk Halpern said there were hard copies shipped back. Lemming had to have stored them. Those missing discs could be here. Look where we are. No one\u2019s going to ask questions when you rent one of these. If he paid cash and used another name...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he bring Sophie here?\u201d</p> <p>Jack shook his head, feeling at though he was grasping at straws, but desperate to have an answer. \u201cHe plans to pick up his stuff and get out of Chicago. Maybe he wants to get even with Sophie. Maybe she was getting too close...I don\u2019t know. One thing I\u2019m sure of: if he has her and he plans to run, he won\u2019t take her with him.\u201d</p><p>Alec made the turn into a narrow alley between two tall buildings. With the headlights turned off, the car rolled forward at a snail\u2019s pace. Most of the streetlights were burned out or broken. Up ahead a bulb hanging off a post flickered and buzzed repeatedly. Emerging onto a street, they saw a police car four blocks away patrolling slowly, on the same mission.</p><p>\u201cStay in the alleys,\u201d Jack said. The night air was fogging up the windows. He rolled his window down to get a better view as they drove up and down the tight passages.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jack said suddenly. He stuck his head out the window and squinted.</p><p>Three alleys over, neatly tucked between two rusted Dumpsters, was a car. Alec pulled to a stop.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat\u2019s Lemming\u2019s.\u201d He got out. \u201cCall Sawyer. Tell him, no sirens, no lights.\u201d He slowly walked down the alley, studying the doors on the left, while Alec followed, concentrating on the units on the right. The rolling doors were big enough to drive a truck through, indicating the volume behind them was large. Next to each garage door was a side door. Everything was locked up tight.</p><p>Jack had almost reached the end of the row of doors when he saw a sliver of light peeking beneath the rubber weather stripping. He moved closer, straining to hear sounds.</p><p>A man\u2019s muffled voice was low and threatening, but Jack couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying. Then he heard a scream...Sophie\u2019s scream.</p> <p>He shot the lock, kicked the door in, and raced inside, taking in the scene all at once: cardboard boxes stacked high, a flashlight propped on top, the beam directed at Sophie. She was on her knees on the floor. Lemming, in the shadows, stood over her holding a crowbar. He was swinging it down toward Sophie when Jack shot him.</p><p>Once wasn\u2019t enough. It was a solid hit to the chest, but Marcus Lemming didn\u2019t go down. He staggered back, gained his balance, and lunged at Sophie again. Running toward the man, Jack shot twice more as he grabbed Sophie\u2019s arm and dragged her behind him. Finally, Lemming dropped, face smashed into the concrete floor, the crowbar still in his hands.</p><p>Jack knelt beside Sophie and saw the blood on the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cSophie, look at me. Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to focus. She saw Marcus, then Jack leaning over her. He took her in his arms and gently lifted her. She tucked her head under his chin and felt him shaking. It hurt to move, but she forced herself to turn her head just enough to press her lips to his ear. \u201cTwo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jack understood. He looked up in time to see a shadow move between boxes against the back wall. With lightning speed, he threw himself on top of Sophie and fired. The shadow darted out and wildly returned fire. Jack emptied his clip and reached for another. Alec appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBehind the boxes, left side,\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him. Get her out of here,\u201d Alec ordered. He fired once and moved in front of Jack.</p><p>They heard a click and knew the bastard\u2019s weapon was empty now.</p><p>\u201cI surrender. I surrender. Don\u2019t shoot me. I\u2019m dropping my gun and coming out. Don\u2019t shoot.\u201d</p><p>Hands in the air, Kirk Halpern stepped toward the light. The son of a bitch had a smile on his face.</p><p>FORTY-THREE</p><p>THE SCENE AT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHAOTIC. SOPHIE HAD been taken down to radiology for tests and was now back in the emergency room, parked in a bed behind a curtain while she waited for the plastic surgeon to stitch her up. Regan and Cordie stayed at her side. A nurse and an aide recognized Sophie from her last visit, and both asked to take their dinner breaks.</p><p>Sophie had a blistering headache, but the doctor wouldn\u2019t give her anything for the pain, not even an aspirin, until he heard the results of her tests.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear if you\u2019ve got a concussion,\u201d Cordie explained.</p><p>\u201cIs my father here?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cI was talking to him on the phone when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way,\u201d Regan told her. \u201cI heard he was giving the police a hard time over at the park. They found your phone by the fountain, and there was blood on it. He was beside himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are Jack and Alec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here, but once they knew you were going to be okay, they left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018thank God\u2019? We know how you feel about Jack,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cSo does my father. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for both of them to be in the same room.\u201d</p><p>Cordie patted her hand. \u201cIt will be fine,\u201d she said as she glanced across the bed at Regan, gave her a look, and shook her head.</p><p>Sophie pulled a blanket over her legs. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a trauma,\u201d Regan explained sympathetically. \u201cYour body is reacting. Would you like another blanket?\u201d</p><p>With tears in her eyes, Sophie said, \u201cIt was awful. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell us tomorrow,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cIt\u2019s too upsetting for you right now.\u201d Trying to brighten the mood, she added, \u201cMr. Bitterman was relieved to hear you\u2019re doing okay. He\u2019s very fond of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s secretly such a softie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said to tell you that Gary was arrested. He was hauled off in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did he do?\u201d</p><p>Sophie gasped several times as Cordie repeated the conversation she\u2019d had with Bitterman.</p><p>\u201cWhat a weasel,\u201d Regan said. Sophie didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>An aide pulled the curtain back and stepped forward with a tray. She saw Sophie, stopped cold, and slowly backed out, pulling the curtain closed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe staff isn\u2019t very friendly here,\u201d Cordie whispered.</p><p>A phone rang. Alec was calling Regan to tell her he wouldn\u2019t be returning to the hospital. Dr. Halpern, whom Cordie had dubbed Dr. Frankenstein, was talking up a storm and didn\u2019t want an attorney. They were taking advantage of the situation and getting as much out of him as they could.</p><p>The plastic surgeon took his sweet time getting to the hospital, but he was very kind, and he worked quickly. After checking the wounds to her face, he cupped Sophie\u2019s chin in his hand and tilted her head, studying her.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful skin,\u201d he said. \u201cFlawless. Good bone structure. Perfect nose...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here for a facelift,\u201d Cordie said, exasperated.</p><p>The doctor smiled at her. \u201cThe three of you could play Charlie\u2019s Angels.\u201d Turning back to Sophie, he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t need Botox for a long time...as long as you don\u2019t lead a stressful life. I\u2019ll need it some day. Plastic surgeons live with stress.\u201d</p><p>Sophie would have laughed if her head hadn\u2019t been aching so.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve got stress? How many bullets have you dodged today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The doctor could tell he was in dangerous territory, so he changed the subject. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a concussion,\u201d he told her, \u201cso you get to go home and sleep in your own bed.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s father arrived at the hospital in time to drive her home. He suggested that he stay the night with her, but she refused. She\u2019d already had the same argument with Regan and Cordie. She promised to go right to sleep after he left.</p><p>Sophie was exhausted and felt grimy. She was careful not to wet the bandage on her face as she showered. After slipping into her nightgown and brushing her teeth, she dropped into bed. Her exhaustion had wiped her out, but she wasn\u2019t sleepy yet, so she turned on the television and surfed the channels. She stopped on the cooking channel. She\u2019d never watched it before. Jack liked the shows, though. What was he doing now? Had he finished with Halpern? She hoped he\u2019d gotten answers. Would he call her tomorrow?</p><p>She fell asleep wishing she was in his arms and wondering if he was thinking about her.</p><p>FORTY-FOUR</p><p>JACK COULDN\u2019T STOP THINKING ABOUT SOPHIE, AND EVERY half hour or so he would leave the interrogation room and call for an update. He knew when she left the hospital, and he knew when she arrived home.</p><p>He had to take breaks to get away from Kirk Halpern anyway, and so did Alec. The doctor turned their stomachs. When the urge to smash his face in became too strong, Jack would know it was time to get up.</p><p>Halpern had sure fooled him. He had seemed like the mild-mannered, scholarly type, sitting in his worn chair talking about his deceased wife and praising Sophie for being so compassionate, but now that his game was over, his true colors came rushing to the surface. He didn\u2019t have to pretend modesty any longer.</p><p>Halpern was smug and conceited, and he wanted them to know how clever he had been. Gaining respect for his superior intellect was obviously important to him. Alec and Jack played along, anything to keep him talking.</p><p>\u201cYou never know how stupid people are until you live with them,\u201d Halpern said.</p><p>\u201cEric and Marcus thought their little secret, their little Alpha Project,\u201d he said mockingly, \u201cwas so safe, but figuring out what they were up to was hardly rocket science. After the first year, I knew they were plotting something. Any child can operate eavesdropping equipment, and breaking passwords and codes is so easy, I make it my hobby. You can get pretty bored with nothing to do but watch wolves.\u201d</p><p>He went into great detail about how he listened to conversations and snooped through their files.</p><p>\u201cThe cherry on top was that Marcus was keeping a journal the whole time. Hiding it under his mattress was a smart move, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked sarcastically.</p><p>Jack asked him specific questions about the scientific discovery.</p><p>\u201cEric came up with the formula,\u201d Halpern said. \u201cI think he may have already had it the first year we were at Inook together. It was by accident that he discovered what it could do and how adrenaline altered its effects.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed Ricky, Agent MacAlister. Don\u2019t you remember that I told you he was a mature alpha male? They started experimenting on him right away. Eric would tell Brandon and me that he needed to take blood, that he was checking for different micro organisms, but I knew what he was really doing. He was injecting the animal, and after a while, when Brandon and I branched off to study other packs and didn\u2019t show any interest, he didn\u2019t even bother to bring back vials of blood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many injections Ricky was given, but I started noticing a slight change in the wolf. Of course, I pretended I didn\u2019t see anything, and Brandon was too self-absorbed to notice. After a while, Ricky was getting stronger and bigger.\u201d He chuckled as he added, \u201cA wolf on steroids, only it wasn\u2019t a steroid he was getting. This was a wonder drug with incredible benefits and no side effects.</p><p>\u201cEric and Marcus continued their experiments on other animals when they went back to Chicago. They had set up a lab. It\u2019s all in the journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Sophie Rose play into all of this?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen their prime subject, William Harrington, was lifted to the test site, they found out she knew him, and had, in fact, talked to him at length. She had e-mailed him before they shut down his website; she left messages on his phone. She even went to his apartment looking for him. They wanted people to think he\u2019d left on a long trip...just in case. But she wouldn\u2019t leave it alone. Then when Harrington was killed, her card was found, and they got scared that she might know too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEric got really paranoid about her, so Marcus called her pretending to be some guy named Paul Larson, just to find out how much she knew. He might have left her alone, but she asked him about the Alpha Project.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey were in too deep. She could ruin the fifty-million-dollar deal he and Eric had made. She had to go.\u201d</p><p>As Jack and Alec delved for details, Halpern became more verbose. His answers turned into lectures.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll explain how I lured Marcus to the storage facility. It was so simple really. I called him, all befuddled, and said that this reporter had contacted me saying she knew about some secret scientific study that was going on at our camp, and she said she had found out where the missing tapes were that would prove it. She was on her way to get them.\u201d</p><p>He stopped for a moment, a slight smile tilting the corners of his mouth as he remembered the call.</p> <p>\u201cI put him in such a panic, he couldn\u2019t wait to get off the phone and rush to his hidey hole. He never questioned how she could have found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did\u2014\u201d Alec began.</p><p>\u201cDo not interrupt me,\u201d he snapped. His head twitched at his outburst, and he took a breath to calm himself before continuing. \u201cLuring the woman was a little chancy, but all I really needed to do was get her out in the open and isolate her, and I had her. I caught her in Nelson Park. I hit her hard. Didn\u2019t know my own strength, really.\u201d His gaze bounced back and forth from Alec to Jack. \u201cShe was out cold. I must admit, I didn\u2019t really care all that much about her, but when she called me at my home, I could tell she was getting close to the truth, closer than any of those agents who questioned me. I knew I had to get rid of Marcus, so why not two birds with one stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to get rid of Marcus? Why not just turn him in to the authorities?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Halpern studied his fingernails and smiled. \u201cThe money, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat money?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThe fifty million. I knew Marcus would come after me when he found out that I had done a little wheeling and dealing of my own. His contact in Dubai was happy to get the formula and the research early. He didn\u2019t care who sold it to him.\u201d He sighed and looked off in the distance. \u201cFifty million. It\u2019s in a secure place, and it\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need money where you\u2019re going,\u201d Alec told him.</p><p>\u201cBut Agent Buchanan, what have I done?\u201d he asked innocently. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone. If my punishment fits my crime, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be a free man in no time at all.\u201d He paused to reconsider. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be a free rich man in no time at all. Face it, gentlemen, I\u2019ve outsmarted you. That money is in a safe place, and you\u2019ll never find it.\u201d</p><p>The interrogation went well into the night. When it was over, Jack and Alec handed in their preliminary reports and headed home.</p><p>Jack was beat. He needed some fresh air. He needed a shower. And he needed Sophie.</p> <p>THE SOUND OF running water woke her. She rolled to her side and looked at the clock: 2:20. For a second she thought she was hearing rain, but then she heard something drop in her bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d It was a whisper, but loud enough for her to know that Jack was getting out of her shower.</p><p>The television was still on, but the remote was on the table on the opposite side of the bed. She never put it there. It was too far to reach.</p><p>Jack came out of the bathroom. He was yawning, and he wasn\u2019t wearing a stitch of clothing.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He got into bed and reached for her. \u201cYou needed me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sound asleep. I didn\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI needed to be here.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the remote and turned off the television, then pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get into my apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Go to sleep. You need your rest.\u201d</p><p>She was so happy he was there. She snuggled closer to him. \u201cI\u2019m changing the locks tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll still get in. You\u2019re not getting rid of me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond. He sounded serious, as though he really wanted to stay with her. Knowing who she was, he still wanted her. What was wrong with him? Why would he want her...except maybe for the sex. He surely wasn\u2019t staying for her cooking. Her mind began to drift.</p><p>His deep breathing told her he was asleep, yet when she tried to roll away, he tightened his hold.</p><p>SOPHIE WOKE UP MIDMORNING. Jack was stroking her back. She turned in his arms and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can never go anywhere. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marrying you, Sophie. That\u2019s what I know.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his chin, the base of his throat. \u201cDaddy won\u2019t approve.\u201d Her hands slid down his chest and his stomach. She smiled at his indrawn breath. \u201cYou\u2019re a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Jack growled low in his throat. She was driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou know...FBI,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t pay attention to what she was saying. She was stroking him, teasing, tormenting.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough for me,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p><p>Jack rolled her onto her back, braced himself on his elbows, and looked into her eyes. \u201cNo one will ever love you the way I do.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him toward her. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-FIVE</p><p>THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY WAS HELD AT THE HAMILTON Hotel at Aiden\u2019s insistence.</p><p>There were over seventy guests. Jack\u2019s brothers were there. His father had died several years ago, and his mother was on her fourth or fifth honeymoon. Her sons couldn\u2019t keep track.</p><p>Jack was talking to Alec and Gil, but he never let Sophie out of his sight. She chatted with Mr. and Mrs. Bitterman and their daughter, who Sophie thought was lovely.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about the job our Sophie was offered? Big-time stuff,\u201d Mr. Bitterman told his wife. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the only job offer. Isn\u2019t that right? It was after she wrote that story about William Harrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read that,\u201d Mrs. Bitterman said. \u201cIt was wonderful. \u2018The Forgotten Man.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned them down,\u201d Mr. Bitterman said.</p><p>\u201cI must be crazy, but I did,\u201d Sophie laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to change jobs after all. I just wanted to be asked, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen when your father is on the outs again with the police? You know it\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack says he\u2019ll take him in for questioning...if he can find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bitterman, you know my father. They can\u2019t hold him long. He\u2019ll negotiate his way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil...\u201d</p><p>Bobby Rose walked into the party. He was suave and debonair and, according to Mrs. Bitterman and her daughter, made the women feel giddy.</p><p>To Sophie, he was simply her father. He was heading for Jack, but guests surrounded him and delayed his getting to his target. Sophie excused herself and hurried to Jack\u2019s side.</p><p>Gil came to stand beside her. \u201cHow\u2019s your father handling this? His only daughter getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Sophie, how do you know that?\u201d Gil asked, thinking she was exaggerating.</p><p>\u201cI know because he said, \u2018Sophie, I don\u2019t like Jack.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Alec choked on his drink. Gil looked nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cJack isn\u2019t particularly fond of my father either, but they\u2019ll get along.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later Bobby Rose faced the happy couple. He shook Jack\u2019s hand and kissed Sophie.</p><p>Mr. Bitterman joined them. \u201cI was telling Mr. Rose that I had heard rumors that Kelly\u2019s Root Beer was going to reopen.\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a good investment.\u201d He winked at Sophie. \u201cIt might happen.\u201d He turned to Jack and said, \u201cI read in the paper that Kirk Halpern is trying to make a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cIs it true he\u2019s hidden fifty million dollars?\u201d Gil asked.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cYes. He says no one will ever find it.\u201d</p><p>Bobby Rose looked at his daughter and smiled. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
